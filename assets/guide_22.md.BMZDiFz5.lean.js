It implies that there's a visual aspect for the reader to focus on: fresh snow on an evergreen. By using the word \\"image,\\" the sentence creates an expectation for the reader to visualize a specific scene or setting. 2. \\"Fresh snow\\": These two words together are significant as they evoke a sense of newness and beauty. Snow plays a key role in the visual aspect of the sentence, as it conveys a clean, pure, and serene atmosphere. \\"Fresh\\" emphasizes that the snow is recent, untouched, and possibly still falling. This combination of words helps the reader understand the particular type of snow being described and further enhances the imagery. 3. \\"Evergreen\\": This word is essential because it identifies the object upon which fresh snow is resting. An evergreen is a type of tree or plant that retains its leaves or needles throughout the entire year, making it a symbol of endurance and consistency. The fact that the snow is on an evergreen intensifies the visual contrast between the white snow and the green leaves or needles, which adds to the sentence's overall impact. Together, the words \\"image,\\" \\"fresh snow,\\" and \\"evergreen\\" bring meaning to the sentence and create a vivid, picturesque scene that can be mentally envisioned by the reader. These words work in conjunction to convey a specific atmosphere and environment, making them the most important words in the sentence."},{"question":"Hattie McDaniel (June 10, 1895 - October 26, 1952) was an American stage actress, professional singer-songwriter, and comedian. She is best known for her role as \\"Mammy\\" in Gone with the Wind (1939), for which she won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, the first Academy Award won by an African American entertainer. In addition to acting in many films, McDaniel was a radio performer and television star; she was the first black woman to sing on radio in the United States. She appeared in over 300 films, although she received screen credits for only 80 or so. The whereabouts of McDaniel's Oscar are currently unknown. In 1992, Jet magazine reported that Howard University could not find it and alleged that it had disappeared during protests in the 1960s. In 1998, Howard University stated that it could find no written record of the Oscar having arrived at Howard. In 2007, an article in the Huffington Post repeated rumors that the Oscar had been cast into the Potomac River by angry civil rights protesters in the 1960s. The assertion reappeared in the Huffington Post under the same byline in 2009. In 2010, Mo'Nique, the winner of the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, wearing a blue dress and gardenias in her hair, as McDaniel had at the ceremony in 1940, in her acceptance speech thanked McDaniel \\"for enduring all that she had to so that I would not have to\\". Her speech revived interest in the whereabouts of McDaniel's plaque. In 2011, J. Freedom duLac reported in the Washington Post that the plaque had disappeared in the 1960s. In November 2011, W. B. Carter, of the George Washington University Law School, published the results of her year-and-a-half-long investigation into the Oscar's fate. Carter rejected claims that students had stolen the Oscar (and thrown it in the Potomac River) as wild speculation or fabrication that traded on long-perpetuated stereotypes of blacks. She questioned the sourcing of the Huffington Post stories. Instead, she argued that the Oscar was likely returned to Howard University's Channing Pollack Theater Collection between the spring of 1971 and the summer of 1973 or had possibly been boxed and stored in the drama department at that time. The reason for its removal, she argued, was not civil rights unrest but rather efforts to make room for a new generation of black performers. If neither the Oscar nor any paper trail of its ultimate destiny can be found at Howard today, she suggested, inadequate storage or record-keeping in a time of financial constraints and national turbulence may be blamed. She also suggested that a new generation of caretakers may have failed to realize the historic significance of the 5 1/2\\" x 6\\" plaque.

Later, Johnston described his initial audition as daunting, saying that \\"it was scary singing in front of 2,500 people.

As a viewer, I am compelled to share my negative sentiments towards this film, which I ultimately found difficult to sit through. John Doe, the director of Broken Dreams, seemed to have bitten off more than he could chew, showcasing an unclear vision that resulted in disjointed storytelling. The film's plot, which revolves around the struggles of a young woman (Jane Smith) to find success in her personal and professional life, fails to evoke any emotional response primarily due to a lack of character development and overused cliches. Smith's portrayal of the protagonist should've been the saving grace of this film, but her lackluster performance contributed to the overall disappointment. Broken Dreams relies heavily on its visual effects in an attempt to captivate the audience, but they seem overindulgent and excessive. It is plain to see that the director has prioritized flashy special effects over a cohesive narrative, which comes at the expense of the viewer's ability to connect with the characters on a meaningful level. The relationship between Jane Smith and her love interest, portrayed by Michael Brown, is poorly developed and severely lacking in chemistry. They come off as two strangers thrown together, rather than two people caught up in the whirlwind of romance. The dialogue exchanges between the leads are cringe-worthy, making the viewer long for the sweet release of the end credits. Furthermore, the film's tonal inconsistency is jarring, as it attempts to tackle profound issues while also incorporating humor and lighthearted moments that fall flat. Consequently, this leaves the audience in a perpetual state of confusion about the film's intended message. The cinematography and editing in Broken Dreams do not offer any redeeming qualities either. Meticulously long, drawn-out scenes that do not contribute to the story make for a tedious viewing experience. Moreover, the perplexing choice of color grading and a near-shaky camera movement give the impression of an amateurish production. The musical score, meant to bolster the emotionally charged moments, seems out of place, as it either drowns out dialogue or is so subtle that it renders any impact it might have had unnoticeable. The sound design department could've elevated the film's atmosphere, but it appears that they too fell victim to the muddled vision behind this production. All in all, Broken Dreams is a textbook example of wasted potential. With a flawed script, lackluster performances, and a plethora of technical shortcomings, the film leaves the viewer with an overwhelming sense of disappointment and unfulfilled expectations. I cannot, in good faith, recommend this woeful attempt at cinema to anyone. As it stands, Broken Dreams serves as a stark reminder that not all dreams are meant to be realized on the silver screen."},{"question":"Tickets for the Museum of Scotland allow entrance also to the main collections of the Royal Museum, fulfilling the stated aim of the curators of bringing Scotland to the world, and the world to Scotland.

Graham is approached at his Florida home by his former FBI superior Jack Crawford (Dennis Farina), who is seeking help with a new serial killer case. Promising his wife (Kim Greist) that he will do nothing more than examine evidence and not risk physical harm, Graham agrees to visit the most recent crime scene in Atlanta, where he tries to enter the mindset of the killer, now dubbed the \\"Tooth Fairy\\" by the police for the bite-marks left on his victims.Having found the killer's fingerprints, Graham meets with Crawford. They are accosted by tabloid journalist Freddy Lounds (Stephen Lang), with whom Graham has a bitter history. Lounds' paper had run photographs of Graham taken secretly while he was hospitalized. Graham pays a visit to Lecktor, a former psychiatrist, in his cell and asks for his insight into the killer's motivations. After a tense conversation, Lecktor agrees to look at the case file. Lecktor later contrives to obtain Graham's home address by deceit.Graham travels to the first crime scene in Birmingham, Alabama, where he is contacted by Crawford, who tells him of Lounds' tabloid story on the case.

Explanation:","response":"No, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. Step-by-step justification: 1. The premise states that \\"A construction worker fits metal pipes together.\\" This means the construction worker is actively working on assembling metal pipes. 2. The hypothesis says \\"The worker is sleeping.\\" For the worker to be sleeping, they would need to be inactive and not performing any work tasks. 3. Since the premise describes the worker actively performing a task (fitting metal pipes together), it contradicts the hypothesis, which states the worker is sleeping and, therefore, inactive.

The lead vocals on \\"I Am the Walrus\\" were performed by John Lennon. Lennon is one of the chief members of the Beatles, which also included Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr. The song was released as a B-side to the single \\"Hello, Goodbye\\". Composed by John Lennon, \\"I Am the Walrus\\" features a rich, psychedelic sound layered with intriguing lyrics that lend to its enigmatic reputation. The record is a unique amalgamation of hard rock, art pop, psychedelia, and musique concrète. John Lennon cited the basis for the song as three individual songs he had been working on that he combined. The first was inspired by hearing a distant police siren that reminded him of his childhood. The second came from a lyric he had written that he thought was very \\"screwed up\\". And the third drew from the rhythm of the car’s engine during that day's commute. The title itself, \\"I Am the Walrus\\" was inspired by Lewis Carroll's poem \\"The Walrus and The Carpenter\\". Lennon later expressed regret over his choice of Walrus as he failed to realize that the Walrus was the villain in Carroll's poem. Lennon’s performance on \\"I Am the Walrus\\" is influential; his distinct vocal delivery brought emotional depth to the song. His harmonic style, coupled with a complementary melody and striking lyrics, ensured that Lennon’s rendition is remembered as an influential piece of music history. It is his voice that successfully captures and delivers the lyrical complexities and eccentricities of the song to listeners. \\"I Am the Walrus\\" also showcased the Beatles' skill at producing innovative music, with complex layering of instruments, vocal effects, sampling, and incorporating orchestra into their music. This was largely due to the experimental phase they were going through, influenced by the contemporary counterculture of the 1960s, during which they were exploring new recording techniques and lyric storytelling. Lennon reflected this shifting, psychedelic zeitgeist in his deeply enigmatic, surreal lyrics and stirring vocal performance. So, to answer your question, it was John Lennon who sang lead on \\"I Am the Walrus\\" – his distinctive voice presented the rich, psychedelic, and intricate composition to audiences, contributing to the ever-lasting legacy of the Beatles’ music."},{"question":"This question has options.

However, the order of the cities and the timing of when he moved to them is different in each statement, which changes the meaning significantly. In the first statement: \\"He moved to Attika, Indiana in 1853, and in 1859 to Bloomington, Illinois.\\" This tells us that the man moved to Attika, Indiana first, specifically in the year 1853. Then, approximately six years later, in 1859, he moved again, this time to Bloomington, Illinois. This information is sequential and puts his relocation to Attika, Indiana before his time in Bloomington, Illinois. This directly impacts any events or experiences he might have had in each place, his relationship to each place, and how we understand his timeline and story. In contrast, the second statement: \\"He moved to Bloomington, Illinois in 1853, and in 1859 to Attika, Indiana.\\" This tells a very different story. In this scenario, the man moved to Bloomington, Illinois first in 1853, which is then followed by a move to Attika, Indiana in 1859. This swaps the order of the relocation events compared to the first statement, moving his time in Bloomington, Illinois to before his time in Attika, Indiana. As with the first statement, this directly influences his experiences, relationship to each city, and how we track his timeline and story.

I've had the luxury and the pleasure to have eaten the BEST Jamaican food prepared. So I'm a bit biased. Haling from Flatbush NY, where everybody and their mama is a chef. Oh and I've had the opportunity to eat at an actually Jamaican restaurant in Jamaica. I'm more than biased. I was hungry. My hunny was hungry. We were hot and tired of fast food. So we decided to trek via the steel horse to this quaint restaurant. Decorum: Decorum: paint job was nice. Yellow and green walls. Pictures of Jamaican food. Local art. Jamaican paintings. Nice candles. Small tables, Nice environment for couples. Tables outside. No one was outside because it was hot ass 99 degree hell. Bob Marley, is what I sang along to while I waited patiently for my food. We held our breathe. This is Phoenix after all. There are no Jamaicans here. So I thought. Service: When entering the restaurant everyone behind the counter said HI! I felt like I was at Blockbuster. They were as happy to see us as I was hungry to eat my food. The lone waiter looked like a hippy, not Jamaican. And i knew he wasn't Jamaican, because he had a New Jersey accent. And he was err um not Black. THE FOOD: I ordered they brown stew chicken, with rice and peas and huge heep of cabbage. Never had it prepared that way. Never want to eat a huge slimy hard to cut heap of cabbage again. Try shredding it, please. One red and one green pepper slice. And to my dismay two puny slices of plantains. Yes I was disappointed. For that is the best part of a Jamaican dish. I eyed my dates plate for his and he had his arms guarding his plate like a prisoner in jail. So no, not enough plantains. The rice and peas tasted like Indian rice. It looked like Indian rice. In fact it was Indian bismati rice. The chef told me himself. Jamaicans dont eat bismati rice. Its too expensive. They eat white rice with beans. I was confused, but i was hungry and i did eat it. No ginger beer available. But the carrot juice was not so bad. And the three dollar glass of ice tea was OK because my boyfriend ordered it, but then he drank my drink. Because it was bleh. Liquor was available, but read below why we didn't indulge. The prices: Pretty steep for a Jamaican restaurant. But I was hungry, and not paying. Two meals and two drinks came to a whooping 29. My boyfriend gave a measly three dollar tip. Mostly because he was a decent waiter and times are hard. And because there were more staff there than customers. And they were watching our every move. Synopsis: Surprisingly, I ate everything on my plate. My hunny ate everything on his plate. And then tried to eat my food, because he paid for it. (wink) So it wasn't that bad. The Chef dropped by to ask me how my dining experience was. I frankly asked about the rice...was it basmati rice? He said yes. He explained in a nerdy hipster narrative that he knew the butcher who the killed the animals and the farmer who grew the veggies. His lifestyle and how he was injecting ether to the restaurant scene in Phoenix. That is why I am giving the guy a break. So instead of giving him a 2. I will give him a 3.

Options: - yes - no Chain of thought and solution for this question is:","response":"Yes, the claim is correct and can be verified by human common sense and without a web search. Chain of thought and solution for this question is: - Sound is a type of mechanical wave that travels through a medium like air by compressing and stretching the particles in the medium. - The human ear consists of three main parts: the outer ear, middle ear, and inner ear. - The outer ear collects sound waves and directs them to the middle ear. - The eardrum (also known as the tympanic membrane) is a thin, tightly stretched membrane that separates the outer ear from the middle ear. - When sound waves reach the eardrum, they cause it to vibrate. - These vibrations are transferred to the three small bones (ossicles) in the middle ear, which transmit the vibrations to the inner ear, where they are transformed into electrical signals and sent to the brain for processing. Therefore, the claim that \\"the drum vibrates inside the ear when sound hits it\\" is correct. This is a basic understanding of how the human ear perceives sound, which can be verified through human common sense without a web search."},{"question":"Give some stream of consciousness and then the answer.

Is \\"Tensions soon developed among different Greek factions, leading to two consecutive civil wars.\\" the correct answer?","response":"The statement \\"Tensions soon developed among different Greek factions, leading to two consecutive civil wars.\\" is a simplified answer. To provide a detailed and long answer, we need to delve into the history of ancient Greece. The Ancient Greek world was primarily composed of city-states or \\"poleis\\" that were relatively independent from each other, and many conflicts occurred between these city-states throughout history. While it is challenging to give an exact number of successive civil wars that occurred among Greek clans, there are a few significant examples that shed light on the nature of conflict among the ancient Greeks. While the term \\"civil war\\" might not be an accurate representation of the Greek poleis' conflicts, the Peloponnesian War offers a broad context for the rivalries and tensions among Greek clans. The Peloponnesian War (431 – 404 BCE) was a series of conflicts between the Athenian Empire and the Peloponnesian League, led by Sparta. It comprised two main phases, separated by a brief period of peace: 1. Archidamian War (431 – 421 BCE): This phase of war was named after the Spartan king Archidamus II. It began in 431 BCE when the Thebans attacked the city-state of Plataea, an ally of Athens. The war continued for a decade and ended with the Peace of Nicias, a treaty signed in 421 BCE between Athens and Sparta. However, the peace did not last long. 2. The Decelean War or Ionian War (413 – 404 BCE): The second phase of the Peloponnesian War followed the failed Sicilian Expedition by the Athenians, during which their navy was virtually destroyed. With increased support from Persia, the Spartans managed to defeat the Athenian Empire, and in 404 BCE, Athens was forced to surrender. Apart from the Peloponnesian War, other examples of conflict among Greek clans include: 1. The First Sacred War (594 – 585 BCE): This war was fought between the Amphictyonic League, a religious federation of ancient Greek tribes, and the city of Kirra. The cause of the war was Kirra's alleged piracy and impiety against the sanctuary of Apollo at Delphi. The conflict ended with the destruction of Kirra. 2. The Lelantine War (circa 700 – 650 BCE): This war was fought between the city-states of Chalcis and Eretria over control of the fertile Lelantine Plain, located in Euboea. This war was significant because it involved most of the important poleis of the time, including Athens, Corinth, and Samos, testing their alliances and rivalries. Given the complexity of the historical context and the numerous wars and conflicts in Ancient Greece, it is difficult to pinpoint an exact number of successive civil wars between Greek clans. The answer provided in the statement is an oversimplification of the historical events and conflicts that took place among ancient Greek factions."},{"question":"Gerard Brantsen was one of the Dutch signatories to the treaty ending a war that began in what year?

The term is analogous to \\"state\\" or \\"province\\". - In geography, regions are areas that are broadly divided by physical characteristics (physical geography), human impact characteristics (human geography), and the interaction of humanity and the environment (environmental geography). Geographic regions and sub-regions are mostly described by their imprecisely defined, and sometimes transitory boundaries, except in human geography, where jurisdiction areas such as national borders are defined in law. - Local government is a form of public administration which, in a majority of contexts, exists as the lowest tier of administration within a given state. The term is used to contrast with offices at state level, which are referred to as the central government, national government, or (where appropriate) federal government and also to supranational government which deals with governing institutions between states. Local governments generally act within powers delegated to them by legislation or directives of the higher level of government. In federal states, local government generally comprises the third (or sometimes fourth) tier of government, whereas in unitary states, local government usually occupies the second or third tier of government, often with greater powers than higher-level administrative divisions. - Ukraine (tr. ) is a sovereign state in Eastern Europe, bordered by Russia to the east and northeast, Belarus to the northwest, Poland and Slovakia to the west, Hungary, Romania, and Moldova to the southwest, and the Black Sea and Sea of Azov to the south and southeast, respectively.

On March 11, 1990, Lithuania was the first to declare its independence, with Estonia and Latvia following suit in August 1991. All three Baltic states claimed continuity from the original states that existed prior to their annexation by the Soviet Union in 1944 and were admitted to the United Nations on 17 September 1991.

Step 2: Analyze the hypothesis The hypothesis states, \\"Lawyers disclosed everything their client had said.\\" This means that the lawyers shared all the information that their client communicated to them. Step 3: Comparing the premise and the hypothesis The premise says that the White House lawyers invoked attorney-client privilege, which is a legal principle protecting the confidentiality of communications between a client and their attorney. This is done so that the client can fully disclose information to their attorney without fearing that the information will be revealed to others. Step 4: Conclusion Since invoking attorney-client privilege implies that the lawyers acted to protect the confidentiality of their client's communications, we can conclude that the hypothesis \\"Lawyers disclosed everything their client had said.\\" is not true, as the lawyers did not disclose their client's communications due to the upheld privilege."},{"question":"The young girl in the sex video that prompted the gang murder of an innocent Bronx teen has been receiving threatening messages on social media, a high-ranking police source said Monday. The 15-year-old girl is under NYPD police protection as a result of messages she’s gotten on Snapchat, Facebook and Instagram, the source said. Some refer to her as a “whore” and blame her for the death of Lesandro “Junior” Guzman-Feliz, who was dragged out of a bodega and hacked to death Wednesday by a group of five suspected Trinitarios gang members. Like Guzman-Feliz, the girl is enrolled in the NYPD Explorers program for youths interested in a career in law enforcement, the source added. Police believe Guzman-Feliz, 15, was the victim of mistaken identity. He resembles a young man who raps in a video that shows the girl having sex in the background. She’s believed to be the relative of a Trinitarios member. ||||| A bodega worker heartlessly gave the boot to mistaken-ID murder victim Lesandro “Junior” Guzman-Feliz as the desperate teen bled all over the store rather than offer him any aid, according to newly released video footage. In the first of two clips that emerged Tuesday, Guzman-Feliz, 15, enters the Cruz and Chiky grocery on East 183rd Street near Bathgate Avenue in the Bronx last Wednesday night and jumps behind the counter in an attempt to hide from the Trinitarios gangbangers who would soon hack him to death with knives and a machete. He struggles with a worker in a blue shirt, who puts his arm out to stop the frightened teen — but Guzman-Feliz manages to scramble behind the counter. The second video — made seconds after Guzman-Feliz was stabbed outside the bodega — shows him staggering back into the store and past two men. The teen leaves a trail of blood on the floor as he heaves himself up on the counter, apparently seeking help for his mortal wounds. But the callous bodega worker can be seen jumping backward and then motioning toward the front door. Guzman-Feliz seems to comply, by promptly stumbling back outside. It is unclear what was said, ­because the videos lack sound. Guzman-Feliz’s left hand smears a pool of blood left on the counter as he leaves. A previously released clip from exterior surveillance shows the teen then exiting the deli and throwing his hands up in the air in exasperation. He limped a block to St. Barnabas Hospital, but collapsed on the sidewalk steps away. The worker watched the boy grow up over the years only to let him die before his very eyes, grieving mom Leandra Feliz said. “They know him! We live here 17 year, [the owner] knows him,” she said over the weekend. “He pushed him like, ‘Take him! Take it outside!’ Before the killers get in, my son was hiding inside the store. He [had] time to lock the door or call police or something. He did nothing.” Outrage at the bodega hit a fever pitch Tuesday as a trio of local lawmakers demanded that the place be shuttered. “An owner who stands idly by while a 15-year-old is dragged out of his store and murdered in cold blood with a machete is no long­er worthy of doing business in NYC,” reads a letter City Council members Ritchie Torres, Vanessa Gibson and Rafael Salamanca sent to the Department of Consumer Affairs Commissioner Lorelai Salas on Monday, demanding that the agency shutter the store, formerly known in the neighborhood as Zesarina Grocery. The council members sent a similar letter to the State Liquor Authority demanding that it pull the bodega’s license to sell booze. “I saw video where the owner was engaged in business as usual right after Junior ran frantically in the store,” Torres told the Post Tuesday. “He continued to engage in a business transact with Junior’s blood right in front of him.” The owner did, however, call 911, NYPD Chief of Detectives Dermot Shea confirmed during a press conference Tuesday. Community members have ripped the owner and those inside the store that night for seemingly doing nothing to help save Guzman-Feliz as gang members dragged him out. The bodega owner, who could not be reached for comment Tuesday, has been getting death threats since the slaying and has kept his business closed, a police source said. The deli owner could not be reached for comment, and the SLA did not respond to requests for comment. “We are reviewing the letter. No general business license exists in ­local law,” said DCA spokeswoman Gloria Chin. Additional reporting by Stephanie Pagones ||||| Eight suspects are now in custody in connection with the vicious murder of a New York teenager. Mourners filled the streets in the Bronx Monday, frustrated with the violence that cost 15-year-old Lesandro Guzman-Feliz his life. According to a relative, the gang believed to be responsible admitted on social media it had attacked the wrong person, reports CBS News' DeMarco Morgan. They reportedly thought he had leaked a sex tape of one of the gang members' relatives. The teen's family said an apology is not enough. They want justice. Guzman-Feliz – known as Junior – was beaten and stabbed repeatedly by five men and was able to walk himself to a nearby hospital after the attack, where he died. His father, Lesandro Guzman, rushed home from a job in Florida when he learned about the attack. \\"I miss him. I miss him a lot. I don't know what happens tomorrow, but I miss him,\\" Guzman said. The gruesome murder is mobilizing the community in the streets and online, under the new hashtag \\"Justice for Junior.\\" Police used social media to solicit tips and were flooded with information, which reportedly helped identify multiple suspects, including their names, locations, and gang affiliations. All of Guzman-Feliz's suspected attackers are alleged members of a gang know as the \\"Trinitarios.\\" Family members believe the incident was a case of mistaken identity and claim the gang even apologized to them on social media. \\"No sorry, no apologize is going to bring my son back. He was a good and sweet kid,\\" Leandra Feliz, his mother, said. The slain teen's parents say he dreamed of becoming a detective and was part of the NYPD Explorers, a program for high school students. New York police commissioner James O'Neill was at his wake along with hundreds of others. \\"I'm very thankful for the support from everybody. Makes me feel like sure my son gonna have justice,\\" Feliz said. A GoFundMe page set up for Guzman-Feliz's family has raised 240,000. Local rapper Cardi B donated 8,000 to the fund. Another wake service is scheduled for the teen on Tuesday night. His funeral is planned for Wednesday. ||||| The 15-year-old New York City teen who died last week after being brutally hacked with a machete outside a deli went into the store after the attack to seek help – but instead was denied medical assistance and was asked to leave, a disturbing new video shows. Graphic surveillance footage posted online – which is drawing widespread outrage Tuesday on social media – captures the sequence of events inside the Zesarina Grocery store in the Bronx last Wednesday before and after Lesandro Guzman-Feliz was attacked. Police have since arrested seven men in connection to the gang-related killing. The clip begins with Guzman-Feliz entering the deli to escape the attackers, who police believe targeted him in a case of mistaken identity. A police source told the New York Post on Monday that Guzman-Feliz resembled a young man seen rapping in a video that shows a girl – believed to be the relative of a Trinitarios gang member – having sex in the background. WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT BELOW A post shared by 🤴🏽Robert 🌈Williams🦁 (@areumdawo_saja) on Jun 25, 2018 at 11:00pm PDT As Guzman-Feliz jumps onto the counter, he appears to be met with resistance by a worker behind the cash register. The worker eventually lets the teen onto the other side before the two walk off camera. Then the suspected attackers come into the store and drag Guzman-Feliz outside, where he was savagely hacked with a machete and left to die with blood gushing out of a neck wound. Shortly after the attack, the footage shows Guzman-Feliz coming back into the store to seek assistance. As he slumps over the counter, the worker behind it appears to jump back and refuses to come to his aid. WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT BELOW An apparent customer who was inside the store the entire time is also seen gesturing for the teen to leave, pointing toward the door. Guzman-Feliz walks out. Then, in one of the video’s most shocking moments, the customer reaches over a pool of Guzman-Feliz’s blood to complete a transaction that got put on hold during the attack, handing the worker what appears to be cash before getting an item back in response. The customer then throws a backpack over his shoulder and leaves the store, following Guzman-Feliz’s trail of blood out the door, while the worker is pictured making a phone call. The teen died shortly afterward, steps away from nearby St. Barnabas Hospital. \\"This just makes my blood boil,\\" one Instagram user wrote next to the footage. \\"The murderers came into the store and was still able to drag the boy out the bodega with nobody helping him. To [make] matters worse HE CAME BACK INTO THE BODEGA!! Bleeding… after the attack and nobody helped him!!!” “They treated him like an animal. My heart breaks for this poor boy his family and friend,” another user reacted on Twitter. New York City police so far have charged 19-year-old Kevin Alvarez of the Bronx with murder and gang assault in relation to the killing. Six other suspects taken into custody over the weekend in Paterson, N.J. -- identified as Jose Muniz, 21, Jose Tavarez, 21, Manuel Rivera, 18, Danel Fernandez, 21, Santiago Rodriguez, 24 and Joniki Martinez, 24 -- waived their right to contest extradition at a hearing on Tuesday, Fox 5 NY reported. They are expected to be arraigned on Wednesday in Bronx Criminal Court. All the men are suspected Trinitarios gang members. Meanwhile, more than a thousand people reportedly turned out Monday for Guzman-Feliz’s wake. The teen, who aspired to become a New York City police detective, was also memorialized in a tattoo on his father’s hand. “My heart is broken, really broken,” Lissandro Guzman told the New York Post. “He’s my son, but he’s also like my best friend.” NBA star Carmelo Anthony was among those to appear Monday at a makeshift memorial of candles and photographs outside the deli, which has been shuttered since the killing. New York Yankees pitcher CC Sabathia and singer Rihanna also have posted their condolences online, with the hashtag #JusticeForJunior going viral. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","response":"A young girl who was in a video that led to a terrible mistake and the death of an innocent boy is now getting mean messages and the police is keeping her safe.

From 1609 through 1614, the Spanish government systematically forced Moriscos to leave the kingdom for Muslim North Africa. They were concentrated in the former Kingdom of Aragon, where they constituted a fifth of the population, and the Valencia area specifically, where they were roughly a third of the total population. The expulsion caused the financial ruin of some of the nobility and the bankruptcy of the Taula de Canvi in 1613. The Crown endeavoured to compensate the nobles, who had lost much of their agricultural labour force; this harmed the economy of the city for generations to come. Later, during the so-called Catalan Revolt (1640–1652), Valencia contributed to the cause of Philip IV with militias and money, resulting in a period of further economic hardship exacerbated by the arrival of troops from other parts of Spain.

Article: Creativity is the key to a brighter future, say education and business experts. Here is how schools and parents can encourage this important skill in children. If Dick Drew had listened to his boss in 1925, we might not have an important product: a new type of tape. Drew worked for the Minnesota Mining Company. At work he developed a kind of material strong enough to hold things together. But his boss told him not to think more about the idea. Finally, using his own time, Drew improved the tape, which now is used everywhere by many people. And his old company learned from its mistake. Now it encourages people to spend 15 percent of their work time just thinking and developing new ideas. Creativity is not something one is just born with, nor is it necessarily a character of high intelligence . Just because a person is highly intelligent does not mean that he uses it creatively. Creativity is the matter of using the resources one has to produce new ideas that are good for something. Unluckily, schools have not tried to encourage creativity. With strong attention to test results and the development of reading, writing and mathematical skills, many educators give up creativity for correct answers. The result is that children can give back information but can't recognize ways to use it in new situations. They may know the rules correctly, but they are unable to use them to work out practical problems. It is important to give children choices. From the earliest age, children should be allowed to make decisions and understand their results. Even if it's choosing between two kinds of food for lunch, decision-making helps thinking skills. As children grow older, parents should let their children decide how to use their time or spend their money, but not help them too much if they make the wrong decision. The child may have a hard time, but that is all right. This is because the most important character of creative people is a very strong desire to find a way out of trouble. Question: What did the company where Dick Drew work learn from its mistake? Options: A: They encouraged people to work a longer time. B: They discouraged people to think freely. C: They asked people to spend all their work time developing new ideas. D: They encouraged people to spend some of their work time thinking and improving new ideas.

In his struggle with the Princes to enforce his succession, the tide turned in his favour when the returning crusader King Richard was captured in Austria and only released against an oath of allegiance and an enormous ransom. In 1194 Henry could assert the inheritance claims of his wife Constance by conquering the Kingdom of Sicily. By declaring a new Crusade to reconquer Jerusalem, Henry aimed at an agreement with Pope Celestine III to acknowledge his rule over Sicily. In 1195 the armistice concluded by King Richard ended. Sultan Saladin had already died in 1193 and a conflict over his succession raged in the Ayyubid lands.

Back in Afghanistan, Bin Laden anticipated U.S. military retaliation. He ordered the evacuation of al Qaeda's Kandahar airport compound and fled- first to the desert area near Kabul, then to Khowst and Jalalabad, and eventually back to Kandahar. In Kandahar, he rotated between five to six residences, spending one night at each residence.

COMPASS is any of a family of macro assembly languages on Control Data Corporation's 3000 series, and on the 60-bit CDC 6000 series, 7600 and Cyber 70 and 170 series mainframe computers. While the architectures are very different, the macro and conditional assembly facilities are similar. - West is one of the four cardinal directions or points of the compass. It is the opposite direction from east. - Geography (from Greek , \\"geographia\\", literally \\"earth description\\") is a field of science devoted to the study of the lands, the features, the inhabitants, and the phenomena of Earth. The first person to use the word \\"\\" was Eratosthenes (276194 BC). Geography is an all-encompassing discipline that seeks an understanding of the Earth and its human and natural complexitiesnot merely where objects are, but how they have changed and come to be. It is often defined in terms of the two branches of human geography and physical geography. The four historical traditions in geographical research are: spatial analyses of natural and the human phenomena, area studies of places and regions, studies of human-land relationships, and the Earth sciences. Geography has been called \\"the world discipline\\" and \\"the bridge between the human and the physical sciences\\". - Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets. - Vulgar Latin or Sermo Vulgaris (\\"common speech\\") is a generic term for the \\"nonstandard\\" (as opposed to \\"classical\\") sociolects of Latin from which the Romance languages developed. Works written in Latin during classical times used Classical Latin rather than Vulgar Latin, with very few exceptions (most notably sections of Gaius Petronius' \\"Satyricon\\"). Because of its nonstandard nature, Vulgar Latin had no official orthography. Vulgar Latin is sometimes also called colloquial Latin, or Common Romance (particularly in the late stage). In Renaissance Latin, Vulgar Latin was called \\"vulgare Latinum\\" or \\"Latinum vulgare.\\" - North is a noun, adjective, or adverb indicating direction or geography. North is one of the four cardinal directions or compass points. It is the opposite of south and is perpendicular to east and west. - In elementary geometry, the property of being perpendicular (perpendicularity) is the relationship between two lines which meet at a right angle (90 degrees). The property extends to other related geometric objects. - The Romance languages (sometimes called the Romanic languages, Latin languages, or Neo-Latin languages) are the modern languages that evolved from Vulgar Latin between the sixth and ninth centuries and that thus form a branch of the Italic languages within the Indo-European language family. - A noun (from Latin \\"nmen\\", literally meaning \\"name\\") is a word that functions as the name of some specific thing or set of things, such as living creatures, objects, places, actions, qualities, states of existence, or ideas. Linguistically, a noun is a member of a large, open part of speech whose members can occur as the main word in the subject of a clause, the object of a verb, or the object of a preposition. - The four cardinal directions or cardinal points are the directions of north, east, south, and west, commonly denoted by their initials: N, E, S, W. East and west are at right angles to north and south, with east being in the clockwise direction of rotation from north and west being directly opposite east. Intermediate points between the four cardinal directions form the points of the compass. The intermediate (intercardinal, or ordinal) directions are northeast (NE), southeast (SE), southwest (SW), and northwest (NW). Further, the intermediate direction of every set of intercardinal and cardinal direction is called a secondary-intercardinal direction, the eight shortest points in the compass rose to the right, i.e. NNE, ENE, ESE, and so on. - In linguistics, an adjective (abbreviated ) is a describing word, the main syntactic role of which is to qualify a noun or noun phrase, giving more information about the object signified. - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - The Italic languages are a subfamily of the Indo-European language family, originally spoken by Italic peoples. They include Latin and its descendants (the Romance languages) as well as a number of extinct languages of the Italian Peninsula, including Umbrian, Oscan, Faliscan and South Picene. - East is one of the four cardinal directions or points of the compass. It is the opposite direction from west. - South is a noun, adjective, or adverb indicating direction or geography. It is one of the four cardinal directions or compass points. South is the polar opposite of north and is perpendicular to east and west. - Septentrional , meaning \`\` of the north '' , is a word rarely used in English , but is commonly used in Latin and in the Romance languages . The term septentrional usually is found on maps , mostly those made before 1700 . Early maps of North America often refer to the northern - and northwestern-most unexplored areas of the continent as at the \`\` Septentrional '' and as \`\` America Septentrionalis '' , sometimes with slightly varying spellings . Moreover , the term septentrional , is the adjectival form of the Latin noun septentrion , which refers to the seven stars of the Big Dipper asterism , the Septentrion . - An adverb is a word that modifies a verb, adjective, another adverb, determiner, noun phrase, clause, or sentence. Adverbs typically express manner, place, time, frequency, degree, level of certainty, etc., answering questions such as \\"how?\\", \\"in what way?\\", \\"when?\\", \\"where?\\", and \\"to what extent?\\". This function is called the adverbial function, and may be realised by single words (adverbs) or by multi-word expressions (adverbial phrases and adverbial clauses). What is the relationship between 'septentrional' and 'adjective'? Answer:","response":"The relationship between 'septentrional' and 'adjective' is that 'septentrional' is an example of an adjective. It is a describing word used to indicate a direction or geography related to the north."},{"question":"What happens next in this paragraph? A construction worker is standing in a building, holding a mop and bucket. He shows off the bucket and solution, then mops the floor in a demonstration. he","response":"Based on the previous statements, the most logical next action for the construction worker would be to finish mopping the floor and then probably evaluate the result of his demonstration. Here's a possible continuation of the paragraph: \\"...carefully finishes mopping the entire floor. After the floor is completely cleaned, the construction worker stands back and takes a moment to examine his work. His satisfaction evident from the prideful glimmer in his eyes.\\" Step 1: The construction worker finishes mopping. This is a logical next step, as it would be consistent with the previous paragraph's context and the action that he had already started. Step 2: After finishing the mopping, the construction worker stands back. It would be reasonable to step back and distance himself from the freshly mopped area. This action also makes sense since he'd want to maintain a physical distance to allow the floor to dry and to avoid leaving footprints on the clean surface. Step 3: He examines his work. This is an expected response after someone completes a task. It's natural to want to check the result of the work, especially after a demonstration - to check if the results met, or hopefully exceeded, the expected standards. Step 4: I described his satisfaction as evident in order to emphasize the demonstration's successful result. His emotional response indicates that the solution he was showcasing worked effectively.

In more detail, the sentence highlights that two modern communication systems, which are internet phone calls (usually referred to as Voice over IP or VoIP calls) and game consoles, are distinctly different from the conventional telephone systems that existed before them. Internet phone calls operate using Voice over IP technology, which enables users to make phone calls by sending voice data over the internet rather than relying on analog phone lines. This technology has made communication more accessible and affordable as it often reduces the cost of long-distance calls. Some of the popular VoIP services include Skype, Viber, and WhatsApp. On the other hand, game consoles primarily serve as platforms for playing video games but have evolved to include various communication tools such as messaging and voice chat features. They facilitate interaction and connectivity among players, allowing users to engage with friends or other players from around the world while enjoying their favorite games. Examples of modern game consoles that support these communication features include PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch. Traditional telephone traffic services refer to the older technology and systems that were once widely used for voice communication. These services rely on a network of interconnected lines (such as copper or optical fiber) and switches to allow users to place and receive phone calls. The technology behind traditional phone systems is often considered less flexible and more expensive than the newer communication options mentioned above, such as internet-based phone calls and communication features offered by game consoles. In conclusion, the statement highlights that internet-based phone calls and game consoles offer a different set of features and benefits compared to traditional telephone traffic services. While the older technology was focused solely on voice communication, modern solutions have embraced the advancements in digital technology, providing users with more versatile and cost-effective alternatives for staying connected with others."},{"question":"Article: CBS 2Watch CBS2 News, CBS This Morning, Dr. Phil, Judge Judy, 60 Minutes, NFL football, and your favorite CBS shows.

The roof was sheared off the van during the high-impact crash. Driver credits wearing a seatbelt for saving his life. By. Shari Miller. PUBLISHED:. 11:55 EST, 13 June 2012. |. UPDATED:. 11:57 EST, 13 June 2012. A driver escaped virtually unharmed after his van hurtled into a pair of trees and he found himself trapped within the mangled remains. Delivery driver James Whittaker, 22, was on the A64 near York in the early hours of Saturday morning, when his van left the road and ploughed into a tree on his passenger side, before veering to the right and crashing into another tree. The second tree stopped the vehicle rolling further down an embankment, but the double impact sliced the roof off Mr Whittaker's Vauxhall Vivaro and reduced the van into a twisted heap of metal. The twisted remains of James Whittaker's van after it left the A64 near York and crashed twice into trees. Mr Whittaker, who lives in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, said he did not remember what caused the crash, but recalled finding himself wedged within the battered van. Miraculously, he did not break a single bone in the impact and came away with superficial wounds. He said: 'Apparently, the police, ambulance and firefighters didn’t expect to find me alive. I’m so lucky. I’ve seen pictures of other crashes and the cars don’t look half as bad as mine. 'I can’t believe I made it out without major injuries. 'All I suffered was a cut to my forehead, a few grazes on my legs and a bruised foot, nothing really. 'The worst injury I had was a cut on my hand from windscreen glass, but even that happened after the crash when I was trying to get out of the van.' Mr Whittaker, who started working for his father's Sheffield-based delivery service, Dedicated Couriers Ltd, had begun his shift at midnight. He said: 'The last thing I remember is making a delivery in Beverley earlier in the night. At the time of the crash I was on the A64, apparently driving from Scarborough to York, but I don’t remember being there.' Mr Whittaker came round after the impact to find a Polish truck driver, who had passed by the accident, calling 999. When ambulance and fire services arrived on the scene they removed him from the wrecked vehicle. The roof of the Vauxhall Vivaro was sliced off in the impact, but miraculously driver James Whittaker escaped relatively unharmed. He explained: 'They didn’t even have to cut the roof off as it was already gone. They just cut some of the steering wheel so I could be pulled out.' The lucky driver was taken off to York Hospital with a neck brace, as a precaution, but a CT scan and x-rays revealed that incredibly, James had not suffered any fractures. He has suffered some memory loss, but doctors have told him he may get his full memory back at some point. Police believe the accident happened around 4am, the same time his Tom Tom navigation system stopped working, but it is still unknown what caused it. Lucky: James Whittaker escaped from the crash with a few superficial cuts and bruises. Mr Whittaker added: 'The Tom Tom system records speed and I wasn’t driving over the speed limit. It was very wet and windy so it could have been that I skidded, and the police say I could have fallen asleep. “But I was talking to my friend on my hands free kit at 3.50am, so I would have been quite alert and the doctor thought it was unlikely that I would have dropped off so quickly.' Looking at pictures of the written-off van, which is undergoing tests to determine if there was a fault with it, Mr Whittaker credited wearing his seat belt for his miraculous escape. He said: “I can’t believe how lucky I was. I just keep thinking, if there had been anyone in the passenger seat, they wouldn’t have stood a chance. “My girlfriend Brodie usually comes with me on my Friday night and Saturday morning shift, but luckily this week she came on Wednesday instead. It’s just so lucky she wasn’t with me.” Mr Whittaker added: \\"When I look at pictures of the wreckage, I can't believe I wasn't more badly injured or killed.

For the third year in a row, we reached out to readers to find out where they wanted to be in the coming year. After thousands of nominations and thousands of votes, you made your choice known. To explain to you why we chose what, we went to our experts in the field: authors and editors who live in the destinations or who travel there on the regular. We think the best people to share about a city or a region are those who can't stay away from them for too long. If your favorite place didn't make the list, join in the comments below to say where you want to see yourself in the coming year. Safe travels. ||||| The top destinations to visit in 2012 Frommer's today released its 2012 list of top destinations (not to be confused with Lonely Planet's 2012 pick hits, which comes out Friday – stay tuned). As it has for the past two years, the guidebook publisher/travel website allowed readers to chime in on where they want to go next year. And the winner by a landslide? Turkey, with 51% of the vote among a list of 10 destinations, including Paris, Italy and Hawaii. There's a reason these lists come out in the fall, when thoughts initally turn toward where to go next. \\"It's to get people thinking about looking at a new way to see the world,\\" says Frommers.com editorial director David Lytle. \\"Travel should be inspiring, even as a five-day vacation.\\" The list is compiled by Frommer's writers and editors, and tends to go for outside-the-box locales, places that are hosting a high-profile event, or spots that have undergone revitalization, Lytle says. The top 10 for 2012 and why, according to Lytle, they made the list: Curacao – This often overlooked Caribbean island has affordable rentals, \\"as opposed to traditional flop-and-drop all-inclusives.\\" Chongqing, China – An alternative to the usual Chinese destinations (Beijing, Shanghai), it's a 19th-century town that has undergone rapid modernization, thanks, in part, to its position as the last stop on the Three Gorges river tour. Fukuoka Japan – This feudal Japanese town on the north shore of Kyushu province is a place to go after you've done Tokyo and Kyoto. Plus, its inclusion on the list is a reminder that not all of Japan was affected by the earthquake. Beirut – The city has experienced a renaissance in recent years, as many European travelers know. \\"It's an urban hotspot full of smartly dressed people who have intelligent conversation,\\" Lytle says. Ghana – Unlike some other African nations, this country has enjoyed long-time stability. As a former center of the slave trade, it's also on the heritage trail for African Americans. London's Greenwich neighborhood – Just 20 minutes from Central London, this Thames-side town has undergone a renaissance. And post-Olympics is a good time to visit London, since it's bound to be gussied up for the event, with bargains after the party's over. Girona, Spain – This Costa Brava town is popular among Brits, but is largely undiscovered by Americans. It's also an easy-to-get-to beach getaway from Barcelona. Bay of Fundy, Nova Scotia – It's a quiet, charming area, perfect for recharging your batteries. Kansas City, Mo. – Its food and music scenes are lively. It sports a number of really good museums. Plus, it's central locale makes it relatively close to a lot of Americans. Yucatan Peninsula – There's more to this region than Cancun. Moreover, it's been relatively free of drug-related violence that has touched border towns and the some of the Mexico's western reaches. This year, Frommer's added some demographic picks to its list. They are: Family Destination: Great Smoky Mountains National Park Cruise Destination: Tromso, Norway Beach Destination: Hanalei Beach, Kauai, Hawaii Adventure Destination: Moab, Utah Food & Drink Destination: Lima, Peru City Break Destination: Chicago Endangered Destination: Aysen Region, Chile Value Destination: Albanian Riviera Destination to Get Lost: Whitsunday Islands, Australia ||||| Summary:","response":"Every year, some smart people who work at Frommer's choose the best places to visit. They ask people for their opinions and also listen to people who visit those places a lot. In 2012, they made a list of the top 10 places to go, and Turkey was the favorite place for people to visit. They also suggested different places for different types of trips, like a family trip to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park or a beach vacation to Hanalei Beach in Hawaii. These lists help people decide where they want to go on vacation and see new parts of the world."},{"question":"Article: I am starting this GoFundMe page for my wife Lisa Brown. We started one last year for her medical bills and going to Cleveland Clinic. We made the trip 5 times last year and 1 time to Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami this year to see about a possible transplant. None of the Dr's were able to help get Lisa back on the road to recovery. As some of you may know, from previous articles, Lisa was in People Magazine last year spreading awareness for this HORRIBLE syndrome, SMAS. (Feel free to GOOGLE Lisa Brown SMAS, you will see all the articles about her) She was also later diagnosed with Gastroparesis. She spent a lot of time trying to help others, which i know she has. She dedicated so much time trying to cheer up anyone who was down. She would handmake personal cards for people who were/are sick, down about something, or just needed a little brightness in their day. She still continues to do this, however it is extremely hard for her to make time because she is so sick and weak. This October she entered into hospice care because she was declining so quickly. They have been trying to help keep her symptoms under control and trying their best to keep her pain free. Her overall health has and is declining rapidly now. I, her husband, am taking off of work on FMLA, and not getting paid, to spend the rest of the time she has with her. I am starting this fund to help pay for anything that she may want to keep her happy and comfortable in the last days she will be with us. It will also help cover the cost of her Memorial and for taking off work with no pay. We appreciate any help you may be able to give. I hope that her story has touch your life as i know it has for many people. Thank you much, The Browns Share now to help this campaign Share Tweet 448 shares on Facebook shares on Facebook ||||| Lisa Brown, the 34-year-old woman who was slowly starving to death because of a rare disease she’d fought for six years, died at her home in Brookfield, Wisconsin, on Saturday night, her husband confirms to PEOPLE. “The last thing I said to her was, ‘Go be free,’ ” her husband, Patrick Brown, says. “I already miss her so much. I wish I could see her every day but she’s now at peace.” She was able to plan her own funeral and made one rule very clear: No black allowed. “Lisa said everyone has to wear bright colors and tell fun stories about her,” he says. “She even made a thank you card to everyone who comes. It’s beautifully decorated and shows an open gate.” Throughout Brown’s twenties, she was healthy, happy and excited for her future with her husband. But that all quickly changed when she became very ill shortly after turning 28. The 5’10” former model and substance abuse counselor began to lose weight and couldn’t figure out why. Her clothing became loose, she started vomiting after every meal and was barely able to move from severe stomach pain. When she finally stepped on a scale, she was shocked to see she weighed just 112 lbs. (down from 140 lbs., her normal weight). In December 2013, doctors at Froedtert Hospital in Milwaukee were finally able to make a diagnosis: Superior mesenteric artery syndrome, a rare digestive-system disorder where part of the small intestine is pinched, blocking food from getting through. After a corrective surgery didn’t help, doctors were at a loss as to what else was wrong. With her mother and best friend, Patricia Neuhauser, she flew to the Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland, Ohio, to meet with a team with experts on SMAS. Of the 400 cases ever reported, they’ve treated 14 of those patients. Unable to get an intestinal transplant — something Brown was told could potentially save her life — she knew she’d continue to decline. Patricia says insurance wouldn’t cover the hefty bill that her mother estimates would end up being over 1 million. While some patients with Brown’s condition also have an eating disorder, Dr. Matthew Kroh who treated her at the Cleveland Clinic, says that there is no indication that she suffered from one. “Lisa is not anorexic or bulimic,” he told PEOPLE in 2015. Brown, who was just 77 lbs. when she died, stayed strong until her very last breath. Patrick vowed to be with her until she died. “I’ll do anything for her,” he says. “We’ve always made a really great team.” He’s also created a GoFundMe page to help with the costs of her memorial and for the money he’s lost for taking off work to be by her side full time. RELATED VIDEO: From Modeling to Intensive Care: ‘I’m Starving to Death and I Can’t Help It’ On hospice care at home since October, she was still able to cook her husband an occasional dinner and work on her favorite pastime, arts and crafts. Days before her death, Brown told PEOPLE she was ready to end her long and grueling battle. “I’m not giving up,” she said, “I’ve just been fighting for so long. My body can’t take it.” ||||| A Brookfield woman beset by a rare condition is back in the hospital as her battle against her own body continues. After years of suffering from superior mesenteric artery syndrome (SMAS), Lisa Brown remains determined to be not only a voice for the disorder, but also to win her own case. SMAS is a rare disorder that causes extreme weight loss and malnutrition. in the summer of 2012, Lisa found herself having difficulty eating and keeping food down. By winter, she had lost enough weight that her clothes weren't fitting and she had lost around 15 pounds. Three years later, Lisa was buoyed by hope that a surgery at a clinic in Cleveland this summer might allow her to reclaim health. For the most part, she has been bound to her residence because she has to be hooked up to a total parenteral nutrition system that delivers nutrients to her body intravenously. The surgery was intended to allow Lisa to switch to a feeding tube system that would give her more mobility and the ability to leave the house. Lisa has continued to use the feeding tube system since that surgery; however, in recent weeks, she has found herself losing weight again. Lisa's mother, Pat Neuhauser, regularly sends emails updating her daughter's status to interested parties. Last week, Pat informed them that Lisa had been checked into Elmbrook Memorial Hospital. \\"I had been getting almost 2,000 calories a day on that feeding tube. I really didn't put a lot of weight on with the tube, but the little bit I did gain, I was okay with that,\\" Lisa said. \\"When I start to lose that, I become concerned. I lost about 5 or 6 pounds in the last 10 weeks. That's like the average person losing 20.\\" Lisa is currently down to 86 pounds, the same weight that she was this spring before discovering the Cleveland clinic. \\"I'm always in pain, but I'm used to that and can usually handle it. The severity has increased over the last 6 to 8 weeks,\\" Lisa said. While the surgery over the summer has proven to be successful, it has led to further complications with Lisa being able to retain her body weight. \\"In October testing had revealed that the surgery had indeed worked and everything was passing through, but once it reached my small intestine, that's where everything gets completely hung up,\\" Lisa said. At that point, doctors in Cleveland recommended that Lisa pursue a small intestine transplant. However, in order to do so, Lisa will have to find yet another doctor in yet another city due to her insurance not covering the transplant in Cleveland. \\"I will have to seek out a hospital either in Miami or in Indianapolis,\\" Lisa said. \\"It's so extreme to have a small intestine transplant, so we're also hoping that there might be a different, less extreme option.\\" Despite the recent setback, Lisa is adamant that she is going to continue to fight SMAS and advocate for others suffering from the disorder. Lisa admits that in her current state, she isn't able to devote quite as much time to the board, but she is committed to staying involved. \\"Before I would provide links or I'd mail them information and really, really get involved,\\" Lisa said. \\"Now, I might just refer them to a website. But I'm on there every day.\\" While the board helps Lisa to stay connected with others going through the same fight, she notes that it also can bring bitter reminders. \\"One of the friends of mine on the support board just passed away Saturday in her sleep. She was diagnosed with SMAS and had a surgery scheduled but couldn't get in until January,\\" Lisa said. \\"It's just another example of how waiting is what kills us.\\" For now, Lisa plans to stay at Elmbrook until she feels strong and well enough to travel again, at which point she will continue to pursue a transplant or finding another option. \\"I would just like to thank everyone their prayers and well-wishes and support,\\" Lisa said. \\"It really has been overwhelming. It's still what holds me up when I'm so weak. It's really hard to stay positive, but because of the people who have supported me, I've been able to do that.\\" For those interested in supporting Lisa and her family with their medical and travel expenses or receiving updates from Lisa herself, go to http://www.gofundme.com/lisabrown. ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

The gastroenterologist took one look at her prior CT scans and angiograms to give her a diagnosis. (There have only been 400 documented cases of SMAS to date.) \\"She could see the pinched area of my intestine very clearly in the scan and the actual doctors reports. There were also notations by other doctors' about the pinch, suggesting further investigation for superior mesenteric artery syndrome, says Lisa. \\"But nobody ever told me, which is frustrating. Now, I tell people to be their own advocate and check your own medical records.\\" Most Popular But for the first time, Lisa had good news: A corrective surgery could relieve symptoms by rerouting food through a new passageway and bypassing the blocked intestine. But first, she had to gain weight — and strength. \\"I was in such bad shape that the doctor didn't think I would make it through surgery.\\" She went on a nasal feeding tube for three weeks and had the procedure in February 2012. For a few months, Lisa was able to keep down the foods she gradually reintroduced into her diet, even though she still had pain. \\"It was my little honeymoon period. I still couldn't eat large portions, but I didn't have any food restrictions.\\" She was able to go on their annual trip to Playa del Carmen. \\"My doctor said it seemed to be a total fix.\\" But in May, the vomiting returned. \\"It was pretty devastating and progressively became worse,\\" she says. A barrage of tests showed no additional explanations. To keep her malnutrition at bay, a nasal feeding tube was put in, followed by one surgically inserted into her stomach, and then finally a vascular feeding system. But still, she kept wasting away. The New Normal For 20 hours a day, Lisa is hooked up to the vascular feeding system through a port in her chest. After a restless night's sleep, her nutrient infusion ends at 8 a.m. and she has \\"four hours of freedom\\" before hooking up again at noon. \\"No matter how sick I'm feeling or how much pain I'm in, I get out of the house because I'm trapped here the rest of the time.\\" Lisa will run errands or go to the craft store. When Patrick, an engineer who travels frequently for work, is home, the couple go to their favorite coffee shop. A home, she's back on the pump — and on the phone for hours. \\"I have to deal with the insurance company and doctors offices: disputing bills and claims, making appointments, and getting things approved,\\" she says. \\"It's exhausting.\\" She finds solace in creating crafts and art projects, especially jewelry and intricate cards to send to people she knows through an SMAS Facebook support group. Her mother, Patricia Neuhauser, lives nearby, so when Patrick is on the road, she comes over to help her only child. \\"She helps with all the things I can't do anymore and will spend hours on the computer researching and looking for physicians,\\" says Lisa. \\"She puts everything she has into it. I'm blessed to have her and I'll never ever take her for granted.\\" Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Finding Answers \\"I was being shrugged off by the doctors at this point,\\" Lisa recalls of this winter. \\"I just kept on the TPN [total parenteral nutrition, her vascular feeding tube] and losing weight and losing weight.\\" Inspired by her friends on a Facebook support group, Lisa made an 11-minute video of her story and posted it on YouTube in January 2015. \\"The world needs to see and understand,\\" she says. \\"I thought, What does it matter if people see me in this light? They already see me and make a judgment. I might as well put it to good use.\\" Lisa heard about the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, a center for experts on SMAS, through her support group. In March, she booked the first available appointment for July 15. \\"I thought, I'm not going to live until then.\\" Desperate, her mother, Patricia Neuhauser, sent the video and a local news story on her to specialists at the clinic, which got their attention. They got her an earlier appointment, and a local business flew Lisa, who was too weak to take a commercial flight or drive, on their company jet for free. At the hospital, Lisa met with Dr. Matthew Kroh, director of surgical endoscopy. Their goal was to combat her malnutrition and find out what else was wrong besides her SMAS. \\"I was so ill when I arrived that it took two and a half weeks to stabilize me before they even felt comfortable doing any testing,\\" she explains. After she gained 6 pounds (bringing her weight to 94 pounds), doctors performed a test with a SmartPill, which was placed endoscopically in her stomach and traveled her intestinal tract, communicating hormone and vitamin levels, acidity, and digestion time. In early July, she got her second diagnosis: gastroparesis. While research on the causes of gastroparesis is limited, Lisa says it can be triggered by abdominal surgery. \\"The nerve endings that allow your stomach to pump to process the food and push it down your intestines are somehow damaged,\\" she explains. \\"They're paralyzed so your stomach can't drain.\\" Lisa Brown, in a January 2015 photo shoot for her video. Lois Bielefeld Photography Putting Their Relationship to the Test The couple admits that the last several years haven't been easy on their marriage. \\"It's not an equal partnership anymore,\\" Lisa says. \\"I used to be the caretaker: I cleaned, made all the meals, did the planning and shopping. Now, I need everything done for me.\\" But Patrick, who's a problem-solver by nature, struggles with the inability to fix this. \\"It's unbelievably frustrating, disheartening for him to accept that we don't have a solution right now — as he watches his wife die,\\" says Lisa. \\"He's so emotionally supportive of me, but it's torn him apart. I feel extremely guilty that more than half of our marriage has been illness.\\" While that's challenging, Patrick's concern is naturally for his wife.\\"What is it like to watch this? It's the hardest thing I've ever had to go through,\\" Patrick says. Being gone so often doesn't help: \\"It's constantly on your mind that your wife is dying but you need to pay the bills. I worry daily, leaving and not knowing what could happen.\\" He admires Lisa's strength and willpower — and tells her she's beautiful all the time. \\"She absolutely is beautiful, on the outside and inside,\\" says Patrick. \\"I probably would have given up a long time ago. She just wants to survive and spread awareness of this horrible illness so that maybe somebody else doesn't have to go through it.\\" Though the pair has good insurance through Patrick's job, the bills keep adding up — especially because much of Lisa's care is specialized and often not covered. Her family has created a GoFundMe page to help with the costs. \\"After insurance, I think our expenses came out to 11,000 for her last 3-week stay in Cleveland,\\" Patrick says. \\"Who knows how long she will be there this time … But money's not worth anything if you don't have anyone to share it with.\\" Hope for the Future On July 15, she had a surgery at the Cleveland Clinic to put in a rejejunostomy feeding tube, which will give her more freedom to move around. Patrick says the surgery was successful. Because he was on a job site in Denver, her mother went with her. \\"Hopefully, Lisa can get some of her life back and have more freedom so she's not hooked up 24 hours a day to the pump. Then they will do some more testing.\\" Adds Lisa, \\"It's not a permanent fix, but this will hopefully get my stomach and my digestive tract working again — and finally keep me strong and stable.\\" Update, January 25, 2017: Tragically, after a five-year struggle with superior mesenteric artery syndrome and gastroparesis, Lisa Brown died on January 21, 2017. She was 34. \\"She was an amazing person,\\" her husband Patrick told GoodHousekeeping.com. \\"As much as she is missed, I am at ease knowing she isn't suffering anymore.\\" ||||| Lisa Brown’s mind frequently drifts back back to her 20s when she was having the time of her life. She went to college, then graduate school and married the love of her life, Patrick. “Everything was perfect,” Brown, now 34, tells PEOPLE. “I couldn’t have been happier.” The 5’10 former model and substance counselor spent her time working, making gourmet meals, frequenting flea markets and driving around in her parents’ classic Mustang convertible with Patrick. She was active and never sitting still. But things quickly took a turn for the worse shortly after her 28th birthday when she began to lose weight and couldn’t figure out why. Her clothing became loose, she started vomiting after every meal and was barely able to move from severe stomach pain. When she finally stepped on a scale, she was shocked to see she weighed just 112 pounds. Lisa Brown at home in Brookfield, Wisconsin Courtesy Lisa Brown As she continued to lose weight, stares and comments from strangers only became worse. “People would say I should eat a burger and they’d ask me why I was starving myself,” she says. “It was very hard to hear but I knew the truth.” Now, three years after a surgery she hoped would fix her ailing body didn’t work, she weighs just 77 pounds and knows she’s out of options. She’s living out her final days at home. “It’s my time to go,” she tells PEOPLE. “I’m done fighting.” Her Six-Year Battle In 2013, Brown was diagnosed with superior mesenteric artery syndrome, a rare digestive-system disorder where part of the small intestine is pinched, blocking food from getting through. The disease causes her to starve to death. “I was hopeful,” says Brown. “I knew it was bad but I thought I’d be one of the lucky ones to survive. ” In July 2015, Brown was down to just 89 pounds and didn’t know if she’d make it to her 33rd birthday. At the time, she sat down with PEOPLE at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio where she was being treated for SMAS. To spread awareness about the debilitating syndrome, she created a video titled Be Brave SMAS Warriors, which she posted on YouTube. Her mother, Patricia Neuhauser, 68, then sent the video and a story a local news outlet did on Lisa to specialists at the Cleveland Clinic who are experts on SMAS- although there have only been 400 documented cases to date. Lisa and Patrick Brown on their wedding day. Lisa Brown It immediately caught their attention. After a corrective surgery didn’t help at another hospital, the two relocated from Brookfield, Wisconsin in May, 2015, hoping to get answers. Hooked up to a feeding device 20 hours a day, she went through numerous tests and was diagnosed with gastroparesis, a condition that prevents the stomach from emptying properly. Six months later, the hospital told Brown that she needed an intestinal transplant. It was something Lisa says she thinks would have worked, but insurance wouldn’t cover the hefty bill that her mother estimates would end up being over 1,000,000. “It was my last chance at surviving,” she says. “But it didn’t happen. It was way too expensive to do on our own.” After leaving the Cleveland Clinic, Lisa and Patrick didn’t give up. In May 2016, they flew to Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami, Florida, one of the few hospitals in the country that offers the transplant. She remembers barely surviving the long trip. “I was really deteriorating at that point,” she recalls, “and they told me I had to gain 20 pounds to have the surgery.” It was an ambitious and unreachable goal that left her feeling disheartened when doctors told her that there was nothing they could do. “I knew then and there I had no shot,” she says. “I couldn’t take it anymore.” Her Final Days Brown, who is now living out her final days with hospice care, still managed to cook Patrick one his favorite meals last week: Chicken green bean casserole. “She just won’t give up,” says Patrick, age 33. “It’s unbelievable. To see her making this meal while she’s so sick says so much.” In October, Brown decided to go to Seasons Hospice & Palliative Care to relieve some of the excruciating pain she was enduring a daily basis. “It’s not a scary thing. It doesn’t mean you’re ready for death; it means you’re finding another way to help your fight,” she says. “It doesn’t mean you’re giving up. I’ve never given up.” Dr. Paul Bullis, Lisa’s physician, says that for numerous reasons she wasn’t a candidate for further treatments after being seen by numerous experts who specialize in SMAS. “Her heart is still very strong,” he says, “and she’s still able to enjoy each day she has left.” While they’re now able to manage her unbearable pain intravenously, they have also given her some closure. “She’s ready to pass away,” he tells PEOPLE. “We just don’t know when.” Patrick, who typically spends more days on the road for work than he does at home, went on family and medical leave from his job in early December without pay to be with her. “I’ll be with her until it’s her time,” he says. “I’ll do anything for her. We’ve always made a really great team.” He’s also created a GoFundMe page to help with the costs of her memorial and for the money he’s lost for taking off work. Courtesy Lisa Brown Patrick has also found strength he never knew he had. “The hardest part is just sitting here watching her suffer,” he says. “But I promised her sickness and in health. I was just hoping for the health.” Brown’s days filled with fresh air, trips to her favorite local coffee shop and arts and crafts store are now mere memories for Lisa and her mother Patricia who lives just down the block from her. “I miss the things we used to do everything together because we are so close,” she tells PEOPLE. “The fun things that a lot of people take for granted. Stopping at the grocery store or anything like that.” When Patricia walks into a shop today that they used to frequent together, she can’t help but tear up. “I miss Lisa every day even though she’s still here,” she says. “My daughter is too young to die. We need more time.” For the past six years, Brown has never lost her determination, but now, she says, it’s her “time to go.” “I’m done fighting,” she says. “I’ve tried everything.” On Tuesday, Patricia and her husband Jack were able to take Brown to get her nails done. Naturally, she had them painted purple, the color for SMAS Awareness day, which is January 28. “It is rare I have the strength to leave the house lately, but mom took me out for this special manicure for a gift,” she wrote on Facebook. “Each day is more of a challenge for me as my body protests every intervention, but it is things like this that lift my spirits to fight another day.” ||||| What is a summary?","response":"Lisa Brown, a woman suffering from Superior Mesenteric Artery Syndrome (SMAS), a rare digestive-system disorder, and gastroparesis tragically passed away at the age of 34 in January 2017 after a six-year battle with the conditions.

Yes or no? Answer: Electron microscopes are used to investigate the ultrastructure of a wide range of biological and inorganic specimens including microorganisms , cells , large molecules , biopsy samples, metals , and crystals . Question: what types of microscopes do not require a vacuum Answer:","response":"There are several types of microscopes that do not require a vacuum to function. These microscopes rely on different principles and imaging techniques, allowing them to visualize samples under various conditions without the need for a vacuum chamber. Below are some commonly used types of microscopes that can operate in non-vacuum environments: 1. Optical Microscopes: Also known as light microscopes, optical microscopes use visible light and a system of lenses to magnify and resolve the details of a specimen. There are various types of optical microscopes, including compound microscopes, stereo microscopes, and phase contrast microscopes. These microscopes are suitable for live cell imaging and can be used to study biological specimens, minerals, and other materials. 2. Confocal Microscopes: Confocal microscopes are a specialized type of optical microscope that uses a laser and a pinhole aperture to obtain high-resolution images with greater depth control. This technique enables the examination of thick samples and even live cells with minimal sample preparation, making it ideal for observing cellular dynamics and molecular interactions. 3. Fluorescence Microscopes: Fluorescence microscopes use specific wavelengths of light to excite fluorophores within the sample, causing them to emit light. The emitted light is filtered and detected, producing an image that highlights the spatial distribution of specific molecules or structures tagged with fluorophores. This method is particularly useful in cellular and molecular biology. 4. Atomic Force Microscopes (AFM): AFM uses a cantilever with an extremely sharp tip to probe the surface of a sample, measuring the forces between the tip and the sample as the cantilever moves across the surface. This generates a topographical map of the sample with nanometer-level resolution. AFM can be used in air, liquid, or even under ambient conditions. 5. Scanning Tunneling Microscopes (STM): STM works by scanning a conductive tip over the surface of a sample, causing electrons to tunnel between the sample and the tip. The resulting tunneling current varies based on the surface properties of the sample, providing atomic-level spatial resolution. STM is typically used for studying the properties of conductive and semiconductive materials but can also be operated in non-vacuum environments. 6. Near-Field Scanning Optical Microscopes (NSOM): NSOM, also known as scanning near-field optical microscopy (SNOM), utilizes a tapered fiber optic probe to collect light that is either transmitted through or reflected off a sample. The probe is positioned extremely close (usually within a few nanometers) to the sample surface, allowing for high spatial resolution imaging beyond the diffraction limit. NSOM is used to study a wide range of materials, including biological samples, semiconductors, and nanostructures. These are just a few examples of the many types of microscopes that can operate without a vacuum. Each of them has specific advantages and applications, making them valuable tools for investigating the properties and structure of various materials at the microscopic and nanoscopic scales."},{"question":"Generate a question about the following movie plot: After witnessing the murder of his wife and young son at the hands of Henry Caine (Craig Fairbrass), who then turned the gun on himself, Abe Dale (Nathan Fillion) is so distressed that he attempts to take his own life. A near-death experience follows that leaves Abe with the ability to identify those who are about to die. He acts on these premonitions to save three people from death, among them a nurse met during his recovery, Sherry Clarke (Katee Sackhoff). Abe soon learns that Henry, before murdering Abe's wife and son, actually saved their lives. Abe concludes that Henry also had the ability to see death.

With an all-star cast and an intriguing plotline, the anticipation for this movie was sky-high. Unfortunately, this film crashed back down to earth within the first few minutes and struggled to find its way throughout its strained and uncomfortable runtime. Step 2: Address the acting performances. - To analyze the performances of the cast and discuss if they contributed to the disappointment of the film. Despite the incredible cast ensemble of A-list actors, including Susan Livingston and Mark Lockwood, their performances were bogged down by poor dialogue and lack of character development. Both actors, proven in many past films, failed to bring any emotional depth to their cardboard cutout characters. The rest of the ensemble also struggled to bring life to their one-dimensional roles, making it difficult for the audience to empathize or connect with any of them. Step 3: Critique the plot and narrative. - To discuss the film's story and pacing, highlighting where it failed to engage. As for the plot, \\"Wanderlost\\" missed the mark with its simplistic and often far-fetched storyline. The narrative was filled with cliches and backtracking, leaving the audience with a confusing and unsatisfying resolution. The pacing dragged on with unnecessary scenes, while pivotal moments were rushed, further contributing to the disorganized quality that plagued the film. Step 4: Delve into the technical aspects. - To examine the quality of the visuals, sound, and overall production. Regrettably, the film's technical aspects also suffered. The visual effects were lackluster and, at times, comically reminiscent of low-budget productions, undermining the intended sense of wonder and awe. The disjointed and jarring editing further added to the chaotic feel of the movie, making it difficult to remain immersed in the story. Even the musical score was forgettable, failing to elevate the film's emotional impact at critical moments. Step 5: Offer a conclusion that summarizes the review's main points. - To give the readers a clear understanding of my overall impression of the movie. In summary, \\"Wanderlost\\" is a prime example of a promising film let down by weak storytelling, shallow characterization, and subpar technical quality. Despite the potential that was hinted at in its marketing and the strength of the performers involved, it ultimately left viewers lost in disappointment. Perhaps Trudge's next project will manage to recapture the magic that audiences have come to expect, but for now, it's best to avoid wandering into the theaters for this one."},{"question":"Answer a question about this article: Victoria later described her childhood as \\"rather melancholy\\". Her mother was extremely protective, and Victoria was raised largely isolated from other children under the so-called \\"Kensington System\\", an elaborate set of rules and protocols devised by the Duchess and her ambitious and domineering comptroller, Sir John Conroy, who was rumoured to be the Duchess's lover. The system prevented the princess from meeting people whom her mother and Conroy deemed undesirable (including most of her father's family), and was designed to render her weak and dependent upon them. The Duchess avoided the court because she was scandalised by the presence of King William's bastard children, and perhaps prompted the emergence of Victorian morality by insisting that her daughter avoid any appearance of sexual impropriety. Victoria shared a bedroom with her mother every night, studied with private tutors to a regular timetable, and spent her play-hours with her dolls and her King Charles spaniel, Dash.

Step by step answer:","response":"To analyze the relationship between the two sentences, it's important to compare and contrast their key components. Sentence 1: \\"A young girl is smiling while swinging.\\" 1. Subject: A young girl 2. Action: Smiling 3. Context: Swinging Sentence 2: \\"A child swings at the park while her mother looks on.\\" 1. Subject: A child 2. Action: Swings 3. Context: At the park, while her mother looks on Step by step comparison: 1. Subjects: The first sentence refers to a \\"young girl,\\" while the second one mentions a \\"child.\\" Both terms can be used to describe a young human being; however, \\"child\\" is a more generic term that can refer to both male and female individuals, whereas \\"young girl\\" is gender-specific. 2. Actions: In the first sentence, the primary action is \\"smiling,\\" while the context is \\"swinging.\\" In the second sentence, the primary action is \\"swings\\" (which is the same as swinging), but there is no mention of the child's facial expression or emotional state. 3. Context: The first sentence does not provide information about the location or presence of other people. The second sentence specifies that the child is swinging \\"at the park\\" and that her mother is present and watching. In conclusion, it is not true to say that the two sentences are the same based on the information provided. While both involve children and swinging, their subjects, actions, and contexts are not completely identical. The first sentence focuses more on the young girl's emotional state, while the second sentence gives more context about the location and the presence of a mother.

Would \\"In modern politics, the most high profile political campaigns are focused on candidates for head of state or head of government , often a President or Prime Minister .\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","response":"In modern politics, most high-profile political campaigns revolve around candidates for head of state or head of government roles, such as a President or Prime Minister. While it is important to understand the types of campaigns in focus, the original question pertains to the sources of funding and financial support for these political candidates. Therefore, while your suggested answer provides context to the nature of political campaigns, it does not directly address the question. A more relevant response would be as follows: Political candidates receive monetary support and funding from various sources, depending on the country's regulations and the particular election campaign in question. Generally, this financial backing can be divided into four main categories: 1. Personal Funds: Some political candidates finance their own campaigns, particularly wealthy individuals or successful entrepreneurs. They may decide to use their personal wealth to cover a significant portion, if not all, of their campaign expenses, which demonstrates financial independence and reduces reliance on external donors. 2. Individual Donations: Many candidates rely heavily on financial contributions from individuals or supporters who favor their policies, ideas, and vision for the country. These donations typically occur through fundraising events, direct solicitations, or online platforms that facilitate small donations from a large number of supporters. In many countries, there are legal limits on the amount of money an individual can donate to a candidate to ensure transparency and avoid illicit influence on the political process. 3. Political Action Committees (PACs) or Super PACs: In some countries like the United States, PACs and Super PACs are organizations established to financially support candidates or advocate for specific policy agendas. PACs can contribute directly to a candidate's campaign, but there are limits on the amounts they can donate. Super PACs, on the other hand, can raise unlimited amounts of money but cannot coordinate directly with the candidates' campaigns. Instead, they may run advertisements or engage in other activities that indirectly support a candidate or influence public opinion on various policy issues. 4. Public Funding: Some political systems provide public financing to eligible candidates to ensure fair competition and limit the influence of wealthy individuals or special interest groups. Candidates may receive partial or full public funding depending on their party's electoral performance or other criteria, such as achieving a minimum percentage of votes. Public funding systems aim to promote political pluralism, reduce financial disparities, and increase transparency in the electoral process. In summary, political candidates' funding sources mainly include their personal funds, individual donations, PACs or Super PACs, and public financing, depending on the country and its regulatory framework. While your suggested answer offers a description of prominent political campaigns, it is essential to specifically address the various methods through which candidates receive financial support to provide a comprehensive and relevant response."},{"question":"Which opera by Richard Strauss was banned in London by the Lord Chamberlains’s Office until 1907?","response":"The opera by Richard Strauss that was banned in London by the Lord Chamberlain's Office until 1907 is \\"Salome.\\" Composed by Richard Strauss, Salome is a one-act opera based on the play by the renowned Irish author and playwright Oscar Wilde. Wilde's original play, \\"Salome: A Tragedy in One Act,\\" was written in French in 1891 and subsequently translated into German by Hedwig Lachmann in 1905, providing the libretto for the opera version. Salome premiered on December 9, 1905, at the Hofoper in Dresden, Germany, and rapidly became one of Strauss's most successful and controversial masterpieces. Set in Judea during the 1st century BCE, the opera's plot revolves around the biblical story of John the Baptist and Salome, the daughter of Herodias and stepdaughter of King Herod Antipas. Salome's character is infamous for her erotic and sensuous dance known as the \\"Dance of the Seven Veils\\" and her striking request for John the Baptist's severed head as a reward for her performance. The opera was not well-received in certain social circles due to its provocative plot, which included violence, incestuous desire, and the exploration of moral and social boundaries. These controversial themes led the Lord Chamberlain's Office in the United Kingdom to ban the public performance of Salome in London until the embargo was eventually lifted in 1907. Once the ban was removed, Salome was performed at London's Covent Garden on December 8, 1910, followed by an English-language version at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, on December 17, 1910. Despite the controversy surrounding its themes, Salome remained a pivotal work in Strauss's repertoire that contributed significantly to his international acclaim as a composer. The landmark opera blended Strauss's powerful orchestral writing with intense character development and exploration of psychological depths, pioneering the way for modern operatic techniques and expressionism in the genre."},{"question":"Can we draw the following hypothesis from the context?

Passage: Due to the often political and cultural contours of blackness in the United States, the notion of blackness can also be extended to non-black people. Toni Morrison once described Bill Clinton as the first black President of the United States, because, as she put it, he displayed \\"almost every trope of blackness\\". Christopher Hitchens was offended by the notion of Clinton as the first black president, noting, \\"Mr Clinton, according to Toni Morrison, the Nobel Prize-winning novelist, is our first black President, the first to come from the broken home, the alcoholic mother, the under-the-bridge shadows of our ranking systems. Thus, we may have lost the mystical power to divine diabolism, but we can still divine blackness by the following symptoms: broken homes, alcoholic mothers, under-the-bridge habits and (presumable from the rest of [Arthur] Miller's senescent musings) the tendency to sexual predation and to shameless perjury about same.\\" Some black activists were also offended, claiming that Clinton used his knowledge of black culture to exploit black people for political gain as no other president had before, while not serving black interests.

Sentence 2: The new contest is how fast can we kill this turtle and then cook it in wax? Select from the following. (I) yes (II) it is not possible to tell (III) no Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","response":"(III) No The second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. An entailment in the context of language use and logic is when the truth of one statement necessarily guarantees the truth of another. According to this definition, the first sentence does not guarantee or suggest in any way the concept presented in the second sentence. The first sentence discusses a theoretical, presumably nonviolent, contest involving the use of a product known as 'Turtle Wax', a popular car polish brand in real life. The context indicates a possible prize for a contest, namely, a year's supply of Turtle Wax. It does not delve into specifics regarding what constitutes a \\"year's supply\\", nor does it hint towards any harm directed at an actual turtle. Conversely, the second sentence introduces a new contest completely different in nature, explicitly suggesting the killing and cooking of a turtle in wax, changing significantly the topic of discussion and not offering a logical progression from the first sentence, which suggested a quantity of a product as a possible prize for a yet unspecified contest. Therefore, there is no entailment between the sentences since the second one does not logically follow the first. They propose two different contests and refer to 'Turtle Wax' in different ways: as a product in the first, and as a process in the second. The nature of the context changes, making the two sentences distinct and unrelated. They may both contain the term \\"turtle\\" and \\"wax\\", yet the treatment and meaning in the two sentences are vastly different."},{"question":"Q: Which of the following two sentences does not make sense? Options: - Sentence A: \\"He moved a city to his belongings\\" - Sentence B: \\"He moved his belongings to a new city\\" Let's solve this gradually.","response":"To determine which sentence does not make sense, we should first examine the meaning of each sentence. Sentence A: \\"He moved a city to his belongings\\" In this sentence, it suggests that the person moved an entire city to the location of his personal items. This is not a logical or reasonable action, as moving an entire city is impossible and it does not convey a clear meaning. Sentence B: \\"He moved his belongings to a new city\\" In this sentence, it implies that the person moved his personal items from one location to a new city. This action is common and understandable, as people often move their belongings when they relocate. By comparing the two sentences, we can conclude that Sentence A: \\"He moved a city to his belongings\\" does not make sense due to its illogical and unclear meaning."},{"question":"How is \\" .

To provide a detailed and long answer to the original question concerning the colors used in redecorations that King Edward VII was involved in, we must delve deeper into his tastes and the time period during his reign (1901-1910, as the then-oldest son of Queen Victoria). As the leader of the fashionable elite and the figurehead of a new age, King Edward VII (fondly known as \\"Bertie\\" to Queen Alexandra) played a significant role in shaping the aesthetic preferences of his time. Known for his love of luxury and opulence, his tastes were influenced by a mixture of Victorian sensibility, the Arts and Crafts Movement, and the emerging Art Nouveau style. Under Edward's reign, there was a move away from the dark, heavy colors and cluttered styles prevalent during Queen Victoria's time. Instead, the color palette began to shift towards lighter, airier hues, with a preference for creams, pastels, and muted shades. This change in color preference was intended to create the atmosphere of sophistication and modernity that came to be associated with the Edwardian era. However, in higher profile rooms – such as state rooms used for entertaining guests or public receptions – bold colors such as deep reds, blues, and greens were still popular to create a sense of grandeur and drama. It was also common to combine these rich hues with gold accents, ornate wood carvings, and plush textiles to enhance the opulent effect. For instance, during the 1902 renovations of Buckingham Palace, one of the most significant changes made under King Edward VII was the creation of the Blue Drawing Room, a space designed for entertaining and named for the intense blue color adorning its walls. The Edwardian era also marked the beginning of a more eclectic approach to interior design, with an emphasis on incorporating various stylistic influences, unique pieces, and antique collections to create a personalized and welcoming environment. This was particularly true for private spaces within the royal residences, where King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra sought to create stylish yet comfortable surroundings. In conclusion, while the original sentence does not directly address the question, researching this time period further reveals that the colors used in redecorations overseen by King Edward VII typically ranged from light and fresh shades in more intimate settings, to bold and dramatic hues in public and high-profile spaces. It's also worth noting that the preference for an eclectic mix of styles and influences opened up the possibility for a variety of color choices and combinations that would have been selected based on personal taste and the atmosphere desired within a given space."},{"question":"Premise: \\"A skateboarder in midair while doing a jump.\\" Hypothesis: \\"A guy falls off his skateboard while attempting a trick.\\" Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?

Answer the above question based on the context below: The exact time of the liftoff varies from source to source and is mentioned as 05:30:42 Moscow Time or 07:22 Moscow Time.At peak acceleration Laika's respiration increased to between three and four times the pre-launch rate. The sensors showed her heart rate was 103 beats/min before launch and increased to 240 beats/min during the early acceleration. After reaching orbit, Sputnik 2's nose cone was jettisoned successfully; however the \\"Block A\\" core did not separate as planned, preventing the thermal control system from operating correctly. Some of the thermal insulation tore loose, raising the cabin temperature to 40 °C (104 °F). After three hours of weightlessness, Laika's pulse rate had settled back to 102 beats/min, three times longer than it had taken during earlier ground tests, an indication of the stress she was under. The early telemetry indicated that Laika was agitated but eating her food. After approximately five to seven hours into the flight, no further signs of life were received from the spacecraft.The Soviet scientists had planned to euthanise Laika with a poisoned serving of food. For many years, the Soviet Union gave conflicting statements that she had died either from asphyxia, when the batteries failed, or that she had been euthanised. Many rumours circulated about the exact manner of her death. In 1999, several Russian sources reported that Laika had died when the cabin overheated on the fourth orbit. In October 2002, Dimitri Malashenkov, one of the scientists behind the Sputnik 2 mission, revealed that Laika had died by the fourth circuit of flight from overheating. According to a paper he presented to the World Space Congress in Houston, Texas, \\"It turned out that it was practically impossible to create a reliable temperature control system in such limited time constraints.\\"Over five months later, after 2,570 orbits, Sputnik 2—including Laika's remains—disintegrated during re-entry on 14 April 1958.","response":"Dimitri Malashenkov submitted a paper explaining how Laika died at the World Space Congress in Houston, Texas.

Answer choices: - absorbs light - career - light - employment - work - small - lenses - warmth Answer:","response":"If a flashlight does work, then a flashlight emits light. A flashlight, also known as a torch in some countries, is a portable and handheld device that produces light by converting electrical energy into visible light. The primary purpose of a flashlight is to provide illumination in dark spaces or during nighttime activities. A working flashlight consists of several essential components, including a power source, an electric switch, a light source, and a reflector. These components work together seamlessly to emit light as follows: 1. Power source: A flashlight typically uses batteries to supply electrical power necessary to generate light. Most flashlights use disposable batteries such as AA, AAA, or D-cells, while others use rechargeable batteries. 2. Electric switch: The electric switch is the mechanism that allows the user to turn the flashlight on or off. It can be a simple push-button, a sliding switch, or even a twist mechanism that connects or disconnects the electrical circuit. 3. Light source: The light source in a flashlight can be an incandescent bulb, halogen bulb, or most commonly in modern flashlights, a light-emitting diode (LED). LEDs are preferred because they are more energy-efficient, last longer, and produce a brighter light than traditional bulbs. 4. Reflector: The reflector is a vital component of a flashlight, as it helps focus the light emitted by the light source into a directed beam. It is usually shaped like a parabolic dish and made from a polished metal or coated with a reflective material. When a flashlight is working correctly, the user activates the electric switch, completing the electric circuit that allows electrical energy to flow from the power source. This energy then reaches the light source, which in turn generates light through a process called electroluminescence. In the case of LEDs, the electrical energy excites electrons in the semiconductor material, releasing packets of light called photons. The light emitted by the light source is then captured and directed by the reflector, creating a beam of light that can be directed towards a specific area or object. The flashlight does not absorb light; instead, it acts as a tool to generate and project light for various tasks such as searching, reading, camping, or emergency situations. In conclusion, if a flashlight does work, it emits light, providing visibility and assisting with navigation in low-light or dark environments. Its ability to produce light comes from the effective combination of essential components, including a power source, electric switch, light source, and reflector."},{"question":"Summarize this article in one sentence. In fact, with more than 3,500 pages to its latest edition, plus vast amounts of supplementary case law, it is not just easy to be befuddled - it is inevitable. And let us venture further. Befuddlement is not merely incidental to the French Labour Code. It is part of the very design. There cannot be more than one person in several hundred thousand who understands the latest reform plan being circulated by Prime Minister Valls. On Monday, as the various \\"social partners\\" stopped before television cameras outside the prime minister's offices, their reactions to the plan (revised version) were like rival exegeses on the Talmud. France's 35-hour working week was approved by Lionel Jospin's socialist government in 2000. Anything more is legally considered overtime. Previously the legal duration of the working week had been 39 hours, established under Francois Mitterrand. Some employers say the 35-hour week has pushed up costs, and made it difficult for France to compete in global markets. The current government wants employers to be able to negotiate longer hours and lower overtime pay with staff, arguing that it would help to reduce the country's double-digit unemployment rate. Busting the myth of France's 35-hour week The Medef business leader complained that a compensation ceiling imposed by tribunals in the case of proven wrongful dismissal would no longer be \\"prescriptive\\" but \\"indicative\\". The CGT union leader complained that new guarantees limiting the justification of economic dismissal on the basis of a company's French - rather than international -- performance were insufficient. The FO union leader regretted that a worker's Compte Epargne Temps (Personal Time Savings Account) would not be included in the future Compte Personnel d'ActivitÃ© (Personal Activity Account). And that it was also unclear where the Compte Penibilite (Hardship Account) and the Compte Personnel de Formation (Training Account) would fit in. One students' leader was pleased that there was a commitment to the Garantie Jeunes (Youth Guarantee Scheme). But another supported more strikes because under the law overtime pay can be negotiated at 10% rather than 25%. One \\"reformist\\" union leader was happy because the \\"philosophy\\" of the law was to devolve negotiations to company rather than sector level. One \\"hardline\\" union leader was angry for exactly the same reason. And a business leader said whatever the \\"philosophy\\", it was all irrelevant because the law's original intention - to allow small businesses to make deals directly with workers, rather than unions - had just been removed in the revised version. How any ordinary person is supposed to make head or tail of this - let alone decide whether the maze of new clauses to the Labour Code will actually bring down unemployment - is beyond understanding. The purpose of the new \\"Law on New Protections for Businesses and Workers\\" is to do precisely that - tackle France's crippling unemployment (five million if you include all categories). It is President Hollande's last throw of the dice, before elections next year. Early on, Hollande had said he should be judged as head of state on whether he had \\"turned the unemployment curve around\\". But this he has singly failed to do. Some 600,000 more people are in the dole queues today than there were in 2012. Most of them are young people - another group who the president promised to pay special attention to when he took office. Equally damning: for all France's vaunted social protection, 90% of new job contracts today are short-term \\"CDDs\\", which normally last just three months. Employers are too scared to offer the sacrosanct \\"CDIs\\" - which are permanent. So with the clock running out and his unpopularity at new highs, the president has cast in his lot with the economic liberalisers in his Socialist Party - that is to say Prime Minister Valls and Economy Minister Emmanuel Macron. The new law was intended to start the same process that has long been under way in France's neighbours, loosening up the labour market and reducing employee protection, but in return creating new jobs. A month on, and we have seen the reaction. A day of strikes and protests last week was not hugely followed - but sufficiently so as to rattle the government, especially as a large part of the Socialist Party is itself opposed to the changes. So now we have the Khomri Law (after Labour Minister Mariam El Khomri) Mark II. Under pressure from the street, Prime Minister Valls has removed several clauses, adapted others - while (he says) remaining true to the reforming spirit of the original. But - and here is the point - who is to know? As we saw at the start, the content of the law is bewildering in the extreme. Only a handful of people understand it, and they themselves have differing interpretations on what effect it will actually have on the jobs market. All that can said with certitude is that it is a million miles from the radical, game-changing reforms that have been introduced in Germany and the UK. In France, once again, it is textual fudge that will win the day. Politically it will be a master-stroke, probably allowing the law to go through with a couple of \\"reformist\\" unions onside and avoiding all-out confrontation with the street. Judgement on its practical effect will be deferred because - after all - it takes years for complex changes like these to work their way into the jobs system. And by that time the law will be forgotten - apart, that is, from an extra hundred extra pages in the Labour Code.","response":"The French government's latest labour law reforms are intended to tackle unemployment and make the nation more competitive, but their complexity and lack of clarity make it difficult to determine whether they will actually reduce joblessness or improve economic performance."},{"question":"Coming off their first win of the year against the Saints, the Rams flew to Bill Walsh Field at Monster Park for a Week 11 NFC West rematch with the throwback-clad San Francisco 49ers.

The question asks for information about the imperial rule over India during the 16th century, while the contextual sentence discusses events from the 18th century and onwards, including the decline of the Mughal Empire, and the subsequent emergence of the Maratha Empire, Sikh Empire, and Mysore Kingdom. Therefore, it doesn't address the desired timeframe in the question or provide a straightforward response to it. The Mughal Empire, however, did reign over much of India during the 16th century. The Mughal Empire was founded in 1526 by Babur, a descendant of Genghis Khan and Timur, after his victory at the First Battle of Panipat. The Empire saw a golden period of expansion and cultural synthesis under the rule of Akbar the Great, who acceded to the throne in 1556.

A \\"road,\\" on the other hand, has a broader definition to include routes connecting two places, both inside and outside of cities or towns. Without substantial context, it is challenging to say definitively if these two terms are referring to the same location in this instance. In conclusion, there is not enough definitive information provided in the first sentence to unequivocally confirm or deny that the scenario described in the second sentence is at all connected to the first. Therefore, the correct answer is II, it is not possible to tell if the second sentence is truthful or not based on the first sentence alone."},{"question":"Generate a context and a hypothesis.","response":"Step 1: Generate a context To generate a context, I'll consider a relevant and interesting subject matter that can lead to thought-provoking discussions.

What do Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Department of Health and Bolling v. Sharpe have in common? The answer to this question is:","response":"Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Department of Health and Bolling v. Sharpe are two separate U.S. Supreme Court cases that, while addressing different issues, share some common elements. These commonalities include: 1. Significance in U.S. Legal History: Both cases are significant legal milestones that have shaped and continue to influence American law, individual rights, and public policy. Cruzan was the first right-to-die case the Supreme Court ever heard, while Bolling played a significant role in desegregating public schools. 2. Constitutional Rights: Both cases examine the issue of constitutional rights, albeit through different lenses. Cruzan deals with the individual's right to refuse medical treatment and bodily autonomy under the Fourteenth Amendment, while Bolling addresses the right to equal protection under the law and the issue of racial segregation in public schools under the Fifth Amendment. Ultimately, both rulings focused on the importance of protecting individual liberties in different contexts. 3. Judicial Review: In both cases, the U.S. Supreme Court conducted a judicial review of lower court decisions. The Court evaluated the constitutionality of the decisions made, and in both instances, it overturned the decisions of the lower courts, setting important legal precedents. 4. Balancing Individual Rights and State Interests: Both cases involve the Court weighing individuals' rights against state interests. In Cruzan, the Court had to consider the individual's right to refuse life-sustaining treatment versus the state's interest in preserving life. In Bolling, the Court weighed the individual's right to equal education against the government's interest in maintaining racially segregated schools. In both cases, the Supreme Court ultimately decided that the individual's rights should be upheld over state interests. To summarize, though Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Department of Health and Bolling v. Sharpe address different legal issues—one about the right to die and the other about racial segregation in public schools—they share common elements such as their significance in U.S. legal history, their focus on constitutional rights, the process of judicial review, and the balancing of individual rights and state interests."},{"question":"Sitä voitaisiin verrata yksinkertaistetusti siihen, että halutaan koota työllisyysjoukkue, jossa 22 pelaajasta 13 ilmoittautuu erotuomariksi ja vain yhdeksän haluaa pelata.

Modern Marvel's first superhero team, the titular stars of The Fantastic Four #1 (Nov. 1961), broke convention with other comic book archetypes of the time by squabbling, holding grudges both deep and petty, and eschewing anonymity or secret identities in favor of celebrity status. Subsequently, Marvel comics developed a reputation for focusing on characterization and adult issues to a greater extent than most superhero comics before them, a quality which the new generation of older readers appreciated. This applied to The Amazing Spider-Man title in particular, which turned out to be Marvel's most successful book. Its young hero suffered from self-doubt and mundane problems like any other teenager, something readers could identify with. What Marvel executive helped change the focus of Marvel's stories and characters?","response":"Marvel executive Stan Lee played a significant role in changing the focus of Marvel's stories and characters. As a writer-editor, he introduced more complex, relatable superheroes in the early 1960s, which revolutionized the comic book industry. Stan Lee, together with artists like Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko, created characters with grounded, human qualities, making them stand out from the archetypes of traditional superheroes. Stan Lee's characters, such as the Fantastic Four, Spider-Man, the X-Men, Iron Man, the Hulk, Thor, and many others, went through personal struggles and faced real-life issues, making them far more relatable to readers of all ages. Lee prioritized character development and tackled adult themes, giving Marvel comics a unique edge with a wide, multigenerational audience. By doing this, he helped turn Marvel from a small publishing house to a major global brand that has expanded into movies, TV shows, and various merchandising opportunities.

Although initially considered a phenomenon separate to magnetism, since the development of Maxwell's Equations both are recognized as part of a single phenomenon:electromagnetism. Various common phenomena are related to electricity, including lightning, static electricity, electric heating, electric discharges and many others. In addition, electricity is at the heart of many modern technologies. - Geography (from Greek , \\"geographia\\", literally \\"earth description\\") is a field of science devoted to the study of the lands, the features, the inhabitants, and the phenomena of Earth. The first person to use the word \\"\\" was Eratosthenes (276194 BC). Geography is an all-encompassing discipline that seeks an understanding of the Earth and its human and natural complexitiesnot merely where objects are, but how they have changed and come to be. It is often defined in terms of the two branches of human geography and physical geography. The four historical traditions in geographical research are: spatial analyses of natural and the human phenomena, area studies of places and regions, studies of human-land relationships, and the Earth sciences. Geography has been called \\"the world discipline\\" and \\"the bridge between the human and the physical sciences\\". - The term export means shipping in the goods and services out of the jurisdiction of a country. The seller of such goods and services is referred to as an \\"exporter\\" and is based in the country of export whereas the overseas based buyer is referred to as an \\"importer\\". In international trade, \\"exports\\" refers to selling goods and services produced in the home country to other markets. - Lightning is a sudden electrostatic discharge that occurs during an electrical storm. This discharge occurs between electrically charged regions of a cloud (called intra-cloud lightning or IC), between two clouds (CC lightning), or between a cloud and the ground (CG lightning). The charged regions in the atmosphere temporarily equalize themselves through this discharge referred to as a \\"strike\\" if it hits an object on the ground, and a flash, if it occurs within a cloud. Lightning causes light in the form of plasma, and sound in the form of thunder. Lightning may be seen and not heard when it occurs at a distance too great for the sound to carry as far as the light from the strike or flash. - An economy (From Greek \\"household\\" and o \\"manage\\") is an area of the production, distribution, or trade, and consumption of goods and services by different agents in a given geographical location. Understood in its broadest sense, 'The economy is defined as a social domain that emphasizes the practices, discourses, and material expressions associated with the production, use and management of resources'. Economic agents can be individuals, businesses, organizations, or governments. Economic transactions occur when two parties agree to the value or price of the transacted good or service, commonly expressed in a certain currency, but monetary transactions are only a small part of the economic domain. - The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) is a civilian foreign intelligence service of the United States federal government, tasked with gathering, processing and analyzing national security information from around the world, primarily through the use of human intelligence (HUMINT). As one of the principal members of the U.S. Intelligence Community (IC), the CIA reports to the Director of National Intelligence and is primarily focused on providing intelligence for the President and Cabinet. - The military, also called the armed forces, are forces authorized to use deadly force, and weapons, to support the interests of the state and some or all of its citizens. The task of the military is usually defined as defense of the state and its citizens, and the prosecution of war against another state. The military may also have additional sanctioned and non-sanctioned functions within a society, including, the promotion of a political agenda, protecting corporate economic interests, internal population control, construction, emergency services, social ceremonies, and guarding important areas. The military can also function as a discrete subculture within a larger civil society, through the development of separate infrastructures, which may include housing, schools, utilities, food production and banking. - ALMANAC is the name of a major breast cancer trial. The acronym stands for \\"Axillary Lymphatic Mapping Against Nodal Axillary Clearance.\\" This major randomized trial performed in several centres in the UK produced clear evidence that sentinel node biopsy (SNB), used to stage axillary spread of disease, can be used with low failed localization and false negative rates, provided both radioisotope and blue dye are used to locate the sentinel nodes. - The World Factbook (also known as the CIA World Factbook) is a reference resource produced by the Central Intelligence Agency with almanac-style information about the countries of the world.

It is also available for download for use off-line. It provides a two- to three-page summary of the demographics, geography, communications, government, economy, and military of each of 267 international entities including U.S.-recognized countries, dependencies, and other areas in the world. - This is a list of countries by electricity exports mostly based on The World Factbook . - Electric charge is the physical property of matter that causes it to experience a force when placed in an electromagnetic field. There are two types of electric charges: positive and negative. Like charges repel and unlike attract. An object is negatively charged if it has an excess of electrons, and is otherwise positively charged or uncharged. The SI derived unit of electric charge is the coulomb (C). In electrical engineering, it is also common to use the ampere-hour (Ah), and, in chemistry, it is common to use the elementary charge (\\"e\\") as a unit. The symbol \\"Q\\" often denotes charge. Early knowledge of how charged substances interact is now called classical electrodynamics, and is still accurate for problems that don't require consideration of quantum effects. - Communication (from Latin \\"commnicre\\", meaning \\"to share\\") is the act of conveying intended meanings from one entity or group to another through the use of mutually understood signs and semiotic rules. - The world is the planet Earth and all life upon it, including human civilization. In a philosophical context, the world is the whole of the physical Universe, or an ontological world. In a theological context, the \\"world\\" is the material or the profane sphere, as opposed to the celestial, spiritual, transcendent or sacred. The \\"end of the world\\" refers to scenarios of the final end of human history, often in religious contexts. - Skyhorse Publishing, Inc. is an American independent book publishing company founded in 2006.

My baby is 1 month and is almost too big for the table. Don't buy it! Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? A:","response":"This review clearly illustrates the product in an unflattering light. The dissatisfaction of the reviewer can be analyzed through multiple aspects of their experience, which we will break down below: 1. Inadequate dimensions: The reviewer complains about the product's design, specifically addressing that the changing table is not long enough for their baby. They initially assumed that the table would be suitable for babies up to the age of 3 years, but their 1-month-old already seems almost too big for it. This concern mainly indicates user dissatisfaction with the size and functionality of the product. 2. Disappointment in the product choice: By stating, \\"Don't buy it!\\" the reviewer is explicitly discouraging potential customers from purchasing this particular changing table. This negative recommendation underlines the unflattering portrayal of the product. 3. Lack of attention to details: The reviewer acknowledges that they bought the product without looking at the dimensions, which suggests that they might not have been fully informed before their purchase. However, this part of their experience is not necessarily a reflection of the product's quality itself but rather an aspect of the consumer's decision-making process. Despite this acknowledgment, the review as a whole maintains an unfavorable depiction of the changing table. In conclusion, the product review presents a significantly unflattering portrayal of the changing table. The main issue lies in the dimensions, which seem insufficient to accommodate a growing baby. Coupled with the reviewer's clear disappointment and unambiguous advice against purchasing the product, the overall impression is overwhelmingly negative."},{"question":"What kind of task would test someone's ability to perform physical reasoning?","response":"A task that would test someone's ability to perform physical reasoning would involve the application of their understanding of the principles of physics, as well as their ability to think critically and problem-solve within the context of these principles. Such a task should challenge the individual's knowledge of various physical phenomena and the laws that govern them, as well as their aptitude for predicting, manipulating, or evaluating these phenomena in a practical setting. One example of a comprehensive task that would test someone's ability to perform physical reasoning is the design and construction of a Rube Goldberg machine. A Rube Goldberg machine is a deliberately complex contraption, typically using various simple machines, that performs a simple task in an indirect and convoluted manner. This task would require several competencies related to physical reasoning, including: 1. Understanding of basic principles of physics: The individual must comprehend the fundamental concepts of mechanics, such as force, friction, gravity, energy conservation, and momentum, among others. 2. Familiarity with simple machines: The individual should be knowledgeable about the basic principles of simple machines, including levers, pulleys, inclined planes, wedges, screws, and wheels and axles, which may be used in combination to create a complex, interconnected system. 3. Problem-solving and creativity: In designing a Rube Goldberg machine, the individual must come up with innovative ways to link separate simple machines to create a chain reaction. This may involve thinking critically and making use of available resources to overcome challenges and reach desired outcomes. 4. Spatial reasoning: The individual will need to mentally visualize the arrangement and interactions of different components within the machine and assess their feasibility. Moreover, they will need to measure and calculate distances, angles, and forces to ensure the components work together as intended. 5. Experimentation and iteration: The process of building a Rube Goldberg machine often requires trial and error, as well as the ability to modify and improve upon initial designs based on observed results. 6. Evaluation and analysis: Once the Rube Goldberg machine is constructed, the individual must be able to evaluate its performance and identify any flaws or inefficiencies. They should be able to utilize their physical reasoning skills to suggest possible improvements, ensuring that the machine performs optimally and reliably. In summary, a task that tests someone's ability to perform physical reasoning should challenge their understanding of physics principles, their ability to solve problems creatively, and their capacity to analyze and evaluate physical systems. Designing and constructing a Rube Goldberg machine serves as an excellent example of such a task, as it requires both theoretical understanding and practical application of multiple aspects of physical reasoning."},{"question":"Here is some data: William Anders WAS_SELECTED_BY_NASA 1963; William Anders STATUS \\"Retired\\"; William Anders OCCUPATION Fighter pilot; William Anders BIRTH_PLACE British Hong Kong; William Anders WAS_A_CREW_MEMBER_OF Apollo 8.

The Premise: \\"Anse glanced at the mule's long melancholy face.\\" This premise provides information about a particular situation in which Anse observes the mule's facial expression as being melancholic. The key term here is \\"melancholy,\\" which, by definition, refers to a feeling of sadness or a gloomy state of mind. Therefore, in this specific instance, the mule appears sad or unhappy. The Hypothesis: \\"The mule never looked happy.\\" On the other hand, the hypothesis takes the information from the premise and makes a broader generalization, stating that the mule never appears happy. The conclusive nature of the word \\"never\\" implies a sense of permanence, suggesting that the mule is incapable of exhibiting a happy or content demeanor. One singular observation of the mule looking melancholic, as mentioned in the premise, does not necessarily mean that the mule has not looked or cannot look happy in some other instances. Now, let's analyze the relationship between these two statements and evaluate their implications. The premise does not exclusively confirm the hypothesis, as it only provides a snapshot of one particular situation. It is possible that in other instances, the mule has looked happy, but we are unable to determine this based solely on the given premise. Therefore, while there may be a correlation between the two statements, the premise does not necessarily entail the hypothesis. It is important to recognize that a single instance of an observation does not automatically lead to drawing a conclusive or generalized claim. In order to support the hypothesis, additional evidence or instances of the mule's demeanor would be needed. For instance, if multiple situations were described where the mule consistently appeared unhappy or sad, perhaps then there may be stronger grounds to support the hypothesis. However, with the given information, we cannot confirm that \\"The mule never looked happy\\" based on the single observation presented in the premise."},{"question":"Question: According to Hayek, what is necessary for the implementation of a socialist economy?

Rodeos often involve events such as bull riding or bronco riding (both in the case of saddle bronc and bareback bronc riding). So, it is not specifically mentioned whether the cowboy is on a bull or a bronco. With this information, it is not possible to logically conclude that \\"A cowboy is about to be bucked off a bull.\\" While it is certainly a possibility in the scenario described, there is no definitive evidence in the statement to conclude it with certainty. It could also be the case that the cowboy is riding a bronco or is successful in staying on the bull or bronco for the entire 8 seconds or more. There are different potential outcomes in this scenario: 1. The cowboy stays on the bull for more than 8 seconds, successfully completing the objective and not getting bucked off. 2. The cowboy is bucked off the bull before the 8 seconds have passed. 3. The cowboy is participating in a bronco riding event instead of bull riding, making it impossible for him to be bucked off a bull in that particular event. In conclusion, while it is possible that the cowboy might be bucked off a bull, it is not possible to determine this with certainty based on the given information."},{"question":"Read the following paragraph and determine if the hypothesis is true: Baby Mine is a 1928 silent film comedy produced and distributed by MGM.

Robin: I can't believe you let your colleague flirt with you like that! It was so disrespectful! Step 2: Give Seth a chance to respond and try to explain the situation. Seth: Robin, I didn't encourage her. She just started talking to me, and I didn't want to make a scene by telling her off in front of everyone. Step 3: Show Robin's frustration escalating, leading to her decision to throw food at Seth and his friends. Robin: You always think you're so clever, don't you? How would you feel if someone was flirting with me right in front of your face? Do you have any idea how humiliating it was to see her all over you like that?

Answer choices: - Plant growth is reduced - cause their death - It becomes dormant - threatened - stay in the area - clean the area - move to another are - fix the area Answer:","response":"If a habitat can no longer support a species, that species tends to move to another area. When a specific environment becomes unsuitable for a species, either due to changes in resources availability, climate, or human-induced factors, the species will tend to migrate to a new location in order to survive. This migration can be a natural response of the species to a changing environment and may occur gradually over time or more rapidly if the habitat degradation is severe. The other answer choices do not fully address the question in relation to the habitat's inability to support a species. Here, briefly, are explanations of why the other options may not be significantly applicable as a standalone answer choice: - Plant growth is reduced: Although it might be true that plant growth can be reduced due to various reasons, it does not necessarily explain the species' response to the change. The reduction of plant growth might be a contributing factor to the unsuitability of a habitat, but not the main response of the species. - Cause their death: It is true that the incapacity of a habitat to support a species can cause death for some individuals. However, this option does not account for the possible migration of the species to a new habitat, which is an essential part of the question. - It becomes dormant: Some species might become dormant in response to adverse conditions, such as during winter or drought. However, dormancy is not a guaranteed option for all species and is not the primary response for a species when its habitat becomes unsupportive. - Threatened: A species may indeed become threatened if its habitat no longer supports it. However, this option focuses on the status of the species rather than its behavioral response to the changed environment. - Stay in the area: If a habitat no longer supports a species, staying in the area would likely lead to a decline in population, as mentioned previously. This option contradicts the question's initial assumption that the species move to another area. - Clean the area: Cleaning the area might not be possible for many species, and it is also not the primary response for a species when its habitat becomes unsupportive. - Fix the area: This option assumes that the species has the ability to fix or adapt their habitat actively. While some might be able to do so, it is not a common or primary response for most species. In conclusion, when a habitat can no longer support a species, the species tends to move to another area in search of a more suitable environment. This movement can help the species to find the necessary resources, adequate climate conditions, or appropriate shelter essential to their survival, thus maintaining their populations in the long term."},{"question":"Can you generate a question with a factual answer?","response":"Sure, I will choose a subject area and then generate a question related to that field to best ensure it can be answered with a factual answer.

Options: - valley - michigan - train station - executive suites. - state Let's give stream of consciousness first:","response":"The differences between a town and a township are primarily rooted in governance and regional distinctions. Towns are political entities that have their systems of local government, commonly with elected officials such as mayors and councils. Towns typically provide a range of municipal services to residents and serve as an economic, cultural, and social hub for a larger area. Townships, on the other hand, are a form of local government primarily seen in certain states in the United States. Townships are smaller administrative divisions within a county. They often manage responsibilities such as road maintenance, land-use regulation, and property assessment for tax purposes. In some cases, the term \\"township\\" may also refer to a geographical area that is officially designated as such but lacks formal political organization. Out of the options provided, Michigan is the one that refers to a state where townships are common. Michigan has 1,240 townships, which are integral to the state's local government structure. These townships can vary significantly in terms of size, population, and available services. In Michigan, townships are particularly important as they often handle land-use planning and zoning regulations, maintain local roads, and participate in decisions on issues like public safety and environmental conservation.

She thwarts the sinister Sith Lord Darth Vader and helps bring about the destruction of the Empire's cataclysmic superweapon, the Death Star. In The Empire Strikes Back (1980), Leia commands a Rebel base and evades Vader as she falls in love with the smuggler, Han Solo. In Return of the Jedi (1983), Leia leads the operation to rescue Han from the crime lord Jabba the Hutt, and is revealed to be Vader's daughter and the twin sister of Luke Skywalker.

Can we draw the following conclusion? Marie Hedwig Auguste of Sulzbach had no children. [i] Yes [ii] It's impossible to say [iii] No","response":"[iii] No It is not accurate to draw the conclusion that Marie Hedwig Auguste of Sulzbach had no children based solely on the provided information. To assess her role as a mother, it is essential to examine her marriages and any offspring that resulted from those unions. Marie Hedwig Auguste of Sulzbach had two marriages during her lifetime. Her first marriage was to Archduke Ferdinand Maria of Austria on 30 June 1662. This union produced one surviving daughter, Theresia Kunigunde (1665-1670), who died at a young age. However, this is a clear indication that Marie Hedwig Auguste of Sulzbach had at least one child in her lifetime. Marie Hedwig Auguste's second marriage was to Julius Francis, Duke of Saxe-Lauenburg, on 9 April 1668. They had two surviving daughters: Anna Maria Theresia (1670-1670), who passed away shortly after birth, and Maria Anna Carolina (1672-1672), who also died during infancy. Although both children did not survive beyond their early years, this evidence further confirms that Marie Hedwig Auguste did have children in her lifetime. Based on her marriages and the children that resulted from them, it is incorrect to conclude that Marie Hedwig Auguste of Sulzbach had no children. Instead, it is reasonable to assert that she had three children, though tragically, none of them survived into adulthood."},{"question":"Answer this question. What is the collective name for the writers of the four gospels?","response":"The collective name for the writers of the four Gospels is the \\"Four Evangelists\\" or the \\"Four Gospel Writers.\\" The four Gospels are found in the New Testament of the Christian Bible and provide a narrated account of the life, teachings, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. The Four Evangelists are traditionally identified as: Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. 1. Matthew: Also known as Levi, Matthew was a tax collector before becoming one of Jesus' twelve apostles. The Gospel of Matthew is often called the most \\"Jewish\\" of the Gospels, as it emphasizes Jesus' connection to Jewish history and prophecies. It contains the Sermon on the Mount and many narratives revolving around Jesus' teachings, with a focus on His fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies. The Gospel of Matthew is written in Greek but contains many Hebrew linguistic elements. It is generally believed that Matthew wrote his Gospel between 80-90 AD. 2. Mark: Mark, also called John Mark, was an associate of Peter and Paul and is thought to have written his Gospel based on the teachings of Peter. The Gospel of Mark is the shortest of the four Gospels, and it is often characterized by its fast-paced narrative and emphasis on action. Mark's Gospel focuses on Jesus' miraculous works and power, illustrating Him as the Son of God, the suffering servant, and the Messiah. Scholars believe Mark's Gospel was the first to be written, with a likely composition date between 65-70 AD. 3. Luke: Luke was a physician who accompanied the apostle Paul on several missionary journeys. He is the only Gospel writer who is not one of the twelve apostles. The Gospel of Luke provides a detailed and chronological account of Jesus' life and ministry. It is often characterized by its emphasis on compassion, social justice, and the importance of women in Jesus' ministry. Luke's Gospel also offers a unique perspective on the birth of Jesus, focusing on the nativity story and the role of Mary in Jesus' life. The Gospel of Luke is believed to have been written between 80-85 AD. 4. John: John, also known as the \\"Beloved Disciple,\\" is thought to be the same John who was one of Jesus' twelve apostles and the brother of James. The Gospel of John is distinct from the Synoptic Gospels (Matthew, Mark, and Luke) in both style and content, as it provides a more profound and theological account of Jesus' life and teachings. It emphasizes the divinity of Jesus, His relationship with God the Father, and the role of the Holy Spirit. Some of the unique narratives in John's Gospel include Jesus' encounter with the Samaritan woman, the raising of Lazarus, and the washing of the apostles' feet. The Gospel of John is estimated to have been written between 90-100 AD. In conclusion, the Four Evangelists - Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John - are the writers of the four Gospels found in the Christian Bible's New Testament. Each Gospel provides a unique perspective on the life, teachings, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, emphasizing different aspects of His ministry and fulfilling an essential role in Christian theology and tradition."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Given this review: \\"FF Reader So far very useful very easy to use very versatile.

RSS, which stands for Really Simple Syndication, is a type of web feed that allows users and applications to access updates to websites in a standardized and computer-readable format. These feeds can, for example, allow a user to keep track of many different websites in a single news aggregator. Aggregators work by scanning a list of websites periodically for new content, pulling that content, and displaying it in one condensed area for easy reading. They are available as standalone applications, web browser plugins, or can even be integrated into email clients. Aggregators are primarily beneficial to internet users who regularly check multiple websites for updates, as it eliminates the need to individually visit each website—an often time-consuming task. As for viaggiareinpuglia.it, without more context, it's reasonable to assume that this website regularly publishes new content about traveling to the region of Puglia in Italy. These updates might include articles about popular tourist attractions, guides on local customs and traditions, recommendations on the best restaurants and accommodations, or updates about upcoming events. With the help of an aggregator program, a traveler planning a trip to this beautiful region would likely find it convenient to get all necessary information in a consolidated and organized format, enabling efficient planning and maximum enjoyment of their trip."},{"question":"If Let us assume that our 1900 and 1990 12-year-olds are identical twins magically born 90 years apart., can we conclude that \\"These twins born 90 years apart share an affinity for swimming and ice cream.\\"?","response":"Based on the given information, we cannot definitively conclude that \\"These twins born 90 years apart share an affinity for swimming and ice cream.\\" While the fact that they are identical twins suggests they might share particular genetic traits, it does not necessarily mean they will have the same interests and preferences. In order to draw a well-founded conclusion about their affinity for swimming and ice cream, we would need to consider the influence of various factors such as environmental, societal, and personal experiences in addition to their genetic background. Firstly, it is important to understand the role of environment and upbringing in shaping one's interests and preferences. As the twins were born in 1900 and 1990, their childhood experiences would differ significantly due to the technological and societal advancements that took place over the course of 90 years. For instance, recreational opportunities, including swimming facilities and ice cream flavors, would have expanded considerably from 1900 to 1990. Additionally, the social norms and values of the two periods might have influenced their respective attitudes toward these activities. Secondly, one must take into account the influence of different personal experiences, even within the same environment. Even if the twins were to have grown up in the same socio-cultural context, they might have encountered different opportunities and challenges, which could, in turn, have an impact on their affinity for swimming and ice cream. For example, one twin might have had a childhood friend whose family owned a pool, while the other might have never had access to a swimming facility until much later in life. Similarly, one twin might have had the opportunity to taste a variety of ice cream flavors and develop a love for it, whereas the other twin might not have had the same experiences. Lastly, genetics does play a role in shaping one's preferences and interests. Identical twins share the same genetic makeup, and research has shown that they tend to have more similar interests and preferences than non-identical twins or siblings. However, genetic predispositions may only serve as a baseline; environmental and personal factors still hold significant influence over the development of preferences. For example, in the case of swimming, genetics might determine the twins' ability or natural inclination, while environmental factors and personal experiences would contribute to their ultimate affinity for the sport. In conclusion, while there is a possibility that the identical twins born 90 years apart may share an affinity for swimming and ice cream, we cannot definitively conclude this without considering additional factors such as environmental, societal, and personal experiences. It is crucial to acknowledge the intricate interplay between genetics and external factors when attempting to determine the similarities in interests and preferences between these two individuals."},{"question":"Given the question: Build a movie plot around this: Which school is Blair Willows chosen to attend ?

My older sister Ann had settled deep in the recliner, and she glared at me too, blaming me for winding him up. The jam box sat on the rolling tray table and my father was working the remote as he talked, backing up my newly burned CD and letting it spin forward to play a few seconds of low fidelity trombone solo. \\"You know the tune, of course,\\" he said. \\"'King Porter Stomp.'\\" Those childhood years of listening to him play Glenn Miller on the console phonograph were finally paying off. \\"He muffed the notes the same way on the Victor version.\\" \\"So why can't it be Miller?\\" I asked. \\"He wouldn't have played with a rabble like that.\\" The backup musicians teetered on the edge of chaos, playing with an abandon somewhere between Dixieland and bebop. \\"They sound drunk.\\" My father had a major emotional investment in Miller. He and my mother had danced to the Miller band at Glen Island Casino on Long Island Sound in the summer of 1942, when they were both sixteen. That signature sound of clarinet and four saxes was forever tied up for him with first love and the early, idealistic months of the war. But there was a better reason why it couldn't have been Miller playing that solo. If the date on the original recording was correct, he was supposed to have died three days earlier. The date was in India ink on a piece of surgical tape, stuck to the top of a spool of recording wire. The handwritten numerals had the hooks and day-first order of Europe: 18/12/44.

However, to conclusively determine whether the hypothesis \\"It's hard to find the prices on the websites\\" is true, we need to consider several aspects and supporting evidence. First, we need to understand the context in which the premise is being applied. Is the statement referring to a particular industry, such as e-commerce, online services, or digital products? Or is it a general observation about websites at large? Knowing the context can help us narrow down the scope of our investigation and determine whether it's a widespread issue or a more specific one. Second, to build our case for or against the hypothesis, we can gather data from a variety of sources such as user feedback, reviews, and experiences. This data would help evaluate if there is a prevalent trend where users find it difficult to locate prices on websites. It is essential to analyze a substantial and diverse sample to avoid confirmation bias, where we only see or remember those instances that support our preconceived beliefs. Third, we can explore website design and user experience (UX) standards adopted by various websites. There are principles and guidelines in place to enhance user experience and make it easier for users to locate crucial information on websites, such as prices. Investigating if websites adhere to these principles and identifying common patterns where websites might deviate from them can help solidify our hypothesis or refute it. Fourth, we can assess the website platforms, templates, and technologies used, which might contribute to making it difficult for users to find the prices. For example, certain website themes or layout options could inadvertently obscure pricing information, leading to user frustration. Likewise, newer technologies like chatbots or AI-driven pricing personalization might play a role in creating barriers. Lastly, we should consider individual variance when evaluating this hypothesis. Different people have different browsing habits, preferences, and levels of comfort with technology. What might be hard for one person to find might be readily apparent to another. As such, we should take into account this diversity of user experiences before making our conclusion. In summary, to conclude whether the hypothesis \\"It's hard to find the prices on the websites\\" is true or not, it's crucial to analyze the context, gather user data, examine website design and UX principles, evaluate website technologies, and account for individual variance. A thorough and well-rounded investigation will help us determine if the premise holds or if there's another driving factor at play."},{"question":"Summarize this article in one sentence.

This trend is explained by the increase in size of the atoms within a group. The valence electron that is being removed is further from the nucleus in the case of a larger atom. The attractive force between the valence electron and the nucleus weakens as the distance between them increases and as the shielding effect increases, resulting in a lower ionization energy for the larger atoms within a group.

Metamorphosis is the developmental transformation that these animals experience as they transition from their larval stage to the adult stage. There are three main groups of amphibians, namely anurans (frogs and toads), urodeles (salamanders and newts), and gymnophionans (caecilians). Frogs and toads are the most common and widespread amphibians. During their early life, frogs and toads begin as aquatic eggs, which then hatch into tadpoles (larval stage). Tadpoles are completely aquatic, possessing gills for breathing and a tail for swimming. As these creatures grow and undergo metamorphosis, they lose their tails and gills and develop limbs and lungs. Adult frogs and toads have fully formed legs for hopping or crawling and lungs for breathing air. While adulthood sees these creatures spending more time on land, they still require water to lay their eggs and may sometimes return to an aquatic habitat for various purposes. Salamanders and newts are another group of amphibians which, like frogs and toads, undergo metamorphosis. Their life cycle is similar, with the eggs being laid in water or damp environments. After hatching, the larvae have gills and a laterally flattened tail for swimming. As they mature, salamanders and newts develop lungs or maintain cutaneous respiration (breathing through their skin). During metamorphosis, their legs grow, and they lose their gills. Adult salamanders and newts spend more time on land, hiding in damp, dark areas, but they usually return to the water to breed and lay eggs. The least known group of amphibians, caecilians, also undergo metamorphosis, but their lifestyle is slightly different. They resemble large earthworms or snakes, and their life cycle varies among species. Some caecilians lay eggs in damp environments, while others give birth to live young. Either way, their young start in a larval stage, which metamorphoses into a legless, elongated adult form. Adult caecilians are generally fossorial, meaning they tend to burrow underground or live in leaf litter, but they can also be found in aquatic environments. Each of these amphibian groups lives part of their lives in water, typically as larvae, and part on land, especially as adults. Their complex life cycles, involving metamorphosis, allow them to thrive in both aquatic and terrestrial habitats. Adaptations like the development of lungs, limbs, and different sensory systems enable them to make the critical transition from their larval stage to adulthood, as they navigate two strikingly different habitats. Consequently, they have become a unique and diverse class of animals that contribute immensely to the ecological balance in various ecosystems around the world."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Determine the topic of the question-answer pair.

For the first time in his nearly 14 years in power, the charismatic, voluble Venezuelan president has been unable to actively participate in such a campaign. The question now hovering over the vote: Will his illness help or hurt the ruling apparatus he has built almost singlehandedly and strengthen his leftist agenda? If Chavez's camp can maintain dominance in the country's 23 governorships, all but eight of which it holds, it can forge ahead with plans to solidify his \\"socialist revolution\\" by fortifying grass-roots citizen councils that are directly funded by the central government. Chavez's backers have framed the election as a referendum on his legacy, angling for the sympathy vote. For the opposition, the elections are apt to determine the fate of its leadership. The most pivotal race involves Henrique Capriles, who gave Chavez his stiffest challenge yet in the Oct. 7 presidential election by winning 44 percent of the votes. If Capriles, 40, can win re-election as governor of Miranda state, which includes parts of the capital, the grandson of a Polish Holocaust survivor would be the opposition's most likely choice in the event of a presidential election that would need to be called within 30 days if Chavez died. Even before Chavez's mortality became a factor, the Miranda race was considered crucial for the opposition with Capriles facing Elias Jaua, Chavez's former vice president. Chavez has virtually monopolized power in his person, painting much of the country red, the color of his leftist movement, as he nationalized key industries and expropriated private land. The man he designated to succeed him before flying to Cuba last Sunday for cancer surgery, Vice President Nicolas Maduro, is a political lightweight by comparison. Capriles is widely seen as having a far better chance against Maduro than against Chavez. Another key race is in Zulia state, Venezuela's most populous, where opposition Gov. Pablo Perez is running for re-election. David Smilde, a University of Georgia sociologist and analyst for the Washington Office on Latin America think tank, believes Capriles will hold on to Miranda's governorship. But he expects an unusually high turnout Sunday that he believes will favor the Chavistas, even among voters fed up with high-level corruption in the president's inner circle. Many Chavistas have been moved by the president's plight, and some pro-Chavez candidates have been calling for people to vote for them in a show of support and solidarity. \\"It is now about Chavez and his legacy,\\" said Smilde. \\"And there is a lot of sympathy.\\" Smilde said the woman who cleans his Caracas apartment complains about Chavez but, after news suggesting his cancer was incurable, \\"she was talking to me with her eyes moist about Chavez and how she's going to vote for Elias Jaua, and that kind of surprised me and I tend to think it's not isolated.\\" Gladys Espinal, who recently completed studies at the free, state-run Bolivarian University to be a schoolteacher, was also voting for Jaua. \\"The (electoral) map is going to be filled with red because that's the best gift we can give our president,\\" she said in a downtown Caracas bakery. Chavez's health has become such a factor in the vote that pocketbook issues like growing public debt and a scarcity of dollars that's pushing up the prices of foreign goods are falling to the side. In the past, the opposition has fared better in regional elections than in presidential votes because it could hone in on nuts-and-bolts issues such as the plethora of unfinished public works projects under Chavez or citizen insecurity. Smilde noted the big popularity boost that followed Chavez's re-election to another six-year term: 68 percent approval in an early November poll by the Datanalisis firm. And that's before he announced he would need a fourth surgery for a cancer first diagnosed in mid-2011. Candidates of the governing Unity Socialist Party of Venezuela have campaigned on strengthening communes, which are grass-roots citizen councils that receive their funding directly from the central government. It's a mechanism that has allowed Chavez to bypass state and municipal control and build loyalty, or dependency, opponents say, among the working poor through government goods and services they never had before. Free health care, subsidized food and access to free education have proliferated under the system. If the Chavistas gain or even hold steady Sunday, the executive branch could strengthen its hold on the grass roots, as communal councils decide, often based on loyalty, such questions as who gets a new roof, or who receives vocational training, distributing the funds directly. \\"The idea is a gigantic state that controls everything,\\" said Angel Alvarez, a political scientist at Venezuela's Central University. Chavez, 58, underwent six hours of surgery in Havana on Tuesday that government officials said involved bleeding, which was stanched, and would mean a difficult recovery. Analysts say his absence during campaigning could hurt Chavista candidates in Sunday's elections, especially relative newcomers who in the past could count on the president accompanying them on the hustings. Government officials have been doing their best to compensate. They have been holding vigils for Chavez all week, hanging banners in tribute and broadcasting elegiac footage on state TV of the former army lieutenant colonel who first gained celebrity by leading a failed 1992 coup. Capriles complained this week of the government using Chavez's failing health for political leverage, citing Jaua's statement that \\"people should vote Sunday for the president's recuperation.\\" \\"The leadership of a single person is not transferrable,\\" Capriles told reporters. Smilde, for one, expects whomever the Chavistas choose as their candidate to win any presidential election that would be called if Chavez, who is due to be inaugurated Jan. 10, died in the first four years of his six-year term. Economists, however, say a Chavista government would struggle to ward off economic turmoil in 2013, which many predict will result from a drop-off in Chavez's huge social spending last year. Opposition congressman Julio Borges, who leads the Primero Justicia party, called Sunday's elections \\"just another piece on the chessboard of a country that is going to suffer very profound changes in the coming months.\\" He predicted a split electoral map, which he called the beginning of the end of Chavismo as \\"the president is going to be disappearing from the scene little by little.\\" In addition to choosing state governors, voters will also be selecting 229 members of state legislative councils. Francisco Sanchez, a 45-year-old refrigerator salesman, said he hoped the opposition would have an edge Sunday as Chavez's one-man rule ebbs. But he fears divisions within it. \\"We must remember that the only thing that unites the opposition parties is their desire to get rid of Chavez,\\" he said.

Identify the main elements in the sentence: In this case, they are \\"worsening economic prospects,\\" \\"Ukraine,\\" \\"requested,\\" \\"macro-financial assistance,\\" and \\"the Union.\\" 2. Translate each element into Finnish: I will use my knowledge of the Finnish language to accurately translate each term. - \\"worsening economic prospects\\" = \\"heikkenevät taloudelliset näkymät\\" - \\"Ukraine\\" = \\"Ukraina\\" - \\"requested\\" = \\"pyytänyt\\" - \\"macro-financial assistance\\" = \\"makrotaloudellista tukea\\" - \\"the Union\\" = \\"unioni\\" (assuming the European Union) 3. Arrange the elements in a way that follows Finnish sentence structure: In Finnish, the subject usually comes first, followed by the verb and then the object, just like in English. However, Finnish also has postpositions instead of prepositions, meaning they follow the noun they modify. So, the sentence structure would be as follows: - Subject: \\"Ukraina\\" - Verb: \\"on pyytänyt\\" - Object: \\"makrotaloudellista tukea\\" - Additional information: \\"heikkenevät taloudelliset näkymät\\" - Postposition for \\"in the face of\\": \\"edessä\\" - Additional information: \\"unionilta\\" (union with the postposition to indicate \\"from the Union\\") 4. Combine the translated elements to form a coherent sentence in Finnish: \\"Ukraina on pyytänyt makrotaloudellista tukea heikkenevät taloudelliset näkymät edessä unionilta.\\" As a result, the Finnish translation of \\"In the face of its worsening economic prospects, Ukraine has requested macro-financial assistance from the Union.\\" is: \\"Ukraina on pyytänyt makrotaloudellista tukea heikkenevät taloudelliset näkymät edessä unionilta.\\""},{"question":"Generate a descriptive sentence about a restaurant using the following words: name = The Rice Boat, food = Fast food, priceRange = moderate, customer rating = 1 out of 5, area = riverside, familyFriendly = no, near = Express by Holiday Inn","response":"The Rice Boat, a riverside fast food restaurant with moderate pricing, has an unfortunate customer rating of 1 out of 5 and is not family-friendly, conveniently located near the Express by Holiday Inn."},{"question":"- finalteam is cincinnati reds - finalyear is 1896 - death place is ligonier , indiana - statlabel is win -- loss record earned run average strikeouts - position is pitcher - statvalue is 27-46 5.52 167 - throws is left - debutteam is brooklyn grooms - bats is left - debutdate is september 2 - death date is 3 october 1941 - birth date is 27 january 1871 - finaldate is june 23 - birth place is ligonier , indiana - debutyear is 1891 Given the details above, guess who could this information be about.

Public relations may include an organization or individual gaining exposure to their audiences using topics of public interest and news items that do not require direct payment. This differentiates it from advertising as a form of marketing communications. Public relations is the idea of creating coverage for clients for free, rather than marketing or advertising. An example of good public relations would be generating an article featuring a client, rather than paying for the client to be advertised next to the article. The aim of public relations is to inform the public, prospective customers, investors, partners, employees, and other stakeholders and ultimately persuade them to maintain a certain view about the organization, its leadership, products, or political decisions. Public relations professionals typically work for PR and marketing firms, businesses and companies, government, government agencies and public officials as PIOs and nongovernmental organizations, and nonprofit organizations. Jobs central to public relations include account coordinator, account executive, account supervisor, and media relations manager. - Clarence Hailey Long , Jr. , often known as C.H.

Geographically located in the south central part of the country, Texas shares borders with the U.S. states of Louisiana to the east, Arkansas to the northeast, Oklahoma to the north, New Mexico to the west, and the Mexican states of Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo León, and Tamaulipas to the southwest, while the Gulf of Mexico is to the southeast. - Tobacco advertising is the advertising of tobacco products or use (typically cigarette smoking) by the tobacco industry through a variety of media including sponsorship, particularly of sporting events. It is now one of the most highly regulated forms of marketing. Some or all forms of tobacco advertising are banned in many countries. - Leo Burnett (October 21, 1891 June 7, 1971) was an American advertising executive and the founder of Leo Burnett Company, Inc.. He was responsible for creating some of advertising's most well-known characters and campaigns of the 20th century, including Tony the Tiger, Charlie the Tuna, the Marlboro Man, the Maytag Repairman, United's \\"Fly the Friendly Skies,\\" Allstate's \\"Good Hands,\\" and for garnering relationships with multinational clients such as McDonald's, Hallmark and Coca-Cola. In 1999, Burnett was named by Time Magazine as one of the 100 most influential people of the 20th century. - The Old Media or Legacy Media are traditional means of communication and expression that have existed since before the advent of the new medium of the Internet. Industries that are generally considered part of the old media are broadcast and cable television, radio, movie and music studios, newspapers, magazines, books and most print publications. - A gunpowder magazine, also known as a polverista, is a magazine (building) designed to store the explosive gunpowder in wooden barrels for safety. Gunpowder, until superseded, was a universal explosive used in the military and for civil engineering: both applications required storage magazines. Most magazines were purely functional and tended to be in remote and secure locations. - A department store or magazine is a retail establishment offering a wide range of consumer goods in different product categories known as \\"departments\\". In modern major cities, the department store made a dramatic appearance in the middle of the 19th century, and permanently reshaped shopping habits, and the definition of service and luxury. Similar developments were under way in London (with Whiteleys), in Paris (\\"Le Bon Marché\\" in 1852) and in New York (with Stewart's). - Nuevo León, or New Leon, officially the Free and Sovereign State of Nuevo León, is one of the 31 states which, with Mexico City, compose the 32 Federal Entities of Mexico. It is divided into 51 municipalities and its capital city is Monterrey. - Rodeo (or ) is a competitive sport that arose out of the working practices of cattle herding in Spain, Mexico, and later Central America, the United States, Canada, South America, Australia and New Zealand. It was based on the skills required of the working vaqueros and later, cowboys, in what today is the western United States, western Canada, and northern Mexico. Today it is a sporting event that involves horses and other livestock, designed to test the skill and speed of the cowboys and cowgirls. American style professional rodeos generally comprise the following events: tie-down roping, team roping, steer wrestling, saddle bronc riding, bareback bronc riding, bull riding and barrel racing. The events are divided into two basic categories: the rough stock events and the timed events. Depending on sanctioning organization and region, other events such as breakaway roping, goat tying, or pole bending may also be a part of some rodeos. - A tradition is a belief or behavior passed down within a group or society with symbolic meaning or special significance with origins in the past. Common examples include holidays or impractical but socially meaningful clothes (like lawyers' wigs or military officers' spurs), but the idea has also been applied to social norms such as greetings. Traditions can persist and evolve for thousands of yearsthe word \\"tradition\\" itself derives from the Latin \\"tradere\\" or \\"traderer\\" literally meaning to transmit, to hand over, to give for safekeeping. While it is commonly assumed that traditions have ancient history, many traditions have been invented on purpose, whether that be political or cultural, over short periods of time. Various academic disciplines also use the word in a variety of ways. - An online magazine is a magazine published on the Internet, through bulletin board systems and other forms of public computer networks. One of the first magazines to convert from a print magazine format to being online only was the computer magazine Datamation. - A cowboy is an animal herder who tends cattle on ranches in North America, traditionally on horseback, and often performs a multitude of other ranch-related tasks. The historic American cowboy of the late 19th century arose from the \\"vaquero\\" traditions of northern Mexico and became a figure of special significance and legend. A subtype, called a wrangler, specifically tends the horses used to work cattle. In addition to ranch work, some cowboys work for or participate in rodeos. Cowgirls, first defined as such in the late 19th century, had a less-well documented historical role, but in the modern world have established the ability to work at virtually identical tasks and obtained considerable respect for their achievements. There are also cattle handlers in many other parts of the world, particularly South America and Australia, who perform work similar to the cowboy in their respective nations. - To publish is to make content available to the general public. While specific use of the term may vary among countries, it is usually applied to text, images, or other audio-visual content on any traditional medium, including paper (newspapers, magazines, catalogs, etc.). The word publication means the act of publishing, and also refers to any printed copies. - South America is a continent located in the western hemisphere, mostly in the southern hemisphere, with a relatively small portion in the northern hemisphere. It is also considered a subcontinent of the Americas, which is the model used in nations that speak Romance languages. The reference to South America instead of other regions (like Latin America or the Southern Cone) has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil). - New Mexico is a state located in the southwestern region of the United States of America. It was admitted to the union as the 47th state on January 6, 1912. It is usually considered one of the Mountain States. New Mexico is fifth by area, the 36th-most populous, and the sixth-least densely populated of the 50 United States. - A herder is a worker who lives a possibly semi-nomadic life, caring for various domestic animals, in places where these animals wander pasture lands. - Oklahoma (Cherokee: \\"Asgaya gigageyi\\" / ; or transliterated from English as (\\"òàlàhoma\\"), Pawnee: \\"Uukuhuúwa\\", Cayuga: \\"Gahnawiyogeh\\") is a state located in the South Central United States. Oklahoma is the 20th-most extensive and the 28th-most populous of the 50 United States. The state's name is derived from the Choctaw words \\"okla\\" and \\"humma\\", meaning \\"red people\\". It is also known informally by its nickname, \\"The Sooner State\\", in reference to the non-Native settlers who staked their claims on the choicest pieces of land before the official opening date, and the Indian Appropriations Act of 1889, which opened the door for white settlement in America's Indian Territory. The name was settled upon statehood, Oklahoma Territory and Indian Territory were merged and Indian was dropped from the name. On November 16, 1907, Oklahoma became the 46th state to enter the union. Its residents are known as \\"Oklahomans\\", or informally \\"Okies\\", and its capital and largest city is Oklahoma City. - Radio is the technology of using radio waves to carry information, such as sound, by systematically modulating properties of electromagnetic energy waves transmitted through space, such as their amplitude, frequency, phase, or pulse width. When radio waves strike an electrical conductor, the oscillating fields induce an alternating current in the conductor. The information in the waves can be extracted and transformed back into its original form. - The JA Ranch, jointly founded by John George Adair and Charles Goodnight, is the oldest privately owned cattle ranch in the Palo Duro Canyon section of the Texas Panhandle southeast of Amarillo. At its peak size in 1883, the JA, still run by descendants of the Adair family, encompassed some of land in six counties and a herd of 100,000 cattle. The name \\"JA\\" is derived from the initials of John Adair, a businessman from Ireland. Goodnight managed and expanded the ranch, while Adair provided the working capital. Upon Adair's death, his wife, the former Cornelia Wadsworth Ritchie, took over Adair's interest in the JA. In 1888, Goodnight left the arrangement to establish his own ranch and in time ventured into other business activities, as well. The ranch was added to the National Register of Historic Places listings in Armstrong County, Texas in 1966. - H.O.R.S.E. is a form of poker commonly played at the high-stakes tables of casinos. It consists of rounds of play cycling among: - The Marlboro Man is a figure used in tobacco advertising campaigns for Marlboro cigarettes. In the United States, where the campaign originated, it was used from 1954 to 1999. The Marlboro Man was first conceived by Leo Burnett in 1954. The images initially featured rugged men portrayed in a variety of roles but later primarily featured a rugged cowboy or cowboys, in nature with a cigarette. The advertisements were originally conceived as a way to popularize filtered cigarettes, which at the time were considered feminine. - A U.S. state is a constituent political entity of the United States of America. There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody). - Advertising is an audio or visual form of marketing communication that employs an openly sponsored, nonpersonal message to promote or sell a product, service or idea. Sponsors of advertising are often businesses who wish to promote their products or services. Advertising is differentiated from public relations in that an advertiser usually pays for and has control over the message. It is differentiated from personal selling in that the message is nonpersonal, i.e., not directed to a particular individual. Advertising is communicated through various mass media, including old media such as newspapers, magazines, Television, Radio, outdoor advertising or direct mail; or new media such as search results, blogs, websites or text messages. The actual presentation of the message in a medium is referred to as an advertisement or \\"ad\\". - A magazine is a publication, usually a periodical publication, which is printed or electronically published (sometimes referred to as an online magazine). Magazines are generally published on a regular schedule and contain a variety of content. They are generally financed by advertising, by a purchase price, by prepaid subscriptions, or a combination of the three.At its root, the word \\"magazine\\" refers to a collection or storage location. In the case of written publication, it is a collection of written articles. This explains why magazine publications share the word root with gunpowder magazines, artillery magazines, firearms magazines, and, in French, retail stores such as department stores. - Personal selling process refers to a process that occurs when a sales representative meets with a potential client for the purpose of transacting a sale. Many sales representatives rely on a sequential sales process that typically includes nine steps. Some sales representatives develop scripts for all or part of the sales process. The sales process can be used in face-to-face encounters and in telemarketing. - Coahuila, formally Coahuila de Zaragoza, officially the Free and Sovereign State of Coahuila de Zaragoza, is one of the 31 states which, along with Mexico City, compose the 32 Federal Entities of Mexico. The state is located in Northeastern Mexico on the US border. - Marketing is the study and management of exchange relationships. The American Marketing Association has defined marketing as \\"the activity, set of institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large.\\" - Tamaulipas, officially the Free and Sovereign State of Tamaulipas, is one of the 31 states which, with Mexico City, comprise the 32 Federal Entities of Mexico. It is divided into 43 municipalities and its capital city is Ciudad Victoria. The capital city was named after Guadalupe Victoria, the first President of Mexico.

Even this week, White House press secretary Jay Carney indicated that the president was unlikely to push for new gun legislation, citing persistent opposition in Congress. But Obama told the National Urban League here that he believes a lot of gun owners would agree that “AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers,” not civilians on American streets. The president called the Aurora massacre an “extraordinarily heartbreaking tragedy.” But, he added, talk of reforming gun laws after similar mass shootings has too often been “defeated by politics and by lobbying and eventually by the pull of our collective attention elsewhere.” Obama’s speech seemed sure to intensify the debate on gun control. The president’s comments were striking because he has generally been cautious on the politically potent issue of firearms — to the point that some prominent politicians and advocates had criticized him, accusing him of barely addressing gun regulations in the immediate aftermath of the massacre in Aurora. Obama’s opponent in the presidential election, Mitt Romney, weighed in earlier Wednesday, saying that he saw no need for new gun restrictions after the Colorado rampage, allegedly carried out by a failed graduate student who used an assault rifle, a Glock semiautomatic handgun and a shotgun. “I don’t happen to believe that America needs new gun laws. A lot of what this young man did was clearly against the law, but the fact that it was against the law did not prevent it from happening,” Romney told “NBC Nightly News” anchor Brian Williams in an interview taped in London as he embarked on a week-long foreign trip. Romney acknowledged that as governor of Massachusetts he supported a bill that banned assault weapons, but he said he opposed a similar measure for the rest of the country. “We can sometimes hope that just changing a law will make all bad things go away. It won’t,” Romney said. “Changing the heart of the American people may well be what’s essential to improve the lots of the American people.” Obama gave few specifics Wednesday evening about what changes, if any, he might seek on guns, although his reference to AK-47s was sure to hearten advocates of an assault-weapons ban like the one passed during the Bill Clinton presidency, which expired in 2004. The current president, however, hasn’t advocated such a measure. In his speech, Obama declared gun violence a national tragedy that reaches beyond mass shootings such as those in Aurora and in Tucson — where six people were killed and 13 wounded, including Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, in a January 2011 attack — and into the lives of innocent people struck down by criminals every day. “For every Tucson or Aurora, there is daily heartbreak,” Obama said. “Violence plagues the biggest cities, but it also plagues the smallest towns.” Obama said that laws should be better enforced and that guns should be kept out of the hands of people with mental illness. Although he reiterated his commitment to uphold gun owners’ Second Amendment rights to responsibly bear arms, he blamed Congress for inaction on what he called common-sense restrictions to keep guns out of the hands of criminals. Well-funded gun-rights organizations such as the National Rifle Association exert great power in Congress, and public-opinion polls show that a declining number of Americans feel the need for stricter gun laws. ||||| NEW ORLEANS – President Obama touched the sensitive issue of guns here on Wednesday, pivoting off last week’s Colorado movie theater shootings to call for a “consensus around violence reduction\\" in the country. With the last public event of a four-day trip that started with a visit to the Aurora, Colo., hospital where almost two dozen victims were brought after the shootings, Obama said he supports measures to conduct background checks to keep guns out of the hands of criminals, fugitives and the mentally ill. “These steps shouldn’t be controversial, they should be common sense,” he told the National Urban League conference. Obama's remarks in the Big Easy about guns were the most extensive of his term, going farther than what he said after the 2011 shooting in Tucson, where six people were killed, and former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.) and a dozen others survived gunshot wounds. White House aides have acknowledged new gun laws are still politically impossible in the current election-year climate, but Obama's comments suggest he's at least willing to talk about the issue. “I – like most Americans – believe that the Second Amendment guarantees an individual the right to bear arms,” Obama said. “I think we recognize the traditions of gun ownership passed on from generation to generation, that hunting and shooting are part of a cherished national heritage. “But I also believe that a lot of gun owners would agree that AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers and not in the hands of crooks. They belong on the battlefield of war, not on the streets of our cities,” he added. Obama bemoaned the lack of political will to tackle gun issues, noting how congressional leaders have so far shown little interest in advancing new legislation following the Colorado shooting. “When there’s an extraordinarily heartbreaking tragedy like the one we saw, there’s always an outcry immediately after for action,” Obama said. “There’s talk of new reforms. There’s talk of legislation. And too often those efforts are defeated by politics and by lobbying and eventually by the pull of our collective attention elsewhere. But what I said in the wake of Tucson is we’re going to stay on this persistently.” Obama said he'd \\"continue to work with members of both parties and with religious groups and with civic organizations to arrive at a consensus around violence reduction.\\" And Obama had a message to Americans that went beyond government. “As we convene these conversations, let’s be clear even as we debate government’s role, we have to understand that when a child opens fire on another child, there’s a hole in that child’s heart that government alone can’t fill,\\" he said. \\"It’s got to be up to us as parents, as neighbors and as teachers and as mentors to make sure our young people don’t have that void inside them. It’s up to us to spend time with them. To pay more attention to them. To show them more love and they learn to love each other and they learn to love one another and they grow up knowing what it is to walk a mile in somebody else’s shoes and to view the world in somebody else’s eyes.\\" CORRECTION: An earlier version of this post misstated a quote from the president about background checks for gun purchases. Obama said, \\"[W]e should check someone’s criminal record before they can check out a gun seller.\\" Read more about: Guns, President Obama ||||| Write a summary.","response":"President Obama talked about gun control after a very sad event where many people were hurt in Colorado because of guns.

He resented his younger brother's arrangement; during the wedding ceremony he \\"became more deathly pale than death itself, and, so they say, is unable to bear this thing, that he, the first-born, should see himself deprived of such splendid status and of the daughter of an Emperor.\\" In 1546 Paul gave Pier Luigi the duchies of Parma and Piacenza as papal fiefs, a highly political move by the pope: in doing so he gave titles and wealth to Pier and appointed a lord who was subservient and owed a debt of gratitude, guaranteeing that the duchies would remain under papal control. At the same time, Ottavio was posted to the North of Italy to support Charles. By 1546 Ottavio was 22 years old, married to Margaret of Austria and an accomplished and distinguished individual. In 1547 his father was assassinated and Ottavio claimed the dukedom of Parma and Piacenza against the express wishes of both Charles, his father-in-law, and Paul. In doing so, Ottavio acted in opposition to the pope's desire to maintain the duchies as papal fiefs, and to Charles, whom he believed responsible for the plot to assassinate Pier Luigi.Titian was a personal friend of Charles; the commissioning of the portrait was most likely intended by Paul as a signal of allegiance to the emperor. Pressure from reforming monarchs in France and Spain, coupled with a general shift of influence in France's favour, ended the Farnese hold on the papacy soon after Paul's death.

The entire family is still mourning the tragic loss of Oskar's father, Daniel, who lost his life during the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center. Despite the passing of time, Oskar cannot shake the feeling that there might be more to his father's story than what he knows. Oskar often finds solace in a hidden box of mementoes under his bed that belonged to his father. One fateful day, he discovers a mysterious letter addressed to Daniel alongside an old photograph of a group of people. The writer, named Richard, leaves cryptic instructions - a clue revealing the existence of a safety deposit box in Manhattan. Oskar becomes determined to unearth the truth behind his father's death and understand the significance of the discovered items. Act Two Against his mother's wishes, Oskar secretly sets out on a journey to New York City to unlock the secrets of Daniel's life. His investigation leads him to the safety deposit box, which contains a series of letters, photographs, and other keepsakes. It quickly becomes apparent that Daniel, a financial analyst, was not the person he claimed to be.

In doing so, he also learns the story of the people in the photograph, who, along with Daniel, risked everything to protect their country. As he delves deeper into his father's past, Oskar realizes that his father's death was worthy of honor and respect, regardless of the intriguing circumstances surrounding it.

Widely considered as one of the most influential bands in the genre and important in the transition of death metal from its thrash metal roots, they were one of the first bands to incorporate guttural vocals, up-tempo blast beats, multiple tempo changes and dark atmosphere. They have been described as one of \\"the most influential and emulated bands in death metal\\", alongside Obituary and Cannibal Corpse, and have been cited as an influence by many later bands. They were also the first death metal band to experience mainstream success in connection with being signed to Giant Records in 1992, heavy rotation of their music videos on MTV, and having the music video for the song \\"God of Emptiness\\" shown on an episode of Beavis and Butt-head. Context: Morbid Angel was formed in 1983 in Tampa, Florida by guitarist Trey Azagthoth and drummer/vocalist Mike Browning. The band made their debut in 1987 on the New Renaissance Records record label. They recorded their debut album, Abominations of Desolation, in 1986, but the band was unsatisfied with the final product and it remained unreleased until 1991, printing 10,000 copies. In the early stages of their career the band developed a reputation for \\"gruesome stage antics.\\" In 1986, David Vincent joined the band, replacing Michael Manson and Sterling von Scarborough as vocalist and bassist respectively. Fellow Terrorizer drummer Pete Sandoval soon followed. Their first studio album, Altars of Madness, was released in 1989, and is regarded by many as one of the most important death metal albums of all time. It is also considered the first true death metal album. Music journalist Jason Birchmeier writes that: Few albums struck a chord within the ears and minds of the late-'80s underground metal scene like Morbid Angel's Altars of Madness did at the end of the decade, setting a new precedent for metal bands to reach. With the arguable exception of Chuck Schuldiner's Death, never before had a heavy metal band carried their lightning-fast guitar riffs and equally spellbinding guitar solos into such horrific territory. Venom and Slayer redefined the extent to which a metal band could align itself with all things evil during the beginning of the decade, but Morbid Angel made these two groups sound like children's music compared to the Florida-based group's assaulting death metal sounds and their blasphemous lyrics. Question: Who were the members of the band? Answer:","response":"Morbid Angel is a music group formed in Tampa, Florida in 1983. They play a type of music called death metal. The people who started the band were a guitarist named Trey Azagthoth, a singer and bass player named Dallas Ward, and a drummer named Mike Browning. Later, more people joined the group, such as David Vincent, who became the new singer and bass player, and Pete Sandoval, who became the new drummer. Their music is known for being very fast, loud, and scary, and many people who like death metal think they are one of the best bands ever."},{"question":"Question: Read the bio below and try to give details on ahmad vaezi 's: - region - school tradition - main interests - name - color - era - birth place Bio: ahmad vaezi -lrb- born 1963 ; -rrb- is an iranian philosopher , scholar and clergyman . he is now the chief of islamic propagation office of qom .

Article: Spring is a wonderful season to celebrate rebirth and new life. The long, cold winter is over. The weather is warmer and sunnier. The trees again have leaves and the flowers are blooming. The season represents hope, joy and beauty. At this time, many people think of this classical music piece -- Spring, which shows happiness. Italian composer Antonio Vivaldi wrote it in the seventeen hundred. However, not all songs about spring are happy. This song written and sung by K.D. Lang is about dreaming of spring in cold dark places. She recorded I Dream of Spring in 2008. Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein wrote It Might as Well Be Spring for the movie State Fair in 1945. Frank Sinatra sings it. It is a feeling of restlessness or excitement brought on by the coming of spring. Richard Rodgers also wrote Spring Is Here, this time with Lorenz Hart. Ella Fitzgerald sings this song about feeling lonely during this season. Frank Loesser wrote the sad song, Spring Will be a Little Late This Year. Why has the season been delayed? Because the singer's lover has left her. Sarah Vaughn released her version of the song in 1953. By now you may be thinking, \\"Enough with the sad songs, already!\\" Ok, then how about a cowboy song? Gene Autry was one of America's most famous singing cowboys. He recorded When It's Springtime in the Rockies in 1937. And finally, we'll leave you with a sunny song called Up Jumped Spring. Freddie Hubbard wrote this jazz song in 1977 and Billy Taylor Trio performs it. Question: According to the passage, which of the following is TRUE? Options: A: Most songs about spring are written by Italian composers. B: K. C: Sarah Vaughn sang the song Up Jumped Spring first. D: Lang. The answer is:","response":"D: Lang. The passage provides information about various songs related to spring. It mentions that not all songs about spring are happy, and K.D. Lang wrote and sang a song about dreaming of spring in cold dark places. The song is titled \\"I Dream of Spring\\" and was recorded in 2008. Although other composers and singers are mentioned in the passage, none of the other options provided in the question can be considered true based on the information given in the article. Option A is not true, as the passage does not state that most songs about spring are written by Italian composers. It only mentions that Antonio Vivaldi, who is an Italian composer, wrote a classical music piece called \\"Spring\\" in the seventeen hundred. Option B is not a valid answer since it is not even a complete option, and no information regarding the option is provided in the passage. Option C is also not true, as the passage states that Freddie Hubbard wrote the jazz song \\"Up Jumped Spring\\" in 1977, and the Billy Taylor Trio performs it. It does not mention Sarah Vaughn singing this song first, but rather that she released her version of the song \\"Spring Will Be a Little Late This Year\\" in 1953. Therefore, based on the information in the passage, the only true statement is option D: Lang, referring to K.D. Lang and her song \\"I Dream of Spring\\" from 2008."},{"question":"Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative (see options at the end)? bad animation Pick from: A). negative; B). positive;","response":"The sentiment of the following sentence, \\"bad animation,\\" can be analyzed as: A).

Thus, the sentiment expressed by the sentence leans negative, making Option A the most accurate choice."},{"question":"Answer the following question, but give the rationale first. Would Franz Ferdinand have survived with armadillo armor?","response":"Rationale: To answer this question, we need to consider several factors, including the type and strength of armadillo armor, the circumstances of Franz Ferdinand's assassination, and the nature of the injuries that led to his death. Answer: It is unlikely that Franz Ferdinand would have survived with armadillo armor. Here's why: 1. The strength of armadillo armor: While the armadillo's armor is made of bony plates called osteoderms, which provide some level of protection against predators, it is unlikely to be strong enough or cover enough surface area to protect against more powerful projectiles such as bullets. Even modern bulletproof vests utilize advanced materials like Kevlar to provide effective protection against bullets, so it is doubtful that armadillo armor would offer enough protection in this context. 2. The circumstances of Franz Ferdinand's assassination: Archduke Franz Ferdinand was assassinated in 1914 by Gavrilo Princip, a member of a nationalist group that sought to liberate their nation from Austro-Hungarian rule. Princip fired two shots at the car carrying Franz Ferdinand and his wife Sophie, striking both of them. As it was a close-range shooting, the bullets had more than enough force to penetrate the armadillo armor, had Franz Ferdinand been wearing it. 3. The nature of the injuries that led to his death: Franz Ferdinand was struck in the neck, while his wife Sophie was hit in the abdomen. Both of them bled to death from their wounds. Even if armadillo armor provided some level of protection, it's unlikely that it would have covered these vulnerable areas of the body sufficiently to prevent fatal injury. In conclusion, while armadillo armor might offer some protection against certain types of attacks, it would not have been sufficient to save Archduke Franz Ferdinand from the assassination attempt and the specific injuries sustained during the incident."},{"question":"Answer the question...who's got the most followers on twitter??","response":"As of my last update, the person with the most followers on Twitter is former United States President Barack Obama.

Article: The days are getting shorter and shorter, and temperatures are dropping. Winter is coming and it is easy for people to catch flu. Many people have started taking vitamin C pills as a precautionary way. But a research has shown that vitamin C pills do not provide as much protection as they think. They are even not as good as other ways, like often washing your hands. Some German scientists have given people information and a test on the subject helping to stop incorrect ways. Whether it is caused by cold or flu , a runny nose and sore throat are signs of catching a cold. Many people overestimate the advantages of vitamin C and other pills. For years it was believed that taking vitamin C pills not only provided protection against colds but also against cancers, helping people to live longer. But the result of the research showed disagreement on these beliefs . The result has now come out on the website wwww.informedhealthonline.org. \\"Some pills may not help people live longer. Some pills may even lead to earlier death,\\" says Professor Peter Sawicki. Scientists also say that the best way to get vitamins is through food instead of having vitamin pills. That is to say, we disagree with the way of taking vitamin C pills. There are many simple but useful ways to lower the risk of catching a cold. These include often washing your hands with normal soap and water and not touching your face with your hands. People who have already had a cold can stop it from spreading by throwing away tissues at once after using them and not shaking hands with other people.

The doctor discovered that Tim had very high levels of cholesterol, while Jim had normal levels. Which brother experiences a decrease in blood flow? Hint: Cholesterol has been implicated in heart disease for decades. Atherosclerosis is a disorder of the arteries in which cholesterol and other materials are deposited on the interior of the arterial wall. These deposits lead to the formation of plaques that can restrict or even block the flow of blood through these blood vessels (see Figure below ). A decrease in the flow of blood can lead to high blood pressure and a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle.

He was employed as an organist there, but he occasionally composed cantatas, mostly for special occasions. The cantatas were based mainly on biblical texts and hymns, such as Aus der Tiefen rufe ich, Herr, zu dir, BWV 131 (a psalm setting), and the Easter chorale cantata Christ lag in Todes Banden, BWV 4. Bach was next appointed organist and chamber musician in Weimar on 25 June 1708 at the court of the co-reigning dukes in Saxe-Weimar, Wilhelm Ernst and his nephew Ernst August. He initially concentrated on the organ, composing major works for the instrument, including the Orgelbüchlein, the Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565, and the Prelude and Fugue in E major, BWV 566. He was promoted to Konzertmeister on 2 March 1714, an honour that entailed performing a church cantata monthly in the Schlosskirche. The first cantatas he composed in the new position were Himmelskönig, sei willkommen, BWV 182, for Palm Sunday, Weinen, Klagen, Sorgen, Zagen, BWV 12 for Jubilate Sunday, and Erschallet, ihr Lieder, BWV 172, for Pentecost. Mostly inspired by texts by the court poet, Salomo Franck, they contain recitatives and arias. When Johann Samuel Drese, the Kapellmeister (director of music), died in 1716, Bach hoped in vain to become his successor. Bach looked for a better position and found it as Kapellmeister at the court of Leopold, Prince of Anhalt-Köthen. However, the duke in Weimar did not dismiss him and arrested him for disobedience. He was released on 2 December 1717.In Köthen, Bach found an employer who was an enthusiastic musician himself. The court was Calvinist, therefore Bach's work from this period was mostly secular, including the orchestral suites, the cello suites, the sonatas and partitas for solo violin, and the Brandenburg Concertos. He composed secular cantatas for the court for occasions such as New Year's Day and the prince's birthday, including Die Zeit, die Tag und Jahre macht, BWV... Guess a valid title for it!

He will row, bike, walk and climb the world without help from any motors at all. His plan includes climbing the tallest peak on six of the continents along the way. For the first part of his trip, he bicycled 5,546 miles from Seattle, Washington to Mount McKinley in Alaska and back, walked 67 miles to base camp and climbed 20,320 feet to McKinley's peak.

Stream-of-consciousness explanation: When trying to evaluate whether we can discern the precise contents of a book just by looking at its cover and spine, we must consider several factors. Firstly, the cover may provide some clues about the book's subject matter, like the title, the author, and perhaps even a brief summary or review. However, it is unlikely that we could glean every nuance or piece of information within the book. Moreover, the same title could correspond to multiple books, and authors could write books under pseudonyms. The spine of the book offers even less insight, typically featuring only the author's last name and a shortened title. Additionally, the meaning of a title could be both figurative and literal, which makes determining the book's contents and themes a near impossibility. Thus, when analyzing the task of assessing a book's specifics solely based on its cover and spine, the answer is: it is not possible to tell."},{"question":"Please add spaces between words: AshortintroductiontothelifeandworkofFriedrichvonSchiller","response":"1.

The voice on the other end belongs to Charley, a voice he hadn't heard in over twenty years. Charley is an adventure-seeker, always on the move and someone who had disappeared from George's life unexpectedly after their college days. Charley tells George of a mysterious artifact he's discovered during his travels, in a remote temple situated in the Himalayas. The artifact, according to Charley, is connected to an ancient prophecy that is said to bring about universal harmony when fulfilled. But, Charley also confides that he is being hunted by a powerful and relentless secret society - The Hand of Orion - who seeks the artifact to exploit its powers for their nefarious aims. Startled and intrigued, George, though hesitant, agrees to help Charley protect the artifact. His quiet life quickly flips into a whirlwind of conspiracies, threats, and a race against time as they hop across continents, decipher cryptic clues, and try to stay a step ahead of The Hand of Orion. Throughout their adrenaline-filled journey, George discovers there is more to life than his books and piano, and learns about courage, friendship, and survival.

In the South Seas, a volcano explodes, eventually causing North Pole icebergs to shift. Below the melting polar ice caps, a 200-foot-long praying mantis, trapped in the ice for millions of years, begins to stir. Soon after, the military personnel at Red Eagle One, a military station in northern Canada that monitors information gathered from the Distant Early Warning Line, realize that the men at one of their outposts are not responding to calls. Commanding officer Col. Joe Parkman flies there to investigate, and finds the post destroyed, its men gone, and giant slashes left in the snow outside. When a radar blip is sighted, Joe sends his pilots out to investigate, but their intended target disappears. Soon an Air Force plane is attacked by the deadly mantis. He searches the wreckage, and this time, in addition to the huge slashes, finds a five-foot-long pointed object in the snow. He takes it to General Mark Ford at the Continental Air Defense in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Ford gathers top scientists, including Professor Anton Gunther, to examine the object, but when they cannot identify it, Gunther recommends calling in Dr. Nedrick Jackson, a paleontologist at the Museum of Natural History. When Ned gets the call from Ford, he is helping museum magazine editor Marge Blaine plan her next issue, and dodges her questions as she begs him for a big scoop. Later, after examining the object, Ned recognizes it as a torn-off spur from an insect's leg, and soon guesses, from evidence that the creature ate human flesh, that it must be a gigantic praying mantis. Meanwhile, in the Arctic, the people of an Eskimo village spot the mantis in the sky, and although they hurry to their boats to escape, it swoops down and kills several men.

It dramatises the damaging physical and psychological effects of political ambition on those who seek power for its own sake. Of all the plays that Shakespeare wrote during the reign of James I, who was patron of Shakespeare's acting company, \\"Macbeth\\" most clearly reflects the playwright's relationship with his sovereign.

His father was a first cousin of King Priam of Troy (both being grandsons of Ilus, founder of Troy), making Aeneas a second cousin to Priam's children (such as Hector and Paris). He is a character in Greek mythology and is mentioned in Homer's \\"Iliad\\". Aeneas receives full treatment in Roman mythology, most extensively in Virgil's \\"Aeneid,\\" where he is an ancestor of Romulus and Remus. He became the first true hero of Rome. Snorri Sturlason identifies him with the Norse Æsir Vidarr. - Publius Vergilius Maro (traditional dates October 15, 70 BC September 21, 19 BC), usually called Virgil or Vergil in English, was an ancient Roman poet of the Augustan period. He is known for three acclaimed works of Latin literature, the \\"Eclogues\\" (or \\"Bucolics\\"), the \\"Georgics\\", and the epic \\"Aeneid\\". A number of minor poems, collected in the \\"Appendix Vergiliana\\", are sometimes attributed to him. - Alba Longa (occasionally written Albalonga in Italian sources) was an ancient city of Latium in central Italy, southeast of Rome, in the Alban Hills. Founder and head of the Latin League, it was destroyed by Rome around the middle of the 7th century BC. In legend, Romulus and Remus, founders of Rome, had come from the royal dynasty of Alba Longa, which in Virgil's Aeneid had been the bloodline of Aeneas, a son of Venus. - Rome is a city and special \\"comune\\" (named \\"Roma Capitale\\") in Italy. Rome is the capital of Italy and of the Lazio region. With 2,870,336 residents in , it is also the country's largest and most populated \\"comune\\" and fourth-most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits. The Metropolitan City of Rome has a population of 4.3 million residents. The city is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of Tiber river. The Vatican City is an independent country geographically located within the city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city: for this reason Rome has been often defined as capital of two states. - Procas or Proca (said to have reigned 817-794 BC) was one of the Latin kings of Alba Longa in the mythic tradition of the founding of Rome. He was the father of Amulius and Numitor and the great grandfather of Romulus and Remus, Rome's legendary founders.. - Aventinus ( said to have reigned 854 - 817 BC ) , one of the mythical kings of Alba Longa , who was buried on the Aventine Hill later named after him . He is said to have reigned thirty - seven years , and to have been succeeded by Procas , the father of Amulius . Servius , in analysing Virgil 's Aeneid , Book vii. 656 , speaks of an Aventinus , a king of the aboriginal inhabitants of Rome , who was killed and buried on the hill afterwards called the Aventine Hill . This king may be conflated with this one or with a separate figure in the Aeneid : \`\` The Aventine is a hill in the city of Rome . It is accepted that it derives its name from birds ( aves ) which , rising from the Tiber , nested there ( as we read in the eighth book of a suitable home for the nests of ill - omened birds ) . This is because of a king of the Aboriginal Italians , Aventinus by name , who was both killed and buried there - just as the Alban king Aventinus was , he who was succeeded by Procas . Varro , however , states that amongst the Roman people , the Sabines accepted this mountain when it was offered them by Romulus , and called it the Aventine after the Aventus river in its area . It is therefore accepted that these different opinions came later , for in the beginning it was called Aventinus after either the birds or the Aboriginal King : from which it is accepted that the son of Hercules mentioned here took his name from that of the hill , not vice versa . '' - In Roman mythology, King Numitor of Alba Longa, was the son of Procas, descendant of Aeneas the Trojan, and father of Rhea Silvia and Lausus - In Roman mythology, Amulius was king of Alba Longa who ordered the death of his infant, twin grandnephews Romulus, the eventual founder and king of Rome, and Remus. He was deposed and killed by them after they survived and grew to adulthood. - The King of Rome was the chief magistrate of the Roman Kingdom. According to legend, the first king of Rome was Romulus, who founded the city in 753 BC upon the Palatine Hill. Seven legendary kings are said to have ruled Rome until 509 BC, when the last king was overthrown. These kings ruled for an average of 35 years. What object entity has the relation of 'position held' with the subject 'aventinus of alba longa'? Choices: - 15 - 3 - 4 - founder - king - latin kings of alba longa - poet - prince Answer:","response":"king"},{"question":"Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2] The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3] Now, I have a new situation: Dan decided to preserve some fruit and roots to see how long they last before they spoil. He also bought other fruit that he plans to eat fresh. He candied plums, pears, ginger and quince, and he ate fresh apples, oranges and mango. Answer this question please: Which fruit have a lower sugar content candied plums or fresh oranges? A:","response":"Candied fruit processes result in fruits that have significantly higher sugar content than fresh fruits. When fruits are candied, they are soaked in sugar syrup which penetrates the fruit, replacing moisture and preserving them. The sugar content in the fruit increases substantially during this process. In this particular situation, Dan has candied plums and he also has fresh oranges. Comparing the sugar content of candied plums and fresh oranges, it is safe to say that fresh oranges have a lower sugar content than candied plums. Fresh oranges have an average natural sugar content of around 9-12 grams per 100 grams, which mainly comes from fructose, glucose, and sucrose. On the other hand, candied plums, due to the addition of sugar syrup, can have a sugar content of around 60-80 grams or even higher per 100 grams, depending on the extent of candying and the amount of sugar used. This is much greater than the sugar content found in fresh oranges. In conclusion, fresh oranges have a lower sugar content than candied plums due to the significant increase in sugar content during the candying process."},{"question":"Please answer the following question by reasoning step-by-step.

This replaced the Constitution of the Irish Free State and called the state Ireland, or Éire in Irish. While Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution defined the national territory to be the whole island, they also confined the state's jurisdiction to the area that had been the Irish Free State. The former Irish Free State government had abolished the Office of Governor-General in December 1936. Although the constitution established the office of President of Ireland, the question over whether Ireland was a republic remained open. Diplomats were accredited to the king, but the president exercised all internal functions of a head of state. For instance, the President gave assent to new laws with his own authority, without reference to King George VI who was only an \\"organ\\", that was provided for by statute law. Ireland remained neutral during World War II, a period it described as the Emergency. Ireland's link with the Commonwealth was terminated with the passage of the Republic of Ireland Act 1948, which came into force on 18 April 1949 and declared that the state was a republic. At the time, a declaration of a republic terminated Commonwealth membership. This rule was changed 10 days after Ireland declared itself a republic, with the London Declaration of 28 April 1949. Ireland did not reapply when the rules were altered to permit republics to join. Later, the Crown of Ireland Act was repealed in Ireland by the Statute Law Revision Act 1962.

Papa Chibou suggests to them that they can still stay in touch, without disobeying her father's directive not to speak with each other, by placing secret personal messages in the pockets of Napoleon's uniform.

In various situations, this phrase can be associated with favorable outcomes, distressing events, or merely neutral incidents. To elucidate further, let's analyze these three scenarios - positive, negative, and neutral. 1. Positive interpretation: In some instances, \\"ending surprise\\" can be seen as a pleasant and delightful event. For instance, consider a movie or novel that concludes with an unexpected twist, leading to the resolution of the story in a creative and satisfying manner. This ending surprise would be deemed a positive aspect of the narrative, as it provides entertainment, intrigue, and thought-provocation for the audience or reader. Another example could be a birthday party where the host arranges a surprise for the guests at the end, such as a special performance or a grand display of fireworks. In this case, the phrase \\"ending surprise\\" would denote a positive experience for the attendees. 2. Negative interpretation: Conversely, \\"ending surprise\\" may imply an adverse situation or unexpected disappointment. For example, a sports match where a team who seemed to have a solid lead throughout the game is defeated in the final moments due to an unforeseen turn of events. In this context, the phrase reflects a negative outcome for the fans of the losing team. Additionally, a surprise ending in a relationship, where a seemingly stable partnership dissolves abruptly due to a betrayal or a shock revelation, can also be considered negative. 3. Neutral interpretation: There are scenarios in which \\"ending surprise\\" does not necessarily align with either positive or negative outcomes and merely signifies an unexpected turn of events. For instance, if the ending surprise in a story relates to a character's backstory or the revelation of a hidden connection between two characters, the audience's reaction may depend on their personal opinions and emotional investment in the narrative. In summary, the interpretation of \\"ending surprise\\" as positive or negative varies depending on the given context, as well as the subjective experiences and perspectives of those involved. There is no inherent positivity or negativity attached to the phrase; instead, its meaning arises from the situational context in which it appears."},{"question":"A bipartisan group of senators is scrambling to reach a fresh compromise they hope can propel a proposal to overhaul U.S. immigration policy toward passage in that chamber and provide momentum heading into the Republican-controlled House. A deal remained elusive, however, on Tuesday evening and it was uncertain whether the stark differences that have stalled immigration reform for years in Congress could be bridged with time running out on debate. Raising new questions on whether any immigration bill will get through Congress this year, House Speaker John Boehner said earlier in the day that he did not see any way of bringing a bill on that issue to the floor that relied on Democrats to pass. Under enormous pressure from conservatives opposed to the bipartisan Senate bill, Boehner has until now sidestepped questions about how he would move forward. \\"I don't see any way of bringing an immigration bill to the floor that doesn't have majority support of Republicans,\\" he told reporters following a closed-door GOP conference meeting where a source said he made similar comments to reassure members. Efforts to push forward immigration reform are emotionally charged as the issue has huge political stakes for both sides. President Barack Obama and Democrats want to fulfill a promise to Hispanic Americans, the nation's fastest-growing demographic, to address the limbo of immigrants living illegally in the country and maintain their overall support. Republican strategists are concerned about the GOP's long term viability in national elections if it does not win over the important voting bloc, which went strongly for Obama in November. The Senate bill negotiated by a bipartisan group of senators dubbed the \\"Gang of Eight\\" proposes a path to citizenship for some 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States. But conservatives consider any measure offering a path to citizenship tantamount to amnesty for those who entered the country illegally. In addition, concerns about whether the bill will tighten security along the nation's porous borders, as asserted by backers of the plan, may make it difficult for conservatives to support it -- especially those up for re-election next year. Debate began last week and senators have been sorting through amendments. Sen. Marco Rubio, a key player in the Senate debate, senses that significant progress has been made in trying to bridge the gap. \\"I think we're on the right track,\\" the Florida Republican said. During a series of afternoon votes, members of the \\"Gang of Eight\\" huddled on the floor and separately with other key senators -- twisting arms, cajoling, convincing. In a rare scene, a large group of Republicans anxiously worked the room seeking compromises. The \\"Gang of Eight\\" and Sen. Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republican, and Sen. John Hoeven, a North Dakota Republican, are attempting to broker a compromise. As of now, it would tighten border security requirements primarily by having Congress dictate exactly how secure the border must be before immigrants in the United States illegally can begin the process of gaining citizenship. By shifting that responsibility to Congress and away from the executive branch, negotiators hope to pick up support from Republican senators who are reluctant to leave that determination to the administration. 5 things to know about immigration reform. The emerging deal also would include several other Republican priorities related to entry and exit biometrics, the E-Verify workplace verification program, and rules that would prevent immigrants from getting public benefits. \\"Corker and I are trying to get enough of these together so you can get a meaningful bipartisan group on the bill,\\" explained Hoeven, who said he hoped to introduce the proposal as early as Wednesday. A package of amendments is \\"something that creates a momentum around the building that people are seeking,\\" said Corker. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said time was critical as he threatened to end debate on the bill soon in order to keep a promise to finish the bill by the end of the month. Love or country: Immigration law means hard choices for gay couples. 5 things to know about immigration reform. A bipartisan group of seven House members -- three Republicans and four Democrats -- is still finalizing its own comprehensive immigration bill that mirrors many of the provisions in the Senate bill, including eventual citizenship for undocumented workers. A CNN/ORC poll released Tuesday shows a small majority of Americans support the approach in the Senate bill. The poll shows that 51% say they support a bill that would attempt to increase border security and create a pathway to citizenship for many undocumented immigrants, with 45% saying they are opposed to such a measure. CNN Poll: Big generational divide in immigration battle. What are the important parts of this article?","response":"1. A bipartisan group of senators is working to reach a compromise on a proposal to overhaul U.S. immigration policy. 2. House Speaker John Boehner expressed doubt about passing an immigration bill without majority support from Republicans. 3. The Senate bill, proposed by the \\"Gang of Eight\\", aims to provide a path to citizenship for approximately 11 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S. 4. Conservatives are concerned about offering a path to citizenship, which they view as amnesty for those who entered the country illegally, and question the bill's ability to tighten border security. 5. Senators Bob Corker and John Hoeven are attempting to broker a compromise by shifting the responsibility of determining border security from the executive branch to Congress, as well as incorporating other Republican priorities related to entry and exit biometrics, the E-Verify workplace verification program, and rules preventing immigrants from receiving public benefits."},{"question":"In conventional travel you move towards the destination.

He finishes up his video watching for the day by watching a video on gorillas that's twice as long as the previous two videos combined. How many minutes does Brian spend watching animal videos? Give me reasons, before answering the question","response":"Let's break down the information given and work through it step by step: 1. Brian watches a 4-minute cat video. 2. He then watches a dog video that is twice as long as the cat video. So, the dog video is 4 minutes * 2 = 8 minutes long. 3. Finally, he watches a gorilla video that is twice as long as the previous two videos combined. The first two videos together are 4 minutes (cat) + 8 minutes (dog) = 12 minutes. So, the gorilla video is 12 minutes * 2 = 24 minutes long. Now, to find the total time Brian spends watching the videos, we simply sum up the durations of all three videos: 4 minutes (cat) + 8 minutes (dog) + 24 minutes (gorilla) = 36 minutes Therefore, Brian spends a total of 36 minutes watching animal videos."},{"question":"Creatively image a question and justification for this answer: Sentence B","response":"Question: Which sentence between A or B best describes the unique features of an ancient castle that has withstood the wrath of time and remains strong till this day?

It was negotiated at the Washington Naval Conference, held in Washington, D.C., from November 1921 to February 1922, and it was signed by the governments of the United Kingdom, the United States, Japan, France, and Italy. It limited the construction of battleships, battlecruisers and aircraft carriers by the signatories. The numbers of other categories of warships, including cruisers, destroyers and submarines, were not limited by the treaty, but those ships were limited to 10,000 tons displacement. - Justice was a pre-dreadnought battleship of the Liberté class built by the French Navy . She had three sister ships : Liberté , Vérité , and Démocratie . Justice was laid down in April 1903 , launched in October 1904 , and completed in February 1908 , over a year after the revolutionary British battleship HMS Dreadnought made ships like Justice obsolete . She was armed with a main battery of four 305 mm ( 12.0 in ) guns , compared to the ten guns of the same caliber mounted on Dreadnought . After her commissioning , Justice was assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet . In September 1909 , she traveled to the United States for the Hudson - Fulton Celebration . At the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 , she was assigned to the 2nd Division of the 2nd Squadron of the Mediterranean Fleet . She covered troop convoys from North Africa to France in the first days of the war , and spent the rest based at Corfu and Mudros without seeing any action . After the war ended , she participated in the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War , though a mutiny in the French fleet in April 1919 led to the fleet 's withdrawal . Justice was sold for scrapping in 1922 . - The French colonial empire constituted the overseas colonies, protectorates and mandate territories that came under French rule from the 16th century onward. A distinction is generally made between the \\"first colonial empire\\", that existed until 1814, by which time most of it had been lost, and the \\"second colonial empire\\", which began with the conquest of Algiers in 1830. The second empire came to an end after the loss of bitter wars in Vietnam (1955) and Algeria (1962), and peaceful decolonization elsewhere after 1960. - World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War, or the Great War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved. - The French Navy (\\"national navy\\"), informally , is the maritime arm of the French Armed Forces. Tracing its roots back to 1624 it is one of the world's oldest naval forces and historically played a key part in establishing the French colonial empire. Since the early foundings, its roles have been defined as maintaining intelligence, protecting populations, preventing crises, intervening wherever necessary to reestablish peace, and dissuading any threats against vital French interests. The Marine nationale consists of four branches: the \\"Force d'Action Navale\\", the \\"Forces Sous-marines\\", the \\"Aéronavale\\" and the \\"Fusiliers Marins\\" (including Commandos Marine). As a blue-water navy the Marine nationale operates a wide range of fighting vessels, including a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, nuclear-powered submarines, frigates, patrol boats and support ships. The French Navy does not use prefixes of the names of its ships (such as the Royal Navy uses HMS, for instance). Foreign commentators sometimes use the prefixes \\"FS\\" (for \\"French Ship\\") or FNS (for \\"French Navy Ship\\"); these are not official, however. - The San Jacinto Battleground State Historic Site includes the location of the Battle of San Jacinto, and the USS \\"Texas\\". It is located off the Houston Ship Channel in unincorporated Harris County, Texas near the city of Houston. The site was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1960. - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. - The dreadnought was the predominant type of battleship in the early 20th century. The first of its kind, the Royal Navy's , made such a strong impression on people's minds when launched in 1906 that similar battleships built subsequently were referred to generically as \\"dreadnoughts\\", and earlier battleships became known as \\"pre-dreadnoughts\\". \\"Dreadnought\\"s design had two revolutionary features: an \\"all-big-gun\\" armament scheme, with more heavy-calibre guns than previous ships, and steam turbine propulsion. As dreadnoughts became a symbol of national power, the arrival of these new warships was a crucial catalyst in the intensifying naval arms race between the United Kingdom and Germany. With the launch of a single ship, \\"Dreadnought\\", the scales of naval power were reset overnight. As a result, dreadnought races sprang up around the world, including in South America, during the lead up to World War I. Successive designs increased rapidly in size and made use of improvements in armament, armour, and propulsion throughout the dreadnought era. Within five years, new battleships had outclassed \\"Dreadnought\\". These more powerful vessels were known as \\"super-dreadnoughts.\\" Most of the original dreadnoughts were scrapped after the end of World War I under the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty, but many of the newer super-dreadnoughts continued to be used throughout World War II. The only surviving dreadnought is , located near the San Jacinto Battleground State Historic Site. What entity does 'french battleship justice' has the relation 'service retirement' with?","response":"The French battleship Justice has the relation 'service retirement' with the French Navy. After serving during World War I and participating in the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War, Justice was eventually sold for scrapping in 1922, which marked the end of her service with the French Navy."},{"question":"Creatively image a question and justification for this answer: no","response":"Question: Do penguins use umbrellas when it rains?

However, despite its grandiose ambitions, the film ultimately falls flat, leaving viewers with a sour taste and a sinking feeling where deep engagement should have been. The story is centered on the tumultuous love affair between the leads, played by Matthew Callaghan and Julia Carrington. While both actors are no strangers to portraying complex emotions on screen, in this film, the duo's innate talent is unfortunately not allowed to flourish. It is evident that both are weighed down by a script riddled with cliches and a lack of originality in the portrayal of their respective characters. Instead of being guided to present a novel take on the classic star-crossed lovers trope, they end up delivering by-the-numbers performances, seldom evoking genuine empathy from the audience. Furthermore, the myriad of supporting characters proves to be an additional detriment to the film. As their exaggerated quirks and one-dimensional personalities take up significant screen time, the narrative is derailed from its core premise. This could have been forgiven if the characters had a meaningful impact on the story or added some semblance of nuance, but they only serve as little more than plot devices or sources of cheap laughs, taking away from the gravity of the film's central theme – the destructive power of forbidden passion. Following suit, the pacing of the film is all over the place. Major plot twists are revealed in a hurried manner that detracts from the significance they hold. Subsequent attempts at building tension, which should have been leading to a cathartic climax, are constantly interrupted by jarring flashbacks that only serve to confuse viewers rather than offering a deeper understanding of the characters' motivations. It is apparent that the director, Sarah Winston, struggled with achieving a cohesive vision for this project. The Pernicious Picture can't seem to decide whether it wants to be a psychological drama or a light-hearted romance. By trying to walk this shaky tightrope, the film fails to truly commit to either genre, thus failing to leave a lasting impression in either. It also seems that Mrs. Winston's lack of experience reflects on the film's technical aspects, such as haphazard editing and mismatched soundtrack choices that simply add to the cacophony. Visually, The Pernicious Picture is a mixed bag. While the costume design is intricate and historically accurate, the cinematography feels contrived, overusing camera tricks and filters that only contribute to the artificiality of the world the film is trying to build. In an era where warm, subdued hues and naturalistic lighting are celebrated, this film's garish color palette and overly polished frames clash with the intended emotional depth. In conclusion, The Pernicious Picture is a classic case of missed potential. Not only does it squander the talents of its lead actors, but it also suffers from a disjointed plot, caricature supporting characters, and distracting visual choices. As a romantic drama, it fails to evoke any real passion or provide meaningful insights into the human condition. The Pernicious Picture is a relentless pursuit down the road of mediocrity, proving to be an arduous watch for even the most hardened fans of the genre."},{"question":"Sentence: name = The Rice Boat, eatType = restaurant, priceRange = less than £20, customer rating = low, area = city centre, familyFriendly = yes, near = Express by Holiday Inn Can you represent the content in this sentence in data form?","response":"Sure, little one!

Answer the following question: Who is Dylan ?","response":"Dylan, from the description provided, appears to be a young child or an infant who is interacting with his toys. His behavior of getting excited by his toys, tracking the movements of his bear, and crying at a point indicate that he is either a toddler or an infant still developing his motor skills, cognitive abilities, and emotional responses. During this playtime, the primary caregiver or parent has taken an active role in engaging with Dylan and his toys, such as making the bear and puppy walk on the canopy of his pack and play. The caregiver's interaction with Dylan helps further develop his cognitive and physical skills by encouraging him to observe and learn from the caregiver's actions. Co-play between the caregiver and child is essential for the child's growth and development. Additionally, the caregiver is attentive to Dylan's emotions, aiming to calm him down by making the toys do entertaining things when he starts crying. This not only shows Dylan's emotional dependency on the caregiver but also demonstrates the caregiver's ability to provide emotional support and comfort to the child during playtime.

In 1851 or 1853 they bought 5,000 acres (2,000 ha), including what is now Lake Ganoga and some of the park, as their own hunting preserve, and built a stone house on the lake shore by 1852 or 1855. The stone house served as their lodge and as a tavern; it was known as \\"Ricketts Folly\\" for its isolated location in the wilderness. Clemuel died in 1858 and Elijah bought his share of the land and house. The Ricketts family was not aware of the glens and their waterfalls until about 1865, when they were discovered by two guests from the stone house who went fishing and wandered down Kitchen Creek.Elijah's son Robert Bruce Ricketts, for whom the park is named, joined the Union Army as a private at the outbreak of the American Civil War and rose through the ranks to become a colonel in the artillery. After the war, R. Bruce Ricketts returned to Pennsylvania and in 1869 began purchasing the land around the lake from his father. By 1873 he controlled or owned 66,000 acres (27,000 ha), and eventually this grew to more than 80,000 acres (32,000 ha), including the glens and waterfalls and most of the park.While the stone house had served as a home and inn since its construction, in 1872 R. Bruce Ricketts built a three-story wooden addition north of the house. The addition used lumber from a sawmill Ricketts and his partners operated from 1872 to 1875, about 0.5 miles (0.8 km) southeast of the stone house. The North Mountain House hotel opened in 1873; Ricketts' brother Frank, for whom a park waterfall is named, managed it from then until 1898. Many of the hotel's guests were Ricketts' friends and relations, who arrived after school let out in June and stayed all summer until school resumed in September. In 1876 and 1877, Ricketts ran the first summer school in the United States at his house and hotel; one of the teachers was Joseph Rothrock,... answer the following question: What is the name of the hotel in which, combined with his house, Ricketts ran the first summer school in the United States?

Teacher: Let's think:","response":"Step 1: Analyze the premise The premise states that there is a group of Asian people talking in a public business. This gives us information about the location (public business) and the activity (talking). Step 2: Analyze the hypothesis The hypothesis suggests that these people are waiting for the bus. This is a specific situation that might happen in public places. Step 3: Determine whether the hypothesis is entailed by the premise To determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, we need to analyze whether the information provided in the premise directly leads to the conclusion in the hypothesis. In this case, the premise only tells us that the group of people is talking at a public business. Step 4: Verify the connection between the premise and the hypothesis While it is possible that the group of people is waiting for the bus, the premise doesn't provide any direct evidence that supports this hypothesis. The people could be engaging in various other activities, for example, just having a casual conversation, discussing a business issue, or waiting for a friend.

A \\"criminal incident information\\" report released Wednesday by Christopher Newport University in Newport News, Virginia, said the alleged incident involving Jesse Matthew took place on September 7, 2003. Matthew quit the school's football team five days later and left the school in mid-October. The university said federal student record privacy laws limited the amount of information it could provide publicly. \\"The University is fully cooperating with law enforcement agencies,\\" a statement said. \\"The success of the criminal investigation is paramount at this time.\\" Where is Hannah Graham? Last person with Graham. Investigators believe Matthew, 32, was the last person with Graham, who was last seen September 13. He has been charged with abduction with the intent to defile in the case, and he is being held in jail in isolation, according to Charlottesville police. Authorities are offering a 100,000 reward for information leading to the safe return of the 18-year-old, a second-year student at the university. More than 3,000 tips to Graham's possible whereabouts have poured in, Carter Johnson, a police spokesman, said. As part of the search effort, police have asked owners of large parcels of property in surrounding counties to search their land and report back. Hannah Graham disappearance: What we know. Aerial drone search. The search for Graham now includes the use of an aerial drone -- the first time, according to authorities, one has been used in the search for a missing person in the state. The addition of the drone to the search effort comes more than two weeks after Graham disappeared from an area of Charlottesville known as the Downtown Mall. The drone has a high-quality camera, and it will \\"look closer\\" at objects of interest, said John Coggin, chief engineer of the Mid-Atlantic Aviation Partnership and one of the members of the team operating the drone. The drone is expected to help with the search of vast tracts of land in the area. As the drone worked from overhead Wednesday, more than 50 law enforcement personnel participated in the search in Fairfax County. Authorities check unsolved cases for ties to Hannah Graham disappearance. 'New forensic link' The search of Wednesday also included U.S. 29, outside of Charlottesville, where another woman reportedly disappeared. The search follows reports that Virginia State Police found a \\"new forensic link\\" between the Graham case and the death of Morgan Harrington, a 20-year-old Virginia Tech student, who went missing after attending a Metallica concert in Charlottesville in October 2009. Harrington was last seen hitchhiking along U.S. 29, and her remains were found on a farm months later. Almost from the start, speculation was raised about the possibility of a connection between Graham's disappearance and Harrington's death. No arrests have been made in Harrington's case, and the cause of her death is still under investigation. CNN's Chelsea J. Carter, Jason Morris, Ed Lavandera, Jean Casarez and journalist Betsy Kaufman contributed to this report. Write highlights for this article.","response":"1.

[III] They have been cooped up all day while I work and want to enjoy the sun .. [IV] They do n't like being outdoors all the time and want to lay inside .. Answer the following question: Why do the cats want to go out to the sunny patio so badly ?","response":"The cats want to go out to the sunny patio so badly for a variety of reasons, as indicated by the description provided. It appears that option [III] They have been cooped up all day while I work and want to enjoy the sun, is the most accurate explanation for their behavior. Here are some of the reasons why they might be eager to spend time outside on the patio: 1. Natural instinct: Cats, as descendants of wild felines, have an inherent desire to explore and roam in their natural environment. Outdoor access allows them to fulfill these natural needs and engage in various activities such as hunting, climbing, and territorial marking. 2. Sunshine and warmth: Cats are known for their love of warmth and sunlight. Their bodies are designed to absorb and retain heat from the sun, making sunbathing an enjoyable and cozy experience. The warmth of the patio's sun-soaked concrete is likely a pleasurable sensation to them. 3. Physical and mental stimulation: Being outdoors offers cats a wealth of visual, auditory, and olfactory stimulation. Engaging in activities such as stalking and chasing chipmunks or moths not only provides physical exercise but also helps keep their minds sharp and instincts honed. This mental and physical stimulation can contribute to their overall well-being and happiness. 4. Territory expansion: Cats are territorial creatures, and by exploring the outdoors, they can expand their territory, whether it's just around the patio or further out into the garden. This territorial claim helps them feel secure in their environment, and they may feel the urge to patrol or defend their domain. 5. Social interaction: Although cats are often considered solitary animals, they do engage in social interactions with other cats or animals when given the opportunity. By going outside, they can encounter other cats or wildlife to interact with, curiously observe, or even just play with. 6. Entertainment: The outdoors can be a never-ending source of entertainment for cats. From watching birds fly to stalking squirrels, the opportunities for excitement and play are limitless. This keeps them entertained and helps break up the monotony they might experience when confined indoors all day. In conclusion, the cats' desire to be outside on the sunny patio is a combination of natural instinct, love for warmth and sunshine, physical and mental stimulation, territorial behavior, social interaction, and entertainment. As a responsible cat owner, it's crucial to provide them with opportunities to experience these outdoor joys while ensuring their safety and well-being."},{"question":"Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: Wicked Games is featured on the soundtrack for the film directed by whom?","response":"Wicked Games, a song by Chris Isaak, is featured on the soundtrack for the 1990 film \\"Wild at Heart\\" directed by David Lynch."},{"question":"Name the year.

Dr. Hastings Banda becomes Malawi's First President: Dr. Hastings Kamuzu Banda became the first president of Malawi in 1966 after Malawi gained independence from British rule in 1964. Earlier, Banda returned to Malawi in 1958 after living and working in the United Kingdom and the United States. He led the Nyasaland African Congress (NAC), which later became the Malawi Congress Party (MCP). After Malawi's independence, Dr. Banda implemented strong autocratic policies during his rule, which lasted for almost three decades until 1994 when he was voted out of office. He passed away in 1997 at the age of 99. 3. Nelson's Pillar in Dublin Blown Up: Nelson's Pillar, a towering granite structure in O'Connell Street, Dublin, was erected in 1809 to honor Vice-Admiral Horatio Nelson, a famed British naval hero. On March 8, 1966, the pillar was severely damaged by an explosion, which was suspected to have been carried out by the Irish Republican Army (IRA) as an act of defiance against British rule in Northern Ireland. The remnants of the monument were later demolished by the Irish Army, and the site now houses the more contemporary Spire of Dublin, erected in 2003. In conclusion, the year 1966 was marked by several significant events: the passing of Walt Disney, the iconic American animator and entrepreneur; the rise to power of Dr. Hastings Banda as the first president of Malawi, and the destruction of Nelson's Pillar in Dublin. Each of these events left a lasting impact on the world, shaping history in different ways."},{"question":"china has inaugurated a voluntary organ donor program , hoping to overhaul a system that now harvests the vast majority of its organs from black-market sellers and executed prisoners and leaves millions of ailing people without hope of getting a transplant .

As I sat parked at the old service station, I pulled out the maps and tried to do a little backtracking. It didn't take me long to figure out where I had made the wrong turn. I had tried following my memory instead of Luna's directions and wound up about eighty miles off course. My gas tank was pushing 'E' but fortunately the service station was open. When I stepped out of my Jeep, I could feel the soles of my boots melt on the asphalt. The heat coming off the cracked and pitted cement peeled off in waves that rolled out in every endless direction. The barren mountains in the distance looked unstable, like I was looking at them through a window pane slicked with olive oil. I slogged my way over to the gas pump and wrapped my shirt around the handle to keep my skin from burning against the desert-baked metal. The heat was so great I worried the fumes would ignite. A dirty round man stood in the shadowy doorway of the ramshackle service station and stared at me while he rubbed his hands inside an oily red rag. The oval name-patch stitched to his coveralls was loose at one end and curled like a leaf in the heat. His name was Jack. I topped off the tank and then walked over to him. \\"You work here?\\" I knew it was a stupid question the second it left my mouth. He and I were the only living things for fifty miles in any direction. Who the hell else would be working here? \\"Who the hell else would be working here?\\" he said. I shrugged my shoulders and pulled out my wallet. Jack wobbled inside behind a glass counter filled with everything from belt buckles to oil funnels. \\"That your momma's car?\\" he asked.

Article: Life-long learning is the concept that \\"It's never too soon or too late for learning.\\" -- a philosophy that has taken root in a larger number of different organizations. Life-long learning is an attitude -- learners believe that one can and should be open to new ideas, decisions, skills or behaviors. Life-long learning throws the well-known rule \\"You can't teach an old dog new tricks\\" out of the door. Life-long learning provides the general public with learning opportunities at all ages and in different ways: at work, at home and through leisure activities, not just through formal channels such as school and higher education. Life-long education is often achieved through distance learning or e-learning, continuing education, home schooling, etc. It also includes training programs for those who want to improve their qualifications, bring their skills up to date or retrain for a new line of work. In later life, especially in retirement, continued learning takes various forms, crossing traditional academic limits. One of the reasons why life-long education has become so important is the rapid progress of modern science and technology. Although the period of primary, secondary and university education is increased, the knowledge and skills gained there are usually not _ for a professional career spanning three or four decades. Question: What is the main idea behind life-long education? - To force people to keep in learning new skills throughout their working life. - To provide teachers with extra income. - To allow people to have chances to receive education throughout their life. - To prevent students from learning at school.

Articulate: This term is generally associated with clear and effective communication, especially in speech. It doesn't directly relate to hands or manual labor. 2. Soft: Individuals who do not engage in manual labor often have softer hands, as their skin is not calloused or roughened from manual work. This is a relevant descriptor. 3. Sign language: While this involves hand movements, it is unrelated to whether someone does manual labor or not. It's a method of communication and not an accurate description of the hands themselves. 4. Graceful: This term refers to movement that is elegant and pleasing to the eye. While it can be used to describe hand movements, it does not directly relate to manual labor. 5. Cup water: This is an action that can be performed by anyone, regardless of their occupation or experience in manual labor. It doesn't specifically describe the hands of someone who doesn't do manual labor. In conclusion, the best answer is \\"soft\\" because it directly relates to the hands of someone who doesn't do manual labor.

Does iOS really work better than Android? Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","response":"In 2016, both Android and iOS had their unique advantages and made significant progress, so comparing them requires looking at various aspects and use-cases. First, let's discuss the two statements in the questions to understand the context: 1. Is Android better than iOS in 2016? 2. Does iOS really work better than Android? These two questions are similar but not exactly the same. While the first question focuses on a direct comparison of Android and iOS in 2016, the second question implies that iOS is widely considered to work better than Android and asks about the validity of this belief. To make a comparison between the two, we can look at the following aspects: 1. Customization: One of the biggest strengths of Android in 2016 was its customization capabilities. Users could personalize their devices by adding widgets, changing app icons, and installing custom launchers. This freedom made Android more appealing to those who wanted a tailored user experience. On the other hand, iOS had limited customization options, keeping the interface more homogeneous. 2. App Quality: Generally, iOS had a reputation for delivering high-quality applications. Since it had fewer device models and strict guidelines, developers could optimize their apps for a specific resolution and hardware configurations, resulting in smoother performance. Android, being open source, had a wider range of devices with varying resolutions and hardware capabilities, making it a challenge for developers to ensure a consistent user experience. 3. Security: iOS is well-known for its strong security measures due to Apple's closed ecosystem and strict app review process. This made it less prone to malware and viruses, especially in comparison to Android. Android, with its open nature, was more likely to encounter security breaches. However, Google made significant efforts to improve the security of Android devices with features like Google Play Protect and Android Nougat's granular app permission controls. 4. Hardware & Price Range: In terms of hardware, Android devices offered a broader choice of manufacturers and price ranges, catering to different budgets. This flexibility allowed customers to choose a device that met their specific needs and preferences. In contrast, Apple's iOS devices were limited to iPhones, which were typically more expensive and had fewer hardware options. 5. Software Updates: Apple prided itself on providing timely software updates to iOS devices, including those that were relatively old. This was a significant advantage over Android, where the number of devices and manufacturers often led to delayed updates or older devices being left with outdated software. 6. Ecosystem Integration: Apple's ecosystem of devices, like Macs, iPads, and Apple Watches, all worked seamlessly with iPhones, making them more appealing to users who were looking to have a unified experience. In comparison, Android was not as closely integrated with other devices, although there were exceptions with certain manufacturers. In conclusion, deciding whether Android or iOS was better in 2016 depends on an individual's preferences and needs. Android offered greater customization and a wider choice of devices at different price points, while iOS was known for its higher quality apps, increased security, prompt software updates, and ecosystem integration. The two questions provided are inquiring about similar information, but the second question seeks to examine if iOS genuinely had a performance advantage over Android."},{"question":"In spite of the fact that people brag about being able to multi-task, the reality is that the human mind can only focus on one thing at a time. When you pay attention to one thing the mind automatically blocks out all other stimuli. Multi-tasking is simply jumping from focal point to focal point; but, you are still only focusing on one thing at a time. The payoff from trying to multi-task is not worth the toll it takes on the individual making the effort. David Meyer, PhD, a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan states the following: Doing several tasks simultaneously may seem like the height of efficiency – and it would be, if a person had more than one brain. In the real world, multitasking actually wastes time and reduces work quality. Many studies have shown that multitasking slows down the mind and makes it less effective. Dividing and distracting the mind causes rapid mental course changes, the inability to effectively focus, and creates stress – which increases with every additional task that is added to the mix. Imagine a dog who is trying to chase three different balls thrown in different directions. He runs two steps in one direction, three steps in another, and one step in the third. He ends up running in circles. The mind is the same. The more time you spend changing mental direction the less time you have to actually focus on a single task. The more directions or mental tasks you add, the less effective you become. But . . . that is not the whole story. Another facet of multi-tasking is worrying about events, projects, or situations that have nothing to do with where your focus should be at the moment. Worrying about what has happened, or may happen changes nothing. All it does is drain your mental and emotional resources, making you less effective at the task at hand. Let your subconscious handle it. The subconscious mind is one of the most powerful tools that we possess. It is unnecessary to make an effort to keep everything at the “top-of-mind” because everything that happens... David Meyer probably believes that A. Multitasking is hard B. not enough information C. It is better to multitask D. People are too busy Answer:","response":"A. Multitasking is hard"},{"question":"Question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Persona begins with images of camera equipment and projectors lighting up and projecting dozens of brief cinematic glimpses, including a crucifixion, an erect penis, a tarantula spider, clips from a comedic silent-film reel first seen in Bergman's Prison (depicting a man trapped in a room, being chased by Death and Satan), and the slaughter of a lamb. The last, and longest, glimpse features a boy who wakes up in a hospital next to several corpses, reading Mikhail Lermontov's A Hero of Our Time (\\"VÃ¥r Tids HjÃ¤lte\\" in the film), and caressing a blurry, transient image that shifts between Elisabet and/or Alma's faces. A young nurse, Alma (portrayed by Bibi Andersson), is summoned by the head doctor and charged with the care of stage actress Elisabet Vogler (portrayed by Liv Ullmann), who has, despite the lack of any diagnosed impairment, become mute. The hospital administrator (portrayed by Margaretha Krook) offers her own seaside cottage as a place for Alma to nurse Elisabet back to health. Though Elisabet is nearly catatonic when the film begins, she does react with extreme panic upon seeing a Vietnamese Buddhist monk's self-immolation on television, and laughs mockingly at Alma's radio soap opera. As the two women leave the hospital together, Alma reads aloud a letter Elisabet's husband has sent her, which includes a photograph of her young son. Together in the administrator's cottage, Elisabet begins to relax, though she remains completely silent and non-responsive. Alma speaks constantly to break the silence, at first about books she is reading and trivial matters, then increasingly about her own anxieties and relationship with her fiancÃ©, Karl-Henrik, who scolds her for lacking ambition â \\"though not with my career, I suppose in some greater way.\\" Alma constantly compares herself to Elisabet and begins to grow attached to her.

The question and answer pair are described below.","response":"Question: Can a man be eating lunch and poisoning an alleyway at the same time? Answer: No, a man cannot be eating lunch and poisoning an alleyway at the same time. Rationale: The reasoning behind this answer is as follows: 1. The action of eating lunch involves consuming food, which requires the individual's attention and focus. This is a distinct activity that typically occurs in a particular environment, such as at a table or a dedicated eating area. 2. Poisoning an alleyway refers to the act of intentionally introducing harmful substances into the environment with the aim to cause harm or damage. This action requires a different set of skills and attention, as well as being in a specific location, namely an alleyway. 3. These two actions (eating lunch and poisoning an alleyway) conflict with each other in terms of focus, attention, and location. It is highly unlikely for a person to be able to multitask between these two distinct actions effectively at the exact same moment in time. 4. Additionally, engaging in both activities at the same time would involve carrying food and poison simultaneously, which poses a significant risk of accidental contamination and danger to the individual themselves. In conclusion, a man cannot be eating lunch and poisoning an alleyway at the same time, due to the conflicting requirements for attention, focus, location, and safety."},{"question":"Question: Who is the hit man's boss? Answer the above question based on the context below: In contemporary wartime San Francisco, chemist and blackmailer Albert Baker is killed by hit man Philip Raven, who recovers a stolen chemical formula. Raven is double-crossed by his employer, Willard Gates who pays him with marked bills and reports them to the Los Angeles Police Department as stolen from his company, Nitro Chemical Corporation of Los Angeles. Raven learns of the setup and decides to get revenge. LAPD detective lieutenant Michael Crane, who is vacationing in San Francisco to visit his girlfriend, nightclub singer Ellen Graham, is immediately assigned the case. He goes after Raven, but the assassin eludes him. Meanwhile, Gates hires Ellen to work in his LA nightclub after an audition where she sings and performs magic tricks. Then she is taken to a clandestine meeting with Senator Burnett, where she learns that Gates and Nitro Chemical are under investigation as suspected traitors, and is recruited to spy on Gates. Unknown to each other, she and Gates board a train for Los Angeles, followed by Raven. By chance, Raven and Ellen sit next to each other.

We have the equation: -15172*h - 29694 + 1850334 = 0, and we want to find out what \\"h\\" is. First, let's simplify the equation by adding 29694 on both sides: -15172*h + 1850334 + 29694 = 29694 + 0 Now, let's add 1850334 and 29694: -15172*h + 1880028 = 0 Next, we want to get \\"h\\" by itself, so we will divide both sides by -15172: h = (1880028) / (-15172) After doing the division, we get: h = -123.83580515 So the value of \\"h\\" is approximately -123.84 (rounded to two decimal places).

I'm in school and due to financial reasons I'll be moving back in with my parents. My sister is also there and she has an 11 month old. I've been talking with my mom for the last month about how to make this work and we've 90% settled out the details. My sister called me today and I've just found out that she has an entire different view on it. She has ground rules because of the baby, but I completely disagree with many of them which I'll talk about below. Some of them, I get and am supportive of. &amp;#x200B; This is what she's proposing: &amp;#x200B; -&gt; My medicine in a lock box in my room -&gt; I must keep my room baby friendly (no choking hazards, etc) -&gt; My cat needs to be locked in the basement at all times -&gt; I have to keep my dishes in my room or in one single area (food allergies) -&gt; I have a list of her pet peeves that I can't do (No left overs in the fridge, etc) -&gt; I can't bring most of my furniture, only the small things bc there is 'no space' &amp;#x200B; Now, from this it's implied that her and baby will have free reign of my room. I want to keep my cat in my bedroom at first until it becomes accustomed to the people/house and then most likely let it stay in the basement with me when I'm down there because it's a much larger space. I 100% understand that she's not comfortable with a cat near her child, so I get not letting it roam the house, but why can't it be in my bedroom? I mentioned putting a lock on my door to keep baby out and safe but she said that baby's always find a way into rooms and that my cat will be let out. I asked why people will be entering my room, and she said that she wants somewhere she can go to be alone when I'm not there. She's upset because she shares a room with the baby and doesn't have her own space. I told her that despite that I still need and want my own space. She also said that she wants help with the baby and implied that I would be able to help watch him anytime she wanted some freedom. IMO, this isn't ok. I'm fine with babysitting and helping out but I have my own life and can't be watching a baby whenever she wants a break. I also told her that I'll be bring my furniture will put the 2-3 non bedroom things in the basement. She said that there's no room and that I should throw it out. I'll be moving out in a year or so and can't afford to re-buy my furniture. AITA for demanding that my sister and her baby stay out of my room when I'm not there?

Troxell is also a link to Brennan's past, having known him in the war when Brennan was a bomber pilot. A flashback to B-17 missions over Germany reveal Brennan to be a top-notch pilot. Another connection to his past is his former flame, Jo Holloway (Eleanor Parker), now Willis' secretary. In order to prove the capabilities of the new JA-3, capable of speeds up to 1,400Â mph (2,300Â km/h), Brennan convinces Willis that a record-breaking flight from Nome, Alaska to Washington D.C., via the North Pole, will impress the government. At the same time, Troxell tries to develop a safer version of the revolutionary aircraft, the JA-4, equipped with an escape pod, but dies during a test flight. The earlier record flight is a success with Brennan earning a 30,000 paycheck, enough to marry Jo. Then he learns that Troxell has been killed.

Carl Gustav Jung (; German: [karl jUNG]; 26 July 1875 - 6 June 1961) was a Swiss psychiatrist and psychoanalyst who founded analytical psychology. His work has been influential not only in psychiatry but also in anthropology, archaeology, literature, philosophy, and religious studies. As a notable research scientist based at the famous Burgholzli hospital, under Eugen Bleuler, he came to the attention of the Viennese founder of psychoanalysis, Sigmund Freud. Carl Gustav Jung was born in Kesswil, in the Swiss canton of Thurgau, on 26 July 1875 as the second and first surviving son of Paul Achilles Jung (1842-1896) and Emilie Preiswerk (1848-1923). Their first child, born in 1873, was a boy named Paul who survived only a few days. Being the youngest son of a noted Basel physician of German descent, also called Karl Gustav Jung (1794-1864), whose hopes of achieving a fortune never materialised, Paul Jung did not progress beyond the status of an impoverished rural pastor in the Swiss Reformed Church; his wife had also grown up in a large family, whose Swiss roots went back five centuries. Emilie was the youngest child of a distinguished Basel churchman and academic, Samuel Preiswerk (1799-1871), and his second wife. Preiswerk was antistes, the title given to the head of the Reformed clergy in the city, as well as a Hebraist, author and editor, who taught Paul Jung as his professor of Hebrew at Basel University. When Jung was six months old, his father was appointed to a more prosperous parish in Laufen, but the tension between his parents was growing. Emilie Jung was an eccentric and depressed woman; she spent considerable time in her bedroom where she said that spirits visited her at night. Although she was normal during the day, Jung recalled that at night his mother became strange and mysterious. He reported that one night he saw a faintly luminous and indefinite figure coming from her room with a head detached from the neck and floating in the air in front of the body. Jung had a better relationship with his father. Jung's mother left Laufen for several months of hospitalization near Basel for an unknown physical ailment. His father took the boy to be cared for by Emilie Jung's unmarried sister in Basel, but he was later brought back to his father's residence. Emilie Jung's continuing bouts of absence and often depressed mood influenced her son's attitude towards women--one of \\"innate unreliability\\". This was a view that he later called the \\"handicap I started off with\\". He believed it contributed to his sometimes patriarchal views of women, but these were common in the society of his time. After three years of living in Laufen, Paul Jung requested a transfer; he was called to Kleinhuningen, next to Basel in 1879. The relocation brought Emilie Jung closer into contact with her family and lifted her melancholy. When he was nine years old, Jung's sister Johanna Gertrud (1884-1935) was born. Known in the family as \\"Trudi\\", she later became a secretary to her brother.

The Emirates team, under the leadership of British skipper Walker, emerged victorious. This victory marks an especially notable achievement for Walker, who not only participated in his third round-the-world race but also became the first British skipper ever to overall win the trophy. The article mentions the performance of all the teams involved in this world race. Specifically, Team Alvimedica won the final leg of the race, leaving only one team out of the seven-strong fleet without a stage win. The winning team, Abu Dhabi Ocean Racing, performed remarkable throughout the competition. They secured top-three podium spots in all but two legs and had victory in two of them. Additionally, Team SCA, an all-female crew, made history by winning a leg of the race for the first time in 25 years, though they eventually finished seventh overall. The Swedish boat, led by Briton Sam Davies, was the only team entirely composed of females in the race, a representation that wasn't seen for the past 10 years. The oceanic race, sailed using a single-design Volvo Ocean 65 boat, was fraught with numerous challenges and unforeseen circumstances. The teams visited 11 ports across every continent and faced a series of dramatic incidents such as shipwrecks and extreme weather. For example, Team Vestas Wind had a near-fatal accident when they crashed onto a remote coral reef surrounded by shark-infested waters during the second leg from Cape Town to Abu Dhabi. Consequently, they missed five legs as their boat had to be reconstructed. Moreover, the race organizers had to establish an ice exclusion zone after spotting an enormous iceberg, and the teams also experienced severe storms leading to mast breakages. Despite the tumultuous journey, Walker reflects on the race positively, emphasizing the sense of camaraderie and deep bonds formed during such enduring shared experiences. He applauds every crew member's achievement and relishes the uniqueness of their trans-global sailing navigation.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more cells will be attacked happens, how will it affect LESS cells being damaged. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","response":"The process you described involves the following steps: 1. Bacteria enters the body. 2. Bacteria enter the bloodstream. 3. Cells in the body are attacked by bacteria. 4. Cells are killed by bacteria. 5. Different kinds of sickness are formed as a result of cell damage. Now, let's consider the perturbation hypothesis: if more cells are attacked by bacteria, how does it affect the possibility of fewer cells being damaged? If more cells are attacked, it is likely that more cells will potentially be damaged. This is because the bacteria attacking the cells are responsible for causing damage, usually through the release of toxins or through direct invasion and destruction of the cells. However, several factors can influence whether this increased attack on cells would necessarily lead to more cells being damaged: 1. The immune system response: The body's immune system may respond more robustly to the increased bacterial attack, neutralizing a larger number of bacteria before they can cause damage to the cells. 2. The virulence of the bacteria: Some bacteria are more aggressive in their ability to attack and damage cells. If less virulent bacteria are responsible for the increased attack, the resulting damage may not increase proportionally to the number of cells attacked. 3. The resilience of the cells: Some cells may be better equipped to resist or recover from bacterial attack. For example, they may have protective mechanisms or be more capable of repairing damage. Although these factors may alleviate the potential increase in cell damage due to more cells being attacked, it is still reasonable to assume that, in general, increased bacterial attack on cells will lead to a higher likelihood of cell damage. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis that suggests more cells being attacked would result in less cell damage is likely not accurate in most cases. More cells being attacked by bacteria will typically lead to more cells being damaged, potentially leading to more severe or widespread illness. However, factors such as the immune system response, bacterial virulence, and cell resilience can influence the extent of the damage caused."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Six years ago, Ann graduated from college with a degree in Art.

If it's un-answerable, please output \\"No answer\\". Question: What's the name of Hiram's great-grandson? Movie plot title: Tremors 4: The Legend Begins Movie plot: In 1889, the inhabitants of Rejection (later Perfection) are completely dependent on the income from a nearby silver mine. One day, ahot spring causes Graboid eggs to hatch, resulting in the death of 17 miners. Hiram Gummer, great-grandfather of Burt Gummer (Michael Gross) and the mine's owner, arrives in town to fix the problem. After Graboids attack his camp one night, he is shocked by their presence. One of his companions, Juan, kills one with a pickax, and the pair escapes. Inexperienced and not fond with firearms, Hiram calls for a gunfighter, Black Hand Kelly (Billy Drago). Hiram and Kelly do not get along well, though Kelly succeeds in conveying to Hiram some of his attitude towards firearms and life in general. Eventually, Kelly is eaten alive but not before discovering that a total of four Graboids have hatched. Hiram decides to abandon Rejection and leave the townsfolk to their fate. However, they force him to give them the silver mine, threatening to alert potential buyers to the danger if he sells it out from under them. In Carson City, Hiram hears a telegram revealing that the fully-grown Graboids have made it through the pass and are headed for the town. Changing his mind, he buys weapons, heads back to Rejection to lead a last stand against the Graboids, and helps the town ready itself. After two Graboids are killed, the third and final one adapts and avoids all of the traps. Hiram tricks it into coming to the surface and then attaches it by the tail to the wheel of a steam traction engine. The Graboid is reeled in and slammed against the wheel with such force that it is explosively decapitated on impact. With the creatures dead, the town decides to keep them secret out of fear that no one would settle in the area if their existence was known, and use the proceeds from the mine to pay for their belongings. Hiram settles in Rejection, building his home in the same place that his great-grandson Burt's would one day be. He is also given a Colt 1865 Gatling gun and begins target practice, enjoying it.

A National Medal of Arts recipient (2007), he was composer-in-residence of the Los Angeles Master Chorale (1994–2001) and has been a professor of composition at the University of Southern California Thornton School of Music for more than 40 years. Hypothesis: Morten Johannes Lauridsen felt honored to receive the National Medal of Arts. Available choices: [-] Yes. [-] It's impossible to say. [-] No.","response":"It's impossible to say conclusively whether Morten Johannes Lauridsen felt honored to receive the National Medal of Arts based solely on the context provided. However, we can infer that receiving such a prestigious award is a significant recognition and generally brings a sense of honor and accomplishment to the recipient. The National Medal of Arts is a high honor in the United States, awarded by the President to individuals or groups who have made extraordinary contributions to the creation, growth, and support of the arts in the nation. Given Lauridsen's extensive accomplishments as a composer, his contributions to the Los Angeles Master Chorale, and his work as a professor of composition at the University of Southern California Thornton School of Music for more than 40 years, it is reasonable to assume that receiving the National Medal of Arts would be a meaningful and validating recognition of his life's work. While the context does not explicitly mention Lauridsen's personal feelings or reactions upon receiving the award, it does establish that he has dedicated a significant portion of his life to the pursuit of excellence in music and arts education. Such a commitment to the field implies that recognition at the highest level would likely be important and appreciated. However, to definitively conclude that Morten Johannes Lauridsen felt honored, it would be necessary to have additional information or personal accounts from the composer himself on his perception and feelings about the award."},{"question":"Generate a short summary this sentence: manchester united striker louis saha was called into france 's squad for next week 's friendly against belgium on thursday .","response":"Manchester United striker Louis Saha joins France's squad for upcoming friendly against Belgium next week."},{"question":"Given the question: What is the final step of the following process: - Body temperature rises - The brain tells blood vessels to dilate - The sweat glands become active - Moisture is released from the pores - The moisture evaporates The answer is:","response":"The final step of this process is \\"the moisture evaporates.\\" This is the culmination of the body's efforts to regulate and cool down its temperature. Let's break down the steps and justify each one: 1. Body temperature rises: This is the initial condition. An increase in body temperature can be caused by various factors such as physical activity, hot weather, or fever. 2. The brain tells blood vessels to dilate: When the body detects an increased temperature, the hypothalamus (a part of the brain) sends a signal to the blood vessels to dilate (widen) and increase blood flow to the skin's surface. This step helps in dissipating heat through the increased surface area of blood vessels and loss of heat through radiation. 3. The sweat glands become active: In response to the increased temperature, the sweat glands become active and start producing sweat. Sweat glands are located all over the body and are responsible for regulating body temperature by producing sweat. 4. Moisture is released from the pores: Once the sweat glands become active, they produce sweat (composed mainly of water, salt, and some minerals), which is then released onto the skin's surface through the pores. This step aids in cooling the body down as the moisture on the skin absorbs the heat from the body. 5. The moisture evaporates: This is the final step of the process. The moisture present on the skin evaporates, taking away the heat absorbed from the body with it. This evaporation of sweat is an endothermic process, meaning it requires heat, and thus, as heat is utilized for the evaporation, it helps to cool the body down."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Read the passage below and choose the right answer to the following question (choices are would increase or would decrease ): Faster-moving water has more energy.

Ask for private Snaps. Move the conversation off Snapchat. Article:","response":"Title: Enhancing Your Snapchat Experience: Responding to Snaps, Requesting Private Snaps, and Moving Conversations Off-platform Introduction Snapchat is an immensely popular social media platform known for its ephemeral and interactive nature. Users can easily share moments of their lives with friends, engage with creative content, and explore new avenues of communication. However, it can sometimes become challenging to fully engage with people you've connected with on the platform. In this article, we will discuss three techniques to enhance your Snapchat experience: responding to snaps, asking for private snaps, and moving the conversation off Snapchat. 1. Responding to Snaps Receiving snaps from your friends and acquaintances is a fundamental part of the Snapchat experience. Responding to their snaps is crucial in various ways: A. Strengthening Connections: By actively engaging with others' content, you show them that you're invested in their experiences and interested in what they have to share. This helps in fostering closeness and maintaining a strong bond with your Snapchat contacts. B. Encouraging Reciprocity: Responding to snaps demonstrates your enthusiasm for the platform, which may encourage others to share more snaps with you. People are more likely to share content with those who are responsive and engaging. C. Enhancing Visibility: Responding to snaps can keep you on top of your friends' minds, as your conversation threads remain active. This can help you gain more visibility among your contacts and increase your chances of receiving future snaps from them. 2. Asking for Private Snaps While Snapchat is primarily designed for sharing content with multiple people simultaneously, it also enables users to send private snaps directly to specific individuals. By asking for private snaps, you can strengthen your connections and create a more personalized experience. A. Building Trust: Requesting private snaps can signify trust, as you are allowing the sender to share something exclusively with you. This can help deepen connections and make your relationship feel more genuine. B. Personalized Content: Private snaps are more likely to be tailored to your interests and preferences since they are intended for specific recipients. This can result in a more enjoyable and engaging experience. 3. Moving the Conversation Off Snapchat Once a connection has been established, it can be beneficial to move the conversation beyond Snapchat and onto other platforms. A. Extended Conversations: Snapchat's temporary nature can sometimes make it difficult to have in-depth conversations. By transitioning your communication to a different platform, you can engage in more meaningful discussions that are not restricted by time or format limitations. B. Strengthening Connections: Moving the conversation to another platform indicates that your relationship has progressed beyond casual interactions on Snapchat. This could lead to more profound connections and potentially deeper friendships. C. Diversifying Communication Channels: Engaging contacts on multiple platforms provides more opportunities to connect, and opens up different ways in which you can interact. Expanding your communication channels can help enrich your experience and strengthen relationships with your contacts. Conclusion Snapchat is a fun and exciting platform that allows users to share snippets of their life with friends and followers. By actively responding to snaps, requesting private snaps, and moving conversations off Snapchat, you can elevate your social media experience and create more meaningful connections with your contacts. Remember that the key to maintaining strong relationships is to be responsive, attentive, and open to new ways of communication."},{"question":"Information: - California is the most populous state in the United States and the third most extensive by area.

Also known as a \\"conflux\\", it refers either to the point where a tributary joins a larger river, (main stem), or where two streams meet to become the source of a river of a new name, such as the confluence of the Monongahela and Allegheny rivers in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania creating the Ohio River. - A drainage basin or catchment basin is an extent or an area of land where all surface water from rain, melting snow, or ice converges to a single point at a lower elevation, usually the exit of the basin, where the waters join another body of water, such as a river, lake, reservoir, estuary, wetland, sea, or ocean. Thus if a tributary stream joins a brook that in turn joins a small river which is a tributary of a larger river, there is a series of successively larger (and lower elevation) drainage basins. For instance, the Missouri and Ohio rivers are within their own drainage basins and also within the drainage basin of the Mississippi River. - A sea is a large body of salt water that is surrounded in whole or in part by land. More broadly, \\"the sea\\" is the interconnected system of Earth's salty, oceanic watersconsidered as one global ocean or as several principal oceanic divisions. The sea moderates Earth's climate and has important roles in the water cycle, carbon cycle, and nitrogen cycle. Although the sea has been traveled and explored since prehistory, the modern scientific study of the seaoceanographydates broadly to the British \\"Challenger\\" expedition of the 1870s. The sea is conventionally divided into up to five large oceanic sectionsincluding the International Hydrographic Organization's four named oceans (the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, and Arctic) and the Southern Ocean; smaller, second-order sections, such as the Mediterranean, are known as \\"seas\\". - Oka is a river in central Russia, the largest right tributary of the Volga. It flows through the regions of Oryol, Tula, Kaluga, Moscow, Ryazan, Vladimir, and Nizhny Novgorod and is navigable over a large part of its total length, as far upstream as to the town of Kaluga. Its length exceeds . The Russian capital Moscow sits on one of the Oka's tributariesthe Moskva River. - The Mississippi River is the chief river of the largest drainage system on the North American continent. Flowing entirely in the United States (although its drainage basin reaches into Canada), it rises in northern Minnesota and meanders slowly southwards for to the Mississippi River Delta at the Gulf of Mexico. With its many tributaries, the Mississippi's watershed drains all or parts of 31 U.S. states and 2 Canadian provinces between the Rocky and Appalachian Mountains. The Mississippi ranks as the fourth longest and fifteenth largest river in the world by discharge. The river either borders or passes through the states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana. - Saint Petersburg is Russia's second-largest city after Moscow, with five million inhabitants in 2012, and an important Russian port on the Baltic Sea.

A shipping route consists of one or several waterways. Waterways can include rivers, lakes, seas, oceans, and canals. In order for a waterway to be navigable, it must meet several criteria: - Novosibirsk is the third-most populous city in Russia after Moscow and St. Petersburg. It is the most populous city in Asian Russia, with a population of 1,473,754 as of the 2010 Census. It is the administrative center of Novosibirsk Oblast as well as of the Siberian Federal District. The city is located in the southwestern part of Siberia on the banks of the Ob River adjacent to the Ob River Valley, near the large water reservoir formed by the dam of the Novosibirsk Hydro Power Plant, and occupies an area of . - Eurasia is the combined continental landmass of Europe and Asia. The term is a portmanteau of its constituent continents. Located primarily in the Northern and Eastern Hemispheres, it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Pacific Ocean to the east, the Arctic Ocean to the north, and by Africa, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Indian Ocean to the south. The division between Europe and Asia as two different continents is a historical and cultural construct, with no clear physical separation between them; thus, in some parts of the world, Eurasia is recognized as the largest of five or six continents. In geology, Eurasia is often considered as a single rigid megablock. However, the rigidity of Eurasia is debated based on the paleomagnet data. - A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, sea, lake or another river. In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague. - Lama River ( Russian : ) is a river in the Moscow and Tver Oblasts in Russia , a tributary of the Shosha River . The river is 139 kilometres ( 86 mi ) long . The area of its drainage basin is 2,330 square kilometres ( 900 sq mi ) . The Lama River freezes up in November and stays under the ice until late March or early April . Historically , the river was a part of the important waterway from the Volga River to the Moskva River . The city of Volokolamsk that has been standing on the Lama River since the 12th century was previously known as Volok Lamsky ( literally - Drag of Lama ) after the process of a watercraft portage . - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - An ocean (the sea of classical antiquity) is a body of saline water that composes much of a planet's hydrosphere. On Earth, an ocean is one of the major conventional divisions of the World Ocean, which covers almost 71% of its surface. These are, in descending order by area, the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic Oceans. The word \\"sea\\" is often used interchangeably with \\"ocean\\" in American English but, strictly speaking, a sea is a body of saline water (generally a division of the world ocean) partly or fully enclosed by land. - Canals and navigations are human-made channels for water conveyance (supply), or to service water transport vehicles. In the vernacular, both are referred to as 'canals', and in most cases, the engineered works will have a series of dams and locks that create areas of low speed current flow. These areas are referred to as\\" 'slack water levels',\\" often just called 'levels'. The main difference between them is that a navigation parallels a river and shares part of its waters, its drainage basin and leverages its resources by building dams and locks to increase and lengthen its long stretches of \\"deep enough\\" slack water levels while staying in its valley. In contrast, a canal cuts across a drainage divide atop a ridge (however humble), generally requiring an external water source above the highest elevation. Many canals have been built at elevations towering over valleys and others water ways crossing far below. Cities need a lot of fresh water and many canals with sources of water at a higher level can deliver water to a destination where there is a lack of water. The Roman Empire's Aqueducts were such water supply canals. - Volokolamsk is a town and the administrative center of Volokolamsky District in Moscow Oblast, Russia, located on the Gorodenka River, not far from its confluence with the Lama River, northwest of Moscow. Population: - The Volga is the longest river in Europe. It is also Europe's largest river in terms of discharge and watershed. The river flows through central Russia and into the Caspian Sea, and is widely regarded as the national river of Russia. - The Moskva River (\\"Moskva-reka\\") is a river of western Russia. It rises about west of Moscow, and flows roughly east through the Smolensk and Moscow Oblasts, passing through central Moscow. About south east of Moscow, at the city of Kolomna, it flows into the Oka River, itself a tributary of the Volga, which ultimately flows into the Caspian Sea. - Nizhny Novgorod, colloquially shortened to Nizhny, is a city in the administrative center of Nizhny Novgorod Oblast and Volga Federal District in Russia. From 1932 to 1990, it was known as Gorky, after the writer Maxim Gorky, who was born there. The city is an important economic, transportation, scientific, educational and cultural center in Russia and the vast Volga-Vyatka economic region, and is the main center of river tourism in Russia. In the historical part of the city there are a large number of universities, theaters, museums and churches. Nizhny Novgorod is located about 400 km east of Moscow, where the Oka empties into the Volga. Population: - Shosha River is a river in Zubtsovsky, Staritsky, Kalininsky and in Konakovsky Districts of Tver Oblast and Lotoshinsky District of Moscow Oblast in Russia. It is a right tributary of the Volga River. The length of the Shosha River is . The area of its basin is . The river flows into the Ivankovo Reservoir. The Shosha freezes up in November through early January and stays icebound until late March or early April. - A tributary or affluent is a stream or river that flows into a larger stream or main stem (or parent) river or a lake. A tributary does not flow directly into a sea or ocean. Tributaries and the main stem river drain the surrounding drainage basin of its surface water and groundwater, leading the water out into an ocean. - Ivankovo Reservoir or Ivankovskoye Reservoir, informally known as the Moscow Sea, is the uppermost reservoir on the Volga River, in Moscow and Tver Oblasts of Russia, located some 130 km north of Moscow. The dam of the reservoir is situated in the town of Dubna. The town of Konakovo is located on its southern coast. The reservoir is connected to the Moskva River by the Moscow Canal, and is the principal fresh water source for the city of Moscow. Its area is , and the area of its drainage basin is . - Russia (from the Rus'), also officially known as the Russian Federation, is a country in Eurasia. At , Russia is the largest country in the world by surface area, covering more than one-eighth of the Earth's inhabited land area, and the ninth most populous, with over 140 million people at the end of March 2016.

Russia's capital Moscow is one of the largest cities in the world, other major urban centers include Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara. - The Caspian Sea is the largest enclosed inland body of water on Earth by area, variously classed as the world's largest lake or a full-fledged sea. It is in an endorheic basin (it has no outflows) located between Europe and Asia. It is bound by Kazakhstan to the northeast, Russia to the northwest, Azerbaijan to the west, Iran to the south, and Turkmenistan to the southeast.

He won't be able to sell all of his cupcakes within the next week, so he has decided to store a portion of them in the freezer to preserve them for later. He is trying to decide if he should store the cupcakes at 0° F or at 10° F in the freezer. and a hint : Freezing is a common method of food preservation that slows both food decay and the growth of micro-organisms. Besides the effect of lower temperatures on reaction rates, freezing makes water less available for bacterial growth. Please answer this question : Which temperature will result in slower decay of the cupcakes? Answer:","response":"To answer this question, let's think step-by-step about the factors that affect the decay of food and the growth of microorganisms. Step 1: Consider the hint provided, \\"Freezing is a common method of food preservation that slows both food decay and the growth of micro-organisms.\\" - Freezing works as preservation because it slows down food decay and inhibits the growth of microorganisms. Step 2: Understand the relationship between temperature and reaction rates. - Lower temperatures mean slower reaction rates, which means slower decay and less bacterial growth. Step 3: Compare the given temperatures, 0°F and 10°F. - 0°F is colder than 10°F. Step 4: Determine which temperature will result in slower decay of the cupcakes. - Given that lower temperatures slow down reaction rates and reduce bacterial growth better than higher temperatures, the colder temperature of 0°F will result in slower decay of the cupcakes compared to 10°F."},{"question":"Math Problem Solve -69*f = -554*f + 975 + 32005 for f.","response":"Let's solve the given equation step by step.

Microsoft's Internet Explorer has been a longstanding choice for many users, but as with any software, it is not immune to bugs and glitches. Recently, Microsoft issued a temporary software fix for a bug in its Internet Explorer web browser, aimed at ensuring user safety and seamless browsing experience. In this article, we will explore the details of this software fix, the potential impact on users and businesses, and future steps for browser security. Microsoft's Internet Explorer Bug and Its Impact The bug in question has the potential to cause significant disruption for users and remain a security threat, especially since Internet Explorer continues to be widely used despite being replaced by Microsoft Edge as the company's primary browser. A vulnerability that allows attackers to execute malicious code on a user's computer can lead to major security breaches and potentially compromise a user's sensitive personal information. As users and businesses depend on their web browsers for a multitude of tasks ranging from online shopping and banking to collaboration and project management, a secure and reliable browser is essential. This bug could impact countless users worldwide, potentially exposing their personal and financial information to cyberattacks. In the worst-case scenario, it could lead to identity theft or unauthorized access to organizational data. Temporary Software Fix and Future Implications Acknowledging the severity of this bug, Microsoft has swiftly released a temporary software fix that users can apply to mitigate the risks associated with this vulnerability. While this solution provides some relief from potential security threats and disruption, it is crucial to note that it is a temporary measure. In the long run, Microsoft will need to address the vulnerability by developing and deploying a permanent fix for the browser. This process could take some time, as pinpointing the source of the problem and implementing a lasting solution requires thorough evaluation and testing. Users and businesses should be aware of this interim solution and continue to monitor updates from Microsoft on the progress of a permanent resolution. In the meantime, as Internet Explorer is gradually being phased out in favor of Microsoft Edge, users are encouraged to make the transition to the newer browser for improved security and performance. Microsoft Edge offers additional features and employs a more secure architecture to provide a safer browsing experience, which can potentially alleviate the risks posed by vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer.

A vocabulary, usually developed with age, serves as a useful and fundamental tool for communication and acquiring knowledge. Acquiring an extensive vocabulary is one of the largest challenges in learning a second language. - Western philosophy is the philosophical thought and work of the Western world. Historically, the term refers to the philosophical thinking of Western culture, beginning with Hellenic (i.e. Greek) philosophy of the Pre-Socratics such as Thales (c. 624 c. 546 BC) and Pythagoras (c. 570 c. 495 BC), and eventually covering a large area of the globe. The word \\"philosophy\\" itself originated from the Hellenic: \\"philosophia\\" (), literally, \\"the love of wisdom\\" ( \\"philein\\", \\"to love\\" and \\"sophia\\", \\"wisdom\\"). - Pythagoras of Samos ( or simply ; in Ionian Greek) was an Ionian Greek philosopher, mathematician, and the putative founder of the movement called Pythagoreanism. Most of the information about Pythagoras was written down centuries after he lived, so very little reliable information is known about him. He was born on the island of Samos, and travelled, visiting Egypt and Greece, and maybe India. Around 530 BC, he moved to Croton, in Magna Graecia, and there established some kind of school or guild. In 520 BC, he returned to Samos. - It is a major competitor of the St college in Tokyo known as Komazawa University. Despite the university's sectarian affiliation, the school accepts Soto students. The school operates two research centers important in Zen academia, i.e. the Institute for Zen Studies and the International Research Institute for Zen Buddhism.

Chinese documents from the 3rd century recorded a few Japanese words, but substantial texts did not appear until the 8th century. During the Heian period (7941185), Chinese had considerable influence on the vocabulary and phonology of Old Japanese. Late Middle Japanese (11851600) saw changes in features that brought it closer to the modern language, as well as the first appearance of European loanwords. The standard dialect moved from the Kansai region to the Edo (modern Tokyo) region in the Early Modern Japanese period (early 17th centurymid-19th century). Following the end in 1853 of Japan's self-imposed isolation, the flow of loanwords from European languages increased significantly. English loanwords in particular have become frequent, and Japanese words from English roots have proliferated. - , or is a national university in Kyoto, Japan.

What is the answer?","response":"The constellation named after the mother of the legendary Greek princess Andromeda is Cassiopeia. Cassiopeia is a prominent northern constellation that is easily recognizable due to its distinctive W-shaped pattern formed by its five brightest stars. This constellation is named in honor of the mythical Greek queen Cassiopeia, who was the wife of King Cepheus and the mother of Princess Andromeda. According to Greek mythology, Cassiopeia was a vain and boastful woman who claimed that both she and her daughter were more beautiful than the Nereids, the sea nymphs who were the daughters of the sea god Nereus. This act of hubris angered the sea god Poseidon, who decided to punish Cassiopeia and her kingdom. Poseidon sent a sea monster, known as Cetus, to wreak havoc along the coastline of the kingdom. In an attempt to appease Poseidon and save their kingdom, King Cepheus and Queen Cassiopeia consulted an oracle, who advised them to sacrifice their daughter Andromeda to the sea monster. Andromeda was then chained to a rock by the sea as an offering to Cetus. However, she was eventually rescued by the hero Perseus, who slew the sea monster and married Andromeda. In the sky, the constellation Cassiopeia is surrounded by other constellations that represent the characters of this myth. Adjacent to Cassiopeia is the constellation Cepheus, which represents King Cepheus. Nearby, the constellation Andromeda represents the princess herself, while the constellations Perseus and Cetus symbolize the hero and the sea monster, respectively. This celestial grouping of constellations effectively tells the story of the mythological tale, serving as a reminder of the ancient Greek story. Cassiopeia, along with the other constellations in this group, is part of the Perseus family of constellations. The constellation is visible throughout the year in the northern hemisphere, particularly during the autumn months. The brightest star in the constellation is Schedar, followed by Caph, which form the two ends of the W-shape. Apart from its mythology, Cassiopeia is also an interesting constellation for astronomers due to the various celestial objects it contains, such as star clusters, galaxies, and supernova remnants."},{"question":"Given the question: Information: - The University of Chicago (U of C, Chicago, or UChicago) is a private research university in Chicago, Illinois.

Answer:","response":"Charles Dickens, a prominent English writer and social critic, was born on February 7, 1812, and died on June 9, 1870. He lived a relatively short but extremely productive life during the Victorian era, which was a period of significant industrial, scientific, and cultural change in the United Kingdom and had a profound influence on Dickens' literary career. While the question asks when did Charles Dickens live, the provided statement \\"His novels, most published in monthly or weekly instalments, pioneered the serial publication of narrative fiction, which became the dominant Victorian mode for novel publication.\\" offers a reasonable insight into his literary contribution, rather than explicitly answering the given question. Nonetheless, it is essential to understand the significance of Dickens' pioneering work in serializing novels during his lifetime. Charles Dickens was a pioneer of serial publication, a process in which a novel was divided into several parts that were published at regularly scheduled intervals such as monthly or weekly. This method of publication enabled Dickens to reach a vast audience, as the readers eagerly waited for the next instalment to find out what happened next in the story. This innovative approach allowed for broader dissemination of literature as it made the novels more accessible and affordable for the general public. Dickens' serialized novels, such as \\"Oliver Twist,\\" \\"A Tale of Two Cities,\\" \\"Great Expectations,\\" and many others, were immensely popular and widely read in Victorian society. This method of publication enabled readers to follow the story as it unfolded, creating a sense of anticipation and excitement around each instalment. Additionally, the serialized format provided Dickens with the opportunity to adapt and modify his narrative in response to reader feedback and reactions. Consequently, the serial publication of narrative fiction emerged as a dominant Victorian mode for novel publication. In summary, Charles Dickens lived during the Victorian era from 1812 to 1870 and made significant contributions to the world of literature. While the provided statement doesn't directly address when he lived, it highlights his influential role in popularizing the serial publication of narrative fiction.

Firstly, I translate the main sentence \\"The beginning of 'frame' is similar to a drive through the city\\". 'Frame' is not a German word, so we'll keep it in English in the translation because it can be a specific term. This gives us: \\"Der Anfang von 'frame' ähnelt einer Fahrt durch die Stadt\\". 2. Secondly, I translate ”Let’s go for a ride,”. In German, this could be expressed as: \\"Lass uns eine Fahrt machen,\\". 3. Lastly, I translate \\"high energy\\". This becomes \\"hohe Energie\\" in German. Putting it all together, the full translation is: \\"Der Anfang von 'frame' ähnelt einer Fahrt durch die Stadt: „Lass uns eine Fahrt machen,“ hohe Energie.\\" But this still sounds a bit off in German. Instead, I would suggest changing the translation to: \\"Der Anfang von 'frame' gleicht einer Autofahrt durch die Stadt: „Auf eine Fahrt gehen wir,“ viel Energie.\\" This translates to: \\"The beginning of 'frame' is like a car ride through the city: “Let's go for a ride,” a lot of energy.\\" This version flows better in German. In the last step, I made some necessary changes to make the sentence more idiomatic and coherent in German, while preserving the original meaning of the English phrase."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Information: - Quebec (pronounced or ) is the second-most populous province of Canada and the only one to have a predominantly French-speaking population, with French as the sole provincial official language. - Massachusetts ; officially the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, is the most populous state in the New England region of the northeastern United States.

Ross McEwen pulls an unusual bank job in the New Mexico town of Santa Maria, taking the banker Frenger with him, then letting him go a few miles away, minus boots but with an I.O.U. for the 2,000 he stole. Pat Garrett, the new marshal, will try to catch the thief, as will bounty hunters after Frenger's reward offer of 3,000. McEwen is bitten by a rattlesnake before he can board a train, where he is helped by a couple of passengers, Monte Marquez, a gambler, and Fay Hollister, a nurse. The train tracks are washed out near Albuquerque, so the small group goes off alone via a route used to deliver mail. Fay finds out a posse from Santa Maria is after a wanted man and recalls that's where McEwen came on board. But he and she have developed an attraction. When they reach an Alamogordo saloon that Marquez's cousins run, a cattleman named Burnett is willing to take on McEwen as a hired hand. Garrett and deputy Clint Waters come to town, so McEwen must leave but offers her an engagement ring. Fay rides along, but ends up separated and captured by Garrett's men. After crossing the desert with difficulty, McEwen comes across a Mexican rancher named Florencio, whose family is ill. He stays to help and starts a fire to signal the lawmen, needing their assistance. Marquez gets there along with Garrett and Fay, but because Florencio is another relative of his, pretends that McEwen is a total stranger.

While being filmed, the girl smiles.Shuya Nanahara, a Japanese middle school student, attempts to cope with life after his father's suicide by hanging. Meanwhile, schoolmate Noriko Nakagawa is the only student attending class -- 3-B. Their teacher, Kitano, quietly leaves upon her tardy, apologetic arrival, but is attacked by student Yoshitoki Kuninobu and resigns after recovering from his wound.One year later, class 3-B takes a field trip after completing their compulsory studies; however, the class is gassed on their bus. They wake up in a \\"briefing room\\" on a remote island, wearing strange electronic collars. Kitano explains that the class has been chosen to participate in this year's Battle Royale as a result of the BR Act, which was passed after 800,000 students walked out of school. The orientation video cheerfully instructs the class to kill each other for three days until only one student remains.

One of the 42 students, Fumiyo Fujiyoshi, interferes with the video by whispering to her friends; Kitano kills her on the spot with a thrown knife. While a shocked class is subdued by soldiers, Kuninobu openly confronts the viciousness of Kitano and the teacher slashes him with a knife (in the back of leg - the same area Kuninobu attacked Kitano two years earlier) before detonating his collar while Shuya, his best friend, watches in horror.

The company said late Friday that it will now require commuting staff and crew members to check into flights 60 minutes prior to departure. The policy change comes in the wake of a highly publicized incident on April 9 in which a paying customer who had already boarded was violently dragged off the aircraft by law enforcement officers.

Had the commuting crew member been required to check in for the flight before passengers began boarding, United could have denied a customer boarding before he or she was seated. \\"This [policy change] ensures situations like flight 3411 never happen again.

Answer explanation: 1. School building - A school building itself is not specific enough to determine where within that building the shelf should be placed, therefore, it is not the best option. 2. Corner - Placing the irregularly shaped shelf in a corner will help you efficiently utilize the space and minimize its interference with high-traffic areas. A corner also provides structural support for the shelf to maintain stability. 3. Outside - Placing the shelf outside may not be suitable for various reasons, including exposure to weather and potential damage or theft. It also does not address the high-traffic area concern. 4. Wall - Attaching the shelf to a wall might create an obstacle in a high-traffic area, causing people to bump into it. The irregular shape could also look visually disruptive along a plain wall. 5. Cabinet - Placing the irregularly shaped shelf inside a cabinet wouldn't serve the purpose, as the shelf itself is meant to provide storage. Considering these points, placing the irregularly shaped shelf in a corner is the most practical and efficient option that minimizes disturbance in high-traffic areas."},{"question":"Title: only for desperate fanatics Review: I had to check Amazon just now because I was worried something was wrong with my DVD player.

And what do we mean by \\"good\\" in the context? According to Presence, a new book by Harvard Business School professor Amy Cuddy, people assess you on two main criteria when they first meet you: 1. Can I trust this person? 2. Can I respect this person? Your level of trustworthiness, or warmth, is the most important factor in how people initially admire you, Cuddy says-yet many mistakenly believe that the second factor,characterised as competence, is more important.\\"From an evolutionary aspect,\\"Cuddy writes,\\"it is more important to our survival to know whether a person deserves our trust.\\" While displaying competence is certainly beneficial, particularly in a work setting, Cuddy warns that focusing on winning people's respect, while failing to win their trust, can backfire-a common problem for young professionals attempting to make a good impression early on in their careers. \\"If someone you're trying to influence doesn't trust you, you're not going to get very far\\", Cuddy says, \\"A warm, trustworthy person who is also strong elicits admiration, but only after you've established trust does your strength become a gift rather than a threat.\\" In Cuddy's book she also explains some of the science that can help you spot a liar. When a person is lying there is likely to be differences between what they are saying and what they are doing, she suggests. \\"Lying is hard work,\\" she writes, \\"We're telling one story while suppressing another, and most of us are experiencing psychological guilt about doing this, which we're also trying suppress. We just don't have the brainpower to manage it all without letting something go-without'leaking'.\\" \\"It's about how well or poorly our multiple channels of communications-facial expressions, posture, movement, vocal qualities, speech-co-operate,\\"she adds. \\"When we're consciously looking for signs of cheat or truth, we pay too much attention to words and not enough to the external body language,\\" the... Question: What can be learned according to the passage? Yes or no, is the answer \\"Some people tend to think displaying competence to gain respect makes a good impression.\\"? Answer:","response":"According to the passage, when people meet someone for the first time, they assess them based on two main criteria: trustworthiness (warmth) and respect (competence). While displaying competence is beneficial, especially in a work setting, it is actually the trustworthiness aspect that is more important in making a good impression. Focusing on winning people's respect without establishing trust could backfire. The passage also discusses how to spot a liar by paying attention to discrepancies between their words and actions, as well as inconsistencies in their communication channels like facial expressions, posture, movement, and vocal qualities. The answer to the question is \\"Yes,\\" as the passage implies that some people mistakenly believe that displaying competence to gain respect is the key to making a good impression, while it is actually establishing trust that is more important."},{"question":"From the following options, what is the question \\"What Robert Louis Stevenson novel was inspired by Deacon William Brodie , a cabinetmaker by day and burglar by night ?\\" asking about?

Finma, which is Switzerland's main markets regulator, said in a statement it was working closely with authorities in other countries, \\"as multiple banks around the world are potentially implicated.\\" The Swiss investigation comes after the U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority said in June that it was \\"aware of allegations\\" of efforts to rig currency rates and was gathering information about potential manipulation of benchmark foreign-exchange rates.

Within an hour, two-thirds of that gain had melted away. The same pattern -- a sudden surge minutes before 4 p.m. in London on the last trading day of the month, followed by a quick reversal -- occurred 31 percent of the time across 14 currency pairs over two years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. For the most frequently traded pairs, such as euro-dollar, it happened about half the time, the data show. The recurring spikes take place at the same time financial benchmarks known as the WM/Reuters (TRI) rates are set based on those trades. Now fund managers and scholars say the patterns look like an attempt by currency dealers to manipulate the rates, distorting the value of trillions of dollars of investments in funds that track global indexes. Bloomberg News reported in June that dealers shared information and used client orders to move the rates to boost trading profit. The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority is reviewing the allegations, a spokesman said. “We see enormous spikes,” said Michael DuCharme, head of foreign exchange at Seattle-based Russell Investments, which traded 420 billion of foreign currency last year for its own funds and institutional investors. “Then, shortly after 4 p.m., it just reverts back to what seems to have been the market rate. It adds to the suspicion that things aren’t right.” Photographer: Susana Gonzalez/Bloomberg An employee counts a stack of U.S. one hundred dollar bills inside a currency exchange center in Mexico City.

Read More Close Open Photographer: Susana Gonzalez/Bloomberg An employee counts a stack of U.S. one hundred dollar bills inside a currency exchange center in Mexico City. Global Probes Authorities around the world are investigating the abuse of financial benchmarks by large banks that play a central role in setting them. Barclays Plc (BARC), Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and UBS AG (UBSN) were fined a combined 2.5 billion for rigging the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, used to price 300 trillion of securities from student loans to mortgages. More than a dozen banks have been subpoenaed by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission over allegations traders worked with brokers at ICAP Plc (IAP) to manipulate ISDAfix, a benchmark used in interest-rate derivatives. ICAP Chief Executive Officer Michael Spencer said in May that an internal probe found no evidence of wrongdoing. Investors and consultants interviewed by Bloomberg News say dealers at banks, which dominate the 4.7 trillion-a-day currency market, may be executing a large number of trades over a short period to move the rate to their advantage, a practice known as banging the close. Because the 4 p.m. benchmark determines how much profit dealers make on the positions they’ve taken in the preceding hour, there’s an incentive to influence the rate, DuCharme said. Dealers say they have to trade during the window to meet client demand and minimize their own risk. Close Close Open Currency Patterns “There are some patterns in currencies that are very similar to what I have seen in other markets, such as the way the price-fixings’ effects disappear so often by the following day,” said Rosa Abrantes-Metz, a professor at New York University’s Stern School of Business, whose August 2008 paper, “Libor Manipulation?,” helped trigger the probe into the rigging of benchmark interest rates. “You also see large price moves at a time of day when volume of trading is high and hence the market is very liquid. If I were a regulator, it’s certainly something I would consider taking a look at.” WM/Reuters rates, which determine what many pension funds and money managers pay for their foreign exchange, are published hourly for 160 currencies and half-hourly for the 21 most-traded. The benchmarks are the median of all trades in a minute-long period starting 30 seconds before the beginning of each half-hour. Rates for less-widely traded currencies are based on quotes during a two-minute window. London Close Benchmark providers such as FTSE Group and MSCI Inc. base daily valuations of indexes spanning different currencies on the 4 p.m. WM/Reuters rates, known as the London close. Index funds, which track global indexes such as the MSCI World Index, also trade at the rates to reduce tracking error, or the drag on funds’ performance relative to the securities they follow caused by currency fluctuations. The data are collected and distributed by World Markets Co., a unit of Boston-based State Street Corp. (STT), and Thomson Reuters Corp. Bloomberg LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News, competes with Thomson Reuters and ICAP in providing news and information as well as currency-trading systems. Reuters and World Markets referred requests for comment to State Street. Noreen Shah, a spokeswoman for the custody bank in London, said in an e-mail that the rates are derived from actual trades and the benchmark is calculated anonymously, with multiple review processes to monitor the quality of the data. “WM supports efforts by the industry to determine and address any alleged disruptive behavior by market participants and we welcome further discussions on these issues and what preventative measures can be adopted,” Shah said. Opaque Market The foreign-exchange market is one of the least regulated and most opaque in the financial system. It’s also concentrated, with four banks accounting for more than half of all trading, according to a May survey by Euromoney Institutional Investor Plc. Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) is No. 1 with a 15 percent share, followed by Citigroup Inc. (C) with almost 15 percent and London-based Barclays and Switzerland’s UBS, which both have 10 percent. All four banks declined to comment. Because they receive clients’ orders in advance of the close, and some traders discuss orders with counterparts at other firms, banks have an insight into the future direction of rates, five dealers interviewed in June said. That allows them to maximize profits on their clients’ orders and sometimes make their own additional bets, according to the dealers, who asked not to be identified because the practice is controversial. ‘Incredibly Large’ Even small distortions in foreign-exchange rates can cost investors hundreds of millions of dollars a year, eating into returns for savers and retirees, said James Cochrane, director of analytics at New York-based Investment Technology Group Inc., which advises companies and investors on executing trades. “What started out as a simple benchmarking tool has become something incredibly large, and there’s no regulatory body looking after it,” said Cochrane, a former foreign-exchange salesman at Deutsche Bank who has worked at Thomson Reuters. “Every basis point is worth a tremendous amount of money.” An investor seeking to change 1 billion Canadian dollars (950 million) into U.S. currency on June 28 would have received 5.4 million less had the trade been made at the WM/Reuters rate instead of the spot rate 20 minutes before the 4 p.m. window. “Funds that consistently trade using the WM/Reuters fix are basically trading against themselves, and their portfolio is taking a hit,” Cochrane said. FCA Complaint One of Europe’s largest money managers, who invests on behalf of pension holders and savers, has complained to the FCA, alleging the rate is being manipulated, said a person with knowledge of the matter who asked that neither he nor the firm be identified because he wasn’t authorized to speak publicly. The regulator sent requests for information to four banks, including Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank and New York-based Citigroup, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Chris Hamilton, a spokesman for the FCA, declined to comment, as did spokesmen for Deutsche Bank and Citigroup. Bloomberg News counted how many times spikes of at least 0.2 percent occurred in the 30 minutes before 4 p.m. for 14 currency pairs on the last working day of each month from July 2011 through June 2013. To qualify, the move had to be one of the three biggest of the day and have reversed by at least half within four hours, to exclude any longer-lasting movements. The sample was made up of currency pairs ranging from the most liquid, such as euro-dollar, to less-widely traded ones such as the euro to the Polish zloty. Pounds, Kronor End-of-month spikes of at least 0.2 percent were more prevalent for some pairs, the data show. They occurred about half the time in the exchange rates for U.S. dollars and British pounds and for euros and Swedish kronor. In other pairs, including dollar-Brazilian real and euro-Swiss franc, the moves occurred about twice a year on average. Such spikes should be expected at the end of the month because of a correlation between equities and foreign exchange, said two foreign-exchange traders who asked not to be identified because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly on behalf of their firms. A large proportion of trading at that time is generated by index funds, which buy and sell stocks or bonds to match an underlying basket of securities, the traders said. Banks that have agreed to make transactions for funds at the 4 p.m. WM/Reuters close need to push through the bulk of their trades during the window where possible to minimize losses from market movements, the traders said. That leads to a surge in trading volume, which can intensify any moves. Index Funds For 10 major currency pairs, the minutes surrounding the 4 p.m. London close are the busiest for trading at the end of the month, quarter and year, according to Michael Melvin and John Prins at BlackRock Inc. who examined trading data from the Reuters and Electronic Broking Services trading platforms from May 2, 2005, to March 12, 2010. Reuters and ICAP, which owns EBS, declined to provide data on intraday trading volumes for this article. Index funds, which manage 3.6 trillion according to Morningstar Inc., typically place the bulk of their orders with banks on the last day of the month as they adjust rolling currency hedges to reflect relative movements between equity indexes in different countries and invest inflows from customers over the previous 30 days. Most requests are placed in the hour preceding the 4 p.m. London window, and banks agree to trade at the benchmark rate, regardless of later price moves. Opposite Effect “Since the major fix-market-making banks know their fixing orders in advance of 4 p.m., they can ‘pre-position’ or take positions for themselves prior to the attempt to move prices in their favor,” Melvin and Prins wrote in “Equity Hedging and Exchange Rates at the London 4 P.M. Fix,” an update of a report for a 2011 Munich conference. “The large market-makers are adept at trading in advance of the fix to push prices in their favor so that the fixing trades are profitable on average.” Recurring price spikes, particularly during busy times such as the end of the month, can indicate market manipulation and possibly collusion, according to Abrantes-Metz. “If the volume of trading is high, each trade has less importance in the overall market and is less likely to impact the final price,” said Abrantes-Metz, who’s also a principal at Chicago-based Global Economics Group Inc. and a World Bank consultant. “That’s exactly the opposite of what we’re seeing here. That could be a signal of a problem in this market.” ‘Massive Trades’ U.S. regulators have sanctioned firms for banging the close in other markets. The CFTC fined hedge-fund firm Moore Capital Management LP 25 million in April 2010 for attempting to manipulate the settlement price of platinum and palladium futures. The regulator ordered Dutch trading firm Optiver BV to pay 14 million in April 2012 for trying to move oil prices by executing a large number of trades at the end of the day. Melvin, head of currency and fixed-income research at BlackRock’s global markets strategies group in San Francisco, and Prins, a vice president in the group, said that because banks could lose money if the market moves against them, their profit may be viewed as compensation for the risk they assume. Both declined to comment beyond their report. “Part of the problem is it’s all concentrated over a 60-second window, which gives such an opportunity to bang through massive trades,” said Mark Taylor, dean of the Warwick Business School in Coventry, England, and a former managing director at New York-based BlackRock. World Markets, the administrator of the benchmark, could extend the periods during which the rates are set to 10 minutes or use randomly selected 60-second windows each day, said Taylor, who began his career as a currency trader in London. ‘Fiduciary Duty’ Trading at the highly volatile 4 p.m. close instead of at a daily weighted average could erase 5 percentage points of performance annually for a fund tracking the MSCI World Index, according to a May 2010 report by Paul Aston, then an analyst at Morgan Stanley. (MS) For an asset manager trading 10 billion of currencies, that equates to 500 million that would otherwise be in the hands of investors. Aston, now at TD Securities Inc. in New York, declined to comment. Fund managers rarely complain about getting a bad deal because they’re assessed on their ability to track an index rather than minimize trading costs, according to consultants hired by companies and investors to help execute trades efficiently. “Where possible, I would always advise clients not to trade at the fix -- but minimizing tracking error is so important to them,” said Russell’s DuCharme. “That doesn’t seem to be the right attitude to take when you have a fiduciary duty to seek the best execution for pension holders.” To contact the reporters on this story: Liam Vaughan in London at lvaughan6@bloomberg.net; Gavin Finch in London at gfinch@bloomberg.net To contact the editor responsible for this story: Edward Evans at eevans3@bloomberg.net ||||| The Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority “is coordinating closely with authorities in other countries as multiple banks around the world are potentially implicated.” The Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority “is coordinating closely with authorities in other countries as multiple banks around the world are potentially implicated.” Close Swiss regulators said they’re investigating several banks for allegedly colluding to manipulate the 5.3 trillion-a-day foreign exchange market. The Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority “is coordinating closely with authorities in other countries as multiple banks around the world are potentially implicated,” it said yesterday in a statement. Separately, the competition commission said it opened a preliminary probe on Sept. 30 after receiving allegations of collusion among banks to manipulate some foreign-exchange rates. The probes come after Bloomberg News reported in June that dealers at banks pooled information through instant messages and used client orders to move benchmark currency rates. Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority said that month it was reviewing the allegations. The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission has also been reviewing potential violations of the law with regards to foreign currency markets, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified. Authorities around the world are investigating the alleged abuse of financial benchmarks by the firms that play a central role in setting them. UBS AG (UBSN), Switzerland’s largest bank, was among four firms fined about 2.6 billion for rigging the London interbank offered rate, the benchmark for more than 300 trillion of securities worldwide. Potential Manipulation European regulators are reviewing allegations of collusion in crude oil and biofuels markets, while the CFTC and FCA are also probing the potential manipulation of ISDAfix, a benchmark for interest-rate swaps. In yesterday’s statement, Finma didn’t identify which firms it’s investigating or give details of the scope of its probe. The Swiss competition commission said it will decide at a later point what further action to take. Vinzenz Mathys, a spokesman for Bern-based Finma, declined to comment further. UBS is among the banks being probed by Swiss regulators, the Financial Times said today, citing unidentified sources. Dominik Von Arx, a London-based UBS spokesman, declined to comment. Marc Dosch at Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) declined to comment. UBS closed at 18.56 francs, up 0.5 percent in Zurich, while Credit Suisse gained 0.6 percent to 28.23 francs. Britain’s FCA yesterday reiterated its June statement that it has been speaking to the “relevant” parties. The regulator has separately requested information from four banks including Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) and Citigroup Inc. (C), a person with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be identified said in June. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority said in a statement yesterday it will “closely monitor” developments. Barclays, Citigroup About four banks account for more than half of all trading in the foreign-exchange market, according to a May survey by Euromoney Institutional Investor Plc. (ERM) Deutsche Bank is No. 1 with a 15 percent share, followed by Citigroup with almost 15 percent and London-based Barclays Plc (BARC) and UBS, which each have 10 percent. Giles Croot, a spokesman for Barclays, Sebastian Howell at Deutsche Bank and Jeffrey French at Citigroup declined to comment. Traders at some of the world’s largest banks sought to manipulate the WM/Reuters currency rates in their favor by pushing through trades before and during the 60-second windows when the benchmarks are set, five current and former dealers with knowledge of the practice said in June. Some dealers colluded with counterparts to boost their chances of moving the rates, said two of the people, who worked in the industry for a total of more than 20 years. Index Providers The WM/Reuters rates are used by fund managers to determine what they pay for currencies and to compute the day-to-day value of their holdings, and by index providers such as FTSE Group and MSCI Inc. (MSCI) that track stocks and bonds in multiple countries. While the rates aren’t followed by most investors, even small movements can affect the value of what Morningstar Inc. (MORN) estimates is 3.6 trillion in funds including pension and savings accounts that track global indexes. Traders said that because they agree to deal at the 4 p.m. WM/Reuters price, they have to push through the bulk of their trades during the window when the rate is calculated to minimize potential losses. That leads to a surge in trading volume, which can intensify any moves, they said.

It is three days until the celebration of the year 3000. A Square, attorney at law, struggles to instruct his grand daughter, A Hexagon, in the art of sight recognition. The lesson is interrupted by his brother B Squares arrival. As clerk to President Circle, B Square wants to warn his big brother to stay home that afternoon while there is a meeting at the Senate of the Great Southern Republic of Flatland.The Senate session has been called to discuss the increasing hostilities between the Chromatist movement and the government. Senator Chromatistes is the irregular polygon who leads this rebellious movement that wants to legalize the right of Flatlanders to color their sides as they see fit. Traditionally a taboo practice, the laws were previously relaxed somewhat which emboldened the Chromatists to demand legalization against the will of the majority. The Great Southern Republic distinguishes itself from its enemy, the Northern Kingdom, by its stances on Chromatism and Irregulars along with a democratic government. Relaxing the laws has already been perceived as weakness by the Northern Kingdom who are massing on the borders.Unable to heed his brothers advice, A Square meets with his new client, the first female charged as a Chromatist and on his way home finds himself embroiled in the melee issuing forth from the Senate. President Circles soldiers have assassinated Senator Chromatistes along with his supporters thus sparking a riot that has spilled into the streets of the city. A Square barely makes it home safely where he then barricades his family against the chaos for the night.Once asleep, though, A Square has an unusual dream in which he visits a one dimensional world, Lineland, and attempts to convince the realm's ignorant king of a second dimension. A Square finds it essentially impossible to make the King of Lineland see outside of his eternally straight line. After waking... My question: Where was a Square sent to? A:","response":"A Square was sent to a one-dimensional world called Lineland in his dream."},{"question":"What is the subject line for this email?

Options: (A) 9 (B) 8 (C) 7 (D) 6 (E) 5 Let's think first. Stream of consciousness:","response":"Let's use algebra to help solve this problem. Let's assume x = the number of dogs and y = the number of peacocks. Since dogs have 4 legs and peacocks have 2 legs, we can create the equation: 4x + 2y = 4(number of heads) - 18. We also have the equation for the total number of heads: x + y = (number of heads). Now we can substitute the second equation into the first equation: 4x + 2y = 4(x + y) - 18. Now distribute the 4 on the right side of the equation: 4x + 2y = 4x + 4y - 18. Now we can subtract 4x from both sides of the equation: 2y = 4y - 18. Next, subtract 4y from both sides: -2y = -18. Finally, divide by -2: y = 9. So, there are 9 peacocks in the group (Option A)."},{"question":"Read the article and select the best answer. Article: What do astronauts eat in space, and why? How did astronaut food come into being? How do astronauts preserve food for long periods of time in space? NASA(the National Aeronautics and Space Administration) has been researching food for space travel since the 1960's to find the best way of keeping astronauts from going hungry. The research could date from an accident that took place on the first manned Gemini mission in 1965. astronaut John Young managed to sneak a corned beef sandwich onto the Geminni III capsule to eat during its orbit around Earth. To Young's surprise, the sandwich plan did not go as expected; instead the sandwich began to break apart and scatter through the Geminni IIIcapsule. This could have resulted in disaster, since a small piece of food could have stuck in the air vents and other equipment. The sandwich was stuffed into a pocket to avoid the further mess inside the small space capsule This incident caused NASA to enforce strict rules on what types of food can be taken into space. Space food has come a long way since then. During the Gemini period, the astronauts mostly ate cubed, compressed foods high in calories and lightweight. NASA expects a long shelf life for space food. The majority of food taken into space has been dried out or heat-treated. These process and use of sodium , make the food taken into space last longer. Research is ongoing into space food to seek out healthier ways to preserve it. Too much sodium is unhealthy, and can badly change the taste of some foods.

Here is a hypothesis: Japan used a recovery strategy that involved creating managed inflation. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","response":"To analyze this, we'll break it down step by step. 1. Firstly, acknowledging the premise: The premise states that in Japan, a compelling intellectual case can be made for a recovery strategy that involves the creation of managed inflation. 2. Understanding the premise: This means that theoretically, the grounds for using managed inflation as a recovery strategy in Japan are considered strong. It doesn't state, however, that Japan has implemented this strategy, but that arguments can be made in favor of it. 3. Secondly, recognizing the hypothesis: The hypothesis posits that Japan has used a recovery strategy involving the creation of managed inflation. 4. Analyzing the relationship: If we look at the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, we see they're talking about the same strategy - managed inflation as a recovery method - but they differ in the \\"reality\\" status. The premise talks of a theoretical application, whereas the hypothesis states it as a factual occurrence. 5. Conclusion: So, it is not possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. The premise only argues that a compelling case could be made for the strategy, not that the strategy has been implemented. The hypothesis, on the other hand, assumes that the strategy has already been used. Given this, we cannot infer the truth of the hypothesis directly from the premise. To do so, we would need additional information that confirms Japan indeed implemented such a recovery strategy."},{"question":"Write an article based on this summary: The officer in charge of the police operation at Belfast City Hall has denied police were caught \\"on the hop\\" by rioting. Article:","response":"Title: Belfast City Hall Police Operation: Officer Denies Being Caught \\"On the Hop\\" by Rioting Introduction The Belfast City Hall incident has gained significant attention in recent days due to allegations that the police were inadequately prepared and caught \\"on the hop\\" by the ensuing riots. However, the officer in charge of the police operation on that fateful day has come forward to dismiss these claims, stating that the force was well-prepared and strategically deployed to manage the situation. Background of the Incident The socio-political situation in Belfast has been tense for a while, with deep-seated differences among various factions and groups leading to sporadic outbreaks of violence. The Belfast City Hall incident was marked by unrest, disorder, and rioting that significantly disrupted the functioning of the administrative center. Critics accused the police force of being inadequately prepared when the riotous mob descended on the city hall. The lack of response time and appropriate personnel deployment was seen as evidence of the police being \\"caught on the hop,\\" leaving officers scrambling to contain the violence. Officer's Statement The officer in charge of the police operation, whose identity has been withheld for security reasons, has since refuted these claims, stating that police were well-prepared and strategically stationed in anticipation of unrest. He stated that the operation plan catered to the possibility of violence erupting and that the force's deployment was designed to ensure the safety of both the public and its officers. According to the officer, police personnel were in constant communication with their counterparts at other operational locations to ensure real-time updates on the ground situation. This coordination network enabled them to act swiftly in transitioning their strategies, with multiple plans available to address any escalation in violence. The officer further highlighted that de-escalation tactics were used to successfully disperse the majority of the mob, preventing further damage to Belfast City Hall's premises. While it is true that some property damage occurred during the rioting, the officer stated that the overall situation was controlled in a relatively short amount of time, without any significant injury to officers or civilians. Critics' Response Despite the officer's statement, some critics remain skeptical about the level of police preparedness, questioning the response time and efficiency in addressing the rioting. Many argue that additional resources and personnel could have been deployed to prevent or minimize damages altogether. Conclusion The debate surrounding the Belfast City Hall police operation's preparedness and execution continues as various parties offer differing perspectives. The officer's denial of being caught \\"on the hop\\" offers a significant counter-narrative that shifts the conversation from blame to understanding the situational complexities and problem-solving process that took place on the ground. Ultimately, incidents such as the Belfast City Hall rioting are not easily controlled or contained, particularly given the city's history and the volatility of the socio-political landscape. Moving forward, it is essential to recognize the importance of transparency, communication, and robust contingency planning in ensuring public safety, while also examining ways the police force may adapt and improve their responses to such situations."},{"question":"Summarize this article: The move will come into effect in September and will affect all 39 special schools in Northern Ireland. It will mean pre-school children with moderate to severe learning difficulties will attend school for 2.5 hours instead of at least 4.5 hours a day. The cut was revealed by the Education Authority (EA) in a letter to a parent. It confirms that from September 2016 \\"all pre-school children will receive 2.5 hours in pre-school per day\\". The EA said the move \\"is designed to increase the opportunity for children to access special school places,\\" and will provide \\"greater regional consistency\\". However, a body that represents special school principals and governors said the cut will \\"hold back and restrict the development of children with complex needs\\". In a submission to the Northern Ireland Assembly, the Strategic Leadership Forum for Special Schools (SLFSS) said they \\"totally disagree\\" with the move. They said it will have a range of impacts including: Francine Wilson's three-year-old son Aodhan, is due to start pre-school at a special school in September. \\"Aodhan has Down's Syndrome and we were hoping in September 2016 he would get five hours of nursery placement,\\" she said. \\"Receiving two and a half hours will, I believe, result in delayed development in Aodhan, both educationally and socially.\\" However, a spokesperson for the EA said the reduction was \\"in line with the Department of Education's 'Learning to Learn' policy\\". \\"There has been a progressive move towards part-time places in all sectors,\\" the spokesperson said. \\"This policy recognises the research evidence that there is no discernible difference in children's development at the start of primary school between those who received part-time and full-time pre-school provision. \\"This move is designed to increase the opportunity for children to access special school places, preferably nearer to their homes.\\" \\"The provision of increased access and greater regional consistency is a priority,\\" they added. Summary:","response":"Starting in September, special schools in Northern Ireland will reduce the school day for pre-school children with learning difficulties. Instead of being at school for 4.5 hours, they will only be at school for 2.5 hours. This change will affect all 39 special schools.

However, some people believe this will slow down the growth and learning of children who need more help."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: One-hundred-and seventh birthdays aren't usually celebrated for authors who aren't alive anymore. But Theodor Seuss Geisel---better known as the children's books author Dr. Seuss ---who came into the world on 2 March, 1904, was an unusual man. Like generations of children I was raised on his wonderful stories. But when I now read them to my children it's not just the childhood memories I enjoy. His writing is brilliant and imaginative and flows with a self-confidence as sure as the words of a Shakespeare poem. Readers ride his characteristic rhythm with an effortless joy that cannot be matched by any other modern writer: You have brains in your head You have feet in your shoes You can steer yourself any direction you choose And will you succeed? Yes indeed, yes indeed! Ninety-eight and three-quarters percent guaranteed. Seuss's brilliant cartoons and clever words make his books a delight for adults but they attract mostly children of course. His stories teach kids moral lessons but in indirect and entertaining ways. The first Seuss book I was given was The Lorax, written just as the 60s were becoming the 70s. Seuss was ahead of his time, and in this book the dawn of concern for environmental problems are shown as the Lorax \\"who speaks for the trees\\" battles against an evil businessman who wants to destroy the forest and make goods \\"which everyone needs\\". It's not only a warning of the heavy price of environmental destruction, written well before most people had thought to worry, but it's also a smart analysis of consumer societies: \\"Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better. It's not.\\" This is of course a moral message, but not of the kind designed to persuade the youngsters into behavior that adults want. I could go on, but hey, it's a birthday, and I'm sure you folks have some good toasts to raise for the party... What's the purpose of this passage? A) To introduce Dr. Seuss's life. B) To analyze Dr. Seuss's books. C) To describe Dr. Seuss's writing style. D) To celebrate Dr. Seuss's achievements. A:","response":"The purpose of this passage is D) To celebrate Dr. Seuss's achievements. The writer is not merely introducing Dr. Seuss's life or analyzing his books, though these elements are indeed present in the passage. Instead, these aspects of Dr. Seuss's life and work are used in service of acknowledging and honoring his achievements. The author is showing the enduring legacy of Dr. Seuss's work, not only as they influenced their own childhood but now as they bring joy and lessons to their own children. More than that, the writer is praising Dr. Seuss's unique writing style, one that flows \\"with a self-confidence as sure as the words of a Shakespeare poem.\\" The author also highlights the innovative topicality of Dr. Seuss's work, referencing \\"The Lorax\\" and the way it tackles environmental concerns before such topics were widely discussed, appreciating how Seuss was ahead of his time. This acknowledgment of Dr. Seuss's exquisite imagination, unique writing style, moral lessons in his stories, and his forward-thinking themes forms a celebration of his brilliant accomplishments in the field of children's literature. Lastly, the writer ends the passage on a note of festivity, stating it's a birthday and hence a reason to celebrate, thereby further emphasizing the celebratory tone of the passage."},{"question":"Background: Gustaf V was born in Drottningholm Palace in Ekero, Stockholm County, the son of Prince Oscar and Princess Sofia of Nassau. At birth Gustaf was created Duke of Varmland. Upon his father's accession to the throne in 1872, Gustaf became crown prince of both Sweden and Norway. On 8 December 1907, he succeeded his father on the Swedish throne, which had been separated from the Norwegian throne two years earlier. Context: When he ascended the throne, Gustaf V was, at least on paper, a near-autocrat. The 1809 Instrument of Government made the king both head of state and head of government, and ministers were solely responsible to him. However, his father had been forced to accept a government chosen by the majority in Parliament in 1905. Since then, prime ministers had been chosen according to parliamentary support. At first, Gustaf V seemed to be willing to accept parliamentary rule. After the Liberals won a massive landslide in 1911, Gustaf appointed Liberal leader Karl Staaff as Prime Minister. However, during the runup to World War I, the elites objected to Staaff's defence policy. In February 1914, a large crowd of farmers gathered at the royal palace and demanded that the country's defences be strengthened. In his reply, the so-called Courtyard Speech--which was actually written by explorer Sven Hedin, an ardent conservative--Gustaf promised to strengthen the country's defences. Staaff was outraged, telling the king parliamentary rule called for the Crown to stay out of partisan politics. He was also angered that he had not been consulted in advance of the speech. However, Gustaf retorted that he still had the right to \\"communicate freely with the Swedish people.\\" The Staaff government resigned in protest, and Gustaf appointed a government of civil servants headed by Hjalmar Hammarskjold (father of Dag Hammarskjold) in its place. To date, it is the last time that a Swedish king directly intervened in the governing of the country. The 1917 elections showed a heavy gain for the Liberals and Social Democrats. Despite this, Gustaf initially tried to appoint a Conservative government headed by Johan Widen. However, Widen was unable to form a coalition. It was now apparent that Gustaf could no longer appoint a government entirely of his own choosing, nor could he keep a government in office against the will of Parliament. With no choice but to appoint a Liberal as prime minister, he appointed a Liberal-Social Democratic coalition government headed by Staaff's successor as Liberal leader, Nils Eden. The Eden government promptly arrogated most of the king's political powers to itself and enacted numerous reforms, most notably the institution of complete (male and female) universal suffrage in 1918-1919. While Gustaf still formally appointed the ministers, they now had to have the confidence of Parliament. He was now also bound to act on the ministers' advice. Although the provision in the Instrument of Government stating that \\"the King alone shall govern the realm\\" remained unchanged, for all intents and purposes the ministers did the actual governing. Gustaf accepted his reduced role, and reigned for the rest of his life as a model limited constitutional monarch. Parliamentarianism had become a de facto reality in Sweden, even if it would not be formalized until 1974. Gustaf V was considered to have German sympathies during World War I. His political stance during the war was highly influenced by his wife, who felt a strong connection to her German homeland. On 18 December 1914, he sponsored a meeting in Malmo with the other two kings of Scandinavia to demonstrate unity. Another of Gustaf V's objectives was to dispel suspicions that he wanted to bring Sweden into the war on Germany's side. Question: What did Gustaf say about the Germans?. Whats the answer?","response":"Gustaf V did not directly say anything specific about the Germans in the information you provided. However, it is mentioned that he was considered to have German sympathies during World War I. His wife, who felt a strong connection to her German homeland, highly influenced his political stance during the war. Gustaf V participated in a meeting with the other two kings of Scandinavia to show unity and to remove any suspicions that he wanted Sweden to join the war on Germany's side."},{"question":"Write a text based on this summary: america online may link to cbs news Text:","response":"America Online, the prominent internet service provider, is currently exploring the possibility of establishing a partnership with CBS News, the renowned American television and radio service news division.

From its source in Hopkinton the river flows in a northeasterly direction (after first coursing due south through Milford), traveling through 23 cities and towns before reaching the Atlantic Ocean at Boston. - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. - The Cold War was a state of political and military tension after World War II between powers in the Eastern Bloc (the Soviet Union and its satellite states) and powers in the Western Bloc (the United States, its NATO allies and others). Historians do not fully agree on the dates, but a common timeframe is the period (the second half of the 20th century) between 1947, the year the Truman Doctrine (a U.S. policy pledging to aid nations threatened by Soviet expansionism) was announced, and 1991, the year the Soviet Union collapsed. - Engineers design materials, structures, and systems while considering the limitations imposed by practicality, regulation, safety, and cost. The word \\"engineer (\\"from the Latin \\"ingeniator\\"\\")\\" is derived from the Latin words \\"ingeniare\\" (\\"to contrive, devise\\") and \\"ingenium\\" (\\"cleverness\\"). The foundation education of an engineer is typically a 4-year bachelor's degree or in some countries, a master's degree in an engineering discipline plus 46 years peer-reviewed professional practice culminating in a project report or thesis. Engineers who seek a professional engineer license in N. America will be required to take further exams in ethics, law and professional practice. - Radar is an object-detection system that uses radio waves to determine the range, angle, or velocity of objects. It can be used to detect aircraft, ships, spacecraft, guided missiles, motor vehicles, weather formations, and terrain. A radar system consists of a transmitter producing electromagnetic waves in the radio or microwaves domain, a transmitting antenna, a receiving antenna (often the same antenna is used for transmitting and receiving) and a receiver and processor to determine properties of the object(s). Radio waves (pulsed or continuous) from the transmitter reflect off the object and return to the receiver, giving information about the object's location and speed. Radar was developed secretly for military use by several nations in the period before and during World War II. The term \\"RADAR\\" was coined in 1940 by the United States Navy as an acronym for RAdio Detection And Ranging or RAdio Direction And Ranging. The term \\"radar\\" has since entered English and other languages as a common noun, losing all capitalization. - Michael Stanley Dukakis (born November 3, 1933, Greek: ) is an American politician who served as the 65th and 67th Governor of Massachusetts, from 1975 to 1979 and 1983 to 1991 respectively. He is the longest-serving governor in Massachusetts history and only the second Greek-American governor in U.S. history, after Spiro Agnew.

A member of the U.S. Republican Party, he was previously a congressman, ambassador, and Director of Central Intelligence. He is the oldest living former President and Vice President. Since 2000, Bush has often been referred to as \\"George H. W. Bush\\", \\"Bush 41\\", \\"Bush the Elder\\", or \\"George Bush Senior\\" to distinguish him from his eldest son, George W. Bush, who became the 43rd President of the United States. Prior to his son's presidency, he was simply referred to as George Bush or President Bush. - Spiro Theodore Agnew (November 9, 1918 September 17, 1996) was an American politician who served as the 39th Vice President of the United States from 1969 to 1973, under President Richard Nixon. - The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) is a private research university in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Founded in 1861 in response to the increasing industrialization of the United States, MIT adopted a European polytechnic university model and stressed laboratory instruction in applied science and engineering. Researchers worked on computers, radar, and inertial guidance during World War II and the Cold War. Post-war defense research contributed to the rapid expansion of the faculty and campus under James Killian. The current campus opened in 1916 and extends over along the northern bank of the Charles River basin. - Civil Engineering History of the civil engineering profession. Engineering has been an aspect of life since the beginnings of human existence. The earliest practice of civil engineering may have commenced between 4000 and 2000 BC in ancient Egypt, the Indus Valley Civilization, and Mesopotamia (ancient Iraq) when humans started to abandon a nomadic existence, creating a need for the construction of shelter. During this time, transportation became increasingly important leading to the development of the wheel and sailing. - A civil engineer is a person who practices civil engineering the application of planning, designing, constructing, maintaining, and operating infrastructures while protecting the public and environmental health, as well as improving existing infrastructures that have been neglected.

It is on the east rim of the Pine Creek Gorge, also known as the Grand Canyon of Pennsylvania, which is 800 feet (240 m) deep and nearly 4,000 feet (1,200 m) across here. It also serves as headquarters for the adjoining Colton Point State Park, its sister park on the west rim of the gorge. Leonard Harrison State Park is known for its views of the Pine Creek Gorge, and offers hiking, fishing and hunting, whitewater boating, and camping. The park is in Shippen and Delmar Townships, 10 miles (16 km) west of Wellsboro at the western terminus of Pennsylvania Route 660. Pine Creek flows through the park and has carved the gorge through five major rock formations from the Devonian and Carboniferous periods. Native Americans once used the Pine Creek Path along the creek. The path was later used by lumbermen, and then became the course of a railroad from 1883 to 1988. Since 1996, the 63.4-mile (102.0 km) Pine Creek Rail Trail has followed the creek through the park. The Pine Creek Gorge was named a National Natural Landmark in 1968 and is also protected as a Pennsylvania State Natural Area and Important Bird Area, while Pine Creek is a Pennsylvania Scenic and Wild River. The gorge is home to many species of plants and animals, some of which have been reintroduced to the area. Although the Pine Creek Gorge was clearcut in the 19th and early 20th centuries, it is now covered by second growth forest, thanks in part to the conservation efforts of the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) in the 1930s. The park is named for Leonard Harrison, a Wellsboro lumberman who cut the timber there, then established the park, which he donated to the state in 1922. The CCC improved the park and built many of its original facilities. Since a successful publicity campaign in 1936, the park has been a popular tourist destination and attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors each year. Leonard Harrison State Park... contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the place whose sister park is on the west rim of the gorge?, what is it ?

We have a sentence stating that a man is warming up for a bicycle race. 2. We have a statement suggesting that the man is specifically doing squats as a warm-up exercise.

The original sentence only informs us that the man is warming up for a bicycle race, but it doesn't specify the type of warm-up activity. - It is not possible to tell: This option acknowledges that we don't have enough information to determine whether the man is performing squats or not. Since the original sentence only tells us that the man is warming up and doesn't mention any specific exercise, we can't be sure that he's doing squats. - No: To reach this conclusion, we would need evidence that the man is not doing squats as part of his warm-up. However, the original sentence doesn't provide this kind of information either.

Seeking shelter to recover from his injuries, Michael steals a kitchen knife from an elderly couple's house and kills their teenage neighbor.

Paramedic Jimmy Lloyd (Lance Guest) starts to develop romantic feelings for Laurie, despite the chagrin of head nurse Virginia Alves (Gloria Gifford) and explains to her about Michael; he soon realizes Laurie is in a comatose state.

Once Michael arrives at the Haddonfield Memorial Hospital, he cuts the phone lines, and after killing most of the hospital personnel using various tools and methods, he reaches Laurie's room, but finds it empty.

Translate to Finnish Finnish:","response":"Tähän asti sille on ehkä annettu vähemmän painoarvoa suhteessa koulutukseen. Finnish: Koulutukseen liittyen tähän asti on saattanut kohdistua vähäisempi painoarvo. Kuitenkin ymmärrämme, että kyseisen asiayhteyden tai aiheen merkitys voi kasvaa tulevaisuudessa. Koulutuksen alalla on jatkuvasti kehittyviä toimintatapoja, lähestymistapoja ja teorioita, mikä tarkoittaa, että aiemmin vähemmän huomioon otettuja tekijöitä voidaan tutkia ja arvostaa enemmän tulevaisuudessa. Nykyisessä globaalissa yhteiskunnassa koulutus on entistä tärkeämpää, sillä se antaa ihmisille tietoja, taitoja ja kompetensseja, jotka ovat välttämättömiä heidän menestykselleen ja hyvinvoinnilleen. Tämän vuoksi koulutukseen liittyviin aiheisiin ja niiden merkitykseen tulisi suhtautua vakavasti sekä pyrkiä edistämään niiden tunnustamista ja arvostusta. Yksi esimerkki sellaisesta alasta, joka on saanut vasta viime aikoina enemmän huomiota, on elinikäinen oppiminen. Se tarkoittaa sitä, että yksilöiden on jatkuvasti päivitettävä tietojaan ja taitojaan vastaamaan nykyisiä ja tulevia työmarkkinoita. Tällainen koulutusmalli auttaa varmistamaan, että ihmiset ovat joustavia, mukautuvat ja kykenevät kohtaamaan uusia haasteita sekä taloudellisella että henkilökohtaisella tasolla. Toinen esimerkki on kestävä kehitys ja sen integroiminen koulutukseen. Yhä useammat koulutusjärjestelmät maailmanlaajuisesti tunnistavat tarpeen opettaa oppilaille kestävän kehityksen periaatteita ja käytäntöjä, joihin kuuluu esimerkiksi ympäristönsuojelu, sosiaalinen oikeudenmukaisuus ja taloudellinen vakaus. Tämä auttaa valmistamaan nuoria sukupolvia kohtaamaan maailmanlaajuisia haasteita ja rakentamaan kestävämpiä ja vastuullisempia yhteiskuntia. Nämä kaksi esimerkkiä osoittavat, että koulutukseen liittyviä aiheita, joihin on aiemmin kiinnitetty vähemmän huomiota, voidaan nyt tunnustaa ja arvostaa enemmän. Samalla ne korostavat koulutuksen merkitystä yksilöiden ja yhteiskuntien hyvinvoinnin kannalta. Jos haluamme rakentaa parempia tulevaisuudennäkymiä koko maailmalle, meidän on jatkuvasti varmistettava, että koulutusjärjestelmät ja -käytännöt ovat ajan tasalla ja ottavat huomioon eri alat ja niiden tarpeet."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Jeffrey is an avid grower of plants and he currently has some daisies and roses in his bedroom.

A:","response":"No, the correct answer is not \\"layers of fat.\\" The question \\"what are a source of food for many fish species?\\" can be answered by referring to the concept of Keystone species. Keystone species are crucial organisms within an ecosystem that disproportionately contribute to the balance and stability of the entire system. These species typically play a critical role in maintaining essential interactions, such as predation and resource distribution among other organisms. The removal or loss of a keystone species can lead to significant shifts in the structure and function of an ecosystem, often causing cascading effects throughout the entire area. In the context of fish species, keystone species can serve as either a primary or secondary source of food. As primary food sources, these species directly provide sustenance to fish through grazing, predation, or scavenging activities. For example, certain types of plankton serve as food for small fish, which are then consumed by larger fish, establishing a vital food chain. Moreover, many fish and invertebrates serve critical roles as predators and prey, contributing to the stability and diversity of aquatic ecosystems. As secondary sources of food, keystone species influence fish survival by supporting the overall health and productivity of an environment. For instance, some fish depend on the presence of coral reefs, mangrove forests, or aquatic plants to provide crucial feeding, breeding, and sheltering opportunities. These habitats are often maintained by keystone species, such as parrotfish, which help keep algae under control, allowing corals to grow and remain healthy. In conclusion, keystone species are essential components of many ecosystems, providing food directly or indirectly to a variety of fish species. Although \\"layers of fat\\" might be a source of energy for some fish, it is not the correct answer to the question of what serves as a source of food for many fish species. Keystone species and their vital influence on aquatic ecosystems are the more accurate and precise answer to this question."},{"question":"(1) The test above does not distinguish between more complex distributions , such as quantum and classical , or between fermionic and bosonic statistics . (2) The above test does not distinguish between more complex distributions , such as quantum and classical , or between fermionic and bosonic statistics . Do these two sentences mean the same thing?","response":"Yes, the two sentences essentially convey the same meaning. Both sentences express that the test in question does not differentiate between complex distributions like quantum and classical or between statistical categories such as fermionic and bosonic. There is a slight difference in the structure of the two sentences due to the placement of the wording: 1. In Sentence 1, the phrase \\"The test above\\" is followed by \\"does not distinguish between more complex distributions,\\" and then a comma is included before listing the specific examples (quantum and classical), followed by another comma before mentioning the distinctions in statistical categories (fermionic and bosonic statistics). 2. In Sentence 2, the structure is the same, however, it includes one less comma, merging the list of specific complex distributions and statistical categories into one continuous list. The difference in comma usage and the presence of the number (1) and (2) before each sentence might cause minimal confusion, but the core meaning remains constant in both statements. In summary, both sentences emphasize the test's inability to differentiate between complex distributions and statistical categories, thus they can be considered to convey the same idea."},{"question":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

He pokes the basket, and it comes alive and runs around in circles. Jerry pulls the blanket off to reveal Nibbles. An attached note says, \\"Please take care of Little NibblesâHe's always hungry! P.S. Feed him lots of milk.\\" Nibbles then begins licking his lips and rubbing his belly. Seeing that he has no food, Jerry tiptoes out of his hole, spotting Tom asleep by his bowl of milk. Nibbles sees the milk and runs toward it, but Jerry pulls him back and goes out to get the milk for him. Nibbles runs out, accidentally waking Tom. Jerry grabs Nibbles and the two fall into the bowl of milk, splashing it in Tom's face and waking him. Tom, startled, looks around and sees no one, so he starts to drink his milk. Jerry and Nibbles are under the milk holding their breath until Tom unsuspectingly scoops up Nibbles with his tongue. Jerry jumps out of the milk and opens the cat's mouth to retrieve Nibbles, which begins the chase. The mice retreat into the mousehole before Tom crashes headfirst into the wall. Jerry builds a pipeline of straws to the milk but Tom turns the tables by grabbing the end of the straw and sucking Nibbles through it.

Question: suppose less changes in weather happens, how will it affect less or slower weathering occuring. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect The answer to this question is:","response":"B: less If less changes in weather occur, it will lead to less or slower weathering of rocks. This is because the main factors that contribute to the weathering process are directly related to the weather conditions and their fluctuations. Let us delve deeper into the reasons behind this. Firstly, one of the primary processes involved in rock weathering is called freeze-thaw action. This occurs when water seeps into the cracks of rocks, and then the temperature drops, causing the water to freeze and expand. This expansion exerts pressure on the rocks, further widening the cracks. When the temperature rises again, the ice melts, and the process repeats itself with regular fluctuations in temperature. If less change in the weather were to occur and the temperature remains more stable, this freeze-thaw cycle would be less frequent, thus slowing down the weathering process. Secondly, changes in weather, such as variations in humidity levels, can significantly contribute to chemical weathering. Chemical reactions between the rock surfaces and the water molecules in the air can cause the breakdown of minerals in the rocks, leading to their eventual disintegration. In an environment with more stable humidity levels, the rate of chemical weathering will be reduced, thereby slowing down the overall rate of rock weathering. Additionally, temperature fluctuations due to weather changes can also cause rocks to expand and contract as they heat up and cool down, leading to cracks and, ultimately, weathering. If less change in weather were to take place, resulting in a more stable temperature, this process would be less prominent, and the weathering of rocks would be slower. Lastly, weather changes, such as intense storms and heavy rainfall, play a crucial role in the physical erosion of rock surfaces. When these weather events become less frequent due to more stable weather conditions, the rate of erosion and the overall weathering process will be slowed down. In conclusion, slower or less frequent changes in weather will lead to a reduction in the various factors that contribute to rock weathering. This, in turn, will result in less or slower weathering overall, as it minimizes the opportunities for various weathering processes to take place. Hence, the answer is B: less."},{"question":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

After the Revolution of 1688, and the accession of William of Orange as King, he was once again at odds with his Protestant rulers, and he refused to take up his seat in Parliament. As a staunch Episcopalian, Bruce was considered a potential Jacobite threat. In 1693 he was briefly imprisoned in Stirling Castle for refusing to appear before the Privy Council. He was incarcerated again at Stirling in 1694, and from 1696 in Edinburgh Castle. Bruce was expelled from parliament in 1702, his seat passing to his son John Bruce. Despite these imprisonments, he continued his architectural work, indeed the 1690s and 1700s were his most prolific years. Bruce was imprisoned at Edinburgh Castle again in 1708 and was only released a short time before his death, at the beginning of 1710.He was buried in the family mausoleum at Kinross Kirk.

Sugaring is the process of desiccating a food by first dehydrating it, then packing it with pure sugar. This sugar can be crystalline in the form of table or raw sugar, or it can be a high sugar density liquid such as honey, syrup or molasses. The purpose of sugaring is to create an environment hostile to microbial life and prevent food spoilage. Sugaring is commonly used to preserve fruits as well as vegetables such as ginger. From time to time sugaring has also been used for non-food preservations. For example, honey was used as part of the mummification process in some ancient Egyptian rites. A risk in sugaring is that sugar itself attracts moisture. Once a sufficient moisture level is reached, native yeast in the environment will come out of dormancy and begin to ferment the sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide. This leads to the process of fermentation. Although fermentation can be used as a food preservation method, it must be intentionally controlled, or the results will tend to be unpleasant. Peter decided to sugar mangoes, ginger, pineapples, peaches to preserve them for next spring. He also bought blueberries and raspberries to eat fresh. Which fruit had a lower sugar content, mangoes or blueberries? Answer:","response":"Blueberries have a lower sugar content compared to mangoes. To provide a detailed explanation, let us first understand the sugar composition of both fruits: - Mangoes: Mangoes are tropical fruits known for their sweet taste and fragrant aroma. They contain natural sugars such as sucrose, fructose, and glucose. On average, a 100-gram serving of ripe mango contains approximately 13 to 15 grams of sugar. This sweetness is one of the reasons that mangoes are often used in desserts, smoothies, and other sweet dishes. - Blueberries: Blueberries are small, round fruits that are often consumed fresh, added to breakfast cereals, or used as an ingredient in baked goods and jams. They have a mildly sweet taste with a slightly tart undertone. In comparison to mangoes, blueberries contain a significantly lower amount of sugar. A 100-gram serving of blueberries generally contains around 10 grams of sugar. Given the sugar content in both fruits, it is evident that blueberries have a lower sugar content than mangoes. Peter's decision to sugar mangoes, ginger, pineapples, and peaches allows him to take advantage of the fruits' naturally high sugar content to preserve them better for the next spring season. On the other hand, the blueberries and raspberries he bought to eat fresh can be enjoyed without added sugar, since their sugar content is relatively lower. It is worth noting that even though blueberries have less sugar than mangoes, they are still a source of natural sugar, and consuming them in moderation is recommended as part of a balanced diet. Both fruits provide essential nutrients, including vitamins, minerals, fiber, and antioxidants, contributing to overall health and well-being."},{"question":"Teacher:Given a sentence in the Japanese, provide an equivalent translation in Bahasa Indonesia that retains the same meaning through the translation.

A sperm and egg meet inside a woman's fallopian tube: Age might affect the quality of a woman's eggs, but this step in the process does not directly involve the uterus. 2. The fertilized egg, now a zygote, travels to the uterus: Again, age might affect the quality of the egg, but the uterus is not involved in this step. 3. The zygote implants in the uterus: Age could affect the uterus's ability to support implantation, possibly due to a thinner uterine lining or a decrease in blood supply to the uterus. This might result in lower chances of a successful pregnancy. 4. The zygote becomes an embryo, the embryo becomes a fetus, and the fetus grows for approximately 9 months: Age could increase the risk of pregnancy complications, including those related to the uterus, which might result in a higher likelihood of miscarriage, stillbirth, or premature birth. 5. The woman gives birth to a baby: An older uterus might have decreased strength and elasticity, potentially affecting the ease and safety of delivery (i.e., increased risk of complications). Given this analysis, an older and potentially less healthy uterus could lead to a higher likelihood of unsuccessful implantation, pregnancy complications, or delivery issues, all of which could contribute to a woman having fewer babies. Therefore, the answer is B: less."},{"question":"Q:- Slide out the bottom rack - Take a dirty plate - Rinse the plate - Place the dish in the rack - Repeat leaving enough space for water to reach all items - Fill the soap cup - Turn on the dishwasher. What might be the first step of the process? A:","response":"The first step of the process is sliding out the bottom rack of the dishwasher. This step is essential as it grants easy access to the dishwasher's interior, enabling you to effectively load dirty dishes and optimize the washing process. To perform this step, kindly follow the detailed procedure outlined below: 1. Approach the dishwasher and ensure it is properly closed and turned off. This is paramount for safety and to prevent any damage to the appliance while handling it. 2. Gently grasp the bottom rack using both hands, preferably by holding onto the sides. Make sure your grip is secure but not too tight to avoid straining the rack's components. 3. Slowly and carefully slide the bottom rack outwards, towards you.

He is best known for his solo material, and as a member of Fistful of Mercy and RNDM. Combining poetic lyrics with a layered sonic palette, Arthur has built his reputation over the years through critically acclaimed releases and constant touring; his unique solo live performances often incorporate the use of a number of distortion and loop pedals, and his shows are recorded live at the soundboard and made available to concertgoers immediately following the show on recordable media. Arthur was discovered by Peter Gabriel in the mid-1990s, and signed to Gabriel's Real World label as the first North American artist on the label's roster. Joseph began writing and playing music in his early teens, after inheriting an electronic keyboard from his aunt. At age 16, he played bass in a blues band called Frankie Starr and the Chill Factor, which disbanded by 1995. Initially, Arthur sought to become a noted bass guitarist, stating: \\"I never started singing until I was in my early 20s. I remember thinking, 'OK - I am not a singer, I am a musician.' I wanted to be this like heroic bass player so I listened to people like Jaco Pastorius, to Bitches Brew over and over again. And then like Nirvana came out and I was blown away and then I got into Bob Dylan. Around that time I started playing acoustic guitar and realized I could actually write songs if I wasn't playing complicated bass lines.\\" Joseph graduated from Firestone High School in 1990 and continued developing his music. In the early 1990s, Arthur relocated to Atlanta, Georgia, continuing to record home demos, playing local clubs and working as a guitar salesman at Clark Music Store. In 1996, Peter Gabriel's A&R associate Harvey Schartz presented Gabriel with a demo of Arthur's first EP, Cut and Blind. Gabriel and Schwartz arranged a live audition at The Fez nightclub in New York City, and Arthur flew up from Atlanta. The night was a success; not only was Lou Reed a guest in the audience, but within a few months Arthur was officially signed, making him the first American recording artist signed to Gabriel's label. Arthur recorded his debut album at Gabriel's Real World Studios in England with producer Markus Dravs (Bjork, Coldplay, Arcade Fire). The debut album Big City Secrets was released worldwide in spring 1997, and Arthur joined Gabriel's WOMAD tour in Europe. Big City Secrets displayed Arthur's often angsty and emotionally wrought lyrics coupled with diverse instrumentation, which he himself described as \\"someone struggling to heal over experimental folk-rock\\", but went virtually unnoticed by the mainstream. Two years later, he recorded an EP called Vacancy, which earned him a Grammy nomination in 2000 for best recording package. Did the album reach the charts?","response":"You did not provide information about the chart performance of the album Big City Secrets.

When I ask who would achieve this feat first, Ani, the older of the two. quips with a big smile, \\"The big sister first, of course.\\" But it is a dream that is increasingly hard to achieve for Indonesian players. Indonesia's economic growth is visible in the sprawling new apartments that dot the Jakarta skyline, and the modern buildings come with sporting facilities not previously available to many Indonesians. Tennis courts are a common feature. But the sport is not necessarily more popular today than a few years ago, when Indonesian tennis was a force to be reckoned with, at least regionally. Yayuk Basuki was Indonesia's biggest tennis star, winning four Asian Games gold medals in the 1980s and 1990s. She also reached the quarter finals of Wimbledon in 1997, the furthest any Indonesian has ever gone at a Grand Slam event. Later that year she also become the highest-ever WTF ranked tennis player from Indonesia, reaching number 19. Today she runs the Yayuk Basuki Tennis Academy, teaching more than 150 under-18-year-olds the fundamentals of the game. She claims her school charges less than others in Jakarta, because she wants to give everyone a chance to play. Yayuk's school has trouble finding affordable facilities to use. There are no free public tennis courts in Indonesia. Even government facilities charge fees, and Yayuk says the fees go up every year. \\"We're not asking for free facilities,\\" Yayuk said. \\"But if I can subsidise kids who are not wealthy enough to pay, why can't the government also subsidise if they have good facilities?\\" The situation means tennis remains known as a sport for the wealthy in the country. Most children who pick up tennis at a young age come from the upper middle class, who have access to a court at home, or whose family can afford to put them in a club. However, the trouble for Indonesia is that the majority of the privileged children are not interested in pursuing tennis in the way that twins Ana and Ani are. Their drive saw the twins win the doubles at the the New Armada tournament, and in the singles Ani was the losing finalist, and Ana reached the semis. Private tennis instructor Alex Santoso sees a lot of potential in some of his students. But he says those from richer families do not want to become professionals, as there is no guarantee they can \\"make a lot of money\\" by becoming a top-ranked male ATP or female WTA player. And he claims that with the current competition and development programmes in Indonesia \\"it's impossible to get there\\". The Indonesian Tennis Association, known as Pelti, is the governing body of tennis in the country. Many Indonesians who are involved in tennis criticise Pelti for neglecting the development of young players, which has led to the talent drain in the last few years. Its chairman Maman Wirjawan admits that there is a lot of work to be done, but refuses to take the blame. \\"It's not only the government's job. The government has many problems as well. So we have to support the government. We have to help find ways to build sport in this country,\\" he says. Since taking on the leadership of Pelti in 2012 he says he has been working on a sustainable programme to develop young talent. \\"We start from junior [level] - we are now planning to have tournaments in many cities, especially big cities, [in] 10 to 15 cities throughout the nation,\\" he explains. \\"We will hold it on a monthly basis for the next five years.\\" Wirjawan's programme can only succeed with corporate sponsorship. But he is a brother of Indonesia's Trade Minister Gita Wirjawan, and has extensive experience in port and oil and gas businesses. Many hope that his wide network can help secure the support tennis needs. That will give much comfort to potential talents like twins Ani and Ana who will be able to play more matches in their home town and improve their skills. But unless and until that happens, the sacrifices made by the twins and their family may be high-risk, and the outlook for Indonesian tennis remains bleak. Summarize the main points of that article.","response":"This article is about two 12-year-old twin sisters, Fitriani Sabatini and Fitriana Sabrina, who are really good at playing tennis in their age group.

The passage describes various changes that happened during his tenure, and you are asked to determine if the question regarding his tenure can be answered using the given passage. Question: What did the university undergo during Hutchins 33-year tenure? First, let's identify the guidelines provided in the passage: 1. Hutchins eliminated varsity football to emphasize academics over athletics. 2. He instituted the undergraduate college's liberal-arts curriculum known as the Common Core. 3. He organized the university's graduate work into its current four divisions. 4. Hutchins proposed an unsuccessful plan to merge the University of Chicago and Northwestern University. 5. The University of Chicago Hospitals finished construction and enrolled its first medical students during his tenure. 6. The Committee on Social Thought was created during his term. Now, let's analyze the question. The question asks about the changes the university underwent during Hutchins' 33-year tenure. However, the passage states that his tenure lasted for 24 years, not 33. This discrepancy means we cannot accurately answer the question based on the information provided in the passage. Therefore, following the guidelines mentioned in the task, the output should be 'False' as the information in the passage is not sufficient to answer the question accurately."},{"question":"Premise: In five minutes a brisk young doctor arrived, hastily summoned.

Answer the above question based on the context below: In June 1911 Holst and his Morley College students gave the first performance since the seventeenth century of Purcell's The Fairy-Queen. The full score had been lost soon after Purcell's death in 1695, and had only recently been found. Twenty-eight Morley students copied out the complete vocal and orchestral parts. There were 1,500 pages of music and it took the students almost eighteen months to copy them out in their spare time. A concert performance of the work was given at The Old Vic, preceded by an introductory talk by Vaughan Williams. The Times praised Holst and his forces for \\"a most interesting and artistic performance of this very important work\\".After this success, Holst was disappointed the following year by the lukewarm reception of his choral work The Cloud Messenger. He again went travelling, accepting an invitation from H. Balfour Gardiner to join him and the brothers Clifford and Arnold Bax in Spain. During this holiday Clifford Bax introduced Holst to astrology, an interest that later inspired his suite The Planets. Holst cast his friends' horoscopes for the rest of his life and referred to astrology as his \\"pet vice\\".In 1913, St Paul's Girls' School opened a new music wing, and Holst composed St Paul's Suite for the occasion. The new building contained a sound-proof room, handsomely equipped, where he could work undisturbed. Holst and his family moved to a house in Brook Green, very close to the school. For the previous six years they had lived in a pretty house overlooking the Thames at Barnes, but the river air, frequently foggy, affected his breathing. For use at weekends and during school holidays, Holst and his wife bought a cottage in Thaxted, Essex, surrounded by mediaeval buildings and ample rambling opportunities. In 1917 they moved to a house in the centre of the town, where they stayed until 1925.

Unlike the bumbling Ustinov, Suchet gets the suave sophistication and incisive intellect of the great detective exactly right. This is a great DVD set for all Agatha Christie fans. Answer: A:","response":"The tone of the product review appears to be predominantly positive. Here's a deeper look at why this is the case: 1. The statement \\"If there was ever a man born to play Poirot, it is David Suchet\\" is undeniably positive. The use of \\"ever\\" and \\"born to play\\" creates an impression of approval and shows the author believes the actor has done an extraordinary job portraying the character of Poirot. 2. The comparison to the other actor, Ustinov, who is referred to as \\"bumbling\\", may initially seem negative, but is primarily used to even further elevate the performance of David Suchet. Thus, it serves a positive purpose. 3. Describing Suchet's handling of Poirot's character as 'getting the suave sophistication and incisive intellect of the great detective exactly right', is high praise indeed. Labelling the detective as 'great' also indicates a positive sentiment towards the character and shows the reviewer's apparent love for this character. 4. The final portion of the review, \\"this is a great DVD set for all Agatha Christie fans\\", is another clear positive endorsement for the product in question. The reviewer outright states that this DVD set is \\"great\\" and universally recommends it to all fans of Agatha Christie. This implies that the reviewer has faith that other fans of Christie will likely enjoy this DVD set as much as they have, which again emphasizes the positive tone. Therefore, the overall tone of the product review is positive due to its use of praising terms and phrases, admiration for the actor, and a strong recommendation for any fan of Agatha Christie's works. It expresses a high level of satisfaction with the DVD set and the actor's performance in particular."},{"question":"Rate the similarity of the following two sentences on a scale from 0 to 5, where 0 is \\"no meaning overlap\\" and 5 is \\"means the same thing\\"?

The battle was primarily fought between the forces of the United States, the United Kingdom, and their allies (commonly known as the Allies) and the forces of Nazi Germany. The Battle of the Bulge took place in the densely forested Ardennes region of Wallonia in eastern Belgium, northeast France, and Luxembourg. The German military had planned a major offensive, code-named Operation \\"Watch on the Rhine,\\" aimed at splitting the Allied forces and capturing the key port city of Antwerp in Belgium. This surprise attack took advantage of the weakened and thinly-spread U.S. forces that were recovering from earlier battles. When the battle began, the Germans launched a surprise attack, overwhelming the initially unprepared Allied forces. The Germans had initial success and were able to create a significant \\"bulge\\" in the frontline, hence the nickname \\"Battle of the Bulge.\\" The German forces exploited poor weather conditions, which made it difficult for the Allies to utilize air support against the German offensive effectively. However, the weather conditions started to improve gradually, and as a result, the Allies were able to utilize their air superiority, providing critical support to the ground troops. The reinforced U.S. Army, aided by British and other Allied forces, began to push back the German advance. Furthermore, the Germans were facing severe shortages in fuel, which severely affected their mobility and ability to sustain the offensive. During the last week of December, critical counter-offensives began taking shape, particularly when General George Patton's U.S. Third Army relieved the besieged city of Bastogne. The battle continued into January, as the German forces tried to maintain their gains. However, by January 25, 1945, the German forces had been pushed back to their original lines, and the Battle of the Bulge was declared over. In conclusion, the winner of the Battle of the Bulge was the Allied forces, primarily composed of the U.S. and British armies. Although the German offensive started strong and initially made significant gains, their inability to maintain momentum, combined with the resilience and determination of the Allied forces, eventually led to their defeat. The outcome of the Battle of the Bulge severely weakened the German military, ultimately leading to the further acceleration of the Allied offensive into Germany and ultimately to the end of World War II in Europe."},{"question":"On Monday, departing Gov.

In Georgia, there is just one legal aid lawyer for every 10,500 eligible poor people. Barnes understood this problem long before he became governor. While in private practice, he handled many pro-bono cases and was a frequent volunteer in the Cobb County office of the federally funded Atlanta Legal Aid Society. Most memorably, he secured a 115 million judgment in 1993 against Fleet Finance for victimizing 18,000 homeowners -- many of them senior citizens -- with its widespread predatory lending mortgage practices. His long-standing commitment to the underserved is certainly admirable, but it should not be viewed as a rare and laudable act of civic virtue. To be admitted to practice law, every attorney must take a professional oath to promote justice -- and every state's ethical rules include language indicating lawyers' responsibility to be guardians of fair play for those living in poverty. In Georgia, many law firms, corporations and private attorneys are working pro bono to serve the neediest clients. Yet only 23 percent of the state's 23,598 active lawyers reported meeting the Georgia State Bar's goal of 50 hours of pro-bono service in 2002. The need for volunteers is most severe outside the five-county Atlanta metropolitan area, where 70 percent of the state's poor people are served by only 24 percent of the state's lawyers. National pro-bono participation is even worse. Only 23 percent of the roughly 1 million attorneys in America volunteer even one hour of pro-bono service annually, according to the ABA.

They have released ten studio albums, twelve compilations, four EPs, and 40 singles. They have spent a total of 182 weeks on the singles and albums charts combined as of 2017, and have accumulated 25 top 75 singles between 1997 and 2012. At their peak of commercial success, Feeder won two Kerrang! For 1999's Yesterday Went Too Soon, the band decided to self-produce the album, brought in Matt Sime for engineering duties and had the album mixed in New York by Andy Wallace. \\"Dry\\" was re-recorded as a full band version after the original acoustic version appeared on \\"Suffocate\\" as a b-side. That single's b-sides featured tracks from the sessions for that album, therefore revealing what sort of direction it would take on. The working title for the album was originally A Life Through Headphones, and was originally set to be a double album. The name change was due to former Take That singer Robbie Williams releasing his solo debut album Life Thru a Lens, with the band not wanting to be compared to him. When the album was released, the band's reputation was on the rise and it entered the UK albums chart at number eight, which was at the time an unexpected chart position for the band. Before that, the band had released the album's first single, \\"Day In Day Out\\", in March 1999 which charted at #31 followed by \\"Insomnia\\" at #22, resulting in their first appearance on Top of the Pops. A week before the album's release, the band played the main stage of the Reading and Leeds festivals, while the title track from the album was at #20 in the singles chart. The album was then released on 30 August 1999. Only one single was lifted from the album after its release, in which a re-recorded version of \\"Paperfaces\\" charted at #41. Some of the album's lyrical themes were derived from Grant's personal perspective of working in a menial supermarket job on a daily basis (\\"Day in Day Out\\"), his experiences after gigs on their US tour (\\"Insomnia\\" and \\"You're My Evergreen\\"), past relationships (the title track and \\"Dry\\"), the music industry (\\"Hole in My Head\\") and \\"fear of commitment in relationships\\" (\\"Anaesthetic\\") amongst others. Musically, the album employed an indie rock feel to it, which also featured extended appearances of an acoustic guitar on some of its tracks. The album was due for release in June, but this was delayed until August to include material written after its completion which the band felt was too good to leave off. Upon its release, the UK music press immediately warmed to the album, which also received Melody Maker 's Album of the Week accolade. The year ended with the band providing support for the Red Hot Chili Peppers at Wembley Arena and Manic Street Preachers at the Millennium Stadium. As of March 2003, the album has been certified gold shipping 100,000 units in the UK, with total counter sales standing at 110,000 as of February 2005. The album was Melody Maker's #24 album of 1999, while Metal Hammer placed the album in at #6 and Kerrang! ranked it at #16.

They are an informal grouping within the infraorder Cetacea, usually excluding dolphins and porpoises. Whales, dolphins and porpoises belong to the order Cetartiodactyla, which consists of even-toed ungulates. Their closest living relatives are the hippopotamuses, having diverged about 40 million years ago. The two parvorders of whales, baleen whales (Mysticeti) and toothed whales (Odontoceti), are thought to have split apart around 34 million years ago. Whales consist of eight extant families: Balaenopteridae (the rorquals), Balaenidae (right whales), Cetotheriidae (the pygmy right whale), Eschrichtiidae (the grey whale), Monodontidae (belugas and narwhals), Physeteridae (the sperm whale), Kogiidae (the dwarf and pygmy sperm whale), and Ziphiidae (the beaked whales). Whales are creatures of the open ocean; they feed, mate, give birth, suckle and raise their young at sea. So extreme is their adaptation to life underwater that they are unable to survive on land. Whales range in size from the 2.6 metres (8.5 ft) and 135 kilograms (298 lb) dwarf sperm whale to the 29.9 metres (98 ft) and 190 metric tons (210 short tons) blue whale, which is the largest creature that has ever lived. The sperm whale is the largest toothed predator on earth. Several species exhibit sexual dimorphism, in that the females are larger than males. Baleen whales have no teeth; instead they have plates of baleen, a fringe-like structure used to expel water while retaining the krill and plankton which they feed on. They use their throat pleats to expand the mouth to take in huge gulps of water. Balaenids have heads that can make up 40% of their body mass to take in water. Toothed whales, on the other hand, have conical teeth adapted to catching fish or squid. Baleen whales have a well developed sense of \\"smell\\", whereas toothed whales have well-developed hearing − their hearing, that is adapted for both air and water, is so well developed that..., can you guess it ?

Variation in plumage also allows for the identification of birds, particularly between species. Visual communication among birds may also involve ritualised displays, which have developed from non-signalling actions such as preening, the adjustments of feather position, pecking, or other behaviour. These displays may signal aggression or submission or may contribute to the formation of pair-bonds. The most elaborate displays occur during courtship, where \\"dances\\" are often formed from complex combinations of many possible component movements; males' breeding success may depend on the quality of such displays.\\".

This piece of cinema holds a significant place in film history, standing alongside The Birth of a Nation and the birth of Mickey Mouse. Many argue that it could be the best Disney movie ever made. From a technical standpoint, the film is highly praised, and it's recognized for its ability to create a captivating sense of mood. While it may not top the list of animated classics for some, there's no denying its far-reaching impact on animation and cinema in general. Every animated feature made after this groundbreaking movie owes a degree of gratitude to it, for it laid the foundation for the genre. With Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs being the first of its kind, it is deserving of admiration and respect.

He served as the head football coach at Washington State University (1915-1917), Purdue University (1921), Louisiana Tech University (1922-1923), University of Wyoming (1924-1926), Haskell Institute--now Haskell Indian Nations University (1929-1932), and Albright College (1937-1942). From 1933 to 1934, Dietz was the head coach of the National Football League's Boston Redskins, where he tallied a mark of 11-11-2. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 2012. Dietz's Indian heritage was first contested in 1916 after former neighbors who settled on the Pacific Coast heard he was posing as an Indian. In December 1918 the Federal Bureau of Investigation looked into his heritage after he fraudulently registered for the draft as a \\"Non-Citizen Indian\\" with an allotment. The Bureau found he had taken on the identity of James One Star, an Oglala man of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation 12 years his senior who had disappeared in Cuba in 1894. Dietz also claimed he was the head of an American film company that produced propaganda films for the war. Dietz divorced De Cora in November 1918, charging her with abandonment. It is not clear how much she knew about his true identity. She died six days after his indictment. Dietz was tried in Spokane, Washington in June 1919 for the first offense. One Star's sister, Sallie Eaglehorse, testified after seeing him for the first time at the trial that Dietz was definitely not her brother. Still, the judge instructed the jury to determine whether Dietz \\"believed\\" he was an Indian, not whether it was true. Despite that others had witnessed his birth in the summer of 1884 or had seen him the following day, Dietz's mother Leanna claimed he was the Indian son of her husband who had been switched a week or more after she had a stillbirth. Dietz's acting ability along with his mother's fallacious testimony (to protect him from prison) resulted in a hung jury, but Dietz was immediately re-indicted. The second trial resulted in a sentence of 30 days in the Spokane County Jail after he pleaded \\"no contest\\". Why was it contested?","response":"William Henry \\"Lone Star\\" Dietz's Indian heritage was contested because there were suspicions about the authenticity of his claims to be of Native American descent.

Investigators discovered that Dietz had assumed the identity of James One Star, an Oglala man from the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation who had disappeared in Cuba in 1894. During Dietz's trial, the testimony of James One Star's sister, Sallie Eaglehorse, further supported the suspicion about his Indian heritage claims. She stated that Dietz was not her brother after seeing him for the first time during the trial. Despite other evidence and testimonies that made it clear Dietz was not Native American, the jury was instructed to determine whether Dietz \\"believed\\" he was Indian, not whether it was true. Dietz's mother Leanna also presented a false testimony to protect her son from prison, which ultimately led to a hung jury.

The diner is operated by a young, beautiful woman, Cora Smith, and her much older husband, Nick Papadakis, a hardworking but unimaginative immigrant from Greece. Frank and Cora start to have an affair soon after they meet. Cora is tired of her situation, married to an older man she does not love, and working at a diner that she wishes to own and improve. She and Frank scheme to murder Nick to start a new life together without her losing the diner. Their first attempt at the murder is a failure, but Nick is not even aware they tried to kill him, so goes about living his life as usual. Frank and Cora succeed with their next attempt. The local prosecutor suspects what has actually occurred but does not have enough evidence to prove it. As a tactic intended to get Cora and Frank to turn on one another, he tries only Cora for the crime. Although they turn against each other, a clever ploy from Cora's lawyer, Katz, prevents Cora's full confession from coming into the hands of the prosecutor. With the tactic having failed to generate any new evidence for the prosecution, Cora benefits from a deal in which she pleads guilty to manslaughter and is sentenced to probation. Months later, Frank has an affair with Madge Gorland while Cora is out of town. When Cora returns, she tells Frank she is pregnant. That night, Katz's assistant, Kennedy, appears at their door and threatens to expose them unless they give him 10,000.

If you're not sure that you would, perhaps you should question if the behavior is really that risky. If you definitely would, then you should speak to your friend immediately about it. Issues that you wouldn't want to hold your tongue about are those in which your friend may be in danger or pose a danger to others. These include drinking and driving, unprotected sex, theft or using drugs. Before you talk to your friend, understanding why they are acting the way they are is often helpful. This allows you to go into your conversation with a clearer idea of what your friend is going through, which may provide you with more ways to help. Asking other friends or those around that person may help you figure out why they are behaving the way they are. You might mention to some other friends, “I've noticed Cassidy has been going out and drinking a lot lately. Have you noticed that, too? Are you concerned?” Many different psychological disorders cause people to behave in risky ways. Those with ADHD, Bipolar disorder, Borderline Personality Disorder, Schizoaffective Disorder, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, or another mental health condition may be more inclined to exhibit risky behavior. Knowing if a mental health condition is the underlying reason for your friend's uncharacteristic behavior can give you ideas about how to get help, such as adjusting medication or going to see a doctor. If you are unsure of yourself and what to say, having other people who care about your friend there with you may be helpful. Additionally, asking a school counselor or addiction specialist to speak with your friend is beneficial, particularly if drinking or drug use is your concern. Professionals can answer questions and offer support that you may not be able to, and they are experienced in having these types of meetings, which may help things to stay calm and productive. You'll need to take your friend's personality into consideration when planning the meeting. If they are deeply private or even paranoid, they may react better to a one-on-one conversation. Having a group of people there may make them become defensive. If you witness your friend doing something extremely risky and dangerous, such as doubling their narcotic prescription, you may need to enlist the help of law enforcement and/or EMS. If you tell your friend to stop and they don't listen, call 9-1-1. Receiving assistance in this way is the best option in extreme situations. This will ensure their safety, your safety, and the safety of anyone else who is involved. What is a summary?","response":"In summary, if your friend is exhibiting risky behavior, first determine if it's worth discussing with them. If it is, try to understand why they are acting this way, potentially by asking others or considering underlying mental health conditions. When planning to address the issue, consider their personality and possibly involve professionals or other friends for support. In extreme situations where they pose a danger to themselves or others, it may be necessary to call emergency services for assistance."},{"question":"The tooth fairy's trash became another man's treasure Saturday when a discolored molar that once belonged to John Lennon was put up for auction.

The deeper you go into toward the Earths core, the hotter it gets. At the core it is really hot. All that heat tries to rise toward the surface. In the Mantle, the rock is partially melted and is able to move. As it is heated, the material in the mantle moves toward the surface. As the mantle material rises, it cools. When it reaches the Earths crust, it is mostly stopped. A little of the material can break through the surface, but not all. Instead, it begins to move horizontally. The mantle material moves horizontally away from a mid-ocean ridge crest. Toward the surface, the mantle material starts to cool. As it cools it sinks back down into the mantle. These areas are where deep sea trench occur. The material sinks back down to the core. The system operates like a giant conveyor belt. The motion due to heating and cooling is called convection. Do you have any questions?","response":"Of course, sweetie! Here's a simpler way to understand it: Imagine you're heating up a pot of soup on the stove. The heat from the stove warms up the soup at the bottom of the pot first. As the soup at the bottom gets hot, it starts to rise towards the top. This is because warm stuff usually likes to go up. Now, when the hot soup gets to the top, it starts to cool down, because it's further away from the heat of the stove. Cool stuff likes to go down. So, it goes back down to the bottom of the pot to heat up again. This cycle of hot soup rising and cool soup falling is what we call 'convection.' The same thing happens in the Earth. The inside of the Earth is really hot, kind of like our stove's heat. When the rock deep inside the Earth gets heated up, it rises to the surface. But, when it reaches the top, it cools down and moves aside. Then, it slowly sinks back down to get heated up again. This movement is also a kind of convection - just like in our soup pot. Sometimes, when the heated rock reaches the Earth's top layer, some of it might even break through and ooze out onto the Earth's surface. This is what happens when a volcano erupts!

Overall, it's \\"one of the best films to come out of Marvel Studios.\\" \\"Smart, snappy, politically savvy, and blessedly fast on its feet,\\" is how Peter Travers describes it. \\"Sure, it's too much and way too familiar,\\" but it \\"brings the fun, the fierce, and the fireworks,\\" he writes at Rolling Stone. \\"Summer, we have liftoff.\\" Travers also praises Chris Evans \\"for bringing a charming quirk\\" to the title character. Expand this summary.","response":"Sure, kiddo! So, you know how sometimes you play with your toys and you'd have your superhero action figures fight each other? Well, that's what happened in a big movie called Captain America: Civil War. It's like a huge play fight between all your favorite Marvel superheroes like Iron Man, Captain America, and even Spider-Man! So, imagine if your toys were on an adventure and accidentally broke a few other toys? Would they need someone to watch them? That's the problem in the movie. After a mission goes wrong, it's asked if superheroes should have someone looking over their actions, like a grown-up watches you. Some superheroes think it's a good idea, and some don't - thus the play fight begins. People who watch a lot of movies (they're called critics) and regular folks who like to watch movies (audiences) thought this movie was really good. Joe from the Wall Street Journal says it's like a big, fun party with your favorite comic book characters. There's lots of action (think about when your toys do daring stunts and cool moves) mixed with comedy (which means lots of laughing). Plus, everything that happens in the story makes sense, which doesn't always happen in superhero movies. And hey, Spider-Man shows up too, which many think is very cool! And guess what? They say that if how Spider-Man is in this movie is a sign of what's to come, superhero movies are going to get even better! Brian from CNN thinks this movie feels like another Avengers film, like the ones you've seen before, but even better! It has lots of superheroes, more than usual, but it still stays interesting and fun. The ending, according to him, could have been better, but it's not too bad. Jamelle from Slate says the movie is not too serious, it's not dark, rather it's colorful and fun like when you let your imagination run wild during playtime. The best part? It has a really cool superhero fight, like the ones you set up with your toys, only bigger and better! All in all, according to most people, Captain America: Civil War is a great movie. It's smart, quick, and fun. And most importantly, it's jam-packed with action, just like the adventures your toys go on! So, imagine, kiddo, if your toys got their own big movie - that's exactly how cool and fun this film is!"},{"question":"Premise: \\"Three chefs in uniform are working in an assembly line to prepare pastries.\\" Based on this premise, can we conclude that the hypothesis \\"The chefs are in a kitchen.\\" is true? Options: - yes - it is not possible to tell - no Step by step answer:","response":"1. The premise given is: \\"Three chefs in uniform are working in an assembly line to prepare pastries.\\" 2. The hypothesis is: \\"The chefs are in a kitchen.\\" 3. To evaluate whether the hypothesis is true based on the premise, let's consider the information provided in the premise and any further assumptions. 4. The premise informs us that there are three chefs, they are in uniform, working in an assembly line, and preparing pastries. 5. Typically, an assembly line is a manufacturing process in which parts or components are added as the product moves through sequential stations. In culinary terms, an assembly line may refer to a system where each chef performs a specific task as the food moves along a line, allowing for efficient and rapid production of a large volume of food. 6. Kitchens are often the primary locations where chefs work to prepare food. However, the premise does not explicitly state that the chefs are in a kitchen. 7. As the chefs are preparing pastries, which typically takes place within some cooking environment, it can be inferred that they are likely in a kitchen or a similar setting. 8. However, it is important to note that there may be other locations where an assembly line for preparing pastries exists, such as a bakery, a pastry production facility, or even an event setting. 9. Due to the lack of specific information regarding their location in the premise, we cannot definitively confirm that the chefs are in a kitchen. Conclusion: Based on the given premise, it is not possible to tell whether the hypothesis \\"The chefs are in a kitchen.\\" is true."},{"question":"Want an actionpacked travelling adventure and the opportunity to make a real difference Add punctuation","response":"Want an action-packed traveling adventure, and the opportunity to make a real difference?

What may happen after purchasing a photographers package ?","response":"After purchasing a photographer's package for an event such as a wedding, several things may happen as part of the process. The detailed journey from purchasing the package to receiving the final product involves multiple steps, and it can be described as follows: 1. Initial Consultation and Booking: Once you have purchased a photographer's package, the photographer will get in touch with you to discuss your event and your expectations. During this consultation, you can clarify any questions, share your preferences, and provide details about the event. The photographer may also request a deposit to secure their services for your specified date. 2. Pre-event Preparations: Depending on the package you selected, the photographer may offer a pre-event photoshoot or consultation. This can include engagement photos, venue scouting, or discussing ideas for specific shots and locations. This stage helps both you and the photographer have a better understanding of the timeline and any unique requirements for the event. 3. The Event: On the day of the event, the photographer will arrive early to set up their equipment and familiarize themselves with the venue. They will then proceed to capture the most important moments, as well as candid shots and group photos, according to your previously discussed preferences and any special requests. 4. Post-event Processing and Editing: After the event, the photographer will proceed to process and edit the photographs. This can involve selecting the best shots, applying color correction, adjusting brightness and contrast, and applying any specific styles or filters that you may have agreed upon during the initial consultation. 5. Proofing and Selection: Once the photographer has completed the editing, they will typically provide a proof gallery for you to review. This allows you to view the images, request any additional editing or changes, and select your favorites for final delivery, depending on the package purchased. 6. Final Delivery: After you have made your selections and any further edits have been completed, the photographer will provide you with the final, high-resolution images. These can be delivered in a variety of formats, such as digital files, prints, or a custom photo album, based on your package and preferences. 7. Additional Services and Products: In some cases, photographers may offer additional services and products after the event, such as creating large-format prints, canvas wraps, or custom photo books. These items can be ordered separately and could be particularly valuable as keepsakes or gifts. 8. Reviews and Referrals: After receiving your final photographs, you may be asked by the photographer to provide a review or testimonial of their services. This helps the photographer build their reputation and gain new clients. You may also recommend the photographer to friends, family, or colleagues who are looking for a professional photographer for their future events. In conclusion, after purchasing a photographer's package, you can expect a series of steps to take place: consultation, pre-event preparations, the actual event, post-event processing and editing, proofing and selection, final delivery, and potential additional services. Each stage ensures a smooth process, resulting in high-quality photographs and a memorable experience for you and your guests at your special event."},{"question":"I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.

This post discusses and explores my experiences of being a PhD student researching women’s lived experiences of research evaluation in the UK, and my thoughts on and experiences of interviewing very senior and esteemed academics as a junior researcher. My PhD study explored research evaluation in the form of the Research Excellence Framework (REF) – a weighty force in UK academia – the outcomes of which, I argue, hold the potential to alter the course of an academic career considerably, as well as playing a role in the type of work that some academics do, particularly given the REF impact agenda. There is currently an international trend towards research evaluation with programmes such as the Excellence in Research for Australia (ERA), the Performance-Based Research fund in New Zealand (PBRF), and equivalents in countries including Denmark, Switzerland and the Netherlands. What is clear is that there is not enough qualitative, exploratory research into the effects of research evaluation on academic careers, especially for women, and so my PhD study was born. My findings suggest that research evaluation in the UK actively contributes to the continuance of gender inequality regimes in the academy, and that the ability to negotiate managerial control and be politically savvy is increasingly important in the academic world. Before embarking on my PhD, I was acutely aware of the sensitivity of my research, as well as my own positionality with regards to my participants. Reflection is and was an important element in the research process for me, as it allowed me to reflect on the effects of the self on the research process and, ultimately, also on the data, as well as the various power dynamics discernible during interviews for my study.

At night, she works in the FBI's cybercrime division with Griffin Dowd (Colin Hanks), fighting identity theft and similar crimes. One night, an anonymous tip leads them to a website called KillWithMe.com. The site features a streaming video of a cat being tortured and killed. The website cannot be shut down, as the creator knew that someone would try and built into it a fail-safe; every time the server is closed, a mirror server immediately replaces it. After the cat's death, KillWithMe.com's webmaster graduates to human victims and makes their deaths correlate directly with the number of hits the site receives. At a press conference, the public is urged to avoid the website, but as Jennifer feared this only increases the site's popularity. The videos are recorded in the killer's basement and his victims include a helicopter pilot (bled to death by injections of anticoagulant), a newscaster (burnt to death by heat lamps while cemented into the floor), and Griffin Dowd (killed by slowly increasing the concentration of sulfuric acid solution in which he is submerged up to his neck). At first it seems the victims were randomly chosen, but this is revealed to be untrue: the first two victims were chosen because they were part of filming or presenting the suicide of a junior college teacher.

The study just proves what many people already guessed: many kids, if not most, have their own cellphones. According to a recent survey, 12 is the magic number. It is the most common age for kids to get their first cellphone. But 13% of children aged 6 to 10 already have one.

They believe that cellphones are an important tool in a dangerous situation. Kids can reach their parents at all times. And some people say having a cellphone helps teach kids to be responsible. Some cellphones designed for kids can be set to only work when parents approve . What's the harm in that? But other people are worried about the health and safety effects of kids' cellphones. They believe that kids with cellphones will spend less time playing outside with friends, and that sending text messages or making phone calls while doing homework makes it difficult for kids to concentrate.

Article: A Samoan airline says that it is the world's first carrier to charge passengers by their weight. Samoa Air, which opened in 2012, asks passengers to give their personal weight during booking, which is then charged according to the length of a flight. The customers will also be weighed just before they board the plane. \\"It is believed that all people throughout the world are the same size,\\" Samoa Air CEO Chris Langton said. \\"Airplanes always run on weight, not seats.\\" \\"There is no doubt in my mind that this is the concept of the future. This is the fairest way of your travelling with your family or yourself.\\" Though the airline introduced the plan last November, it caught people's attention last week when the carrier began international flights to neighboring American Samoa. Almost at the same time, a Norwegian economist, Bharat Bhatta, published a report suggesting that airlines should charge obese passengers more. The Pacific Islands contain some of the world's most common countries for obesity, many ranking in the top 10, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Samoa is ranked number four, with 59.6 percent of the population considered obese, said the most recent WHO report. According to Samoa Air's latest schedule, the airline charges up to 0.57 per kg for flights in Samoa and 1.03 per kg for its only international flight to American Samoa, around 250 miles. Children under 12 are charged 75 percent of the adult rate, with fares also based on weight. Any overweight baggage is calculated at the same rate as the passenger's personal weight. The plan could actually prove cheaper in some cases, such as for families travelling with small children, and Langton said customer reaction has mainly been \\"amazingly positive\\". The idea of charging passengers by weight has been hotly discussed before, and in the US some airlines require those who do not fit into a seat comfortably to buy a second seat.

The pillars, arches and columns rise hundred of feet into the air over a vast region of southern China, striking awe into observers who have flocked to the area for thousands of years. Known as karsts, the limestone structures - captured in these images for National Geographic Magazine - are created when water forces fissures, sinkholes, cracks and caverns into the soft rock, leaving only a series of monoliths above ground. Vast: Jaw-dropping limestone 'karsts' formed by erosion over 270million years soar hundreds of feet into the air across a huge region of southern China. Pictured, climber Emily Harrington takes the hard way up Moon Hill, an arch which was formed from the remains of a collapsed cave. Sightseers can take an easier dirt track. Awe: The enormity of the structures is clear compared to the size of the cavers ascending them, from a limestone spire in the Enshi canyon (left) to the Great Arch in Ziyun Getu He Chuandong National Park (right). Seeing these sights can be much easier, as a new glass elevator delivers less intrepid tourists to the foot of the arch. China's Stone Forest is one of the. largest, with huge arches which once belonged to cave systems but now. protrude awkwardly above the lush green hills around. Covering an estimated half a million square kilometres, south China's is one of the largest and most significant in the world. While. limestone structures are common, only in a humid, tropical environment. can there be enough movement of water to create such dramatic change,. and form structures which have earned the South China Karst recognition. as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. But. just as with an iceberg, what can be seen in these photographs is only. the tip. The flowing water has not only carved up the landscape above. the ground, but has also transformed it below. South. China is home to some of the largest caves in the world, which even now. are still being mapped and explored by researchers from around the. world. Heading the charge. is a team led by Andy Eavis, the chairman of the British Caving. Association who has been traveling to China for more than 30 years. Otherworldly: The landscape was formed by water in the humid region seeping in through cracks in porous rock and gradually opening up sinkholes, fissures and caves. All work and no play...: Those pictured have devoted their careers to exploring and mapping the hostile cave landscape down below - but do come up for air occasionally. Map: Beneath southern China's landscape researchers have discovered some of the largest underground chambers in the world. In 2013 a British-led expedition used a laser scanner to map the Miao Room of Gebihe, pictured, whose maximum height is 627 feet. A passenger jet is shown for scale. The images are from the July issue of National Geographic magazine. He and his explorers have used. pioneering laser scanners to map the complex, unstable systems in. unprecedented detail, including the Miao Room of the Gebihe cave system -. since confirmed as the second-largest known cavern in the world. Despite. its entrance from the outer world comprising just a narrow, unobtrusive. gap in stone in the forest, it has a maximum height of 627 feet. The. cavern must be explored in hostile conditions - including high humidity. and a lack of any natural light - using a mixture of computer. technology and old-fashioned caving bravery. With. fissures and sharp points of rock, a wrong step could mean injury or. death, and the cavern is so large it could fit a fleet of jumbo jets. with plenty of room to spare. Other. caves are less formidable. In one part of the region, an entire village. of 21 homes - with no need for rooves - is situated inside a cavern. together with a primary school, a basketball court, and an increasing. stream of tourists. More still have been made safe for people to explore without the risk of losing their hats. It. is not all work and no play for the explorers. Some feature in these. photos, where they take time off from their caving work to ascend the. other side of China's fantasy landscape. That. is despite there being far more tourist-friendly ways to ascend the. limestone structures, which are mainly in China's Yunnan, Guizhou and. Guangxi provinces. One, the. Great Arch in Ziyun Getu He Chuandong National Park, includes a glass. elevator which delivers the less intrepid to the foot of the arch so. they do not have to climb. It is a vision of the future - and it's predicted the caves will be next. With. China becoming one of the fastest-growing economies in the world,. tourists from other parts of the vast nation are already streaming. underground - though how long it will take to install a glass lift there. remains to be seen. The images are from the July issue of National Geographic magazine.

The band has undergone numerous formations throughout its history of which 21 musicians have been members; since October 2017 it has consisted of Robert Fripp, Jakko Jakszyk, Tony Levin, Mel Collins, Pat Mastelotto, Gavin Harrison, Jeremy Stacey and Bill Rieflin. Fripp is the only consistent member of the group and is considered the band's leader and driving force. Context: After their first US tour, King Crimson was in a state of flux with various line-up changes, thwarted tour plans, and difficulties in finding a satisfactory musical direction. This period has subsequently been referred to as the \\"interregnum\\" - a nickname implying that the \\"King\\" (King Crimson) was not properly in place during this time. Fripp became the only remaining musician in the band, with Sinfield expanding his creative role to playing synthesizers. Fripp and Sinfield recorded the second King Crimson album, In the Wake of Poseidon, in 1970 with the Giles brothers hired back as the session rhythm section, and with jazz pianist Keith Tippett and Circus saxophonist Mel Collins as guest musicians. The group considered hiring Elton John to be the singer, but decided against the idea. Lake then agreed to sing on the album in exchange for receiving King Crimson's PA equipment, except on \\"Cadence and Cascade\\", which is sung by Fripp's friend Gordon Haskell. Though Tippett was offered band membership, he preferred to remain as a studio collaborator, performing with the band for a single gig. Upon its release in May 1970, In the Wake of Poseidon reached No. 4 in the UK and No. 31 in the US. It received some criticism from those who thought it sounded too similar to their first album. With no musicians to perform material from their new album, Fripp and Sinfield persuaded Haskell to join as singer and bassist and recruited Andy McCulloch as drummer, retaining Collins as saxophonist, flautist and occasional keyboard player. During the writing sessions for the third album, Lizard, Haskell and McCulloch had no say in the direction of the material, since Fripp and Sinfield wrote the album themselves, bringing in Tippett, Mark Charig on cornet, Nick Evans on trombone, and Robin Miller on oboe and cor anglais as additional musicians. Haskell sang and played bass. Jon Anderson of Yes was also brought in to sing the first part of the album's title track, \\"Prince Rupert Awakes\\", which Fripp and Sinfield considered to be outside Haskell's range and style. Lizard featured stronger avant-garde jazz and chamber-classical influences than previous albums, as well as Sinfield's upfront experiments with processing and distorting sound through the EMS VCS 3 synthesiser. It also featured complex lyrics from Sinfield, including a coded song about the break-up of the Beatles, with almost the entire second side taken up by a predominantly instrumental chamber suite describing a medieval battle and its outcome. Released in December 1970, Lizard reached No. 29 in the UK and No. 113 in the US. Described retrospectively as an \\"acquired taste\\"., Lizard was certainly not to the taste of the more rhythm-and-blues-oriented Haskell and McCulloch, both of whom found the music difficult to relate to. As a result, Haskell quit the band acrimoniously after refusing to sing live with distortion and electronic effects. McCulloch also departed, leaving Fripp and Sinfield to recruit new members once more. After a search for new musicians, Fripp and Sinfield secured a returning Collins and Ian Wallace on drums. Auditions for a singer included those from Bryan Ferry and John Gaydon, the band's manager,. The position went to Raymond \\"Boz\\" Burrell. Bassist John Wetton was invited to join, but declined (at the time) in order to play with Family. Rick Kemp also declined an offer to join, leaving Fripp and Wallace teaching Burrell to play bass rather than continue auditions. Though he had not played bass before, Burrell had played enough rhythm guitar to assist him in learning the instrument. With the line-up complete, King Crimson toured in 1971 for the first time since 1969. The concerts were well received, but the musical and lifestyle differences of Collins, Wallace, and Burrell began to alienate the drug-free Fripp, who began to withdraw socially from his bandmates, creating further tension. In 1971, the new King Crimson formation recorded Islands. Loosely influenced by Miles Davis's orchestral collaborations with Gil Evans and Homer's Odyssey, the album also showed signs of a split in styles between Sinfield (who favoured the softer and more textural jazz-folk approach and wanted the band to move in a Miles Davis direction) and Fripp (who was drawn more towards the harsher instrumental style exemplified by the instrumental \\"Sailor's Tale\\", with its dramatic Mellotron and banjo-inspired guitar technique). Islands also featured the band's one-and-only experiment with a string ensemble on \\"Prelude: Song of the Gulls\\" and the raunchy rhythm-and-blues-inspired \\"Ladies of the Road\\". A hint of trouble to come came when one member of the band allegedly described the more delicate and meditative parts of Islands as \\"airy-fairy shit\\". Released in December 1971, Islands charted at No. 30 in the UK and No. 76 in the US. Following a period of touring Islands, Fripp asked Sinfield to leave the band, citing musical differences and a loss of faith in his partner's ideas. The remaining band broke up acrimoniously in rehearsals shortly afterward, owing to Fripp's refusal to incorporate other members' compositions into the band's repertoire. He later cited this as \\"quality control\\", with the idea that King Crimson would perform the \\"right kind\\" of music. King Crimson reformed to fulfil touring commitments in 1972, with the intention of disbanding afterwards. Recordings from various North American dates between January and February 1972 were released as Earthbound in June 1972, noted and criticised for its sub-par sound quality and playing style that occasionally veered towards funk, with scat singing on the improvised pieces. By this time, a definite musical rift between Fripp and the rest of the band existed, since Wallace, Burrell and Collins favoured a more rhythm-and-blues style. Though personal relations improved during the 1972 tour (to the point where most of the band wished to continue), Fripp opted to part company with the existing band and to restructure King Crimson with new members, since he felt the current members wouldn't be able to play the new material he had in mind. King Crimson have incorporated improvisation into their performances and studio recordings from the beginning, some of which has been embedded into loosely composed pieces such as \\"Moonchild\\" or \\"THRaK\\". Most of the band's performances over the years have included at least one stand-alone improvisation where the band simply started playing and took the music wherever it went, sometimes including passages of restrained silence, as with Bill Bruford's contribution to the improvised \\"Trio\\". The earliest example of King Crimson unambiguously improvising is the spacious, oft-criticised extended coda of \\"Moonchild\\" from In the Court of the Crimson King. Rather than using the standard jazz or blues \\"jamming\\" format for improvisation (in which one soloist at a time takes centre stage while the rest of the band lies back and plays along with established rhythm and chord changes), King Crimson improvisation is a group affair in which each member of the band is able to make creative decisions and contributions as the music is being played. Individual soloing is largely eschewed; each musician is to listen to each other and to the group sound, to be able to react creatively within the group dynamic. A slightly similar method of continuous improvisation (\\"everybody solos and nobody solos\\") was initially used by King Crimson's jazz-fusion contemporaries Weather Report. Fripp has used the metaphor of \\"white magic\\" to describe this process, in particular when the method works particularly well. Similarly, King Crimson's improvised music is rarely jazz or blues-based, and varies so much in sound that the band has been able to release several albums consisting entirely of improvised music, such as the Thrakattak album. Occasionally, particular improvised pieces will be recalled and reworked in different forms at different shows, becoming more and more refined and eventually appearing on official studio releases (the most recent example being \\"Power to Believe III\\", which originally existed as the stage improvisation \\"Deception of the Thrush\\", a piece played on stage for a long time before appearing on record). Question: How did King Crimson work with improvisations ?. Whats the answer?","response":"King Crimson approached improvisation as a group effort rather than as a standard jazz or blues \\"jamming\\" format, where only one soloist takes center stage at a time. Instead, each band member was encouraged to listen, react, and contribute creatively within the group dynamic. The improvisation sessions were not strictly based on jazz or blues, which allowed the band to develop a versatile sound. In some cases, improvised pieces from live performances would be recalled and reworked in different forms at following shows, eventually making their way into official studio releases. In summary, King Crimson worked with improvisations by: 1. Encouraging group participation where each member could make creative decisions and contributions as the music was being played, rather than following a traditional soloist structure. 2. Focusing on a process where everyone listens to each other and reacts creatively within the group dynamic. 3. Incorporating a variety of musical influences into their improvisations, rather than strictly adhering to jazz or blues styles. 4. Reworking and refining improvised pieces over time, eventually incorporating them into studio releases."},{"question":"Facebook will allow you to say who is responsible for your account when you die Quiviger What is the correctly punctuated version of this sentence?","response":"Facebook will allow you to designate someone as responsible for your account when you die: Quiviger."},{"question":"Translate to Finnish: Add to this the fact that the Russian authorities have done nothing to protect the functioning of the Estonian embassy in Moscow, as a result of which the conflict ended up, to all intents and purposes, being a diplomatic crisis.

Cut the base off a coffee can and push it two inches (5 cm) into the turf. Pour in soapy water until it stays filled. Repeat in several areas of your lawn, especially at the border of yellow patches. Return after ten minutes and count chinch bugs floating on the surface: 5+ chinch bugs per can: a serious infestation. Continue to the next step for treatment. 2–4 chinch bugs per can: low-level infestation. Improve lawn health and test again later. Treat immediately if your lawn is in poor health. 0–1 chinch bug per can: no treatment necessary. If your lawn is in poor health, there is probably another cause. Alternatively, you might also take a close look at the lawn with a magnifying glass. This can be effective if you catch the chinch bug infestation early, before they've spread throughout your lawn: Rake the lawn vigorously for 2 ft (60 cm) on all sides of the damaged area, toward the center. Vacuum the damaged area and surroundings. Water thoroughly. Insecticidal soaps are considered safe and appropriate for organic farming. A homemade soap treatment is actually more likely to damage your garden, but pure castille soap or mild Ivory or Dawn products (not extra-strength, grease-cutting, or anti-bacterial) are usually safe in a solution of 2½ tbsp dishwashing liquid per 1 gallon water (40 mL per 4 L). Mix in a clean sprayer, then shake or stir vigorously to combine. If using an insecticidal soap, dilute it following label instructions instead. This method also works best if you catch the infestation early and use it to target small areas of lawn. If you have hard water in your area, the soap may fail to mix in, leaving a scum on the surface after the water settles. If this happens, make a new mix using distilled or bottled water instead. Using a commercial insecticidal soap for chinch bugs is not legal in Canada, although this may just be an oversight. Homemade soap treatments are allowed. Any soap can cause damage to aquatic life. Do not apply it where the water could run off into a storm drain. Drench the damaged area of your lawn using a spray bottle or hose attachment. For best results, do this on a cool, still morning or evening. In windy or hot weather (especially above 90ºF / 32ºC), there is a much higher chance of damaging your plants. Try to avoid getting the soap in contact with nearby plants. Some trees and flowers are particularly vulnerable to soap damage, especially during times of drought. If you're concerned about potential damage, test a corner of your lawn first and check on it after 24 hours. The chinch bugs will run for cover and get caught in the nap of the flannel. Return after ten or fifteen minutes to vacuum the pests off the sheet, or drown them by putting the sheet in a bucket of water. Monitor your lawn to check for more chinch bugs or expanding damage. If necessary, repeat the soap treatment once a week, or once every three or four days for severe infestations. The soap breaks down quickly, so your lawn should be back to normal soon. You may want to check your soil pH after treatment is finished, since soap is alkaline. These predators are not available for purchase, but they often arrive during an infestation to feed on chinch bugs. Providing a variety of flowering plants encourages them by giving them places to hide and feed. These predators look very similar to chinch bugs. They tend to be smaller and faster, with larger eyes. If you're still seeing a lot of chinch bugs but your lawn seems healthy, you might be misidentifying this predator species. Ladybugs, lacewings, and parasitic wasps all feed on chinch bugs or their eggs. While they do not target chinch bugs as effectively as big-eyed bugs, they are all widely available for purchase. Beneficial nematodes (roundworms) may also help. These are proven to control grubs, though there aren’t yet studies on their effectiveness for chinch bugs. You can buy beneficial nematodes at many home and garden stores. A neem oil product can control chinch bugs with little effect on plants and beneficial insects. Spray on the oil during cool, humid evenings, since it can break down or burn plants in direct sunlight. Some essential oils such as rosemary, lemongrass, cinnamon, or citrus oils can also help, but have not been studied as thoroughly. Dilute about 20 drops of oil in 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water, then spray onto your lawn. This can kill beneficial insects and earthworms and can take weeks or months to solve the problem, so use it only as a last resort. Wear safety goggles and a dust mask to avoid irritation, and try not to create too much dust. Wash your hands after applying. Use garden-grade or food-grade DE only. Swimming pool grade DE is a more significant respiratory hazard. Non-heated DE containing less than one percent crystalline silica is the safest option. Try applying DE with a bulb applicator. This will reduce the risk of getting the dust in your eyes, nose, and mouth. Apply DE to wet grass, as well, either after it rains or you’ve watered the lawn. This ensures that the small particles stick to the grass. What is a summary of what this article is about?","response":"This article is about how to deal with chinch bugs in your lawn.

He found it easy to understand their differences by categorizing them. For that, he classified reptiles as class A and amphibians as class B. Which class of animals would have weaker separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams, class A or class B?","response":"Class B, the amphibians, would have a weaker separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams compared to Class A, the reptiles. Amphibians typically have a three-chambered heart consisting of two atria and one ventricle. When blood enters the heart, oxygenated blood from the lungs and skin mixes with deoxygenated blood from the body in the single ventricle. This mixture of oxygen-rich and oxygen-poor blood then gets pumped to both the body and the lungs. This type of circulatory system is less efficient at separating oxygenated and deoxygenated blood compared to that of reptiles. Reptiles, on the other hand, have a more advanced circulatory system. Most reptiles have a three-chambered heart, but with a partially divided ventricle or having a septum that separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams to a greater extent than in amphibians. This separation reduces the mixing of oxygen-rich and oxygen-poor blood, making their circulatory system more efficient. In addition, some reptiles, like crocodiles, have a four-chambered heart, which provides complete separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood, similar to birds and mammals. So, in summary, animals in Class B (amphibians) would generally have weaker separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams compared to animals in Class A (reptiles)."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Where are you if there is a dental office along with other similar provider? - urban area - strip mall - office - town - medical building The best answer is Answer:","response":"medical building"},{"question":"Do these two sentences from wikipedia have the same meaning?

This one comes from Selina from Beautystorm. Beautystorm are proudly the cheapest stockists of Dermalogica products in Australia and provide online skin consultations with their in house Skincare Therapists. Selina will be giving us advice on how to repair sun damaged skin. Whilst we are blessed to be living in such a sun drenched country, here in Australia, as a consequence the majority of us will have sun damaged skin. Here are Selina's tips to repair some of the damage: The severe, Australian suncauses a multitude of cases of serious skin damage every year. However, there are ways, to repair rough, dry, wrinkled skin that may also suffer from redness and brown spots. The very first step to reverse some of that skin damage is some gentle cleansing. Never wash the face with an ordinary bar of soap. This will make the situation worse and cause severe dry skin. In order to wash the sun-damaged skin effectively without causing further injury, use a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser. This will remove, not only dirt and oil, but also the top layer of dead skin cells, providing a nice glow. This will reveal fresh skin cells ready for treatment. After cleansing the skin, follow with a mud mask or a facial mask made specifically for skin that’s been damaged by the sun. The purpose of a mask is to draw out impurities in the skin while adding key ingredients like moisturisers and minerals back into the skin. After gently rinsing the purifying mask, a lotion, cream or serum containing key ingredients should be applied to the skin. The difference between the three is that a lotion is best for daytime use, worn under makeup or for those prone to breakouts. Creams are considered heavier and best used at night or for those with dry skin. Serums are usually highly concentrated formulas that can be used day or night, but a little goes a long way. Those with the most severe sun damaged skin should use them. Question: What did the author say about the Australian sun? Options: - something about it causing injury - not enough information - something about it being mild to skin - something about it being harsh on the skin === The correct answer is Answer:","response":"The author mentioned that the Australian sun is severe, causing a multitude of cases of serious skin damage every year. This implies that the Australian sun is harsh on the skin."},{"question":"If Billy rode his bike 17 times, John rode his bike twice as many times, and their mother rode her bike 10 times more than John, how many times did they ride their bikes in total?

Since Billy rode his bike 17 times and John rode his bike twice as many times as Billy, we need to multiply Billy's number of rides by 2. 17 (Billy's rides) * 2 = 34 rides Step 2: Find out how many times their mother rode her bike. We know that their mother rode her bike 10 times more than John. So, we need to add 10 to John's number of rides. 34 (John's rides) + 10 = 44 rides Step 3: Calculate the total number of rides for Billy, John, and their mother.

It looks as if Mark Twain took many small meaningless stories into one big one. Please...read anything else. Answer: A:","response":"Based on the provided information, it is clear that this product review is negative. There are several indicators throughout the review that signal the writer's dissatisfaction and disappointment with the product, which, in this case, is a book. Firstly, the title of the review itself, \\"Icky,\\" implies that the reviewer had a distasteful experience with the book. This alone suggests that the review will be negative, as \\"icky\\" is an informal term for something unpleasant or distasteful. Moving on to the content of the review, the author begins by acknowledging that the protagonist of the book, Huck, goes through many adventures. However, they immediately follow this statement with a negative remark, suggesting that it is difficult to maintain interest in the story when it makes the reader want to sleep. This implies that the book failed to capture the reviewer's attention or excite them in any way. The reviewer then explicitly states their dissatisfaction with the book by saying, \\"I never got into this book, I can sum it up in two words: 'Unbelievably Dull.'\\" This statement directly conveys that the book did not meet their expectations, and they found it to be extremely dull. Furthermore, in an attempt to elaborate on why they found the book uninteresting, the reviewer explains that none of the experiences Huck encounters are exciting. They go so far as to suggest that the book is nothing more than a collection of \\"small meaningless stories\\" that Mark Twain cobbled together to create a larger, uneventful story. Lastly, the review concludes with a plea for the reader to choose any other book to read, strengthening the notion that this reviewer had a negative experience with the product in question. Taking all these factors into account, we can determine that this product review is definitively not positive. The reviewer clearly expresses their dissatisfaction with the book and provides reasons for why they found it dull and unexciting. They also go as far as to discourage potential readers from picking up the book, which further emphasizes their negative opinion on the product."},{"question":"Paris, France (CNN) -- The death toll from flash flooding in southern France rose to 25 Thursday as rain continued to inundate the region, authorities said.

I am offering my male genitals (full penis, testes, scrotum) as a meal for 100,000 yen…. I will prepare and cook as the buyer requests, at his chosen location. On Sunday, April 13, 2012, Tokyo illustrator Mao Sugiyama (who goes by the nickname “HC”), publicly seasoned ond braised his own genitals on a portable gas cartridge burner, and then served them to five eager diners who each paid about 250 for the meal (a sixth was a no-show). The genitals had been returned to the asexual Sugiyama, frozen and double-bagged in plastic, following elective genital removal surgery (“gender nullification”) on his 22nd birthday on March 31. After initially considering eating them himself, Sugiyama offered the meal on Twitter in mid-April to the first person willing to pay 100,000 yen (about 1,250). But after the notoriety that his tweet caused, he organized a public banquet, dubbed “Ham Cybele — Century Banquet,” at the “Asagaya Loft A” event space in the Suginami Ward of Tokyo. Century in Japanese is a homophone for the Japanese word for genitals; “Ham Cybele” refers to the Anatolian mother goddess, prefixed with an appropriate word for tough meat to create a phrase whose initials match Sugiyama’s artist name of HC. The banquet The day before the event Sugiyama tweeted, “I’m starting to thaw them out,” and posted a photo. On the day of the event a crowd of about 70 mostly twenty-somethings gathered, five to a table, to listen to a piano recital and panel discussion before the dinner. Although only five servings of the genitals were available, the other diners were served alternate beef- and crocodile-based dishes, with additional items available for purchase, including rice, cream cheese and crackers, strawberry parfaits, waffles with blueberry sauce, grape juice, and milk. The cooking was done by Sugiyama himself, dressed as a chef, under the supervision of a licensed food preparation specialist. The diners The five genital eaters comprised a 32-year-old male manga artist (there for “research”), a 30-year-old white-collar couple (who were “curious”), an attractive 22-year-old woman (who wondered how it would feel), and 29-year-old event planner Shigenobu M. [last name redacted], who tweeted before the event, “It’s a once in a lifetime chance, so I decided on the spur of the moment to do it.” Shigenobu M. posted a detailed blog post on April 14 after the banquet, including about 20 photographs (the source of the photos in the original version of this article). He boasted on Twitter that he was getting twice the traffic he’d gotten when his blog was once profiled on prime-time Japanese television. But on May 19 he suddenly deleted the post and replaced it with a new post explaining that the removal was due to privacy considerations. (Sugiyama himself had linked to and seemed to endorse the blog post.) Diners were required to sign a waiver releasing Sugiyama and the event organizers from any liability from the consumption of the genitals. Sugiyama stated that before his operation he had been tested to be free of any venerial diseases (although during the panel discussion he admitted that he had gone on a one-month sex binge with anonymous internet partners just to make sure that he wouldn’t regret the operation.) He stated that he had not yet started receiving female hormone therapy at the time of the operation. He also added that the pre-severed penis could attain an erect length of 16.1 cm (about 6.3 inches). The entrée Close-up photos of the braised genitals showed a sliced penis shaft with clearly visible corpora cavernous and uretha, a sliced testical with the look and texture of sea urchin sushi, and scrotal skin with about 3 mm of pubic hair growth. Rounding out the presentation the chef garnished the genitals with button mushrooms and Italian parsley. Sugiyama told the tense but giggly crowd during the pre-dinner interview that he would be contributing his genital recipes to the Japanese recipe website CookPad. After CalorieLab’s coverage of the event was picked up by a wire service and went viral a photo from Sugiyama’s Twitter stream of two large, meaty balls together on a plate were misidentified by some websites as his testicles. They were actually beef steak cubes that Sugiyama used to develop his recipe his recipe before the real event. And on June 6 Sugiyama tweeted that a Reuters photojournalist bought him some variety meat at the market in order to stage a recreation of his pre-event cooking rehearsals, although we have not seen any such photos materialize. Sugiyama had also intended to include his nipples on the menu, but his attempt to burn them off with sodium hydroxide did not result in anything usable. (His nipple areas and some spots surrounding them where the lye spilled have now healed into smooth scar tissue. He told the dubious dermatologist and plastic surgeon that he consulted that he had a “work accident.” He footnoted this section of the transcript of his Ham Cybele talk with an assurance that he properly pays into the national health insurance program, which covers 70 percent of medical expenses, but we’re pretty sure it doesn’t cover nipple removal accidents any more than it covers gender nullification surgery.) Delicious? What was the verdict by the eaters? According to the deleted blog post by Shigenobu M., the hard, rubbery penis root almost bent his fork, and he spit it out after a few chews. The only taste was of the red wine that it had been pre-stewed in. The scrotum was surprisingly even harder and more rubbery than the penis, but tasteless. (Shigenobu M. didn’t mention the pubic hair.) The testicles were hard on the outside, soft and glutinous in the middle, with a fishy or gamey taste. One of Shigenobu M.’s friends in attendance asked for a piece of the penis and ate it, but after the event became distraught and expressed regret that he had lost his common sense in the heat of the moment. A commenter to our original article with culinary expertise recommended that tough organ meats be soaked in milk, then cooked sous vide at 50 degrees Celsius for 8 hours in a vacuum; they’ll become spoon-soft, he said. And Managing Culinary Director of Serious Eats J. Kenji Lopez-Alt in an e-mail to CalorieLab wrote, “The first thought that entered my mind when I read your article was the chef didn’t cook it right. What a waste of a perfectly good penis! Penis is pretty tough and needs to be slow cooked, either sous-vide or in a braise. Testicles need to be cleaned, washed, membrame removed, then very gently cooked so they retain their soft, creamy texture. Check out some of Chichi Wang’s ‘Nasty Bits’ columns on Serious Eats. She cooks both testicles and penis.” Japanese media coverage and legal ramifications Shortly after the event broke on the Japanese Twittersphere a spokesman for the Suginami police told CalorieLab that they had received inquiries and complaints from concerned citizens, but that they would not be getting involved because they considered it a case of cannibalism, which is not in itself illegal in Japan (nor is it in the United States, but it is outlawed in the U.K.). The spokesman nevertheless said, “We’re going to talk to the people at Asagaya Loft A and ask them what is going on and why they hosted such an event.” On June 1, two weeks after CalorieLab’s report, the Japanese media finally discovered the story. Japanese tabloid website Zakzak reported that, at the behest of the Suginami police the Suginami health department conducted an on-site inspection of Asagaya Loft A. Although the venue is primarily used for live music, it also has a license for food service. The proprietor explained to the health inspectors that the venue was rented for the purpose of putting on a show, that the event was private and closed to the general public, and that none of the venue’s food preparation equipment, utensils or kitchen facilities were used. The health department issued a warning to the venue’s proprietor not to allow food service activities to be done outside the kitchen area in the future. In addition, the health department said it was considering drafting administrative guidance on the issue. Zakzak also spoke to former public prosecutor Masaru Wakasa, who said that the event might also have violated obscenity laws if the genitals, despite their severed state, were still clearly recognizable as genitals to the attendees. The same day as the Zakzak report Japanese wire service Kyodo News moved a short article about the event quoting a Suginami Ward official that they do not permit this sort of thing and are looking into it in consultation with the police. The next day the number 2 newspaper in Japan, the Asahi Shinbun, published a short item quoting Suginami Mayor Tanaka as calling the event “deplorable.” The same day the tabloidy Sankei Sports afternoon sports newspaper said that L’Affair Sugiyama’s “grotesqueness recalls the Sada Abe incident,” the inspiration for Nagisa Oshima’s In the Realm of the Senses, and several other print, web, and television outlets began speculating that the mothballed criminal investigation might be reopened. On this day Sugiyama was interviewed by the police about the incident; he had not retained an attorney at that point. On Twitter Sugiyama began to come across as extremely stressed out. On June 5 Zakzak reported on an e-mail it received from Sugiyama attempting to explain things. Sugiyama wrote of two years of planning for the event, conceived of as an artistic statement. Sugiyama wrote that as an artist he had no need of genitals to reach his life goals. Sugiyama said he received an appearance fee of 100,000 yen (1,250). Sugiyama said that he tried his recipes on several sets of cow and pig genitals that he obtained (which may revive the suspicion that this was a hoax for some people), and that he did “image training” to train himself to eat genitals by eating dozens of bananas ?with a knife and fork (apparently he sampled his own cooking at the event). Sugiyama told Zakzak that one of the benefits of his operation is that he no longer has to worry about getting drunk and inadvertently getting arrested for indecent exposure, which may have been a joke. (Sugiyama denied that he gave any domestic Japanese media “interviews,” but this e-mail rang true and was largely confirmed by the “official report” manifest that Sugiyama later published.) On June 6 J-Cast News ran a long, mostly accurate, non-tabloidy take on the event, including a run-down on the widespread, embarrassing-to-Japan overseas coverage (although they credited the initial breaking of the story to the Huffington Post, rather than to CalorieLab). Meanwhile Mayor Ryo Tanaka of Suginami Ward, the Tokyo city in which Asagaya Loft A is located, was getting more and more irate about the situation, pressuring the police and other authorities to do something. What the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department finally came up with was charging Sugiyama, and three others involved in the event, with indecent exposure, on the theory that he exposed his genitals, albeit separated from his body and braised in red wine. Sugiyama tweeted about the new approach by police: A new detective was put in charge of investigating Ham Cybele. He’s not pursuing the the facts related to the concerns of the health and food safety authorities, who had contacted the police after citizens made inquiries after reading reports in gossipy tabloids. Rather, he’s turned his attention to investigating me on suspicion of exhibiting obscene materials, and to that end he’s pressuring me to cooperate in preparing a document of confession to the violation of obscenity laws. If he sees his job as expanding the police department’s power and looking at this case simply as the stripped-down facts, ignoring the context, and all he wants is for me to sign a bare-bones confession of the facts for the use of prosecutors without any explanation of the circumstances, then it looks like I’ll have to retain an attorney in order to protect not only myself, but to put forward the the whole truth of the situation, since the police are acting no differently than the contemptible mass media. Unable to extract a confession, police forwarded the results of their investigation to prosecutors on September 18. A charge of indecent exposure could have landed Sugiyama and the others in jail for up to two years, with substantial fines to boot. The months dragged on, the incident fell out of the news, and Mayor Tanaka calmed down and moved on to other issues. Japanese prosecutors have a very high conviction rate, and they keep it that way by not pursuing iffy cases. Everyone “exposed” to the “indecency” was attending a private function and knew what to expect. The matter was quietly dropped in Februay, 2013, and Mao Sugiyama was finally able to relax. Gender nullification One of the confusing aspects of this case to many observers was the concept of gender nullification. Most people are familiar with transgender women and transgender men, and perhaps even congenital intersex cases, where both male and female or ambiguous genitalia are present. But where does Mao Sugiyama fall in this spectrum? He self-identifies as asexual (we have chosen to use the pronoun “he” throughout this article), or “X gender,” with no sexual feelings, attraction, or urges. As an asexual and an artist, Sugiyama felt he had not use for genitals. What does an X gender person do in Japan to get rid of his genitals? There are five university hospitals in Japan that perform sex reassignment surgery. They follow a protocol that requires that surgeons work in tandem with psychologists and an ethics panel. The would-be male-to-female patient often has to live for a year full-time in the role of the desired sex before receiving hormone therapy and then for another couple of years before receiving surgery, just to make sure the patient can cope with the reality of his choice. Asexual nullification surgery falls outside these established guidelines. Most Japanese seeking a quick and inexpensive, no-questions-asked operation travel to Thailand, but some patients are uneasy about using a non-Japanese surgeon, and there have been stories of antibiotic resistant bacteria outbreaks. These patients have the option of going to one of a few private clinics in Japan. The first such clinic in Japan was operated by the late Dr. Koji Wada, whose first patient was Japanese entertainer Ai Haruna. Mao Sugiyama has not publicly revealed where his surgery took place, but an investigation by CalorieLab based on scraps of information from Sugiyama’s Twitter feed around the time of the operation led us to a clinic in a small city on the scenic Sea of Japan coast of western Honshu where a sole practitioner cosmetic surgeon, Dr. S., had been performing various sex reassignment surgeries for a year or two after studying the procedures used at a nearby university hospital gender clinic as well as by Thai surgeon Dr. Sanguan Kunaporn and the late Dr. Wada. Unlike the university hospitals, Dr. S. was willing and eager to perform MTX (male-to-X) surgeries. When CalorieLab contacted Mao Sugiyama with Dr. S’s name, his reply implicitly confirmed our guess. On his blog Dr. S. recounts a trip to the Philippines in 1999 while working on staff at a plastic surgery clinic in Yokohama. “I actually met a 14-year-old boy who I felt was intersex, neither male nor female.” Speaking to the locals he heard that in some parts of the Philippines students are classified from elementary school into three sexes, male, female, and the “third sex.” At his own clinic he met with men who lived outwardly as men, but had feminine mannerisms and ways of speaking. They were not gay, nor did they want to become women. “They do not internally recognize themselves as men … but rather they live as X, cross gender, neither man nor woman … We would call this a third sex.” After first blogging about X gender patients in January, 2011, Dr. S. received many inquiries about non-traditional sex reassignment surgery, and the number of such patients began to outstrip his traditional male-to-female sex reassignment patients. Rather than having a simple desire to be turned into a simulacrum of an anatomical woman, such patients have unusual requests that most gender clinics are reluctant to accommodate. “I recognized anew the importance of made-to-order medical treatment in sex reassignment surgery, such as not creating a vagina or leaving the penis intact while also creating a vagina, rather than uniformly changing all genitals from one sex to the other just because that’s the way it’s usually been done in gender identity disorder cases.” Dr. S. was internet savvy and made it easy for potential patients. On his website were consent forms (regular and parental, for minors), as well as a detailed, transparent, a la carte price list: Castration: ¥300,000 (add ¥100,000 for scrotum removal) Scrotum removal (a la carte): ¥200,000 Castration, scrotum removal, simple penis amputation at the base: ¥710,000 Penis amputation: ¥510,000 Package deal of castration, scrotum removal, deep penile root removal, pudental cleft creation, and female-style urethra rerouting: ¥960,000 The works (Castration, deep penile root removal, creation of female external genitalia and clitoris, and female-style urethra rerouting): ¥1,300,000 Vagina (a la carte): Price ranges from ¥400,000 to ¥1,000,000, depending on how aggressive the surgery is, and jumps to ¥1,500,000 if a portion of the large intestine must be used Labia major, labia minora, and clitoris: These usually are not done alone, so a la carte prices are not established; consult for details Breast implants: Currently 30 percent off, ranging from ¥350,000 to ¥480,000, with additional breast-related services also available Female hormones: Various prices Artificial testicle implant: ¥180,000 per testicle Dr. S. accepted cash, debit card, and several types of credit card, as well as partnering with a third-party medical loan company that would finance operations for anyone, including teens, students, and non-working housewives. A little over a year after his MTX business began to take off, at the end of March, 2012, Dr. S. operated on a patient who would bring him lasting notoriety, 22-year-old Mao Sugiyama. Mao’s parents may have had an inkling of what was to come: Mao is a name given to both girls and boys in Japan. The talented young illustrator from Tokyo, who dressed in an androgynous manner, peppered his Twitter stream with literary and artistic allusions, and professed to be asexual, came to Dr. S. to be made “tsuru-tsuru” down there, smooth and shiny. This itself was not new to the surgeon. Dr. S. had blogged about “men who want to become intersex because although they do not want to be women they loathe maleness,” and “who feel a sense of incongruity about the things hanging in their crotch.” On Mao Sugiyama’s 22nd birthday, Dr. S. and his staff fulfilled Sugiyama’s wishes, and a few days later Sugiyama was returning home with a package of frozen medical waste in his luggage. He tweeted that the procedure cost him about ¥1 million (about 12,500). Pictures, please, and journalistic lessons CalorieLab’s initial report on Ham Cybele included many photographs, mostly from Shigenobu M.’s blog post. By the time that other media and bloggers discovered the story, three weeks had passed since Shigenobu M. had taken down his post and photographs, but we had grabbed them just before that happened. We decided to remove the photos for various reasons: They made the story much more lurid and graphic than our normal readership expects; we didn’t own the copyrights and the owner, Shigenobu M. obviously didn’t want the photos out there; and finally, one more thing: The Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department asked us very politely (“It would be really appreciated … Thank you for your kind cooperation.”) to delete the article because it was “against the public order and morals in Japan.” The laws for obscenity, defamation, and privacy differ in Japan, and with this added to the other factors mentioned, we decided we were more comfortable in deleting the post for a while, later updating and restoring it without photos and with anonymized names, other than that of Mao Sugiyama, who had no problems with the article and linked to it with praise from his website. (Sugiyama has since changed his name to the equally sexually indeterminant Yuma Hamasaqi and collaborated under that name with Chinese artist Lu Yang on her Uterus Man project.) If you want photographs we ask you to make use of Google Images, because during the time that we had the photos online several websites around the world downloaded them and posted them, which in turn have been posted by yet others. It wasn’t just the photos that others acquired from us. Two weeks after we published the original version of this article, the Tokyo office of Agence France-Presse ran a story that repeated points from our article, many of which could only have been sourced from us because the original material had disappeared, without crediting us. You may recall Agence France-Presse as the outfit that used photos from freelance journalist Daniel Morel without his permission and sued him when he complained (a court later awarded Morel 1.2 million). Megan McArdle in an article on plagiarism described a “much lamented” but journalistically “legal” practice in which a smaller publication’s work is recreated by a larger publication, without credit: “[T]here is your story: same sources, same facts, different byline. One of its reporters has gone through your article and pulled the research reports it took you weeks to find, called all the sources you had to painstakingly develop, and fished pretty much the exact same quotes that you got through strategic questioning, then written it up as an ‘original story’ for their much larger readership, without ever mentioning your name.” That’s kind of what happened to us. The originial tweet [Please Retweet] I am offering my male genitals (full penis, testes, scrotum) as a meal for 100,000 yen [1,250]. I’m Japanese. The organs were surgically removed at age 22. I was tested to be free of venereal diseases. The organs were of normal function. I was not receiving female hormone treatment. The length at full erection was 16.1 cm [6.3 inches]. First interested buyer will get them, or I will also consider selling to a group. Will prepare and cook as the buyer requests, at his chosen location. If you have questions, please contact me by DM or e-mail. ||||| Japanese man cooks, serves own genitals TOKYO — A Japanese artist cooked his own genitals and served them to five paying diners in Tokyo to cover the medical costs, in a bizarre act to raise awareness about sexual minorities. Mao Sugiyama had his penis and testicles surgically removed in March and kept them frozen for two months before dishing them out -- seasoned and braised -- to customers at an event hall on May 13, according to postings on his Twitter account and local police. Diners paid 20,000 yen (250) for the plate with a portion of genitals. Pictures published on a website appeared to show the meal came complete with mushrooms and a parsley garnish. The painter, who is reportedly 22, said on Twitter the organ had been removed by a physician and certified to be free of infections. The meal was prepared under the supervision of a certified cook and diners were required to sign a waiver indemnifying Sugiyama and event organisers. In May 18 tweets, the artist said steps were taken so the act met all relevant laws, including a ban on organ sales, processing of medical waste and even food sanitation requirements. \\"I receive questions from some women and men... asking 'Will there be a next time? Please host it again.' But there is only one set of male organ,\\" he tweeted on May 16. \\"Unfortunately, I have no plan for the next time.\\" Sugiyama, who considers himself \\"asexual\\", that is without gender, initially thought about eating the genitals himself, but decided to solicit paying customers to help pay his hospital bills for the surgery. In an email to AFP, he confirmed the event had taken place and said it was organised to raise awareness about \\"sexual minorities, x-gender, asexual people\\". He said he was readying to publish an official account of the day. Police in Tokyo said they knew of the episode, but added that it had not broken the law as cannibalism was not illegal in Japan. \\"We are aware of the case. There was nothing (criminal) to it. It does not violate any detailed rules. There is nothing to take action about,\\" an officer at Suginami police station told AFP. Copyright © 2013 AFP. All rights reserved. More » |||||Summary:","response":"On April 13, 2012, Tokyo-based illustrator Mao Sugiyama, who identifies as asexual and goes by the nickname \\"HC,\\" prepared and cooked his own genitals and served them to five diners in a bizarre event in Tokyo. Sugiyama had previously undergone elective genital removal surgery, known as \\"gender nullification,\\" and originally considered consuming his genitals himself. However, he later decided to offer the meal on Twitter to anyone willing to pay 100,000 yen (about 1,250). Following the notoriety of his tweet, Sugiyama organized a public banquet called \\"Ham Cybele - Century Banquet,\\" where his cooked genitals were served. Only five servings were available, but other diners at the event enjoyed alternative dishes such as beef and crocodile. Sugiyama himself cooked the meal, dressed as a chef, under the supervision of a licensed food preparation specialist. Diners were required to sign a waiver to release Sugiyama and the event organizers from any liability that may arise from the consumption of the genitals. The genitals served included a sliced penis shaft, sliced testicle, and scrotal skin. Sugiyama informed the attendees during a pre-dinner interview that he would be contributing recipes involving his genitals to the Japanese recipe website CookPad. The incident did not lead to any legal actions, as cannibalism is not illegal in Japan, nor is it in the United States. The unusual event aimed to raise awareness about sexual minorities, x-gender, and asexual individuals."},{"question":"Student: Can we conclude from \\"Two boys wearing white karate uniforms are engaging in sparring.\\" that \\"A girl is wearing a black belt.\\"?

For example, diseases involving fewer than 200,000 patients in the United States, or larger populations in certain circumstances are subject to the Orphan Drug Act. Because medical research and development of drugs to treat such diseases is financially disadvantageous, companies that do so are rewarded with tax reductions, fee waivers, and market exclusivity on that drug for a limited time (seven years), regardless of whether the drug is protected by patents.

This is because these diseases, which involve fewer than 200,000 patients in the United States or larger populations in certain circumstances, make the development of drugs financially disadvantageous for pharmaceutical companies. In order to encourage research and development in this area, companies are provided financial incentives, such as tax reductions, fee waivers, and market exclusivity on the developed drug for a limited period of time, generally seven years. This market exclusivity applies regardless of whether the drug is protected by patents, which makes it an attractive incentive for pharmaceutical companies to invest in finding treatments for rare diseases, despite the potential financial risks involved."},{"question":"Combine facts and answer this: Were Robert Graves and Oliver La Farge of the same nationality?","response":"Robert Graves and Oliver La Farge were not of the same nationality. In order to provide a comprehensive response, it is necessary to explore the nationalities and backgrounds of both individuals. Robert Graves (1895-1985) was a British poet, novelist, and critic. He was born in Wimbledon, a suburb of London, in the United Kingdom. Graves belonged to the prominent British Graves family. He is best known for his works on historical fiction, particularly the novel \\"I, Claudius\\" (1934), which explores the life of the Roman Emperor Claudius. Besides historical novels, Graves also published numerous volumes of poetry and critical essays on various subjects such as mythology, war, and his own experiences as a soldier during World War I. His nationality was British, specifically English, and he contributed greatly to British literature throughout his life. Oliver La Farge (1901-1963), on the other hand, was an American writer and anthropologist. He was born in New York City, United States, and was a member of the prominent La Farge family, known for their contributions to the fields of art, architecture and literature. La Farge is best known for his Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, \\"Laughing Boy\\" (1929), which documents the experiences of a Navajo youth in a changing world. Apart from being a novelist, La Farge was also an anthropologist who conducted extensive research on Native American cultures, with a focus on the tribes of the southwestern United States, particularly the Navajo and the Hopi peoples. He was deeply involved in promoting and preserving Native American culture and rights. Thus, La Farge's nationality was American. In summary, Robert Graves and Oliver La Farge were not of the same nationality. Graves was British, specifically English, and his literary works were primarily associated with the United Kingdom. In contrast, La Farge was American, and his works mainly revolved around the United States and its Native American cultures. Despite their different nationalities, both writers enjoyed significant success in their respective fields, leaving an everlasting mark on the literary and cultural landscapes of their countries."},{"question":"Instructions: An answer is given.

Step-by-step reasoning:","response":"Yes, the statement is true. Malcolm X was a prominent figure in the African-American civil rights movement. Let's analyze this step by step: 1. Background: Malcolm X, born Malcolm Little on May 19, 1925, became an influential and impactful leader and speaker for African-American civil rights. He was an advocate for the upliftment and empowerment of black individuals and communities in the United States. 2. Membership in the Nation of Islam: Malcolm X joined the Nation of Islam in the early 1950s, which led to his new surname \\"X.\\" Under the guidance and teachings of the Nation of Islam leader, Elijah Muhammad, Malcolm worked to educate and uplift the black community, promote their civil rights, and challenge their suppression. 3. Malcolm X's Philosophy: While initially influenced by the Nation of Islam's teachings, Malcolm eventually broke away and adopted a broader and more inclusive approach to civil rights. He advocated for black nationalism and the importance of having a strong sense of identity and self-worth within the black community. Malcolm encouraged African-Americans to fight for their rights, often stressing the need for self-defense, economic independence, and unity. 4. Public Speaking and Advocacy: Malcolm X became a renowned public speaker and was known for his eloquence and directness when discussing matters of civil rights and racial inequality. His speeches sought to raise awareness of injustices faced by African-Americans and to inspire them to take action. 5. Malcolm X's Influence Beyond the Civil Rights Movement: Although Malcolm X was assassinated in 1965, his ideas and philosophies continued to influence future generations and the civil rights movement. Malcolm X's teachings resonated with various groups and people, such as the Black Panther Party, which emerged in the late 1960s, and his work laid a foundation for the broader pursuit of equal rights and social justice for all. In summary, Malcolm X fought for African-American civil rights through his advocacy, speeches, and teachings, which promoted unity, self-worth, and empowerment among the black community. His ideas and influence continue to be felt today and have had a lasting impact on the civil rights movement and the struggle for equality."},{"question":"Read this and answer the question. If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\". Health care delivery in Nigeria is a concurrent responsibility of the three tiers of government in the country, and the private sector. Nigeria has been reorganising its health system since the Bamako Initiative of 1987, which formally promoted community-based methods of increasing accessibility of drugs and health care services to the population, in part by implementing user fees. The new strategy dramatically increased accessibility through community-based healthcare reform, resulting in more efficient and equitable provision of services. A comprehensive approach strategy was extended to all areas of health care, with subsequent improvement in the health care indicators and improvement in health care efficiency and cost.

Not sure what everyone sees in these pies. Not worth the money. Options: * negative; * positive;","response":"Based on the content of the review, it can be determined that the review is negative. The reviewer seems unsure as to why others highly regard the pies, indicating that their personal experience did not align with the positive opinions of others. Additionally, the statement \\"Not worth the money\\" clearly expresses dissatisfaction with the product's perceived value, which is another indication of a negative view. The negative evaluation of the pies can be attributed to a few factors. Perhaps the reviewer had high expectations due to the hype created by other reviews, leading to disappointment when the pies did not meet those expectations. Alternatively, it is possible that the reviewer simply has a different taste preference than the majority of customers who enjoyed the pies. Consideration should also be given to any external factors that might have influenced the reviewer's experience, such as a specific location or employee who may have provided subpar service. It's essential to keep these variables in mind while evaluating reviews because they may not be illustrative of the overall quality of the pies or the establishment selling them. To summarize, the answer to the question is negative based on the reviewer's uncertainty regarding the pies' appeal and their dissatisfaction with the cost-value relationship. However, it is essential to consider any relevant factors contributing to this negative review before making a definitive conclusion about the pies' overall quality."},{"question":"it's got a great location at the start of the \\"burger mile\\" - right on the inner lakes. one of the four owners earns a side living as bass player in copenhagen alt/pop band lukas graham!

To find the sum of these 4 numbers, we can use the same formula: Sum of first 4 numbers = 20 × 4 = 80 3. The average of the last 4 numbers is 16. To find the sum of these 4 numbers, we can use the same formula: Sum of last 4 numbers = 16 × 4 = 64 4. Now, let's find the sum of the middle number. We know that the sum of all 9 numbers is 153, and we already have the sum of the first 4 numbers and the sum of the last 4 numbers. To find the middle number, we can subtract the sum of the first 4 and last 4 numbers from the total sum: Sum of middle number = Sum of all 9 numbers - (Sum of first 4 numbers + Sum of last 4 numbers) Sum of middle number = 153 - (80 + 64) = 153 - 144 = 9 So, the middle number is 9.

They are currently signed to Warner Bros. Records, and have released four studio albums: Antidotes (2008), Total Life Forever (2010), Holy Fire (2013), What Went Down (2015), one video album, six extended plays and nineteen singles. The band have toured internationally and have featured at Glastonbury, Coachella and Roskilde festivals. Holy Fire was released in both the UK and the US on 11 February 2013. The album's lead single, \\"Inhaler\\", received its first radio play on 5 November 2012. They played the song \\"My Number\\" for the first time on Later... with Jools Holland. Holy Fire was produced by Flood and Alan Moulder, who have worked with many artists, including Nine Inch Nails, The Smashing Pumpkins and My Bloody Valentine. The album was recorded at Assault & Battery studios in London. Yannis Philippakis stated that the recording process had some unconventional moments: \\"At one point we even made these poor studio interns collect bones. We were inspired by voodoo, these Haitian rhythms. We collected some ourselves, from butchers in Willesden High Road. Mainly cows, I think often they had gristle and cartilage on them, mainly cow and occasionally sheep. We had to order these big pots because one of the shoulder blades was too big! We boiled the flesh away so we could use them as percussion! We wanted to get primitive!\\" According to The Guardian: \\"Their producers, Flood and Alan Moulder, even tricked them by recording their rehearsal in order to capture a more uninhibited sound.\\" In late November to mid-December, Foals toured the UK for an album preview. The tour was supported by Petite Noir (a close friend of Philippakis'). In summer 2013, they attended a number of festivals and headlined Latitude Festival in Suffolk in July. The band have recently played a World and UK tour, which ended with two sell out shows at Alexandra Palace in February. The two shows were in stark contrast compared to playing the same venue 7 years earlier to an almost empty room while supporting Bloc Party, a sentiment which lead singer Philippakis did not fail to mention during the live shows.

(3). are shown of people swimming around, laughing, and laughing.. (4). are shown of people getting ready on land as well as swimming around the ocean..","response":"(4). are shown of people getting ready on land as well as swimming around the ocean. Explanation: The sentence from the paragraph talks about scuba divers and people riding boats, so it implies that the topic is related to water activities. Out of the four options, option 4 is the most relevant as it directly refers to people getting ready for some water-based activities and swimming in the ocean. The other options are not the best choices for the following reasons: (1) Croquet is not a water-related activity, so it would be out of context in a paragraph discussing water activities. (2) While this option talks about people posing in an indoor swimming pool, it focuses more on people speaking to the camera and posing with one another, rather than engaging in water-related activities. (3) Although swimming is mentioned, the focus on laughter twice in the same sentence makes it repetitive and unclear what kind of activities are being discussed."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given a text from tweets and a boolean question whether this tweet has positive sentiment or negative sentiment.

For this example, I will select the field of environmental science. Step 2: Narrow down the topic Within the field of environmental science, there are numerous subtopics and issues that can be explored. I will narrow down the focus to climate change, specifically looking at the effects of global warming on weather patterns. Step 3: Define the context Now that I have a more specific focus, I can create a context by setting the stage and providing relevant background information. In this case, the context would be: \\"Global warming refers to the long-term increase in Earth's average surface temperature due to human activities, predominantly the emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane. Over the past century, global average temperatures have increased at an unprecedented rate, which has consequently led to a myriad of changes in natural systems and human societies. One area in which these impacts are profoundly felt is the alteration of weather patterns worldwide.\\" Step 4: Identify research gaps or areas of interest To develop a hypothesis, it's important to identify research gaps or areas of interest within the context. In this case, a potential area of interest could be the relationship between global warming and the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as hurricanes. Step 5: Formulate a hypothesis With an area of interest identified, I can now generate a hypothesis. A hypothesis is a specific, testable, and falsifiable statement that attempts to answer a research question or explain an observed phenomenon. For this example, the hypothesis could be: \\"Increased global temperatures due to human-induced global warming are responsible for the observed increase in the frequency and intensity of hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean.\\""},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Noah is currently making dinner in his kitchen.

Justin is eating ice cream, which has a low temperature. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Do the particles have more kinetic energy in the ice cream or in the soup? Answer:","response":"The particles have more kinetic energy in the soup. In the given scenario, the soup on the stove has been boiling for a while, which means it has a high temperature. In contrast, the ice cream that Justin is eating has a low temperature as it is a cold dessert. When considering kinetic energy, it is important to remember that the temperature of an object is proportional to the average kinetic energy of the particles in that object. As the temperature increases, the particles move faster, and their kinetic energy increases. When temperature decreases, the particles move slower, and their kinetic energy decreases. Since the soup has a higher temperature than the ice cream, the particles in the soup have more kinetic energy compared to the particles in the ice cream."},{"question":"Palermo As the Roman Empire was falling apart, Palermo fell under the control of several Germanic tribes.

Once they got to the building, Danae found out she had to put Marissa's wheelchair together all by herself. Normally, the airplane's workers should have helped her, but they did not come to help. So, Danae used her strength and put the wheelchair together so her sister could sit down and be ready to go on their next adventure.

This resolution marked the earliest attempt to establish a Canadian government policy requesting the sovereign not to grant knighthoods, baronetcies, and peerages to Canadians and set the precedent for later policies restricting Canadians from accepting titles from foreign countries. Dissatisfaction with the British honours system led to the gradual creation of a separate system for Canada. - A baronet (or ; abbreviated Bart or Bt) or the rare female equivalent, a baronetess (, or ; abbreviation \\"Btss\\"), is the holder of a baronetcy, a hereditary title awarded by the British Crown. The practice of awarding baronetcies was originally introduced in England in the 14th century and was used by James I of England in 1611 as a means of raising funds. - Ethnic Channels Group (ECG) is a Canadian television broadcasting, distribution and communications company, specializing in multicultural television channels for the Canadian and United States markets. ECG has been in operation since 2004 and was co-founded by Slava Levin. - Broadcasting is the distribution of audio and/or video content or other messages to a dispersed audience via any electronic mass communications medium, but typically one using the electromagnetic spectrum (radio waves), in a one-to-many model. Broadcasting began with AM radio, which came into popular use around 1920 with the spread of vacuum tube radio transmitters and receivers. Before this, all forms of electronic communication (early radio, telephone, and telegraph) were one-to-one, with the message intended for a single recipient. The term \\"broadcasting\\", borrowed from the agricultural method of sowing seeds in a field by casting them broadly about, was coined by either KDKA manager Frank Conrad or RCA historian George Clark around 1920 to distinguish this new activity of \\"one-to-many\\" communication; a single radio station transmitting to multiple listeners. - The Gaza Strip (' ), or simply Gaza\\"', is a small self-governing Palestinian territory on the eastern coast of the Mediterranean Sea, that borders Egypt on the southwest for and Israel on the east and north along a border. Gaza, together with the West Bank, comprise the Palestinian territories claimed by the Palestinians as the State of Palestine. The territories of Gaza and the West Bank are separated from each other by Israeli territory. Both fall under the jurisdiction of the Palestinian Authority, but Gaza has since June 2007 been governed by Hamas, a Palestinian Islamic organization which came to power in free elections in 2006. It has been placed under an Israeli and U.S.-led international economic and political boycott from that time onwards. - The Israeli Network is a Canadian exempt Category B Hebrew language specialty channel . It is wholly owned by Ethnic Channels Group , with its name used under license from the owners of the Israeli - based TV channel , The Israeli Network . - A television channel is a physical or virtual channel over which a television station or television network is distributed. For example, in North America, \\"channel 2\\" refers to the broadcast or cable band of 54 to 60 MHz, with carrier frequencies of 55.25 MHz for NTSC analog video (VSB) and 59.75 MHz for analog audio (FM), or 55.31 MHz for digital ATSC (8VSB). Channels may be shared by many different television stations or cable-distributed channels depending on the location and service provider. - Hebrew (\\"\\" or ) is a language native to Israel, spoken by over 9 million people worldwide, of whom over 5 million are in Israel. Historically, it is regarded as the language of the Israelites and their ancestors, although the language was not referred to by the name Hebrew in the Tanakh. The earliest examples of written Paleo-Hebrew date from the 10th century BCE. Hebrew belongs to the West Semitic branch of the Afroasiatic language family. The Hebrew language is the only living Canaanite language left. - A specialty channel can be a commercial broadcasting or non-commercial television channel which consists of television programming focused on a single genre, subject or targeted television market at a specific demographic. - Israel , officially known as the State of Israel, is a country in the Middle East, on the southeastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea and the northern shore of the Red Sea. It has land borders with Lebanon to the north, Syria to the northeast, Jordan on the east, the Palestinian territories of the West Bank and Gaza Strip to the east and west, respectively, and Egypt to the southwest. The country contains geographically diverse features within its relatively small area. Israel's financial and technology center is Tel Aviv, while its seat of government and proclaimed capital is Jerusalem, although the state's sovereignty over the city of Jerusalem is internationally unrecognized.

So we start with this problem: 572 * y - 33 + 154 = 693 * y First, let's do the adding part. We have -33 and +154. When we add these two numbers, we get: 121 (Because 154 - 33 = 121) Now our problem looks like this: 572 * y + 121 = 693 * y To find y, we need to get all the \\"y\\" parts on one side. Let's move the 572 * y to the other side by subtracting it from both sides: 693 * y - 572 * y = 121 Now, let's subtract: 121 * y = 121 We're almost there! To find out what y is, we need to divide both numbers by 121: y = 121 / 121 And when we do that, we find that: y = 1 So, in this math problem, y stands for the number 1.

Roger Podacter, Miami Dolphins' Head of Operations, mysteriously falls to his death from his apartment. At the crime scene, Miami Police Lieutenant Lois Einhorn concludes the death to be a suicide. However, Ace proves it was a murder, embarrassing and infuriating Einhorn.

Finkle became so obsessed with the loss and Marino that he became insane and was committed to a mental hospital. However, despite Ace warning Melissa to send extra protection, Marino is still kidnapped.

President Alvaro Colom announced the 30-day emergency rule in Alta Verapaz on Sunday. The rule allows the military to order anyone suspected of conspiring against the government to be arrested and imprisoned without a warrant, the state-run AGN news agency said. \\"Starting today, combined forces will retake the streets of Alta Verapaz,\\" a government statement released Sunday morning said. Government data shows cells of the drug gang known as Los Zetas are in the area to protect drug trafficking paths between Honduras and Mexico, \\"intimidating the population with their heavy weapons and threatening farmers to give up their land for criminal activities,\\" AGN reported. The state of siege also allows the government to place greater restrictions on public gatherings, travel visas and gun licenses, among other things, according to AGN. \\"The population should be calm. What we are doing is not intended to persecute honest, working people,\\" Interior Minister Carlos Menocal told reporters. Menocal said operations in the coming days would aim to boost regional security, regain control of territory, identify criminal gangs and capture their members. In an interview with CNN en Espanol last month, Menocal said his country needed more help from the United States to combat cartels, which were increasingly carving out new drug transport paths. \\"In the end, the large majority of drugs travel through Central America, and the assignment of resources or the financial support of the United States government is not the same as Colombia and Mexico receive,\\" he said.

In Europe and the U.S. green is sometimes associated with death (green has several seemingly contrary associations), sickness, or the devil, but in China its associations are very positive, as the symbol of fertility and happiness. In the Middle Ages and Renaissance, when the color of clothing showed the owner's social status, green was worn by merchants, bankers and the gentry, while red was the color of the nobility. The Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci wears green, showing she is not from a noble family; the benches in the British House of Commons are green, while those in the House of Lords are red. Green is also the traditional color of safety and permission; a green light means go ahead, a green card permits permanent residence in the United States. It is the most important color in Islam. It was the color of the banner of Muhammad, and is found in the flags of nearly all Islamic countries, and represents the lush vegetation of Paradise. It is also often associated with the culture of Gaelic Ireland, and is a color of the flag of Ireland. Because of its association with nature, it is the color of the environmental movement. Political groups advocating environmental protection and social justice describe themselves as part of the Green movement, some naming themselves Green parties. This has led to similar campaigns in advertising, as companies have sold green, or environmentally friendly, products. Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): Besides happiness, what contradictory meaning does China ascribe to green?","response":"In Chinese culture, green is primarily seen as a symbol of fertility and happiness. However, it may also have a contradictory meaning associated with infidelity. This negative connotation may not be as prevalent or widely recognized as the positive associations of fertility and happiness, but it is present in some aspects of Chinese culture, particularly in literature and idioms. For example, a well-known Chinese expression, \\"wearing a green hat\\" (戴绿帽子 or dài lǜ màozi), symbolizes a man whose wife or partner is unfaithful. The origin of this phrase can be traced back to the Yuan dynasty, when the families of prostitutes were required to wear green clothing and accessories. Another example is the classic Chinese novel \\"Dream of the Red Chamber,\\" where one of the main characters, Jia Baoyu, describes the jealousy caused by suspicion of infidelity as \\"green plums simmering in a golden pot\\" (金炉绿梅 or jīnlú lǜméi). The negative context of jealousy and infidelity links the color green with these unwanted feelings and circumstances in this literary context. Despite these negative associations, it is essential to note that different cultures interpret colors differently, and the positive symbolism of green as a representation of fertility, happiness, and overall optimism remains the more dominant aspect in Chinese culture."},{"question":"Secondary meristem is located within and around the vascular tissues, and secondary growth occurs in the lateral meristems.

To achieve this, she organized cultural events and workshops to promote understanding and inclusivity. As a member of the National Society of High School Scholars, Shelby has taken advantage of numerous opportunities to engage in academic programmes and leadership initiatives. Her involvement in extracurricular activities, such as drama club, debate team, and volunteer work, has further cemented her passion for learning and helped her grow as a well-rounded individual. Shelby’s success in her A-level exams is not only a personal triumph but also represents an important milestone for both the Gypsy and Traveller communities. Her accomplishments highlight the potential for talented, hardworking students from these communities to excel in higher education when given the right support and resources. It also challenges stereotypes and misconceptions about Gypsy and Traveller students, proving that they, too, can achieve great things. Oxford University's efforts to diversify its student body and reach out to underrepresented communities is an important step towards fostering a more inclusive and equal academic environment. The university's commitment to admitting students from a wide range of backgrounds helps break down barriers to higher education and ensures that talented individuals like Shelby can thrive. As Shelby embarks on this exciting new chapter, she will undoubtedly continue to inspire others within her community to pursue their educational dreams as well. Her achievements serve as a powerful reminder that, through hard work, determination and unwavering support from loved ones, even the most seemingly insurmountable obstacles can be overcome. The sentence ends: 'in order to reach and support other bright and promising students like Shelby from diverse and underrepresented communities, allowing them to achieve their full potential and contribute to a more inclusive and innovative academic environment.'"},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: You are given a concatenated string consisting of two parts that are separated by a newline character.

The expensive trip to church was a surprise for Richard Albert, who lives right on the Canadian border. Like the other half-dozen people of Township 15, crossing the border is a daily occurrence for Albert. The nearby Quebec village of St. Pamphile is where they shop, eat and go to church. There are many such situations in these areas along the largely unguarded 5,530-mile border between Canada and the US -- which in some cases actually runs down the middle of streets or through buildings. As a result, Albert says he did not expect any problems three weeks ago when he returned home to the US after attending church in Canada, as usual. The US customs station in this area is closed on Sundays, so he just drove around the locked gate, as he had done every weekend since the gate appeared last May, following a tightening of border security. Two days later, Albert was told to go to the customs office, where an officer told him he had been caught on camera crossing the border illegally. Ottawa has given out special passes to some 300 US citizens in that area so they can enter the country when Canadian customs stations are closed, but the US stopped a similar program last May. That forces the people to a 200-mile detour along hilly roads to get home through another border checkpoint. Albert has requested that the customs office change their decisions on the fine, but he has not attended a Sunday church since. \\"I feel like I'm living in a prison.\\" he said. The answer is:","response":"Question: What happened to Richard Albert after crossing the US-Canada border to attend church on a Sunday? A) He was congratulated by the US customs officials B) He was fined 10,000 for breaking Washington's strict new security rules C) He was given a special pass by Ottawa for future crossings D) He was forced to take a 200-mile detour along hilly roads Answer: B) He was fined 10,000 for breaking Washington's strict new security rules"},{"question":"Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Peter: Let's play computer games!

Four aliens discover it and are sucked into the craft through its vacuum tube, after which it makes its way back to Earth. The aliens are able to escape from a government base by using their powers (with which they can destroy or heal anything they touch). During the escape, the youngest one hides in a passing van, occupied by a boy named Eric Cruise who uses a wheelchair, his older brother, Michael, and their single mother, Janet, who are moving to California from Illinois.

Premise: GAO's overall human capital situation also is of growing concern. The premise suggests that there is an issue within the Government Accountability Office (GAO) when it comes to managing human resources. When it mentions \\"human capital,\\" it refers to the employees and their capabilities within the organization. The phrase \\"of growing concern\\" indicates that this issue is becoming more severe and may negatively impact the organization's operations or success. Hypothesis: GAO does not have enough people to fill the jobs they have. The hypothesis presents a potential explanation for the premise by suggesting that the GAO's concern with their human capital may be due to a shortage of people needed to fill the available positions. This could mean that the GAO is struggling to hire enough qualified personnel or retain existing employees at a rate sufficient to manage their workload and responsibilities. Now, to assess whether the conclusion can be drawn in this scenario: If the premise is true - which states that the human capital situation at the GAO is a growing concern - it doesn't necessarily confirm the hypothesis that they don't have enough people to fill their jobs. While the hypothesis may be one possible explanation for the premise, there could be other elements contributing to the concerns. Some alternative explanations could be: 1. Low employee morale or job satisfaction, leading to increased turnover and difficulty retaining talent. 2. Skill gaps among available workforce, where GAO employees may not possess the required competencies or qualifications for specific jobs. 3. Budget constraints leading to hiring freezes or inability to offer competitive compensation and benefits, making it challenging to attract qualified job candidates. 4. Inefficient workforce planning or human capital management processes, resulting in underutilization of available resources. In conclusion, although the hypothesis may be aligned with the premise, it is not possible to definitively conclude that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis must be true as well. The premise presents a broader issue in the GAO's human capital situation, and the hypothesis is just one possible explanation for this issue. There could be alternative explanations causing the human capital concern, as mentioned above. Therefore, further investigation and analysis would be needed to confirm or refute the hypothesis by considering other potential contributing factors to the growing human capital concern at GAO."},{"question":"Definition: In this task, you are given a summary for US Congressional and California state bill, your task is to generate a Title for this bill.

In January 2019, Howard Schultz, who had stepped down as Starbucks CEO in 2017 and left the Starbucks board in June 2018, began publicly discussing a potential independent bid for the U.S. presidency in 2020. Schultz's potential candidacy was met with mixed views from various political analysts and public figures, but his prospective run, particularly as an independent candidate, caught the attention of Michael Bloomberg. Michael Bloomberg, who had been the mayor of New York City from 2002 to 2013, is a billionaire and an influential political figure himself. He had previously weighed multiple times running for president as an independent candidate. During the 2016 presidential election, he had explored a presidential run, but ultimately decided against it amid concerns that a third-party candidate could potentially divide the Democratic vote and put then-Republican candidate Trump in office. In the lead-up to the 2020 election, Bloomberg ultimately decided to run as a Democratic candidate but suspended his campaign after the Super Tuesday primaries in March 2020 and endorsed Joe Biden. When Bloomberg learned about Howard Schultz's potential presidential run as an independent candidate in 2020, he was not pleased, as he was concerned that an independent candidacy could potentially help President Donald Trump get re-elected by splitting the Democratic vote. Despite Schultz positioning himself as a \\"centrist independent candidate\\" and voicing concerns about the polarizing nature of American politics, Bloomberg still saw it as a potential threat to the Democratic Party's chances for success in the election. This prompted Bloomberg to make the blunt remark, asking, \\"Who the f**k is he?\\" in response to Schultz's potential candidacy. Ultimately, Howard Schultz decided to abandon his exploration of a presidential run, citing concerns about increasing polarization and the risk of inadvertently assisting in Trump's re-election as reasons for his decision."},{"question":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task. In this task, you are given a question and a context passage. You have to answer the question based on the given passage. who was the scholar mentioned in the last paragraph?, Context: The only words of Jesus on the cross in the Mark and Matthew accounts, this is a quotation of Psalm 22. Since other verses of the same Psalm are cited in the crucifixion accounts, it is often considered a literary and theological creation. Geza Vermes, however, points out that the verse is cited in Aramaic rather than the Hebrew in which it usually would have been recited, and suggests that by the time of Jesus, this phrase had become a proverbial saying in common usage. Compared to the accounts in the other Gospels, which he describes as 'theologically correct and reassuring', he considers this phrase 'unexpected, disquieting and in consequence more probable'. He describes it as bearing 'all the appearances of a genuine cry'. Raymond Brown likewise comments that he finds 'no persuasive argument against attributing to the Jesus of Mark/Matt the literal sentiment of feeling forsaken expressed in the Psalm quote'.

He practices twice as long each day on the weekend. How many minutes does he practice during a whole week?. Me: Hmmm, let me think. I think this is the detailed solution:","response":"Sure, let's break it down step by step: 1. During the school week, Daniel practices for 15 minutes each day. There are 5 days in a school week (Monday through Friday). To find out how many minutes he practices during the school week, multiply the number of minutes per day by the number of days: 15 minutes/day × 5 days = 75 minutes 2. On weekends, Daniel practices twice as long as he does on school days. Since he practices 15 minutes per day during the week, we need to multiply that by 2 to find out how long he practices on weekends: 15 minutes/day × 2 = 30 minutes/day 3. There are 2 days in a weekend (Saturday and Sunday). To find out how many minutes Daniel practices during the weekend, multiply the number of minutes per day by the number of days: 30 minutes/day × 2 days = 60 minutes 4. To find out the total number of minutes Daniel practices during the entire week, add the minutes from the school week (75) to the minutes from the weekend (60): 75 minutes + 60 minutes = 135 minutes So, Daniel practices basketball for a total of 135 minutes during a whole week."},{"question":"Свод нависал низко, как раз чтобы нам идти не сгибаясь, а стены были бугристыми.

The graph below shows the cities with the worst commutes in the world, according to IBM's Commuter Pain Index (via Wired). The city with the world's worst commute, according to the IBM study, is Beijing, followed by Mexico City, Johannesburg, Moscow, and New Delhi. London, New York, L.A., and my adopted hometown of Toronto also rank in the top 20. Stockholm has the world's best commute among the 20 cities in the IBM survey. Commuting is a waste of energy and time, and carries with it enormous economic costs. Commuting costs America an estimated 90 billion dollars per year in terms of lost productivity and wasted energy, according to the annual Urban Mobility Report. Our own detailed calculations by Martin Prosperity Institute (MPI) research director Kevin Stolarick find that every minute shaved off America's commuting time is worth an estimated 19.5 billion dollars. That translates into 97.7 billion for five minutes, 195 billion for 10 minutes, and 292 billion for every 15 minutes saved nationally. The chart below from the IBM study shows the percentage of drivers in each of the 20 surveyed cities who would work more if their commuting time was significantly reduced. The index is based on IBM surveys of 8,192 motorists in 20 cities across six continents: The index is comprised of 10 issues: 1) commuting time, 2) time stuck in traffic, agreement that: 3) price of gas is already too high, 4) traffic has gotten worse, 5) start-stop traffic is a problem, 6) driving causes stress, 7) driving causes anger, 8) traffic affects work, 9) traffic so bad driving stopped, and 10) decided not to make trip due to traffic. We want to hear what you think about this article. Submit a letter to the editor or write to letters@theatlantic.com. ||||| Quit whining about your commute. It isn’t that bad, even for you Angelinos and New Yorkers. Your daily slog through traffic is nothing compared to Moscow, where people might spend more than three hours sucking exhaust fumes while going nowhere fast. Even that pales compared to New Delhi, where 96 percent of drivers say their commute is so hellish it harms their health. And you’ll get no sympathy in Beijing, where traffic can get so bad that almost 7 out of 10 drivers have at some point said, “Screw this” and gone home. Number-crunchers at IBM Research surveyed 8,192 motorists in 20 cities, and — no surprise — most of them think traffic has only grown worse during the past three years. More than half said gridlock has wreaked havoc on their physical or mental health. One-third said it is undercutting their productivity at work or school. As IBM notes, mounting congestion is relatively new phenomenon in emerging markets where the economy is growing faster than the infrastructure. That stands in contrast to cities like New York, Houston and Los Angeles, where growth has occurred over time, allowing traffic engineers to at least try to keep up. But no matter the cause, we can’t pave our way out of this. “Traditional solutions — building more roads — will not be enough to overcome the growth of traffic in these rapidly developing cities, so multiple solutions need to be deployed simultaneously to avoid a failure of the transportation networks,” says Naveen Lamba, who has the unusual title of IBM global industry lead for intelligent transportation. “New technologies are required that empower transportation officials to better understand and proactively manage the flow of traffic.” You’d expect IBM to say that since it is developing just that sort of technology. But the numbers back it up. China is the world’s largest auto market, and traffic volume in Beijing is growing 10 percent annually. Moscow says unsnarling its roads will cost 6.5 billion. The average traffic speed in New Delhi will fall from 15 km/hr to just 5 by the end of next year. The list goes on. IBM used the results to compile a “Commuter Pain Index,” which ranks the emotional and economic toll of commuting. The index is a measure of 10 criteria, from the amount of time spent sitting in traffic to the frequency with which people simply gave up and went home. Here it is, by the numbers: Some highlights, or maybe we should say low points, from the study: Forty-nine percent of respondents say traffic has gotten worse in the past three years and 18 percent say it is a lot worse. Oddly, 16 percent of those surveyed in Beijing and 17 percent of those in New Delhi say things have improved. Almost nine in 10 respondents say they’ve sat in gridlocked traffic at some point during the past three years. The average delay was 1 hour, but Muscovites wish it was that long. They’re used to spending an average of 2.5 hours sitting still in the worst tie-ups. Forty percent said they’ve spent three hours or more in stymied traffic. Thirty-one percent of respondents said they’ve encountered traffic so bad they simply turned around and went home. That number climbed to 69 percent for residents of Beijing. Here in the United States, 85 percent of respondents say traffic is as bad or worse now than it was three years ago. But that doesn’t mean they’re about to change their behavior. More than 8 in 10 people drive solo to work — compared to 50 percent for the rest of the world — and only 3.1 percent carpool. Perhaps that’s why we spend more money driving than we do on groceries. IBM’s web-based survey, conducted by Survey Sampling International in 2008 and 2009 and released today, has a margin of error of plus or minus 2 points overall and plus or minus 5 points when comparing cities. Respondents were drivers between 18 and 65 years old. Photo of just another traffic jam in Moscow: Leszek Golubinski/Flickr ||||| Armonk, NY - 30 Jun 2010: -- Moscow copes with the two-and-a-half hour traffic jam -- Despite congestion, Beijing drivers report improvement in traffic -- Houston, New York and Los Angeles fare well, relatively speaking The daily commute in some of the world's most economically important international cities is longer and more grueling than before imagined, reflecting the failure of transportation infrastructure to keep pace with economic activity, according to IBM's (NYSE: IBM) first global Commuter Pain study released today. IBM surveyed 8,192 motorists in 20 cities on six continents, the majority of whom say that traffic has gotten worse in the past three years. The congestion in many of today's developing cities is a relatively recent phenomenon, having paralleled the rapid economic growth of those cities during the past decade or two. By contrast, the traffic in places like New York, Los Angeles or London has developed gradually over many decades, giving officials more time and resources to address the problem. For example, the middle class in China is growing rapidly, with the number of new cars registered in Beijing in the first four months of 2010 rising 23.8% to 248,000, according to the Beijing municipal taxation office. Beijing's total investments in its subway system are projected to be more than 331.2 billion yuan by 2015 as the city expands the system to more than double its current size, according to Beijing Infrastructure Investment Co., Ltd. The city plans to invest 80 billion yuan in 2010 in building its transportation infrastructure. The study did offer a number of bright spots. Forty eight percent of drivers surveyed in Beijing reported that traffic has improved in the past three years – the high for the survey – reflecting substantial initiatives to improve the transportation network in that city. In addition, the commute for drivers in Stockholm, Sweden seems to be, if not pleasant, then largely pain-free. Only 14% of Stockholm drivers surveyed said that roadway traffic negatively affected work or school performance. Overall, though, the study paints a picture of metropolitan-area commuters in many cities struggling to get to and from work each day. For example, 57% of all respondents say that roadway traffic has negatively affected their health, but that percentage is 96% in New Delhi and 95% in Beijing. Similarly, 29% overall say that roadway traffic has negatively affected work or school performance, but that percentage rises to 84% in Beijing, 62% in New Delhi, and 56% in Mexico City. Moscow was notable for the duration of its traffic jams. Drivers there reported an average delay of two-and-a-half hours when asked to report the length of the worst traffic jam they experienced in the past three years. IBM Commuter Pain Index IBM compiled the results of the survey into an Index that ranks the emotional and economic toll of commuting in each city on a scale of one to 100, with 100 being the most onerous. The Index reveals a tremendous disparity in the pain of the daily commute from city to city. Stockholm had the least painful commute of the cities studied, followed by Melbourne and Houston (which tied) and New York City. Here's how the cities stack up: The index is comprised of 10 issues: 1) commuting time, 2) time stuck in traffic, agreement that: 3) price of gas is already too high, 4) traffic has gotten worse, 5) start-stop traffic is a problem, 6) driving causes stress, 7) driving causes anger, 8) traffic affects work, 9) traffic so bad driving stopped, and 10) decided not to make trip due to traffic. The cities scored as follows: Beijing: 99, Mexico City: 99, Johannesburg: 97, Moscow: 84, New Delhi: 81, Sao Paolo: 75, Milan: 52, Buenos Aires: 50, Madrid: 48, London: 36, Paris: 36, Toronto: 32, Amsterdam: 25, Los Angeles: 25, Berlin: 24, Montreal: 23, New York: 19, Houston: 17, Melbourne: 17, Stockholm: 15. \\"Traditional solutions -- building more roads -- will not be enough to overcome the growth of traffic in these rapidly developing cities, so multiple solutions need to be deployed simultaneously to avoid a failure of the transportation networks,\\" said Naveen Lamba, IBM's global industry lead for intelligent transportation. \\"New techniques are required that empower transportation officials to better understand and proactively manage the flow of traffic.\\" IBM Global Commuter Pain Survey – Major Findings Analysis of the survey results indicated a number of key findings related to how traffic impacts commuters: The Commuter Pain Survey was conducted by IBM to better understand consumer thinking toward traffic congestion as the issue reaches crisis proportions nationwide and higher levels of auto emissions stir environmental concerns. These events are impacting communities around the world, where governments, citizens and private sector organizations are looking beyond traditional remedies like additional roads and greater access to public transportation to reverse the negative impacts of increased road congestion. This year marks the first global Commuter Pain survey. IBM previously conducted the Commuter Pain survey in the United States in 2008 and 2009. IBM is actively working in the area of Smarter Transportation using a worldwide team of scientists, industry experts and IT services professionals to research, test and deploy new traffic information management capabilities in cities around the world. Findings from the Commuter Pain Survey will be used to assess citizen concerns about traffic and commuter issues; expand solutions like automated tolling, real-time traffic prediction, congestion charging, and intelligent route planning; and serve as a basis for pioneering innovative new approaches to traffic mitigation. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","response":"Commuting is considered one of life's least enjoyable activities, with cities such as Beijing, Mexico City, Johannesburg, Moscow, and New Delhi having the worst commutes in the world, according to IBM's Commuter Pain Index. Commuting costs America an estimated 90 billion per year in lost productivity and wasted energy, and every minute shaved off commuting time is worth approximately 19.5 billion. IBM's survey is based on 10 factors, including commuting time, time stuck in traffic, and the impact on mental health and work, and was conducted with 8,192 motorists across 20 cities on six continents. The study highlights the need for innovative solutions to tackle traffic congestion as traditional methods, such as building more roads, are insufficient for the rapid growth in developing cities."},{"question":"See question below: One of the following sentences is nonsensical.

This is because the typical purpose of a bonfire is to burn wood and create a large, controlled outdoor fire. While it is possible to burn cans, it is not a conventional or efficient method for building a bonfire. Additionally, burning cans could release harmful fumes or chemicals, which is undesirable and potentially hazardous. Sentence A, on the other hand, makes logical sense, as wood is a common and appropriate material for creating a bonfire."},{"question":"In nature, what are active, dormant and extinct?","response":"In nature, particularly in the context of volcanology and the study of volcanic activity, the terms 'active,' 'dormant,' and 'extinct' are used to describe a volcano's current status, potential to erupt, and geological history. 1. Active Volcanoes: An active volcano refers to one which has erupted recently or shows potential signs of erupting in the near future. Active volcanoes exhibit a variety of phenomena, such as continuous release of gases, frequent seismic activity, high lava and magma temperature, and earth deformation caused by magma movement. Volcanologists generally consider a volcano to be active if it has erupted within the past 10,000 years, as this duration is consistent with the timescales associated with volcanic processes and human history. Active volcanoes are further classified into two types: a) Continuously active: These volcanoes are almost always in an eruptive state, such as Kīlauea in Hawaii and Mount Etna in Italy. Numerous effusive and explosive eruptions take place in these volcanoes, posing a continuous hazard to nearby populations and the environment. b) Intermittently active: These volcanoes experience periods of activity followed by periods of inactivity, which can last months, years, or even centuries. Examples of intermittently active volcanoes include Mount St. Helens in the United States and Mount Merapi in Indonesia. 2. Dormant Volcanoes: Dormant volcanoes are those that have not erupted for a long time but still possess the potential to erupt in the future. These volcanoes show minor or no signs of volcanic activity, such as low-frequency seismic events or minimal gas emissions. Dormancy periods can last from a few decades to thousands of years, making it challenging to predict the next eruption. Dormant volcanoes are often difficult to distinguish from active or extinct volcanoes, as visible signs of volcanic activity may be absent for extended periods, even in cases when an eruption is imminent. Some dormant volcanoes may be reawakened by tectonic or magmatic causes, such as the movement of the Earth's crust or the intrusion of new magma into a magma chamber. An example of a dormant volcano is Mount Rainier in Washington, which last erupted around 1,100 years ago but still possesses the potential for future eruptions. 3. Extinct Volcanoes: An extinct volcano is one that is unlikely to erupt again because it no longer has a magma supply or connection to a magma chamber. These volcanoes typically have not erupted for tens of thousands to millions of years, and the majority of their volcanic structures have eroded or been altered by weathering processes. Determining whether a volcano is extinct can be challenging, as a long period of inactivity could be mistaken for dormancy. However, several geological indicators suggest that a volcano is extinct, such as the lack of heat flow or seismic activity, deeply eroded volcanic structures, or rocks formed from magma that solidified within the Earth's crust and have been later uplifted by tectonic forces. An example of an extinct volcano is Edinburgh's extinct volcanic complex's highest peak, Arthur's Seat in Scotland. It last erupted approximately 335 million years ago, and its magma source has since been depleted or disconnected. In summary, the terms active, dormant, and extinct describe a volcano's current status and the potential for future eruptions. Active volcanoes are either continuously or intermittently eruptive, dormant volcanoes have not erupted for a long time but may potentially erupt again, and extinct volcanoes are unlikely to erupt again in the future due to a lack of magma supply. Understanding the differences between these classifications is vital for assessing volcanic hazards, planning mitigation strategies, and ensuring public safety."},{"question":"Generate a sentence that describes the following data: Distinguished Service Medal (United States Navy), higher, Department of Commerce Gold Medal; Alan Shepard, birthPlace, New Hampshire; Alan Shepard, birthDate, \\"1923-11-18\\"; Alan Shepard, award, Distinguished Service Medal (United States Navy).

Answer: The greenhouse effect is a natural phenomenon that helps maintain the Earth's temperature by trapping heat from the sun. It is primarily caused by a combination of natural and human-induced factors, with human activities being the primary driving force of its exacerbation. 1. Carbon dioxide (CO2): Carbon dioxide is the most significant greenhouse gas responsible for global warming. It is released into the atmosphere mainly through the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and various industrial processes. As a result of human activities, the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere has increased by more than 40% since the Industrial Revolution, causing the Earth's temperature to rise. 2. Methane (CH4): Methane, another potent greenhouse gas, is released during various natural and anthropogenic processes, such as livestock farming, rice cultivation, and the decay of organic matter in landfills. Additionally, the extraction and transport of fossil fuels, particularly natural gas, lead to methane emissions. Methane is 25 times more effective at trapping heat than CO2 over a 100-year period. 3. Nitrous oxide (N2O): Nitrous oxide emissions result from agricultural practices, such as the use of synthetic fertilizers and the burning of crop residues. Industrial activities and the burning of fossil fuels also contribute to its release. N2O has a global warming potential that is about 300 times greater than that of CO2 over a 100-year timeframe. 4. Fluorinated gases: Fluorinated gases, including hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), are synthetic gases mainly produced during various industrial processes. Although they are present in relatively small concentrations, they are potent greenhouse gases, with global warming potentials up to thousands of times stronger than CO2. 5. Water vapor: Water vapor is a powerful greenhouse gas, as it amplifies the warming effect of other greenhouse gases, such as CO2. As human-induced global warming increases, it leads to an increase in atmospheric water vapor, further exacerbating the greenhouse effect. The combined impact of these greenhouse gases contributes to an enhanced greenhouse effect, resulting in the increase of the Earth's surface temperature. This leads to various consequences, such as melting of polar ice caps, rising sea levels, and more frequent and severe weather events, which threaten ecosystems and human settlements worldwide. To mitigate global warming, it is crucial to reduce the emissions of these greenhouse gases through the adoption of cleaner energy technologies, sustainable agricultural practices, and effective waste management systems."},{"question":"Given a set of four words, generate the category that the words belong to.

If the concentration of a substance is decreased, the system will respond by favoring the reaction that replaces that substance. In the industrial Haber-Bosch process, NH 3 is removed from the equilibrium system as the reaction proceeds. As a result, the forward reaction is favored so that more NH 3 will be produced. The concentrations of N 2 and H 2 decrease. Continued removal of NH 3 will eventually force the reaction to go to completion until all of the reactants are used up. If either N 2 or H 2 were removed from the equilibrium system, the reverse reaction would be favored, and the concentration of NH 3 would decrease.

Men are in a line in a bycicle in a competition. men","response":"In a bicycle competition, men are lined up and ready to race. What most naturally follows is the series of events and processes that take place during a typical bicycle race competition. Let's break it down into various stages and aspects of the race: 1. Pre-race preparations: Prior to the start of the competition, participants would have completed their registration process and collected their race numbers. They will have also checked their bikes to ensure that they are in good working order and complied with any equipment regulations. The race organizers would have set up the race course, including markings and safety measures, such as placing barriers, marshals, and first aid stations along the route. 2. Strategies and planning: Riders and their teams would have developed race strategies tailored to the specific conditions of the competition, such as the route, weather, terrain, and their individual strengths and weaknesses. Some riders may aim to go for an early breakaway, while others may want to ride in the peloton (main group) and conserve energy for a sprint finish. 3. The starting line: Riders would have warmed up and assembled at the starting line, prepared to begin the race. The race official would make any last-minute announcements, and the countdown to the start will commence. Once the starting gun or whistle is sounded, the race begins. 4. The race: Throughout the race, individual riders and teams will contend for positions and may attempt to break away from the main group to gain an advantage. Each rider's performance during the race will be determined by their tactical decision-making, physical fitness, ability to handle their bicycle in various terrain types, and their ability to navigate the race course efficiently. 5. Aid stations and support vehicles: Along the race route, riders may need to stop at aid stations or receive support from team vehicles if they require mechanical assistance, water, or nourishment. Race marshals and officials may provide assistance and enforce race rules along the route as well. 6. Finish line: As racers approach the finish line, some might sprint to try to get ahead of their competitors, while others may be simply focused on completing the race. The winner of the race will be the first one to cross the finish line, and the subsequent racers will have their position in the competition determined based on the order of their arrival. 7. Results and celebrations: After the race, the official results will be calculated, including the winners for any race categories, such as age groups or gender-based classifications. The awarding ceremonies will follow, where winners and those who placed on the podium receive their medals or trophies. Post-race celebrations and festivities are common, allowing racers and supporters an opportunity to socialize, discuss race strategies and experiences, share achievements, and enjoy food and refreshments. Overall, what most naturally follows the men's bicycle race competition are the exciting and challenging events taking place during the race, as well as the post-race gatherings and celebrations. Races bring together individuals and communities, showcasing the spirit of sportsmanship, camaraderie, and passion for cycling."},{"question":"Determine if the sentence is true based on the text below: Sidney Altman (born May 7, 1939) is a Canadian and American molecular biologist who was born in Canada.

No, my biggest complaint is with the rude and entirely unhelpful staff at the leasing office. There was recently a package mix-up where a package was sent to my old address by mistake. I had tracked the package, which led me to find that it had been delivered successfully to my old address. I called the Palladium office to ask if they had received the package and they took a look for me. After returning to the phone and saying they didn't have it, I asked if it was possible if it was placed the parcel locker for my old address, and, if so, if they could contact the current residents, asking if they had seen the package so that it might be returned. They did not seem to be having the same conversation as I was having, however, as they kept throwing words in my mouth, insinuating that I was trying to have them break the law and look into a resident's parcel looker and go through their mail. Bizarre and irritating conversation to say the least. They got defensive, then rude. I couldn't get in two words and then they hung up on me after telling me I needed to contact the post office because no mail carrier would just drop a package in a parcel looker without double checking the name (...ummm, yea they do, happens all the time in fact). So, I called the post office and they said it was delivered to that address and repeated other things I already knew. I called back the Palladium. They were furious that I might try and bother them twice in the same day when they were trying to sit down and eat jolly ranchers in peace! So, they did what any irrational group of people would do and immediately started reexplaining all things they incorrectly rambled at me earlier. When I finally got a word in, I tried again explaining that I was asking them to CHECK WITH THEIR RESIDENTS, JUST CHECK!!! GIVE THEM A POST-IT OR SOMETHING, I DON'T CARE!!! not steal their mail. They just hung up again...I was not pleased. I went to my old apartment, knocked on the door and asked if they had received my package...THERE IT WAS!!! (though opened, still intact). The great mystery was solved. The residents just handed it to me, and I was able to go on with my business, only wasting several hours of my time dealing with Palladium's godawful leasing squad. Don't expect much from these people, I would have been more successful calling and asking for \\"Mike Hawk,\\" at least I would have been hung up on faster and could have experienced less of their uncalled for rudeness along the way. In sum, I'm not sure I've ever experienced such incompetence and rudeness in my life. DO NOT EXPECT CUSTOMER SERVICE HERE. These people are terrible at their jobs. It honestly might be worth moving somewhere else just to avoid dealing with them. Is this review positive or negative? OPT: 1). negative; 2). positive; Answer:","response":"1). negative; The review is negative because the person describes their experience with the leasing office staff as rude, unhelpful, and incompetent. The reviewer also had issues with the living conditions at Palladium, such as a break-in and thin walls.

Options: - Sentence A: \\"Children are more vulnerable than adults.\\" - Sentence B: \\"Children are more independent than adults.\\" Hmmm, let me think. I want to lay out the solution in details.","response":"To determine which of the given sentences is nonsensical, let's analyze each sentence step-by-step. Sentence A: \\"Children are more vulnerable than adults.\\" 1. Define the key terms: \\"vulnerable\\" means susceptible to harm or injury, \\"children\\" refers to individuals who have not yet reached adulthood, and \\"adults\\" are individuals who have reached the age of maturity. 2. Consider the general understanding: It is commonly accepted that children are more vulnerable than adults due to their still-developing bodies and minds, as well as their lesser experience and knowledge. 3. Assess the sensibility: Sentence A makes sense and seems logical, given the general understanding mentioned above. Sentence B: \\"Children are more independent than adults.\\" 1. Define the key terms: \\"independent\\" means not relying on others or being able to make decisions and take care of oneself. 2. Consider the general understanding: Typically, adults have more life experience, knowledge, and resources, which allows them to be more independent than children who rely on their parents or guardians for protection, guidance, and support. 3. Assess the sensibility: Sentence B goes against the general understanding and assumes an unexpected condition for children, which makes it nonsensical. Conclusion: Based on the analysis of both sentences, Sentence B, \\"Children are more independent than adults,\\" is the nonsensical sentence."},{"question":"Question: I know that the answer to the question \\"Whose opinion is it that the burden of keeping society from being led astray is on the shoulders of men such as Atticus?\\" is in \\"Absent mothers and abusive fathers are another theme in the novel. Scout and Jem's mother died before Scout could remember her, Mayella's mother is dead, and Mrs. Radley is silent about Boo's confinement to the house. Apart from Atticus, the fathers described are abusers. Bob Ewell, it is hinted, molested his daughter, and Mr. Radley imprisons his son in his house until Boo is remembered only as a phantom. Bob Ewell and Mr. Radley represent a form of masculinity that Atticus does not, and the novel suggests that such men as well as the traditionally feminine hypocrites at the Missionary Society can lead society astray. Atticus stands apart as a unique model of masculinity; as one scholar explains: \\"It is the job of real men who embody the traditional masculine qualities of heroic individualism, bravery, and an unshrinking knowledge of and dedication to social justice and morality, to set the society straight.\\"\\".

In both sentences, the key subject is Edward Snowden, an American whistleblower who leaked classified information from the National Security Agency (NSA). The focus on Snowden and Russia is the main overlapping element between the two sentences. However, the first sentence, \\"Snowden asks to stay in Russia,\\" focuses on Snowden's request to remain in the country. This potentially refers to his application for temporary or permanent asylum, which was granted by the Russian government. The sentence emphasizes Snowden's desire to stay in the country and the legal process he needs to navigate. On the other hand, the second sentence, \\"Snowden releases first Russia video,\\" highlights Snowden's release of some form of content, most likely to the public or media. The \\"first Russia video\\" implies that there might be a series of videos or information released by Snowden with a specific focus on Russia. The main point in this sentence is Snowden's actions to share information rather than his stay in Russia. In conclusion, the two sentences share similar elements, such as the reference to Snowden and his connection with Russia. However, the main focus of each sentence is different, one emphasizing his request to stay in the country and the other highlighting the release of video content. Therefore, the meaning overlap is moderate, and I would rate the similarity as a 2.5 on the scale."},{"question":"Why is the tangent of theta greater than 1 but neither sin nor cos can be greater than 1? Does cos x = 0 always imply that sin x = 1? Would you say that these questions are the same?","response":"Imagine you're playing with a ladder that can be placed against a wall. The angle between the ladder and the floor is \\"theta\\" (it's just a name for that angle). Now, let's talk about the words tangent, sine, and cosine. They are special names for measurements based on this angle and the ladder. 1. Tangent of theta: Think of the ladder as a slide. If the ladder is very flat, it's a very long and slow slide, and if the ladder is almost straight up against the wall, it's a very short and steep slide. The tangent of theta is how steep the slide is. So, if the angle is shallow (like when the slide is long and flat), the tangent is less than 1, because it's not that steep. If the angle is very steep (like a short slide), the tangent is more than 1 because it's very steep. But sine and cosine can't be more than 1 because they are like how far up the ladder you are when you slide down (sine) and how far away from the wall you land (cosine). Those distances can't be longer than the ladder itself, which is why they can't be more than 1. 2. Cosine equals 0 and sine equals 1: Let's look at our ladder again. If the cosine is 0, that means when you slide down the ladder, you land right at the wall. In this case, the ladder is straight up and down making a 90-degree angle with the floor. When the ladder is like that, you slide down the full length of the ladder, which is sine. In this special case, since you are right at the highest point of the ladder, it means sine equals 1. 3. Are they the same question? No, these questions are not the same. The first question is about why tangent can be more than 1 while sine and cosine can't. The second question is about a special situation when cosine equals 0, and if that always means sine equals 1. Both questions talk about the special measurements, but they are asking different things."},{"question":"So , I was sitting at the bus exchange in town this morning , and some Nestle sales rep just walked in and started handing out free packs of soup mix to everyone .

(CNN) -- In his first address since returning to Pakistan from self-exile, former President Pervez Musharraf declared his intention to run for office, saying he defied risks to \\"save\\" the country. Musharraf landed in Karachi on Sunday after more than four years in exile. He faces criminal charges, and the Taliban have vowed to unleash a \\"death squad\\" to assassinate him. However, he said, he does not plan to flee again. \\"I have put my life in danger and have come to Pakistan -- to you to be the savior of this country,\\" he said at the airport. \\"I have come to save Pakistan.\\" Last week,","response":"Last week, Pervez Musharraf began rallying support and reaching out to his loyalists in a bid to reestablish his presence in Pakistan's political landscape. He has been holding meetings with key party leaders and members, discussing potential alliances and mapping out strategies to maximize his impact in the upcoming elections. Musharraf's return to Pakistan has resulted in a mixed response from the public, with some showing support for his commitment to restoring order in the country, while others condemn his past actions during his time in power and believe that he should face legal consequences for them. Despite the threats from the Taliban, Musharraf appears to be undeterred and determined to play an active role in shaping the future of Pakistan. He has called for unity amongst the different factions in the country, emphasizing the need for a stable and prosperous Pakistan. This sentiment has resonated with some Pakistanis who are disillusioned with the current state of the nation and believe that a strong, united front against corruption, extremism, and economic instability is necessary. In terms of policy, Musharraf's potential platform centers around key issues such as education reform, economic revitalization, counter-terrorism, and regional cooperation – all of which were focal points during his previous time in office. However, it remains to be seen whether he can regain the trust and support of the Pakistani people, given the various controversies that plagued his previous tenure. This includes the suspension of the constitution, the dismissal of the chief justice, and alleged human rights abuses by security forces on his watch. Musharraf's comeback attempt has also prompted discussions surrounding the role of the military in Pakistan's politics. During his time in power, Musharraf was often accused of undermining democratic institutions and consolidating power within the military establishment. Some political analysts argue that his return to the political arena could signal a resurgence of military influence in Pakistani politics, which may not bode well for the fragile democratic process in the country. Furthermore, by deciding to run for office, Musharraf knowingly puts himself at risk of facing the numerous criminal charges that await him, such as the high treason case related to the imposition of emergency rule in 2007. Nonetheless, Musharraf remains steadfast in his decision, hoping to leverage his previous experience and commitment to the nation to secure a foothold in the government. In conclusion, Pervez Musharraf's return to Pakistan and his decision to run for office have brought a myriad of reactions, discussions, and concerns to the forefront. While his ambition to \\"save\\" Pakistan serves as a rallying cry for some citizens, many remain skeptical of his intentions, and his potential return to power raises questions about the stability of Pakistan's political landscape and the ongoing struggle between civilian and military establishments. As the situation unfolds, it will be crucial to observe how Musharraf is received by the people, how he faces the legal challenges that await him, and whether he can initiate a new era of stability and progress in Pakistan, despite the looming threats and obstacles before him."},{"question":"Article: France used the right moment and occupied Alger in 1830.

A: yes Explain how we arrive at this answer:","response":"We arrive at the answer that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise through a process of analyzing the information provided in both statements and determining if the hypothesis is a logical consequence of the premise. Premise: \\"A woman seated at a table in front of a cake.\\" This statement provides us with three key pieces of information: 1. There is a woman. 2. The woman is seated at a table. 3. There is a cake in front of the woman on the table. Hypothesis: \\"A woman with a cake.\\" This statement provides us with two key pieces of information: 1. There is a woman. 2. The woman has a cake. By comparing the information in the premise and the hypothesis, we can observe a clear connection between the two statements: 1. The woman mentioned in the premise is the same as the woman mentioned in the hypothesis. 2. The cake mentioned in the premise is the same as the cake mentioned in the hypothesis. The hypothesis is a simplified version of the premise, focusing only on the presence of the woman and the cake. Since the premise provides additional information about the woman being seated at a table in front of the cake, this detail can be inferred from the hypothesis. Thus, we can conclude that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, as it logically follows from the information provided in the premise."},{"question":"Skylar took Quinn to the new bar to celebrate Quinn getting the new job. Given the question \\"Why did Skylar do this?\\", is \\"wanted to stay home\\" a valid answer?","response":"No, \\"wanted to stay home\\" is not a valid answer to the question \\"Why did Skylar do this?\\" because it contradicts the given information. Instead, it is clear that Skylar took Quinn to the new bar to celebrate Quinn's new job. This act implies Skylar's desire to show support and share in the joy of Quinn's accomplishment. Thus, a more valid answer would highlight Skylar's intentions to congratulate and celebrate with Quinn. In order to better understand Skylar's reasoning, let's discuss the possible factors and emotions that could have motivated this decision: 1. Friendship: Skylar and Quinn are likely good friends, and celebrating together is an expression of that bond. It is common for friends to join in each other's happiness and share important milestones in life. 2. Recognition of achievement: Skylar understands that getting a new job is an important step for Quinn, and by organizing a celebration, Skylar is acknowledging and validating the significance of this event in Quinn's life. 3. Emotional support: Celebrating a new job together gives Skylar an opportunity to offer emotional support and encouragement to Quinn. This camaraderie can help ease the transition into a new position and bolster Quinn's confidence. 4. Social bonding: Taking Quinn to a new bar provides an opportunity for both friends to socialize, connect with others, and enjoy a fun, relaxed atmosphere together. This is an essential aspect of maintaining and strengthening friendships. 5. Creating memories: By choosing a new bar for the celebration, Skylar is adding an element of novelty and excitement to the experience. This allows both friends to create lasting memories of their time together, which they may cherish for years to come. In summary, \\"wanted to stay home\\" is not a valid answer to the question of why Skylar took Quinn to the new bar to celebrate the new job. Instead, the decision was likely driven by factors such as friendship, recognition of achievement, emotional support, social bonding, and the desire to create memories."},{"question":"Tässä on kyse aivovuodosta, joka on moraalitonta köyhiä maita kohtaan.

Paul McCartney said he came up with the title \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" during one of his first visits to his property High Park Farm, near Campbeltown in Scotland, which he purchased in June 1966. The phrase was inspired by the sight of a road \\"stretching up into the hills\\" in the remote Highlands surroundings of lochs and distant mountains. He wrote the song at his farm in 1968, inspired by the growing tension among the Beatles. Based on other comments McCartney has made, author Howard Sounes writes, the lyrics can be seen as McCartney expressing his anguish at the direction of his personal life, as well as a nostalgic look back at the Beatles' history. McCartney recalled: \\"I just sat down at my piano in Scotland, started playing and came up with that song, imagining it was going to be done by someone like Ray Charles. I have always found inspiration in the calm beauty of Scotland and again it proved the place where I found inspiration.\\"Once back in London, McCartney recorded a demo version of \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" during one of the recording sessions for The Beatles. Later, he offered the song to Tom Jones on the condition that the singer release it as his next single. In Jones' recollection, he was forced to turn it down since his record company were about to issue \\"Without Love\\" as a single.The song takes the form of a piano-based ballad, with conventional chord changes. McCartney described the chords as \\"slightly jazzy\\" and in keeping with Charles' style. The song's home key is E-flat major but it also uses the relative C minor. Lyrically, it is a sad and melancholic song, with an evocation of an as-yet unrequited, though apparently inevitable, love. In an interview in 1994, McCartney described the lyric more obliquely: \\"It's rather a sad song. I like writing sad songs, it's a good bag to get into because you can actually acknowledge some deeper feelings of your own and put them in it. It's a good vehicle, it saves having to go to a psychiatrist.\\"The opening theme is repeated throughout. The... The answer to this question is:","response":"Jones.

My ihome broke!","response":"To describe the sentiment of the tweet \\"My ihome broke!\\", one should first interpret the context, the user's emotions, tone, and the perspective from which they are sharing this information. Sentiment analysis is the process of determining the underlying emotions, opinions, or attitudes within a piece of text, such as a tweet. In this case, there are several factors that can help us clarify the sentiment expressed: 1. Content: The tweet is about the user's iHome, which is an electronic device for playing music and charging smartphones, breaking down. The fact that the device no longer works implies that the user is facing an inconvenience or loss of functionality. 2. Tone: The exclamation mark at the end of the tweet suggests that the user is expressing strong emotions. Although the exclamation mark doesn't specify whether the emotion is positive or negative, considering the broken device, it's safe to assume that it represents a negative feeling, such as frustration or disappointment. 3. Emotion: From the content and tone, we can infer that the user is expressing dissatisfaction, distress, or annoyance because their iHome is broken, affecting their experience with the device and possibly their daily routine. 4. Perspective: The tweet is written in the first person, which means that the person experiencing the sentiment is the one posting the tweet. This personal perspective emphasizes the user's own emotional experience with the broken iHome. Taking all these factors into account, one could describe the sentiment of this tweet as predominantly negative due to the user's frustration, disappointment, or dissatisfaction about their broken iHome device. This sentiment might also evoke sympathy or empathy among readers who can relate to the experience of dealing with faulty technology."},{"question":"Write an article based on this summary: European observers have said violence marred the run-up to polls in Turkey in which the Justice and Development Party (AKP) regained its majority.
