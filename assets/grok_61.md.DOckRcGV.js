However, this movie so disappointed me (even with a modest score of 6.4 at the time of writing) that I couldn't keep quiet anymore. Noise is the story of a New Yorker (Tim Robbins)who is so perturbed by noise pollution that he takes on an alter-ego as a as a vigilante, \\"The Rectifier\\", and vandalizes any cars he finds with a car-alarm sounding. I take the name of the movie to be somewhat of a misnomer. Although there are one or two instances of other sources of noise being addressed or mentioned, the only true focus of our protagonist is car alarms. Car alarms, car alarms, car alarms. There is really no other focus. When the movie tries to tie other examples of noise pollution to the problem of car alarms, it seems to be just thrown in to give merit to the actions of Robbins' character. Yes, we're all annoyed by noise. Nobody likes the sound of car alarms. Of course we all have that internal urge to take a baseball bat to a shrieking vehicle, and this movie uses that fact, and pretty much that fact alone, to sell this movie. I say 'pretty much' because there is also a blatantly contrived sexual relationship (including a completely needless threesome) which is obviously thrown in for those movie-goers who need such things thrown in in order to enjoy a movie. Honestly, it's eye-rolling. Robbin's character, very shortly into the movie, becomes completely unrelatable. It seems less that he decides not to put up with the noise anymore, and more that by focusing so much on the noise he has begun to lose his sanity. The first half of the movie is essentially the story of how he turns from just an angry, car-bashing dude into this hero of the little guy, The Rectifier. However... the transformation doesn't take place. He just renames himself. I could go on for a while. Annoying generalized social commentary comes in every now and then to add to the pretentiousness of the movie, and the self-satisfied smirk which never quite leaves Robbins face doesn't help either. Overall, I think it's very obvious what this movie is trying to be, as it's pretty much shoved down your throat, but in my opinion, it fails in a big way. Just one guy's opinion, cheers.

Visual elements employed during Nine Inch Nails concerts have often included numerous lighting, stage and projection effects employed to accompany and augment presentation. Prior to the Fragility tour in 2000, Reznor reflected that \\"I’ve adopted a philosophy of the way to present Nine Inch Nails live that incorporates a theatrical element. I want it to be drama. I want my rock stars to be larger than life, you know? The Kurt Cobains of the world, I’m sick of that shit. I don’t want a gas station attendant being my hero. I grew up with Gene Simmons. I grew up with Ziggy Stardust.\\"Many songs are typically accompanied with specially designed visual aids, including synchronized lighting effects and projected stock-footage montages. Early performances of the song \\"Hurt\\", for example, were accompanied by a projected montage of clouds, charred bodies, mushroom clouds, maggots, and war refugees, a performance of which is featured in the song's music video. Recent performances of the song, however, have featured less lighting effects. Since 1999, the visual presentation of Nine Inch Nails live shows have been directed by Rob Sheridan, while Bill Viola designed a large triptych display for the Fragility tour. The images displayed on the triptych focused on storm and water imagery. And All That Could Have Been features an audio commentary track by Viola describing the display and his inspirations for it.For the Live: With Teeth tour, Roy Bennett and Martin Phillips were responsible for the lighting design and stage design respectively. Bennett explained in a 2005 interview that much of the lighting was done using a series of LED lights arranged in \\"stalactites or stalagmites [formations] to tie in to the album artwork\\". DLP projectors were also used to project images onto a gauze screen in front of the stage.

But in the end what is it really? Many of the ways in which it has been made to work for a hearing audience on the screen do not work. The fairly academic camera work keeps the signing obfuscated, and scenes that are in ASL are hard to follow as a result even for someone who is relatively fluent. The voice interpretation of Matlin's dialogue, under the excuse that Hurt's character \\"likes the sound of his voice\\", turns her more and more into a weird distant object as the film goes on. Matlin does shine in the few scenes where her signing is not partially hidden from view. But nonetheless, most of the movie, when this is a love story, is only showed from a single point of view, that of the man. As Ebert said, \\"If a story is about the battle of two people over the common ground on which they will communicate, it's not fair to make the whole movie on the terms of only one of them.\\" The idea that an oralist teacher who uses methods that have been imposed in many deaf schools for decades would be presented as \\"revolutionary\\" is fairly insulting in itself. His character becomes weakened as a credible teacher as the movie goes on. Drawing comedy from a deaf accent is, quite honestly, rather low. And his attitude towards the male students of his class is pretty symptomatic of how he seems to act with women: as an entitled man. A party scene involving a number of deaf people including a few academics meeting together leaves him seemingly isolated, in a way that's fairly inconsistent with his credentials: I have seen interpreters spontaneously switch to asl between each other even when they weren't aware of a deaf person being in the area, and yet somehow he feels like a fish out of the water in an environment his education should have made him perfectly used to. As a lover, he seems like a typical dogged nice guy, including his tendency to act possessively afterwards. And yet the movie is, indeed, only really seen through him, as everything his lover says is filtered through his voice. The scenes involving the other deaf kids are, in general, wallbangers. The broken symbolism fails, the dance scene, the pool scene, even the initial sleep scene which is supposed to carry some of it - all these scenes that try to hint at the isolation of the deaf main character are broken metaphors, at best: many hearing people I know do dance on the bass beats that deaf people feel (instead of squirming like copulating chihuahuas), and going to take an evening dive for a hearing person is rarely an excuse to make a deep statement on the isolation of deafness (no, seriously, when I go swim, I go swim)... It also fails at carrying the end of the play, instead making it a story of a deaf woman who submits to a strong man. Even though the original play ended with a more equal ground, where both have to accept each other as they are, and where he has to finally recognize her real voice is the movement of her hands, not the vibrations in her throat. And for all the breakthrough that it may have seemed to be, Marlee Matlin remains Hollywood's token deaf woman to this day. Did this review think positively or negatively of the movie (see options below)? Options are: - negative - positive...I think the answer is","response":"negative. The user has expressed multiple points of dissatisfaction with different aspects of the movie. They criticized the way the film was interpreted for hearing audiences, claiming that it didn't effectively convey the experiences of deaf individuals. They also took issue with how the story was primarily told from the male character's point of view, contending that this was unfair given the plot's focus on two people trying to find common ground. Furthermore, they objected to the film's characterization of the male lead as a revolutionary teacher and expressed disgust at the use of humor derived from a deaf accent. They pointed out many inconsistencies in the plot and characters, and described a number of scenes as unsuccessful attempts at representing the challenges faced by deaf people. Finally, they were unhappy with how the ending deviated from the original play's conclusion, insisting that it diminished the lead female character's autonomy. Additionally, the user felt that despite all its apparent innovations, the film did not succeed in challenging Hollywood's limited representation of deaf individuals, as exemplified by how Marlee Matlin is still seen as the industry's only recognized deaf actress.

Given the context: How would Skylar feel afterwards? Options are: + tired; + awake; + lethargic; Answer:","response":"Taking into consideration the context provided, Skylar was feeling tired and decided to take a nap to refresh themselves. Naps can often be a beneficial solution to improve alertness, mood, and cognitive performance. The potential outcomes for Skylar after their nap depend on various factors such as the duration, quality, and timing of the nap. If Skylar took a short power nap of approximately 10-20 minutes, there is a higher chance that they would feel more awake, alert, and refreshed. Short naps allow the body to rest and recharge without entering deep sleep cycles, which can lead to feelings of grogginess or lethargy upon awakening. In this case, Skylar's choice to nap would be effective in fulfilling their objective of feeling refreshed, and \\"awake\\" would be the most suitable answer. However, if Skylar took a longer nap exceeding 30 minutes, the outcome could be quite different. Although longer naps allow the body to enter deep sleep cycles, which can be beneficial for overall sleep health, they could also result in a feeling of sleep inertia or grogginess upon awakening, potentially leaving Skylar feeling lethargic. It is also possible that a longer nap in the late afternoon or evening could disrupt Skylar's normal sleep pattern, making it difficult for them to fall asleep at night, and resulting in continued tiredness. In conclusion, the most accurate answer to how Skylar would feel after their nap would depend on the specifics of their nap. However, assuming that the purpose of the nap was to feel refreshed and reenergized, it is more likely that Skylar would be feeling \\"awake\\" after their nap. Of course, individual responses to napping can vary, and Skylar's personal sleep needs and habits would also play a role in determining the effectiveness of their nap session."},{"question":"Având în vedere modificările structurale din comerțul internațional, este important ca economia europeană să poată pună rapid în aplicare politicile din domeniul asistenței în favoarea lucrătorilor afectați de aceste modificări, oferindu-le în același timp competențele de care au nevoie pentru a reveni rapid pe piața muncii.

If we have 50 apples and we want to take away 245 apples, we will be short of 195 apples. So, the new equation will be: 13*j = -195 Now, we will find the value of \\"j\\".

Jacarandas thrive with sun, and should be planted in an area that will receive frequent, direct sunlight for most of the year. Plant the tree at least 15-feet (4.5 meters) away from any nearby buildings, and do not plant seedlings in the shade of other, larger trees. Jacaranda trees will suffer if their roots don’t drain well, and they need fertile, rich soil to provide them with nutrients. If you’re planting your tree in a large planter or pot, place the jacaranda in a rich soil mixture. A local nursery or Garden center should have a variety of soil bags for sale, and sales staff can help you select a healthy mixture for your jacaranda. If you plant the tree directly into the ground, you’ll have less control over the makeup of the soil than if you were buying it from a plant nursery. Look for a patch of soil that isn’t prone to having puddles and has other plants already growing in it. Jacarandas need frequent watering in order to grow and thrive in temperate climates. Healthy jacaranda trees grow quickly, but will wilt and possibly die if given insufficient water. Between March and October, use a household hose to water the jacaranda tree about once a week. During the cooler winter months, you do not need to water the tree as regularly. The jacaranda will not be growing during November through February, and so you should only water the tree about once a month. Although they begin small as seedlings, jacarandas can grow into massive trees. Jacarandas commonly reach between 25-50 feet (7.6-15 meters) in height and can have a width of 15-30 feet (4.5-9 meters). Plant the jacaranda in a large, open area where it will have room to grow to its full size. For example, jacarandas do well in large front or back yards. If you plant the jacaranda in an already cramped or crowded space (e.g. under a patio roof or between narrow walls) it will not grow to its full size and may wither and become unhealthy. Plant the tree at least 15-feet (4.5 meters) away from homes and other structures so that falling branches are less likely to cause damage. Summary:","response":"To successfully grow jacaranda trees, plant them in sunny locations with well-draining, fertile soil, at least 15 feet away from structures, provide regular watering during warmer months, and ensure enough space for them to reach their full size of up to 50 feet in height and 30 feet in width."},{"question":"Bu yıl Arnavutluk sahillerine çok sayıda turist geldi.

The Rams would welcome back Steven Jackson to the lineup after weeks of sitting out with a thigh injury. Jackson gave the Rams a good enough boost to strike first with a first possession field goal by Josh Brown from 23 yards. Brown would kick a 51-yard field goal to give the Rams a 6-0 lead. In the second quarter, the Dolphins responded as RB Ronnie Brown got a 3-yard TD run. The Rams would answer with Brown making a 33-yard field goal, but Miami replied with kicker Dan Carpenter getting a 37-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Dolphins increased their lead as Carpenter got a 47-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter, St. Louis tried to keep up as Brown made a 38-yard field goal, yet Miami answered right back with Carpenter nailing a 42-yard field goal. The Rams tried to come back, but a late-game interception shattered any hope of a comeback. Answer this question: How many yards was the mean value of all field goals kicked in the game?","response":"To calculate the mean value of all field goals kicked in the game, we need to add up the yardage of all field goals and divide it by the total number of field goals. Josh Brown kicked field goals of 23 yards, 51 yards, 33 yards, and 38 yards. Dan Carpenter kicked field goals of 37 yards, 47 yards, and 42 yards. Step 1: Add up the yardage of all field goals: 23 + 51 + 33 + 38 + 37 + 47 + 42 = 271 yards Step 2: Count the total number of field goals: There are 4 field goals by Josh Brown and 3 field goals by Dan Carpenter, for a total of 7 field goals.

Dunnottar Castle was the last stronghold to fall to the English Parliament's troops in May 1652. Under the terms of the Tender of Union, the Scots were given 30 seats in a united Parliament in London, with General Monck appointed as the military governor of Scotland. During the Interregnum, Scotland was kept under the military occupation of an English army under George Monck. Sporadic Royalist rebellions continued throughout the Commonwealth period in Scotland, particularly in western Highlands, where Alasdair MacColla had raised his forces in the 1640s. The north west Highlands was the scene of another pro-royalist uprising in 1653-55, which was only put down with deployment of 6,000 English troops there. Monck garrisoned forts all over the Highlands — for example at Inverness, and finally put an end to Royalist resistance when he began deporting prisoners to the West Indies as indentured labourers. However, lawlessness remained a problem, with bandits known as mosstroopers, very often former Royalist or Covenanter soldiers, plundering both the English troops and the civilian population. After the death of Oliver Cromwell in 1658, the factions and divisions which had struggled for supremacy during the early years of the interregnum reemerged. Monck, who had served Cromwell and the English Parliament throughout the civil wars, judged that his best interests and those of his country lay in the Restoration of Charles II. In 1660, he marched his troops south from Scotland to ensure the monarchy's reinstatement. Scotland's Parliament and legislative autonomy were restored under The Restoration though many issues that had led to the wars; religion, Scotland's form of government and the status of the Highlands, remained unresolved. After the Glorious Revolution of 1688, many more Scots would die over the same disputes in Jacobite rebellions.

Directed by Michel Gondry and penned by the ingenious Charlie Kaufman, the film is a mesmerizing synthesis of romance, science fiction, and comedy. The unconventional narrative structure, captivating performances, and thought-provoking themes make this movie an unforgettable viewing experience. The story centers on introverted Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) and free-spirited Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet), two seemingly polar opposites who are inexplicably drawn to each other in a life-altering encounter. After a particularly painful breakup, Clementine undergoes a memory-erasing procedure performed by Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson) to forget all about Joel. When Joel, heartbroken by the revelation, decides to undergo the same procedure, the audience is transported to a visually-stunning journey through his subconscious, unraveling the complexities of love and human connections. Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet's performances are undeniably outstanding. Carrey, usually known for his wacky comedic roles, skillfully embodies the melancholy and vulnerability of Joel, exposing a whole new side of the actor. Winslet, on the other hand, exudes an infectious energy as the impulsive and vibrant Clementine. The chemistry between the two leads is electrifying, successfully capturing the highs and lows of a roller coaster romance, making it easy for viewers to invest in their journey together. Gondry's artistic direction shines throughout the film by juxtaposing a realistic world with the surreal landscape of Joel's memories. The inventive visual effects, combined with Ellen Kuras' cinematography, create an elaborate dreamscape that blurs the line between fact and fiction. Notable scenes include the haunting image of Joel's childhood home crumbling down on a desolate beach and the unforgettable parade of surreal library halls representing the deepest corners of Joel's mind. The audaciousness of Gondry's vision is amplified by the flawless execution of these visual elements. The film's complex narrative structure, with its non-linear approach, is challenging yet rewarding. Shifting between various timelines and perspectives, the viewers are left feeling as disoriented as the heartbroken protagonist. However, this approach ultimately enables the audience to delve deeper into the introspective aspects of each character and the nuances of their relationships. Lastly, the themes explored in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind are both relevant and universal. The film masterfully tackles topics such as love, forgiveness, regret, and the value of memories, resulting in a poignant reflection on human nature. It invites viewers to question the strength of human connections and the significance of the past in defining who we are. In conclusion, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a heartfelt and thought-provoking masterpiece that offers an unforgettable cinematic experience. With its captivating premise, outstanding performances, and visually arresting aesthetics, it is truly a modern classic. It is a film that stays with you long after the credits roll, leaving you to ponder the intricacies of life, love, and the bittersweet beauty of memories."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the first name of the person who convinced Compton to move forward with nuclear weapons?

Two weeks later, on 5 July, the European Court of Justice imposed restrictions on the export of goods from Northern Cyprus into the European Union. Soon afterwards, in December, relations between the EU and Turkey were further damaged when Greece blocked the final implementation of a customs union. As a result, talks remained completely blocked throughout 1995 and 1996. In December 1996, the European Court of Human Rights delivered a landmark ruling that declared that Turkey was an occupying power in Cyprus. The case - Loizidou v. Turkey - centred on Titina Loizidou, a refugee from Kyrenia, who was judged to have been unlawfully denied the control of her property by Turkey. The case also had severe financial implications as the Court later ruled that Turkey should pay Mrs Loizidou US825,000 in compensation for the loss of use of her property. Ankara rejected the ruling as politically motivated. After twenty years of talks, a settlement seemed as far off as ever.

Greece blocked the final implementation of a customs union in December 1994. To determine the number of months between these two events, we can follow these steps: 1. Calculate the number of months remaining in 1994 from June to December: June has 30 days, so there are 5 days left in June (30 - 25 = 5). July has 31 days, August has 31 days, September has 30 days, October has 31 days, and November has 30 days. So, the total number of days left in 1994 from June 25 is: 5 + 31 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 = 158 days. 2. Convert the number of days into months: We can estimate the number of months by dividing the total number of days by the average number of days in a month (30.44 days): 158 days / 30.44 = approximately 5.19 months. Therefore, approximately 5 months after the Corfu European Council, Greece blocked the final implementation of a customs union."},{"question":"Do these mean the same?

With six points awarded for each touchdown, it's no surprise that teams scheme and strategize to maximize their opportunities for reaching the end zone. Throughout the history of the sport, many iconic moments have involved long-range touchdowns that defy the odds and showcase the exceptional skill of the players involved. This article aims to delve into the world of long-range touchdowns and analyze the total yards scored on those that measure longer than 30 yards in length. Methodology To begin our investigation, it's important to define the parameters of a long-range touchdown. For the purposes of this analysis, we will be examining touchdowns of 30 yards or more. This distinction provides a basis for exploring the unique world of long-distance scores. With this in mind, several factors are considered in identifying the total yards scored on such touchdowns: 1. Data acquisition - To build our dataset, touchdown plays from various sources including the National Football League (NFL), the NCAA college football leagues, Canadian Football League (CFL), and other professional and amateur leagues are sourced. Furthermore, historical records, play-by-play data, and individual statistics will all contribute to our analysis. 2. Play categorization - It is essential to separate long-range touchdown plays into distinct categories based on play type. These would typically include rushing, passing, and special teams plays (e.g., kickoff and punt returns). By doing so, we can better understand the dynamics and patterns behind long-range touchdowns and their contribution to yardage totals. 3. Time scope - Our analysis will cover touchdowns over 30 yards in length across a designated period, considering a span of several seasons or years to ensure a comprehensive dataset. Results Due to the sheer volume of football competitions across all levels of play, it is difficult to provide an exact figure for the total number of yards scored on touchdowns longer than 30 yards. However, the following analysis provides a snapshot into the NFL, one of the world's premier football competition. Over the past five seasons (2016-2020) in the NFL, there have been 1,419 touchdown plays recorded with distances greater than 30 yards. The total yardage accumulated across these touchdowns amounts to 67,895 yards. The breakdown of these touchdowns according to play type is as follows: 1. Rushing plays - 418 touchdowns, totaling 23,459 yards (34.5% of the total yardage) 2. Passing plays - 911 touchdowns, totaling 40,184 yards (59.2% of the total yardage) 3. Special teams plays - 90 touchdowns, totaling 4,252 yards (6.3% of the total yardage) The analysis shows that within the NFL, passing plays contribute the most significant amount of total yardage on touchdown plays longer than 30 yards, followed by rushing plays and special teams plays. Conclusion While this article only scratches the surface of the total yards scored on long-range touchdowns in the world of football, our investigation into the NFL showcases the significant contributions of such plays to overall scoring. Not only do these lengthy touchdowns provide excitement for fans, but they also characterize the vital role of versatile offensive schemes and skillful individual performances in today's football landscape. It's crucial to remember that our findings represent just the NFL, and the data we've collected is a mere snapshot when compared to the vast world of American football. Therefore, the total yards scored on touchdowns longer than 30 yards across other leagues and levels of play would likely push our total yardage figures into the hundreds of thousands, if not more. Regardless, the allure of an incredible long-range touchdown will continue to captivate football enthusiasts around the globe and serve as a testament to the excitement and unpredictability that defines the sport."},{"question":"In her bakery, Teal sells pumpkin pie and custard pie by the slice.

Give me reasons, before answering the question","response":"To calculate the total amount of money Teal makes from selling the pies, we need to know the number of pumpkin and custard pie slices she sells and the price per slice. Let's break this down step by step: Step 1: Calculate the number of pumpkin and custard pie slices. - Teal sells 4 pumpkin pies, and each pumpkin pie is cut into 8 pieces. So, she sells 4 * 8 = 32 pumpkin pie slices. - Teal sells 5 custard pies, and each custard pie is cut into 6 pieces. So, she sells 5 * 6 = 30 custard pie slices. Step 2: Multiply the number of slices by the price per slice. - The pumpkin pie slices are 5 each, so the money Teal makes from selling the pumpkin pie slices is: 32 * 5 = 160. - The custard pie slices are 6 each, so the money Teal makes from selling the custard pie slices is: 30 * 6 = 180. Step 3: Add the money from the pumpkin and custard pie sales. - The total amount of money Teal makes is the sum of the money she makes from the pumpkin and custard pie sales: 160 (pumpkin) + 180 (custard) = 340. So, Teal makes a total of 340 from selling 4 pumpkin pies and 5 custard pies."},{"question":"Es umfasst das Orontes-Flusstal zwischen dem Ort ar-Rastan und der Burg Shayzar einschließlich eines Areals bis 15 km westlich des Flusslaufes.

Where in the British Isles can the Laxey Wheel aka Lady Isabella be seen?","response":"The Laxey Wheel, also known as Lady Isabella, can be found in the village of Laxey in the Isle of Man, a self-governing British Crown dependency located in the Irish Sea between Great Britain and Ireland. The Isle of Man falls within the geographical grouping of the British Isles, even though it maintains its own governance and is not part of the United Kingdom. Built in 1854, the Laxey Wheel is the largest working waterwheel in the world, with a diameter of 72 feet and 6 inches and a circumference of 227 feet. Renowned engineer Robert Casement designed the wheel, aiming to extract water from the surrounding mines, particularly from the Great Laxey Mine, a substantial zinc and lead mine. The wheel was named Lady Isabella in honor of the wife of Lieutenant Governor Charles Hope, the then-governor of the Isle of Man. The wheel's design is an elegant example of Victorian engineering. It features a 44-step spiral staircase that climbs alongside the wheel, allowing visitors to ascend and witness panoramic views of the Laxey Valley. The wheel lifts about 250 gallons of water per minute from the mine. The Laxey Wheel operates primarily through the energies of its fast-flowing river, which descends a mountainside and passes beneath the wheel, propelling the various gears and mechanisms. The force generated is distributed mechanically through a series of rods known as \\"flat rods,\\" directing the energy to the mine and powering several massive water pumps used to extract water. This clever engineering feat ensured that the mines remained operational, extending their productive life and supporting the Isle of Man's economy. Today, the Laxey Wheel stands as a monument to the Isle's industrial heritage and is an exceptional tourist attraction. Visitors can explore the wheel and its surrounding gardens, learning about the history of mining on the Isle of Man. In addition, visitors can venture into a section of the Great Laxey Mine and view the wheel's 150-year-old inner workings. In conclusion, the Laxey Wheel, or Lady Isabella, is located in the village of Laxey on the Isle of Man within the British Isles. This impressive waterwheel showcases the ingenuity of Victorian engineering and is an iconic symbol of the island's industrial past."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Build a movie plot around this: What does Reacher do to the Zec ? They had misunderstandings and the Zec now wants Reacher taken out Answer:","response":"Title: Reacher's Retaliation Plot Summary: Former military investigator Jack Reacher, now working as a private investigator, is tasked with clearing his name when a notorious criminal boss, known as the Zec, comes after him for a series of misunderstandings. As Reacher delves deeper into the case, he uncovers a complex web of power, betrayal, and revenge. Armed with nothing but his cunning intellect and brute strength, Reacher must navigate the dangerous world of organized crime and thwart the Zec's violent schemes to save the lives of those closest to him. Act 1: Jack Reacher takes up a case involving the daughter of a wealthy businessman who has gone missing. During his investigation, Reacher stumbles upon evidence suggesting that the Zec, the shadowy leader of a powerful criminal organization, may be involved in the girl's disappearance. Act 2: As Reacher continues to investigate the Zec's criminal empire, he discovers that the businessman who hired him has secretly been laundering money for the Zec's illicit activities. Realizing the connection between his client and the criminal mastermind, Reacher confronts the businessman, and the two have a violent falling out. The Zec, believing that Reacher has betrayed him, orders his henchmen to take Reacher out. Reacher survives the assassination attempt, and now fueled by vengeance, makes it his mission to take down the Zec and his criminal empire once and for all. Act 3: Reacher systematically tracks down the Zec's lieutenants and other key figures within the criminal organization, dismantling the network piece by piece. Meanwhile, the Zec grows increasingly desperate and orders more attempts on Reacher's life, all of which fail.

As the two bond, Reacher discovers that the Zec had targeted her in the hopes of using her as leverage against her father. Act 4: With his organization crumbling around him, the Zec launches a final desperate attack on Reacher, kidnapping the girl once again and setting an elaborate trap to lure Reacher into a deadly confrontation.

In a final, brutal showdown, Reacher and the Zec face off, with Reacher ultimately overpowering and capturing the Zec, ensuring that his reign of terror and corruption ends for good. Epilogue: With the Zec and his criminal organization dismantled, Reacher sends the rescued girl home to her father. Although tempted to continue working with the authorities to bring down organized crime, Reacher is reminded that he is a lone wolf by nature and decides to walk away, ready to tackle his next adventure wherever it may be."},{"question":"Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? one key problem with these ardently christian storylines is that there is never any question of how things will turn out .","response":"The given phrase can be interpreted as having a predominantly negative connotation. This interpretation stems from the mention of a specific problem or issue, which generally evokes an unfavorable response. The phrase specifically refers to \\"ardently Christian storylines,\\" suggesting that the focus is on stories that have deeply rooted Christian themes or messages. The use of the term \\"ardently\\" implies that these storylines can be rigid and strongly adherent to Christian values or teachings. In identifying the problem with such storylines, the phrase states that \\"there is never any question of how things will turn out.\\" This essentially means that the outcome is predictable, with little to no uncertainty, and often adheres to a specific moral framework. Predictability in storytelling is generally perceived negatively, as it may cause readers or audiences to lose interest, knowing that the narrative arc will follow a pre-determined path. However, it is essential to consider the context and background of the person evaluating the phrase. Some individuals may appreciate the comforting and familiar nature of predictable storylines rooted in their religious beliefs. For them, the phrase might lose its negative connotation, and instead only highlight a known characteristic of these narratives. In contrast, others who may not share these beliefs or appreciate traditional storytelling frameworks may view the phrase as more decidedly negative. Furthermore, the phrase can initiate a discussion on broader subjects, such as the diversity and inclusivity in storytelling. A perceived lack of narrative variety in ardently Christian storylines may limit opportunities for exploring other perspectives and values, effectively narrowing the scope of collective literary experiences. In conclusion, the phrase \\"one key problem with these ardently Christian storylines is that there is never any question of how things will turn out\\" can be considered negative as it identifies a specific issue, i.e., predictability. The context and personal beliefs of the person evaluating the phrase may, however, influence the extent to which it may be perceived as negative. The phrase could also serve as a conversation starter for diving deeper into discussions about diversity in storytelling and the universality of certain themes and messages."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: Who does Sir Edith take to London? ?

Armaan Singh, 12, spent an entire weekend in juvenile detention after a classmate claimed the boy had a bomb in his backpack and threatened to blow up Nichols Junior High School in Arlington, a city of 380,000 people that neighbors Irving, where \\"clock kid\\" Ahmed Mohamed was arrested three months ago after his homemade clock was mistaken for an explosive device. “I thought it was a joke so I started laughing and he started laughing,” Armaan told the Dallas Morning News following the Dec. 11 arrest. “The next thing you know, I’m reading with my friend and police come in, grab me and take me outside.\\" Armaan was arrested for making a terroristic threat, a felony. He is under house arrest and must wear an ankle monitor, according to the Dallas Morning News. Armaan, who has undergone three heart surgeries, was taken away in handcuffs, according to the paper. “I was really scared, really nervous,” said Armaan of the arrest. Another unidentified student claimed Armaan told him he had a bomb in his backpack and would detonate it in the bathroom, said Lieutenant Christopher Cook of the Arlington Police Department. Armaan admitted that he made the joke after the classmate told him he thought a phone battery in his backpack looked like a bomb. The following day, the classmate in the pre-AP history class said he was going to report him, he told the newspaper. “I thought it was a joke, so I started laughing and he started laughing,” Armaan told the newspaper. “The next thing you know, I’m reading with my friend and police come in, grab me and take me outside.” Authorities evacuated the classroom, which included 16 students and a teacher, until it was determined there was no bomb. Armaan's family claims that it was the classmate who was behind the prank, but cops saw it differently. Lt. Cook said that the other student \\"became so frightened that he went to the nurse’s office and was 'trembling.'\\" Cops say Armaan made the first threat on Dec. 10, but it was never reported to the school or authorities. The boy made the threat again the next day, going into \\"more detail on how he would actually blow up the school,\\" cops said. A cousin of Armaan placed the blame solely on the \\"bully\\" classmate earlier this week. \\"It hurts my heart and boils my blood that there are people stupid enough out there not only accusing us, but our innocent children of being terrorists!\\" Ginee Haer wrote. However, cops claim Armaan never told officers he was being \\"bullied.\\" Armaan's parents said they had to call 911 to find out where their son was being held after they were not notified that he was in custody, the Dallas Morning News reported. The family was also upset that Armaan had to spend the weekend in custody with more hardened criminals. “We’re those kind of people who, if it was his fault, would let him stay in there so he could learn his lesson,” brother Aksh, 17, told the newspaper. The family had moved from San Antonio in August. Armaan's parents came to the U.S. from India in 1997, the Dallas Morning News reported. “It was my decision to move here, but now I’m thinking why we came here,” Armaan's mother Gurdeep Kaur told the newspaper about the decision to move to the Arlington area.

Statements consisting only of original research should be removed. (August 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) When the final closing arguments in a murder trial have been presented to the judge, she gives her instructions to the jury, all of whom are men. In the United States, the verdict in criminal cases must be unanimous. A non-unanimous verdict results in a hung jury which in turn forces a mistrial. The question they are deciding is whether the defendant, a teenaged boy from a city slum, murdered his father. The jury is further instructed that a guilty verdict will be accompanied by a mandatory death sentence. Under current American criminal law, a defendant must first be found guilty, and then the jury in the sentencing phase must find an aggravating circumstance and unanimously agree to recommend the death penalty, if the state has the death penalty.[citation needed] The jury of twelve retires to the jury room, where they begin to become acquainted with their personalities and discuss the case. The story revolves around their difficulty in reaching a unanimous verdict, mainly because of the personal prejudices of several of the jurors. An initial vote is taken and eleven of the jurors vote for conviction. Juror number 8, the lone dissenter, states that the evidence presented is circumstantial and the boy deserves a fair deliberation, upon which he questions the accuracy and reliability of the only two witnesses to the murder, the fact that the knife used in the murder is not as unusual as the testimony indicates (he produces an identical one from his pocket), and the overall shady circumstances. Having argued several points, Juror 8 requests another vote, this time by secret ballot. He proposed that he would abstain from voting, and if the other eleven jurors voted guilty unanimously, then he would acquiesce to their decision. However, if at least one...

The other options, like a drugstore or movie theater, do not provide personal storage, while a shirt pocket may not be secure enough to hold sunglasses without the risk of them falling out."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What was the name of the person who dominated the Han government well after the death of his sister Empress Liang Na?, using the article: The first group of people claiming to be an ambassadorial mission of Romans to China was recorded as having arrived in 166 AD by the Book of the Later Han. The embassy came to Emperor Huan of Han China from \\"Andun\\" (Chinese: 安敦; Emperor Antoninus Pius or Marcus Aurelius Antoninus), \\"king of Daqin\\" (Rome). As Antoninus Pius died in 161 AD, leaving the empire to his adoptive son Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, and the envoy arrived in 166 AD, confusion remains about who sent the mission, as both emperors were named \\"Antoninus\\". The Roman mission came from the south (therefore probably by sea), entering China by the frontier of Rinan or Tonkin (present-day Vietnam). It brought presents of rhinoceros horns, ivory, and tortoise shell, probably acquired in Southern Asia. The text states that it was the first time there had been direct contact between the two countries. Yule speculated that the Roman visitors must have lost their original wares due to robbery or shipwreck and used the gifts instead, prompting Chinese sources to suspect them of withholding their more precious valuables, which Yule notes was the same criticism directed at papal missionary John of Montecorvino when he arrived in China in the late 13th century AD. Historians Rafe de Crespigny, Peter Fibiger Bang, and Warwick Ball believe that this was most likely a group of Roman merchants rather than official diplomats sent by Marcus Aurelius. Crespigny stresses that the presence of this Roman embassy as well as others from Tianzhu (in northern India) and Buyeo (in Manchuria) provided much-needed prestige for Emperor Huan, as he was facing serious political troubles and fallout for the forced suicide of politician Liang Ji, who had dominated the Han government well after the death of his sister Empress Liang Na. Yule emphasised that the Roman embassy was said to come by way of Jiaozhi in northern Vietnam, the same route that Chinese sources claimed the embassies from Tianzhu (northern India) had used in 159 and 161 AD., what would be the answer ? A:","response":"The answer to the question regarding the name of the person who dominated the Han government well after the death of his sister Empress Liang Na is: Liang Ji."},{"question":"Is this product review positive? Title: Stopped working after 2 months Review: I've purchased two of the Vick's FilterFree Humidifiers so far and both of them stopped working after 2 months. The humidifier is loud and leaves a sticky film over the furniture. Do not buy! Answer: Answer:","response":"Based on the information provided in the product review, it is evident that this review is negative. There are several key factors that contribute to this conclusion, which will be explained and elaborated upon in the following paragraphs. Firstly, the reviewer mentioned purchasing not just one, but two of the Vick's FilterFree Humidifiers, both of which ceased functioning after a mere two months of use. This indicates a consistent issue with the product's performance and longevity, which negatively impacts the reviewer's overall satisfaction with the humidifiers. This alone is a significant drawback and causes the review to be negative as it implies that the product does not live up to its expectations and is not a worthwhile investment. Secondly, the reviewer notes that the humidifier operates at a loud volume, which can be distracting or even unbearable for users who require a quiet environment. Any product that generates excessive noise levels is likely to be perceived as a nuisance rather than a helpful addition to a household. This further strengthens the negative sentiment expressed in the review, as it points to another aspect of the product that is less than satisfactory. Thirdly, the reviewer highlights that the humidifier leaves a sticky film on their furniture, which is both undesirable and inconvenient. A quality humidifier should improve the overall comfort and atmosphere in a given space, without creating additional cleaning or maintenance requirements. However, this sticky residue seemingly necessitates extra effort on the part of the user to keep their space tidy, detracting from the overall product experience and leading to more negativity in the review. Finally, the reviewer explicitly states, \\"Do not buy!\\" which is a clear and direct indication that they are not satisfied with the product and would not recommend it to others. The use of such a strong and decisive statement suggests extreme disapproval and dissatisfaction, leaving no doubt to any potential buyers that the reviewer believes the product to be flawed and unsuccessful in meeting their needs. In conclusion, taking into account all of the factors outlined above – the product's performance issues, the loud operation, the sticky residue and the reviewer's ultimate directive to not purchase the humidifier – the review is indisputably negative. This review serves as a warning for potential buyers regarding the various drawbacks and issues associated with the Vick's FilterFree Humidifier."},{"question":"If Because of the male exodus to France and elsewhere in search of jobs, women continue to outnumber men., can we conclude that \\"The men despite leaving in big amounts for jobs, still greatly outnumber the women.\\"?","response":"No, we cannot conclude that.

Context: WSJD (100.5 FM, \\"True Oldies 100.5\\") is a radio station serving the Evansville, Indiana area with an oldies format. It broadcasts on FM frequency 100.5 MHz and is under self ownership. Majority of the programming is featured from ABC Radio's \\"The True Oldies Channel\\" satellite feed. The station broadcasts Major League Baseball games as a member of the Los Angeles Dodgers Radio Network. Hypothesis: WSJD is under self ownership","response":"Yes, the hypothesis that WSJD is under self ownership can indeed be drawn from the context provided. The context states clearly that WSJD (100.5 FM, \\"True Oldies 100.5\\"), a radio station serving the Evansville, Indiana area with an oldies format, is \\"under self ownership\\". This implies that the radio station operates independently, most likely meaning that it does not belong to a larger network of stations under common ownership, but instead, it owns itself. This generally means that the radio station has complete authority and control over its operations, programming, and decision-making. Additional information given in the context also suggest that apart from the station being under self ownership, it's also a part of the Los Angeles Dodgers Radio Network and broadcasts Major League Baseball games. The majority of the station's programming is featured from ABC Radio's \\"The True Oldies Channel\\" satellite feed which further supports the concept of their programming independence. Take note, however, that being under \\"self ownership\\" doesn't necessarily mean that the station doesn't have partnerships or affiliations with other entities. As the context suggests, it leverages content from ABC Radio's \\"The True Oldies Channel\\" and is part of The Los Angeles Dodgers Radio Network. This usually happens to enhance the station's programming and expand its reach. In conclusion, based on the context provided, the hypothesis that WSJD operates under self ownership is correct. However, it's also evident that the station collaborates with other networks for some of its content, which is a common practice in the radio industry. These partnerships shouldn't be confused with the concept of ownership, as they are usually contractual relationships that do not impact the station's overall self ownership status."},{"question":"Triple: Administrative Science Quarterly PUBLISHER Cornell University; Cornell University AFFILIATION Association of Public and Land-grant Universities; Cornell University PRESIDENT Elizabeth Garrett What is a sentence that describes this triple?","response":"The sentence that describes this triple would be: \\"Administrative Science Quarterly is published by Cornell University, which is affiliated with the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities and is presided over by Elizabeth Garrett.\\" Here are my steps: 1.

Solve this instance: In Marseille, an undercover detective is following Alain Charnier (Fernando Rey), a wealthy French criminal who runs the largest heroin-smuggling syndicate in the world. The policeman is assassinated by Charnier's hitman, Pierre Nicoli (Marcel Bozzuffi). Charnier plans to smuggle 32 million worth of heroin into the United States by hiding it in the car of his unsuspecting friend, French television personality Henri Devereaux (Fr d ric de Pasquale). In New York City, detectives Jimmy \\"Popeye\\" Doyle (Gene Hackman) and Buddy \\"Cloudy\\" Russo (Roy Scheider) are conducting an undercover stakeout in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn. After seeing a drug transaction take place in a bar, Cloudy goes in to make an arrest, but the suspect makes a break for it, cutting Cloudy on the arm with a knife. After catching up with their suspect and severely beating him, the detectives interrogate the man, who reveals his drug connection. Later, Popeye and Cloudy go out for drinks at the Copacabana, where Popeye notices Salvatore \\"Sal\\" Boca (Tony Lo Bianco) and his young wife Angie (Arlene Farber) entertaining mob members involved in narcotics. They decide to tail the couple, and soon learn that the Bocas, who run a modest newsstand luncheonette, have criminal records: Sal for armed robbery and murder, and Angie for shoplifting. The detectives suspect that the Bocas, who frequent several nightclubs and drive expensive cars, are involved in some kind of criminal operation. They soon establish a link between the Bocas and lawyer Joel Weinstock (Harold Gary), who is part of the narcotics underworld. Soon after, Popeye learns from an informant that a major shipment of heroin will arrive in the New York area. The detectives convince their supervisor, Walt Simonson (Eddie Egan), to wiretap the Bocas' phones, and they use several ruses to obtain additional information. Popeye and Cloudy are joined in the investigation by a federal agent named Mulderig (Bill Hickman). Popeye and Mulderig dislike each other based on having worked together in the past, with Mulderig holding Popeye responsible for the death of a policeman. After Devereaux's Lincoln Continental Mark III arrives in New York City, Weinstock's chemist (Pat McDermott) tests a sample of the heroin and declares it the purest he has ever seen, establishing that the shipment could make as much as 32 million on a half-million dollar investment. Boca is impatient to make the purchase reflecting Charnier's desire to return to France as soon as possible while Weinstock, with more experience in smuggling, urges patience, knowing Boca's phone is tapped and that they are being investigated. Charnier soon realizes he has been observed since his arrival in New York. He \\"makes\\" Popeye and escapes, waving tauntingly on the departing subway shuttle from Grand Central Terminal. To avoid being tailed, he has Sal Boca instead meet him in Washington D.C., where Boca asks for a delay to avoid the police. Charnier, however, wants to conclude the deal quickly so he can return to France. On the flight back to New York, Nicoli offers to kill Popeye, but Charnier objects, knowing that Popeye would be replaced by another policeman. Nicoli insists, however, saying they will be back in France before a replacement is assigned. Soon after, Nicoli attempts to shoot Popeye from the roof of Doyle's apartment complex but misses. Popeye chases after the fleeing sniper, who boards an elevated train at the Bay 50th Street Station in Gravesend. Doyle commandeers a car and gives chase along Stillwell Avenue. Realizing he is pursued, Nicoli works his way forward through the carriages, kills a policeman who tries to intervene and then hijacks the motorman at gunpoint forcing him to drive straight through the next station, also killing the train conductor who gets too close. The motorman passes out and they are just about to slam into another, stationary, train, when an emergency trackside brake engages violently hurling the assassin against a glass window. Popeye arrives limping, having wrecked the commandeered car, and sees the killer descending from the platform. When he sees Doyle, he turns to run but is shot dead by Doyle with a single shot. After a lengthy stakeout, Popeye impounds Devereaux's Lincoln. In a police garage, he and his team take it apart piece by piece, searching for the drugs, but seemingly come up empty-handed. Then Cloudy notes that the vehicle's shipping weight is 120 pounds over its listed manufacturer's weight; they realize the contraband must still be in the car. This time they remove the rocker panels and discover the obloid packages (some light blue and some light green) of heroin concealed therein. The police then restore the car to its original condition and return it to Devereaux, who delivers the Lincoln to Charnier. Charnier drives to an old factory on Wards Island to meet Weinstock, and about a dozen others, and deliver the drugs. After Charnier has the rocker panels removed, Weinstock's chemist tests one of the bags and confirms its quality. Charnier removes the bags of drugs, and hides the money; concealing it beneath the rocker panels of another car that was purchased at an auction of junk cars, which he will then take back to France. With their transaction complete, Charnier and Sal drive off in the Lincoln, but almost immediately hit a roadblock with a large contingent of police led by Popeye Doyle, who playfully waves to Charnier. The police chase the Lincoln back to the factory, where Sal is killed with two shotgun blasts during a shootout with the police and most of the other criminals surrender. Charnier, however, escapes into the old warehouse and Popeye follows after him, with Cloudy joining in the hunt. When Popeye sees a shadowy figure in the distance, he empties his revolver a split-second after shouting a warning. The man whom Popeye kills, however, is not Charnier but Mulderig. Undaunted, Popeye tells Cloudy that he will get Charnier. After reloading his gun, Popeye runs into another room, and a few seconds later, a single gunshot is heard.

A few years ago, Vegas was one of my “bucket list” places – one of those iconic cities that one should visit at least once in their life. For me, once was enough. This is now my 4th (I think?) trip to Vegas, and while the city has a lot to offer, it’s just not my cup of tea. For one thing, I’m not a gambler, like at all. I don’t have anything against it, I just don’t enjoy it. It either feels pointless or stressful to me. The city itself makes me a little sad – in some cases, it reeks of desperation. Last time I was there, my cab driver entertained me with stories of how she was working 3 jobs to save up enough to join some mega-massive bingo game. She won a small jackpot a few years back and that allowed her to work only one job for a few months. She was hoping to win again so she could cut back to 1 or 2 jobs. I wondered how many people do similar things – gambling their money away, in big or small chunks, in the hopes of that big score and in the process, putting themselves in a not-great financial situation. I suppose as long it makes them happy, then it’s all OK, but I can’t help but think someone like my cab driver might be happier overall if she only worked 1 job instead of 3, instead of working extra jobs to save up money to gamble her way to financial freedom. But that’s for her to decide, not me. The juxtaposition of extreme and in-your-face wealth and the homeless people on the Strip also makes me sad.

Answer:","response":"The missing first step of the process is the formation of magma within the Earth's mantle. The detailed and long answer to this question is as follows: Step 1: Formation of Magma Magma is formed when the Earth's mantle, which consists of solid rock with mineral components, begins to melt due to high temperature, pressure, and the addition of volatiles (such as water and carbon dioxide). The melting process occurs because the mantle's rock material cannot withstand these conditions, resulting in a semi-liquid molten state. This molten rock, called magma, is less dense than the surrounding solid rock, which allows it to rise upwards through the mantle towards the Earth's crust. Step 2: The Magma Goes into Volcanoes As the magma ascends through the mantle, it accumulates within magma chambers beneath the Earth's crust. These chambers typically lie beneath volcanic structures on the surface, such as stratovolcanoes, shield volcanoes, or calderas. Magma can continue to rise and accumulate in these chambers for extended periods of time before an eruption occurs. Step 3: The Volcanoes Pressure the Magma Upwards As more magma accumulates in the chamber, the pressure within the chamber builds up and eventually surpasses the weight of the overlying rock layers. This pressure forces the magma to travel upwards through fractures, cracks, and conduits in the Earth's crust, eventually reaching the volcano's vent or caldera. Step 4: The Pressure Causes the Magma to Push Through the Surface of the Volcano When the pressure within the magma chamber becomes strong enough, the magma breaks through the surface of the volcano, either as an effusive eruption (which produces flowing lava) or an explosive eruption (which generates ash, gas, and fragmented magma particles). Step 5: The Lava Cools Once the magma has erupted from the volcano, it is referred to as lava. The lava flows over the Earth's surface, where it begins to cool and solidify. The rate of cooling and the composition of the lava can result in the formation of distinct rock types, such as basalt, andesite, and rhyolite. Step 6: The Lava Forms New Rock As the lava cools completely, it solidifies into new rock, modifying the landscape around the volcano. Over time, the accumulation of these rocks can result in the growth of a volcanic edifice, or the construction of new landforms such as lava domes, plateaus, and islands. Step 7: New Magma is Pressured to the Surface of the Volcano After the eruption concludes, the Earth's mantle continues to generate more magma. This new magma can follow the same pathway previously established by earlier eruptions, or create new pathways to reach the surface. As magma accumulates once again in the chamber beneath the volcano, the cycle of pressurization, eruption, cooling, and solidification repeats. Step 8: The Volcano Bursts Through the Rock That Formed After the Last Eruption When the next eruption occurs, the force of the magma's upward movement can shatter and displace the rock that formed during the previous eruption. This serves to expand the volcanic structure or create new vents, further modifying the Earth's surface and contributing to the active geologic processes that shape our planet."},{"question":"Dialogue: Edna: Hi!

I crashed on stage one and it just whacked me, broke a rib, hit my head and really shook me up.\\" Froome secured the yellow jersey in Saturday's penultimate stage, a 22.5km time trial in Marseille, extending his overall lead from 23 to 54 seconds with Rigoberto Uran second and Romain Bardet dropping to third. Tradition dictates that no general classification rivals attack the yellow jersey on the final stage in Paris on Sunday, meaning Froome should win the race in Paris. Geraint Thomas, Rowe's fellow rider from Cardiff - who became the first Welshman to wear the yellow jersey - was forced out with a broken collarbone after a crash on stage nine when second in the overall standings. Rowe admits that if his own crash had not been in the Tour de France, then he might also have withdrawn because of his injuries. \\"You never like to go home [early] from a race, but there's times I was in a bit of a mess, times were pretty tough,\\" Rowe admitted. \\"But when you've got the yellow jersey in the team and what I believe to be the best rider in the world, you're in that position where you've got to defend yellow. \\"The only way you go home is if you physically can't ride your bike or missed the time limit... but if it had been another race then yeah, it could have been an early taxi. \\"I knew I had a job to do and I battled through and did it. \\"The first 10-12 days I was really struggling, the toughest Grand Tour I've ever done. \\"It's been quite nice on a personal achievement to be here [at the end], to have made it to Paris. It's been a tough three weeks.\\" Rowe is in line to claim the lanterne rouge, an unofficial award for the cyclist who completes the Tour in last place, as he finished in 167th in Marseille. Unlike in other sports where last is seen as failure, the lanterne rouge carries respect as it honours the role of the domestiques - the team riders who sacrifice their own ambitions to help their team leader's bid for yellow. Rowe has spent much of the 2017 Tour chasing down breakaways at the front, then bringing up the rear of the peloton having spent all his energy in Froome's cause. The 27-year-old again typified that role in Saturday's time trial, as his earlier efforts were used to help his fellow Team Sky riders. \\"For me it was more a case of absorbing as much information as possible that I could feed back to the lads, that was the most important thing,\\" Rowe added. \\"There was quite a bit of wind out there, a cobbled section, so where's best to ride, check out a few of the bends and... feed it back. \\"It's a time trial with some big, long and straight boulevards so there's plenty of places to put the power down, then stay calm on the technical sections.\\" Find out how to get into cycling with our special guide.

Some of the locals feared that the regional economy would be unable to thrive if there remained strict federal prohibitions against resource development or settlement within park boundaries and local entrepreneurs advocated reducing the size of the park so that mining, hunting, and logging activities could be developed. To this end, numerous bills were introduced into Congress by Montana representatives who sought to remove the federal land-use restrictions.After the park's official formation, Nathaniel Langford was appointed as the park's first superintendent in 1872 by Secretary of Interior Columbus Delano, the first overseer and controller of the park. Langford served for five years but was denied a salary, funding, and staff. Langford lacked the means to improve the land or properly protect the park, and without formal policy or regulations, he had few legal methods to enforce such protection. This left Yellowstone vulnerable to poachers, vandals, and others seeking to raid its resources. He addressed the practical problems park administrators faced in the 1872 Report to the Secretary of the Interior and correctly predicted that Yellowstone would become a major international attraction deserving the continuing stewardship of the government. In 1874, both Langford and Delano advocated the creation of a federal agency to protect the vast park, but Congress refused. In 1875, Colonel William Ludlow, who had previously explored areas of Montana under the command of George Armstrong Custer, was assigned to organize and lead an expedition to Montana and the newly established Yellowstone Park. Observations about the lawlessness and exploitation of park resources were included in Ludlow's Report of a Reconnaissance to the Yellowstone National Park. The report included letters and attachments by other expedition members, including naturalist and mineralogist George Bird Grinnell. Grinnell documented the poaching of..., can you guess it ?

Context: Few athletes would disagree that more muscle is an advantage in their sport. And protein is the perfect source of amino acid building blocks needed for new muscle growth and repair. Taken together, strength training and sufficient protein will stimulate new muscle protein synthesis. Note that the keyword here is sufficient, because this is where protein supplement marketers like to extend to “the more the better”. So how much protein do sportspeople need? Consensus position statements such as those produced by the American College of Sports Medicine give the range of 1.2 grams to 1.7 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. But the top end of that range is for elite endurance athletes, power sportspeople and those in the early stages of a strength training phase. The “recreational athlete”, which describes the majority of active sportspeople, should aim for the bottom end of the range. So how do those protein requirement numbers stack up against a regular diet? Protein intake and body weights collected in the 2011-2012 Australian Health Survey, as an example, show the average Australian male already eats 1.2 grams and the average female 1.1 grams of protein per kilogram body weight. And this is for mostly sedentary people who are not following any special “high protein” training diet. Sportspeople do have higher energy needs. But by simply eating a greater volume of food with a focus on higher protein content, it’s very feasible for an athlete to get their protein requirements from food alone. This has been backed up by research; numerous dietary surveys show the normal diet of strength-based athletes provides around two grams of protein per kilogram body weight per day. And that’s before using any protein powders. But protein supplements can’t be dismissed altogether. There are circumstances where supplementation is an appropriate and convenient option for athletes, such as when travelling, or during an intense training schedule. Question: After the article, what will sportspeople probably consume? Options: - Only protein supplements so they can eat whatever they want - not enough information - More foods that are higher in protein - They'll consume less protein and more carbs for energy The answer is:","response":"More foods that are higher in protein"},{"question":"This text is missing some spaces, please add them: Thefirsttwocards(holecards)aredealtfacedown,andtheotherplayerscan'tseethem.","response":"To add spaces to the given text, I will first identify the words and then insert spaces accordingly: 1.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Tchaikovsky was born in 1840 in Votkinsk, a small town in present-day Udmurtia, formerly the Imperial Russian province of Vyatka. A precocious pupil, he began piano lessons at the age of five, and could read music as adeptly as his teacher within three years. However, his parents' passion for his musical talent soon cooled. In 1850, the family decided to send Tchaikovsky to the Imperial School of Jurisprudence in Saint Petersburg. This establishment mainly served the lesser nobility or gentry, and would prepare him for a career as a civil servant. As the minimum age for acceptance was 12, Tchaikovsky was sent by his family to board at the Imperial School of Jurisprudence's preparatory school in Saint Petersburg, 800 miles (1,300 km) from his family home in Alapayevsk. Once Tchaikovsky came of age for acceptance, he was transferred to the Imperial School of Jurisprudence to begin a seven-year course of studies.Music was not a priority at the School, but Tchaikovsky regularly attended the theater and the opera with other students. He was fond of works by Rossini, Bellini, Verdi and Mozart. Piano manufacturer Franz Becker made occasional visits to the School as a token music teacher. This was the only formal music instruction Tchaikovsky received there. From 1855 the composer's father, Ilya Tchaikovsky, funded private lessons with Rudolph Kündinger, a well-known piano teacher from Nuremberg, and questioned Kündinger about a musical career for his son. Kündinger replied that nothing suggested a potential composer or even a fine performer. Tchaikovsky was told to finish his course and then try for a post in the Ministry of Justice.Tchaikovsky graduated on May 25, 1859 with the rank of titular counselor, a low rung on the civil service ladder. On June 15, he was appointed to the Ministry of Justice in Saint Petersburg. Six months later he became a junior assistant and two months after that, a senior assistant. Tchaikovsky remained there for the rest of his three-year civil service career.In 1861, Tchaikovsky...

[ii] Slightly dampen a piece of bread and press it on the floor.","response":"I will choose option [ii] Slightly dampen a piece of bread and press it on the floor. This method is effective in safely picking up broken glass because the bread's soft, moist texture allows it to capture small shards and tiny glass particles that may be difficult to see or pick up with other methods. Steps on how to do this: 1. Take a slice of bread or a small piece of bread. 2. Moisten the bread slightly with water to make it damp. This will improve the bread's ability to adhere to the glass particles. However, do not make it too wet, as it may fall apart and become ineffective. 3. Carefully press the damp bread on the floor where the broken glass is located. Make sure to apply gentle, even pressure to cover as much area as possible without risking injury. 4. Slowly lift the bread, checking to see if any glass particles are stuck to it. If there is still broken glass on the floor, repeat the process with a fresh damp piece of bread. 5. Once all the visible glass shards have been picked up with the bread, thoroughly sweep or vacuum the area to ensure any remaining pieces are removed. 6. Dispose of the broken glass and the used bread in a safe manner, such as by wrapping them in newspaper or placing them in a sturdy container before putting it in the trash.

By the end of the evening, all that is left is a small pile of ashes. What happened to the matter that you started with? Was it destroyed by the flames? It may seem that way. What do you think happened? The truth is that the same amount of matter still exists. The wood changed not only to ashes, but also to carbon dioxide, water vapor, and other gases. The gases floated off into the air, leaving behind just the ashes. Although matter was changed, it was not created or destroyed. Because the same amount of matter still exists, we can say that matter is conserved. You may wonder how it can be conserved if something is now missing? Assume you had measured the mass of the wood before you burned it. Assume you had also trapped the gases released by the burning wood and measured their mass and the mass of the ashes.

(A) hardwood floor (B) carpet","response":"(A) hardwood floor When Talia slides her dog's bone across the hardwood floor and the carpet with the same level of strength, the bone will travel further on the hardwood floor. This is because different surfaces have different frictional forces. The hardwood floor has a smoother surface, resulting in less friction between the bone and the floor, allowing the bone to slide more easily and travel a greater distance. On the other hand, carpet has a rougher, more textured surface which increases friction, slowing down the bone and reducing the distance it can travel.

Questions: What could a driver do that could distract him or her while he or she is in a driving car? Options: - use mobile phone - car crash - smoke - backache - automobile accidents Answer:","response":"A driver could engage in various activities that can distract him or her while driving, ultimately putting their safety and the safety of others at risk. Among the options provided, the most in line with common sense as a potential distraction for the driver is using a mobile phone. When a driver uses a mobile phone, they may divert their attention away from the road and the task of driving itself. This can involve texting, browsing the internet, checking social media, or engaging in phone calls. Drivers who use mobile phones while driving have a harder time maintaining proper focus, responding to traffic changes, controlling speed, and keeping the steering wheel steady. In addition to using a mobile phone, other activities can cause distractions while driving too. For instance, adjusting the radio, eating, drinking, looking at a GPS navigation system, and conversing with passengers can all lead to divided attention. It is important to note that car crashes, backaches, and automobile accidents are not direct distractions or actions taken by the driver while driving; instead, these events are potential consequences or symptoms that may occur in a driver's life. A backache, for example, might cause discomfort while driving, but it is not an activity that a person engages in while driving. Similarly, car crashes and automobile accidents are events that may result from distracted driving, but they are not considered distractions in the conventional sense. In conclusion, using a mobile phone during driving has been established as a significant distraction for drivers, leading to an increased risk of accidents and harming the safety of everyone on the road. It is important for drivers to be aware of these risks and to avoid engaging in distractions while driving, thus ensuring a safer driving experience for all road users."},{"question":"Q:Archaeologists studied data about human settlements.

Despite this \\"stumbling block\\", Bright said that Windows 8's interface worked well in some places, but began to feel incoherent when switching between the \\"Metro\\" and desktop environments, sometimes through inconsistent means. Tom Warren of The Verge wrote that the new interface was \\"as stunning as it is surprising\\", contributing to an \\"incredibly personal\\" experience once it is customized by the user, but had a steep learning curve, and was awkward to use with a keyboard and mouse. He noted that while forcing all users to use the new touch-oriented interface was a risky move for Microsoft as a whole, it was necessary in order to push development of apps for the Windows Store.

Alexander perhaps undercut his own rule by demonstrating signs of megalomania. While utilizing effective propaganda such as the cutting of the Gordian Knot, he also attempted to portray himself as a living god and son of Zeus following his visit to the oracle at Siwah in the Libyan Desert (in modern-day Egypt) in 331 BC. His attempt in 327 BC to have his men prostrate before him in Bactra in an act of proskynesis borrowed from the Persian kings was rejected as religious blasphemy by his Macedonian and Greek subjects after his court historian Callisthenes refused to perform this ritual. When Alexander had Parmenion murdered at Ecbatana (near modern Hamadan, Iran) in 330 BC, this was \\"symptomatic of the growing gulf between the king's interests and those of his country and people\\", according to Errington. His murder of Cleitus the Black in 328 BC is described as \\"vengeful and reckless\\" by Dawn L. Gilley and Ian Worthington. Continuing the polygamous habits of his father, Alexander encouraged his men to marry native women in Asia, leading by example when he wed Roxana, a Sogdian princess of Bactria. He then married Stateira II, eldest daughter of Darius III, and Parysatis II, youngest daughter of Artaxerxes III, at the Susa weddings in 324 BC.Meanwhile, in Greece, the Spartan king Agis III attempted to lead a rebellion of the Greeks against Macedonia. He was defeated in 331 BC at the Battle of Megalopolis by Antipater, who was serving as regent of Macedonia and deputy hegemon of the League of Corinth in Alexander's stead. Before Antipater embarked on his campaign in the Peloponnese, Memnon, the governor of Thrace, was dissuaded from rebellion by use of diplomacy. Antipater deferred the punishment of Sparta to the League of Corinth headed by Alexander, who ultimately pardoned the Spartans on the condition that they submit fifty nobles as hostages. Antipater's hegemony was somewhat unpopular in Greece due to his practice (perhaps by order of Alexander) of exiling malcontents and garrisoning cities with Macedonian... A:","response":"The Spartan king Agis III was defeated at the Battle of Megalopolis.

The best solution largely depends on the type of lampshade you are dealing with. Whether it's fabric, glass, or paper can greatly determine the best approach. Here are three common solutions: 1. Vacuuming: One way to clean a lampshade is by vacuuming it. Dust and other flaky materials can be easily removed from the lampshade using the soft-brush attachment on your vacuum. Start from the top and move down, this facilitates dust removal without pushing them further into the fabric. Make sure the vacuum is set at a low suction level to avoid damage. This method is suitable for all types of lampshades. 2. Soap and Water: For tougher stains on fabric or glass lampshades, a more in-depth cleaning might be needed. Remove the lampshade and submerge it in a solution of warm water and mild dish soap. Gently scrub away stains with a soft cloth or sponge. After cleaning, rinse thoroughly to remove any soapy residue. Allow the lampshade to air-dry completely before reinstalling. This method is not advisable for paper or parchment shades as they are not water-resistant. 3. Dry Spot-Cleaning: For fabric lampshades with spot stains, a dry spot-cleaning method can be used. Apply a small amount of dry cleaning solvent (available at convenience and grocery stores) on a clean cloth. Dab rather than rub at the stain to minimize fabric damage. Make sure to test on an inconspicuous area first to check if the solvent is safe for your lampshade. Once the stain is gone, let it air dry. Use this method only for spot stains and not for overall cleaning as solvents can discolour certain fabrics. Conclusion: Each method's effectiveness relies on the type of lampshade you have and the nature of the stains or dust. Vacuuming is often the most gentle and universal method, while soap and water are great for deep cleaning lampshades that are water-safe. Dry spot-cleaning, although not ideal for overall cleaning, can save the day for stubborn stains on fabric shades. In essence, no single method is superior. It's about choosing the right strategy for the right type of lampshade and stain or dust. But remember, whenever you clean lampshades or any other electrical appliances, always unplug them first. Never use water or liquid cleaning solutions near electrical connections or on lampshades that are not water-safe. When in doubt, always refer to the lampshade's cleaning instructions if available or consult a professional cleaner."},{"question":"Given the sentence \\"Young child walks by the side of a walk down a snow sloshed path embedded in water.\\" can we conclude that \\"A child wearing boots is walking through slush.\\"?

Do most high school head coaches make as much as the Head Coach at NCSU?","response":"Rationale: To answer this question, we need to consider the differences between high school coaching salaries and the salaries of head coaches at higher-level athletic programs, such as those found in universities. Several factors contribute to these differences in compensation, including the level of competition, the revenue generated by the athletic programs, and the budget allocated for athletics by schools and universities. Answer: No, most high school head coaches do not make as much as the Head Coach at North Carolina State University (NCSU). This is because college head coaches, especially those at well-known universities such as NCSU, typically earn significantly higher salaries than high school coaches. The reasons for this disparity in compensation include the following: 1. Level of competition: College sports often attract more attention and feature a higher level of competition than high school sports. As a result, coaches at the college level, who are responsible for recruiting and developing top-level talent, are often compensated more handsomely than their high school counterparts. 2. Revenue generation: College sports, especially football and basketball, generate significant revenue for universities through ticket sales, merchandise, and broadcasting deals. A successful college athletic program can also boost enrollment, attract donors, and raise the school's overall profile. In contrast, high school sports programs typically have lower budgets and rely heavily on local support. Consequently, the budgets for coaching staff are likely to be smaller in high schools. 3. Athletic budgets: Universities often dedicate a larger portion of their budgets to athletics than high schools, which means there is more money available for coaching salaries in a college setting. Additionally, high schools usually have numerous sports programs to support while having fewer resources, limiting the amount they can allocate to each program. Overall, high school head coaches generally make less than the Head Coach at NCSU because of the differences in level of competition, revenue generation, and athletic budgets."},{"question":"What is the missing first step of the following process: - The pollution negatively affects the water quality - The pollution negatively affects the health of plants and animals - The plants and animals have shorter, less healthy lives - The plants and animals do not reproduce very well - The number of plants and animals decreases over time - The quality of water gets worse and worse as there are no plants or animals to clean it - Eventually there is nothing living in the water and it is unusable - A:","response":"A: The first step missing in this process is: \\"Human activities such as industrial processes, agricultural practices, and urban development generate various forms of pollution, which enters the water bodies such as rivers, lakes, and oceans.\\" This step identifies the source of pollution and its connection to human actions, setting the stage for the subsequent consequences."},{"question":"Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

Due to her dark skin color, Pecola gets taunted for her appearance as the members of her community associate beauty with \\"whiteness\\". She ultimately develops an inferiority complex, which fuels her desire for blue eyes. The point of view switches between the perspective of Claudia MacTeer, the daughter of Pecola's foster parents, and multiple third-person limited viewpoints. Due to the controversial issues the book raises such as racism, incest, and child molestation, there have been numerous attempts to ban it from schools and libraries. - Princeton University is a private Ivy League research university in Princeton, New Jersey, United States. - Sula is a 1973 novel by Nobel Prize - winning author Toni Morrison . - Toni Morrison (born Chloe Ardelia Wofford; February 18, 1931) is an American novelist, editor, and Professor Emeritus at Princeton University.

Answer: novel"},{"question":"If \\"The brown dog bounds through the leaves and the underbrush.\\", can we conclude \\"A dog sleeps in his cage.\\"?","response":"From the provided statement, \\"The brown dog bounds through the leaves and the underbrush,\\" we cannot conclusively infer that \\"A dog sleeps in his cage.\\" The reason for this lies in the differences between the two statements and the lack of any direct correlation between them. To elaborate further, let's break down and analyze the content of the two statements. In the first statement, \\"The brown dog bounds through the leaves and the underbrush,\\" we gather the following information: 1. There is a dog involved in the scenario. 2. The dog is brown. 3. The dog is currently engaging in an activity, specifically, bounding through the leaves and underbrush. This description paints a very specific picture of a dog and its current activity. Now let's examine the second statement, \\"A dog sleeps in his cage.\\" 1. There is a dog involved in the scenario. 2. The dog is asleep. 3. The dog is confined within a cage. Although both statements involve a dog, the similarities effectively end there. The first statement describes a brown dog participating in an active outdoor pursuit, while the second statement refers to a dog resting indoors within a cage. Additionally, the second statement does not provide information about the color of the dog. Given the discrepancies and lack of correlation between the two statements, we cannot ascertain whether the dog in the first statement is the same dog mentioned in the second. Moreover, the context provided in the first statement does not indicate any information about the dog's sleeping habits or any eventual confinement to a cage. The two statements are entirely independent, offering us no grounds through which to connect their respective subjects or actions. In conclusion, based on the information provided, we are unable to draw the connection from \\"The brown dog bounds through the leaves and the underbrush\\" to \\"A dog sleeps in his cage.\\" To establish a conclusion between these statements, we would require additional context or information linking the subjects and their actions. Otherwise, as it stands, the statements provide no evidence supporting such a conclusion."},{"question":"@princessherb okaaay good Describe the sentiment embodied by this tweet.

The match's lone goal came courtesy of Dan Gardner's late second-half winner, which sent the Chesterfield fans into celebrations. This fixture held immense importance for both sides as they continue their fight to avoid relegation from the English Football League (EFL) League One. With Chesterfield currently without a permanent manager, the tension was high as the home side looked to improve their league standing. The first half was a tightly contested affair, with both teams showing their desire for a valuable victory. Coventry City's aggressive pressing and tactical approach initially caused problems for Chesterfield's makeshift backline. However, the resilience of the Blues' defenders gradually grew with their confidence, snuffing out the Sky Blues' attacking forays and keeping them at bay. Chesterfield's attacking play in the opening period was characterized by quick bursts of pace and a willingness to shoot from distance. However, Coventry City's goalkeeper was on hand to thwart the early attempts on goal. The first half ended goalless, with both teams still searching for the elusive breakthrough. The second half commenced with renewed impetus from both teams as they sought to claim an invaluable three points. Chesterfield began to find their rhythm as they carved out chance after chance, but the Sky Blues' stubborn defense and goalkeeping thwarted their efforts. As the match entered its final stages, it appeared that the two sides would have to settle for a share of the spoils. However, Chesterfield talisman Dan Gardner had other ideas. With just minutes remaining, Gardner gathered possession in the Coventry City half and unleashed a ferocious strike from 30 yards out. The ball soared past the Coventry goalkeeper, nestling into the back of the net and sending the Chesterfield faithful into delirium. The match concluded with a 1-0 victory for the Spireites. Gardner's late winner could prove to be an incredibly important moment for Chesterfield's season, as they now sit three points closer to escaping the dreaded relegation zone. This vital win has given Chesterfield's players a much-needed confidence boost in their fight for League One survival. Despite the club's ongoing managerial search, the players displayed tremendous character and spirit throughout the match. Coventry City, on the other hand, will be bitterly disappointed with the outcome. The Sky Blues find themselves further embroiled in the relegation battle, with the pressure mounting on both the players and the coaching staff. Despite the rollercoaster of events during the season so far, Chesterfield's victory over Coventry City serves as a timely reminder that no team's fate is sealed in the world of football. As the League One season continues, both clubs will be desperate to continue fighting and defy the odds in one of the most competitive divisions in the English football pyramid. With performances like this one, Chesterfield may well prove that they have the ability to stave off relegation and build a brighter future for themselves in League One."},{"question":"Can we conclude from \\"Two people look up towards a gold statue.\\" that \\"A gold statue has the attention of two people.\\"?

Each province was governed by the Provincial States, the main executive official (though not the official head of state) was a raadspensionaris. In times of war, the stadtholder, who commanded the army, would have more power than the raadspensionaris.\\" Answer: The answer to this question is:","response":"In the absence of any current war, the most powerful individual or entity would likely be the Raadspensionaris, as the Stadtholder's power and influence would be significantly diminished without an active conflict requiring military command. The Raadspensionaris, or Grand Pensionary, served as the chief executive and chief administrator of the Provincial States within the Dutch Republic during the time when there was no active military conflict. This position was essential to the operation of the federal government, as it ensured the coordination and implementation of policies across all provinces. The Raadspensionaris played a central role in managing a broad range of activities, ranging from fiscal matters and diplomacy to justice and legislation, thus wielding considerable power and influence in the administration of the republic. In contrast, the primary role of the Stadtholder was to function as the military commander and provincial governor in times of war and crisis. In the absence of active military conflict, their duties would be limited to that of a provincial governor and would have less influence over the republic's affairs compared to the Grand Pensionary. While the Stadtholder would still maintain some authority, particularly in regional governance, they would not have extensive control over national decision-making. This would result in less power compared to the Raadspensionaris. As a general rule, the power dynamics within the Dutch Republic tended to shift in response to changing circumstances, with the Raadspensionaris growing more influential during times of peace and stability, while the Stadtholder's authority increased in times of war or unrest. This dynamic ensured an effective division of power and responsibility within the Dutch Republic, allowing for effective governance and adaptation to various challenges and opportunities. In the particular case of the Dutch Republic without any ongoing war, the most powerful person or role would likely be the Raadspensionaris, as they would take a leading role in shaping policy and managing the affairs of the Republic. The role of the Stadtholder, while still important, would not be as prominent in the absence of an active conflict, allowing the Grand Pensionary to maintain significant power and influence over the workings of the Republic."},{"question":"Q: Given a sentence in Somali language, translate the sentence to English language keeping the meaning of the original sentence intact Somali sentence: 11 Haddii aydnaan maalka xaqdaran aamin ku ahayn, waxa run ah yaa idinku aaminaya?

It involves levitating pods or capsules running inside partially evacuated tubes, with the goal of achieving high levels of efficiency and cutting down on travel time. One of the primary benefits of the Hyperloop is its potential for lower costs compared to traditional transportation systems, both for its development and for the users. The following evidence supports the claim that the Hyperloop will be a low-cost system for the user: 1. Reduced energy consumption: The Hyperloop is expected to rely on renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, or geothermal power. In addition, the near-vacuum environment inside the tubes reduces air resistance, making it more energy-efficient compared to traditional modes of transportation. This reduction in energy consumption would translate into lower operational costs, which, in turn, could lead to more affordable ticket prices for passengers. 2. Lower infrastructure costs: The proposed design of the Hyperloop involves elevated tubes supported by pylons, which could be constructed with a smaller footprint and within existing transportation corridors, reducing acquisition costs for the land. Furthermore, the modular construction and prefabrication of components can potentially lower overall infrastructure costs, making it more cost-effective to build and maintain. 3. Competitiveness with air and high-speed rail travel: The primary competition for the Hyperloop in the long-distance transportation market is air travel and high-speed rail. By offering faster, more efficient transportation at lower costs, the Hyperloop could disrupt these industries and force them to lower their prices to remain competitive. This would benefit consumers through cheaper travel options and encourage a more competitive transportation market. 4. Economies of scale: As the technology and manufacturing processes behind the Hyperloop mature and become more efficient, costs for building and operating the system could decrease. This could allow companies to offer lower prices to users as they scale up and build more extensive networks. 5. Reduced car dependency: The Hyperloop could potentially reduce the need for personal car ownership, especially for long-distance trips, as users may choose to use Hyperloop for faster, more affordable travel. This could lead to reduced transportation costs for individuals who would otherwise rely on personal vehicles, as well as decreased congestion and pollution from cars. 6. Public-private partnerships: Governments could potentially collaborate with private companies to develop and manage Hyperloop systems. Public-private partnerships often result in subsidies and financial support for infrastructure projects, which could help to reduce costs for both developers and users. 7. Attraction of private investments: The promise of a revolutionary transportation system like the Hyperloop is likely to attract private investments, further helping to fund the development and testing of the technology. These investments can help offset the cost of initial development and eventually lead to lower user costs. While the Hyperloop's potential for low-cost transportation is promising, it is important to note that the technology is still under development, and many questions remain unanswered about its viability in real-world applications. As testing and development continue, more definitive data will become available to determine if the Hyperloop can live up to its potential to provide a low-cost transportation option for users."},{"question":"Choose your story that continues the following story.

U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday revived the June 12 Singapore summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, eight days after canceling it. Trump said he was convinced of Kim’s commitment to denuclearization by the renewed diplomatic talks that included a visit to Washington by Kim Yong Chol, the North’s former intelligence chief, who carried a letter from the North Korean leader. South Korean President Moon Jae-in has been influential in facilitating the U.S.-North Korea summit, in getting Kim to agree to the broad goal of denuclearization, and in urging Trump to stay committed to the diplomatic process to resolve differences with North Korea. President Trump seems to be leaning now towards Moon’s approach versus the more confrontational stance advocated by some of his security team in demanding that North Korea unilaterally and completely disarm before any concessions are granted. Friday Trump downplayed expectations for a major breakthrough at the summit, saying it will be the beginning of a process. He also backed away from his “maximum pressure” approach that stressed tough sanctions and the threat of military force, focusing instead on brokering an agreement to end the North’s nuclear program for economic aid and security guarantees that could include a peace treaty to replace the armistice that ended the Korean War in 1953.

A: OPT: I. calcification II. migration III. evaporation IV. erosion Answer:","response":"A: The process involved in the formation of a waterfall when a stream flows from an area of harder to softer rock is erosion. When a river or stream flows over an area with layers of harder and softer rock, differential erosion occurs. Harder rocks are more resistant to erosion, while softer rocks erode relatively quickly. As the softer rock erodes, it creates a drop in elevation between the two types of rock, leading to the formation of a waterfall. The process of erosion primarily takes place through the actions of water, which gradually wears away the softer rock. Over time, the waterfall continues to retreat upstream, creating a gorge as the waterfall migrates. Waterfalls also erode due to the force of the falling water creating a plunge pool at the base, which can cause further erosion of the softer rock and deepening of the gorge. In summary, the formation of a waterfall when a stream flows from an area of harder to softer rock involves erosion. The other processes listed (calcification, migration, and evaporation) are not directly related to waterfall formation in this context."},{"question":"Use reasoning to lead to the answer of the following question: The blade would catch the air and turn, this powered the what engine to create power?

The land was infertile, just a swampy plain, the river small and sluggish. But it had a sheltered harbor, protected from the monsoons by neighboring Sumatra. Later, the strategic location and deep-water channel close to the coast brought in the bigger vessels of the trade-wind traffic crossing the Indian Ocean. The first to realize the larger commercial potential, as so often throughout the country's subsequent history, were the Chinese. In 1409, under a new directive from Emperor Chu Ti to pursue trade in the South Seas and the Indian Ocean, a Chinese fleet of 50 ships headed by Admiral Cheng Ho called in at Melaka. They made Parameswara an offer he could not refuse: port facilities and an annual financial tribute in exchange for Chinese protection against the marauding Thais. In 1411, Parameswara took the money to Beijing himself, and the emperor gratefully made him a vassal king. Twenty years later, the Chinese withdrew again from the South Seas trade. The new ruler of Melaka, Sri Maharajah, switched his allegiance to the Muslim trading fraternity by marrying into the Muslim faith, wedding the daughter of a sultan in Sumatra. Islam won its place in Malaya not by conquest — as had been the case in North Africa and Europe — but by trade, dynastic alliances, and peaceful preaching. Bengali peddlers had already brought the faith to the east coast. In Melaka and throughout the peninsula, Islam thrived as a strong, male-dominated religion of individuality, offering dynamic leadership and preaching brotherhood and self-reliance — all qualities ideally suited to the coastal trade. At the same time, Sufi mystics synthesized Islamic teaching with local Malay traditions of animistic magic and charisma, though Islam did not become the state religion until Muzaffar Shah became sultan of Melaka (1446–1459). But the key figure in the sultanate was Tun Perak, bendahara (prime minister) and military commander. He expanded Melaka's power along the west coast and down to Singapore and the neighboring Bintan islands. He also had orang laut pirates patrolling the seas to extort tribute from passing ships. After Ailied district chiefs had repelled assaults from Thai-controlled armies from Pahang, Tun Perak personally led a famous victory over a Thai fleet off Batu Pahat in 1456. Question: \\"Why was Melaka not an ideal place for most people to live in its early days?\\" Answer: \\"Aggressive animals\\" Based on the paragraph, is this answer correct","response":"No, this answer is not correct. The paragraph states that Melaka was not an ideal place to live in its early days because the land was infertile and swampy, and the river was small and sluggish.

Recycling used glass is the most environmentally friendly and beneficial option among the given choices. This is because recycling glass has multiple advantages, such as: 1. Energy Conservation: Recycling glass saves energy compared to the manufacturing of new glass from raw materials. This is because producing glass from recycled materials requires less heat than melting raw materials, such as sand, soda ash, and limestone. 2. Reduced Carbon Emissions: Producing glass from recycled materials generates fewer carbon emissions compared to manufacturing glass from raw materials. This is crucial in our fight against climate change and reducing our overall carbon footprint. 3. Resource Conservation: By recycling glass, we conserve natural resources, as less raw materials are required for production. This helps in preserving our resources for future generations. 4. Waste Diversion from Landfills: Recycling glass reduces the amount of waste that ends up in landfills. This promotes waste management practices and helps alleviate the burden on our landfills. 5. Economic Benefits: Recycling glass creates jobs and promotes the recycling industry. By supporting the collection and processing of used glass, new opportunities are created in the workforce. When glass is recycled, it can be converted into various new products, including bottles, jars, insulation, glassphalt (used in road construction), and glass tiles.

UPDATED:. 09:02 EST, 6 March 2013. Switching off a certain gene could stop junk food eaters from gaining weight. Switching off a 'fat' gene could prevent you from piling on the pound even if you stick to a high-fat diet, say researchers. A two-year study found that removing this gene in mice made them resistant to obesity. The animals showed unusual restraint when fed a high-calorie diet and were more active as well. 'When fed a diet that induces obesity. these mice don’t get fat,' said study author Professor James McManaman from the University of Colorado. 'It may be. possible to duplicate this in humans using existing technology that. targets this specific gene.' The absence of the gene may cause fat to be broken down faster by the body, he said. The research team created a strain of mice without the Plin2 gene, which humans also possess. It produces a protein that regulates fat storage and metabolism. They found their fat cells were 20 per cent smaller than typical mice and did not show the kind of inflammation usually associated with obesity. Obesity-associated fatty liver disease, common in obese humans and rodents alike, was absent in the mice without the Plin2 gene. 'The mice were healthier,' Prof McManaman said. Fat cells were 20 per cent smaller in mice without the Plin2 gene. 'They had lower triglyceride levels, they were more insulin-sensitive, they had no incidents of fatty liver disease and there was less inflammation in the fat cells.' The findings suggest switching off the Plin2 gene may lower the risk of heart disease (triglycerides are fatty molecules involved in the hardening of the arteries) and diabetes. 'It could mean that we have finally. discovered a way to disrupt obesity in humans. That would be a. major breakthrough,' Prof McManaman. The team next want to know how the gene alteration works physiologically and better understand how it affects food consumption. According to the study, understanding how Plin2 is involved in the control of energy balance will provide new insights into 'the mechanisms by which nutrition overload is detected, and how individuals adapt to, or fail to adapt to, dietary challenges.' The study, funded by the. National Institutes of Health was published in The Journal of Lipid Research. What are the important parts of this article?","response":"The key points of this article are: 1. Researchers from the University of Colorado conducted a two-year study that examined the effects of switching off a specific 'fat' gene, known as Plin2, in mice. 2. The study found that removing the Plin2 gene in mice made them resistant to obesity, even when fed a high-calorie diet. These mice showed unusual restraint when fed such a diet and were more active. 3. According to study author, Professor James McManaman, it may be possible to replicate this effect in humans by targeting the Plin2 gene using existing technology. 4. The absence of the Plin2 gene may cause fat to be broken down faster by the body. 5. Mice without the Plin2 gene had 20% smaller fat cells and did not exhibit inflammation usually associated with obesity.

If there’s one thing that’s consistent about Netflix’s “House of Cards,” it’s that there are always several moments each season that stick with you for awhile — and not necessarily in a good way. Whether it’s Zoe Barnes getting pushed in front of a Metro train or Frank and Claire Underwood inviting a Secret Service agent into the bedroom for some unexpected extracurricular activities, there’s no shortage of strange images in the first two seasons. That grand tradition continues into Season 3, which premiered Friday. [Related: What happened on “House of Cards” Season 2? Here’s a reminder.] I’m four episodes in (your viewing speed may vary), and there’s already a lot going on. Frank officially swindled his way into becoming president, but it’s not going very well: He can’t get any bills passed and his own party would prefer he not run in the 2016 election. Claire manipulates everything to become United Nations ambassador. Doug Stamper, formerly Frank’s right-hand man, survived being attacked by Rachel (the prostitute he tried to kidnap last season) but is recovering incredibly slowly. Hacker Gavin hates working as the FBI, even if it’s a trade-off for not going to jail — but he’s trying to help Doug track down Rachel, because she still knows too much. Oh, and we learn that Secretary of State Catherine Durant has killer beer pong skills. And of course, along with the intertwining plot lines and notable cameos (Stephen Colbert and Pussy Riot thus far), there have been the requisite disturbing moments. Which one has made you the most uncomfortable so far? It’s tough to choose, even just four episodes in — and nine more to go. “House of Cards” insults our intelligence What to look for in this season of “House of Cards” Sesame Street did a “House of Cards” parody.

Take a class. Article:","response":"Title: Be Spontaneous and Tackle Your Fears: Trying New Things and Taking Classes Hello boys and girls! Today, we are going to talk about a fun and exciting way to make life more interesting. Have you ever wished that you could do something new and cool? Well, guess what? You can! Being spontaneous means doing something without planning it, just for the fun of it. So, let's explore how we can be more spontaneous, tackle our fears, try new activities, and maybe even take a class. First, let's talk about being spontaneous. Being spontaneous is like when you decide to dance in the rain, even though you didn't plan to. It's all about doing things for the joy of it and not worrying about what others may think of it. By being spontaneous, we can learn to laugh more, have more fun, and discover new things that we love to do! Next, we need to tackle our fears. Sometimes we're scared to do something new, like climb a tall tree or learn how to swim. But guess what? That's okay! We all have things that we're afraid of, but the only way to overcome those fears is by facing them head on. When we try something new, like joining a soccer team or learning how to play the piano, we feel so proud of ourselves for being brave! Now, let's talk about trying new activities. New activities are things you have never done before. Doing new activities is like walking into a room full of fun toys that you've never seen before! There are so many possibilities - we can try painting, playing an instrument, making new friends, or jumping on a trampoline! Trying new activities helps us to find out which ones we like the most and can even help us make new friends who share our interests. Finally, let's think about taking a class. A class is like a big group of people who are all learning something new together. Classes can be about anything, from learning a new language to learning how to dance. Taking a class helps us to learn new skills, meet new friends who like the same things as we do, and become a better version of ourselves! In conclusion, boys and girls, being spontaneous, tackling our fears, trying new activities, and taking classes are all great ways to make our lives more exciting and fun! So, the next time you see a chance to try something new or be spontaneous, go for it, because life is a big adventure and we should enjoy every moment of it!"},{"question":"Hannah Brencher never planned on starting a worldwide movement. Her life wasn't going as planned so she looked for a way to cope. That's when she started writing. \\"I began leaving love letters all over New York City back in October 2010,\\" Brencher writes on her personal website, \\"as a way to try to fight off my own loneliness and depression.\\" She took it even further and went on to write over 400 letters to strangers around the world. Her kind words turned into More Love Letters, an international organization that has sent notes of positivity and encouragement to people in all 50 states and 50 countries. Those deserving of letters are nominated, with friends or family explaining why they're deserving of an outpouring of support. Writing volunteers read the nominations and respond to those that move them. Brencher described the organization as the \\"best accident\\" that ever happened to her. The letters are as unique as the individuals who write them. A quick glance at the More Love Letters website shows some written on embellished stationary while others are written on plain index cards. The messages written in the letters are meant to touch the heart of the reader. \\"Dear Friend, Embrace today. You are amazing, beautiful, loved. Brighten a room with your smile,\\" states one letter. Another one is more lighthearted. \\"I hope today is/was a good hair day and that you felt confident in what you chose to wear.\\" Whatever the message, these letters make an impact. \\"(The More Love Letters team) received an e-mail from a girl who had been riding on the subway and she had just found out that her mother had cancer,\\" Brencher said. \\"She actually looked down to the side of her and she noticed that there was a love letter sitting there with all the words of encouragement that she could possibly need.\\" In fact, in addition to sending letters directly to those who are nominated, More Love Letters encourages recipients to pass their messages on, or leave them for others to find. People find the letters in the strangest places. \\"I have heard of everything from in the grocery store to in coffee shops,\\" Brencher said. \\"We've seen a lot of people start to leave love letters in their favorite books.\\" Brencher said one book in particular seems to be a popular location to leave love letters: \\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower.\\" After receiving a letter, Betina Foreman said she sees the value in paying it forward. \\"People always want to complain,\\" she said, \\"but when somebody does something right, how often does somebody say something?\\" As the organization has grown, it has expanded into other ways of sending love.

If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","response":"To determine if the second sentence is true, given that the first sentence is true, let's analyze both sentences step by step. Step 1: Analyze Sentence 1 - \\"The Industrialist stared, looked at the Astronomer, turned to stare again.\\" - This sentence tells us that the Industrialist looked at the Astronomer and stared in a manner that suggests surprise or strong interest. Step 2: Analyze Sentence 2 - \\"The Astronomer turned his gaze to stare as well.\\" - This sentence suggests that the Astronomer also stared, which means he looked at something with a similarly intense gaze. Step 3: Evaluate the connection between the sentences - It is important to note that Sentence 2 does not establish a direct cause-and-effect relationship with Sentence 1. It simply states that the Astronomer also stared, but it doesn't specify what he stared at or why. Step 4: Determine if the second sentence can be true given the first sentence - Given that the first sentence is true, the second sentence can also be true, but not necessarily always be true.

Align the log and board: This means making sure the round stick (log) is straight and lined up with the long, flat piece of wood (board). 5. Attach the log to the board: We'll need some special helpers called clamps to hold our round stick (log) in place on the flat surface (board). Ask your grown-up helper to tighten the clamps so the log stays in place. 6. Double-check everything: Before we move on, make sure everything is in the right place and the log is secure on the board. 7. Use the table saw: Now, the grown-up helper will use a big tool called a table saw to carefully cut the round stick (log). The flat board will move through the saw, helping the log stay in place while it's being cut. Once the log is cut, you've accomplished your goal! You attached a log to a board and safely ran it through a table saw. Great teamwork!"},{"question":"Question: Who is Kim's ex-husband? If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: 88 Minutes Context: Forensic psychiatrist Dr. Jack Gramm (Al Pacino) testifies at the trial of suspected serial murderer Jon Forster (Neal McDonough), dubbed \\"The Seattle Slayer\\" by police. Gramm's testimony and expert psychiatric opinion are crucial to help convict Forster of the attempted killing of Janie Cates and the murder of Joanie Cates, who was drugged, hanged upside down, and killed after the killer broke into her home. After receiving his conviction by the jury, Forster taunts Gramm, saying \\"Tick-tock, Doc.\\" Nine years later, as Forster's execution date approaches, several similar torture murders with very similar circumstances occur. Gramm is questioned by a lawyer from the Attorney General's office as well as FBI Special Agent Frank Parks (William Forsythe) about his connection to the latest victim, Dale Morris, a former psychology student of Gramm's with whom he was at a party the night before, just hours before her death. On the way to his class, Gramm receives a phone call from someone using software to distort their voice, threatening he has 88 minutes to live. He later reports the call to his secretary Shelly (Amy Brenneman) and has her put together a risk assessment profile of potential perpetrators. Gramm receives another threatening phone call while teaching and becomes suspicious of his students, particularly Mike Stempt (Benjamin McKenzie). The Dean of students, Carol Johnson (Deborah Kara Unger), interrupts the class to evacuate the building due to a bomb threat called in. As he evacuates the lecture hall, Gramm finds a written threat on the overhead projector in the classroom as well as on his car, which has been vandalized in the parking garage. Gramm then is met by his teaching assistant Kim Cummings (Alicia Witt) who offers to help him find the person that's been targeting him. In the stairwell of the parking garage, Gramm comes upon one of his students, Lauren Douglas (Leelee Sobieski), attacked by an unknown assailant and reports the assault to campus security.

What is the answer??","response":"Okay, let's solve the equation step by step! We have the equation: 9*c - 92*c - 432 = -11*c First, we'll combine the terms with 'c' in them: (9*c - 92*c) - 432 = -11*c Now, imagine you have 9 candies and someone takes away 92 candies from you. That is like adding 9 and subtracting 92 which will be: 9 - 92 = -83 So, now we have -83*c - 432 = -11*c Next, we want to move all the 'c' terms to one side of the equation. To do this, we'll add 83*c to both sides to make it look like this: -83*c + 83*c - 432 = -11*c + 83*c When we simplify this equation, we get: - 432 = 72*c Now, we want to get 'c' all by itself. It's like saying you have 72 groups of something, and all together they make -432. To find out what each group has, we can divide -432 by 72: -432 / 72 = -6 So, c = -6.

The man took the car off of cruise control. He passed the car when it was safe. He put the car back on cruise control. Based on that paragraph can we conclude that this sentence is true? The car did the driving","response":"Based on the provided paragraph, the statement \\"The car did the driving\\" cannot be entirely true without considering some caveats and assumptions. Cruise control is an automatic feature in many modern vehicles that allows drivers to maintain a consistent speed without having to manually control the accelerator. When the man in the story puts the car on cruise control, this means that the car will be maintaining a specific speed set by the driver. However, the driver remains in control of other aspects of driving, such as steering, braking, and sometimes even speed adjustments depending on the situation. In the given paragraph, the man takes the car off of cruise control because the car in front of him is going too slow. This implies that the driver is still responsible for making decisions and actively driving the vehicle by controlling the speed and direction. He passed the slower car when it was safe to do so, and then reengaged the cruise control feature, allowing the car to maintain the desired speed automatically. While it is true that the car's cruise control feature handles a specific aspect of driving (maintaining a consistent speed), it is important to understand that cruise control does not equate to complete autonomy of driving. The driver remains in control of the majority of the vehicle's actions, including steering, braking, and lane changes. In this case, the driver made a decision to execute a pass, disengage the cruise control, and reengage it later. To fully conclude that the car did the driving, we would have to assume that the car was equipped with advanced self-driving technology or autonomous features that handle all aspects of driving. However, from the given paragraph, it does not state that the car has these advanced features, and it describes a situation where the driver is still actively involved in the driving process. So, although it is true that the car's cruise control feature contributed to the driving, the statement \\"The car did the driving\\" cannot be considered entirely true in this context without further information regarding the vehicle's advanced features or level of autonomy. The driver maintains primary responsibility for controlling the vehicle and making decisions in the given scenario."},{"question":"Please answer this question: what do you win on lotto max with 3 numbers?","response":"In the Lotto Max game, you need to match numbers on your ticket with the numbers drawn.

It can hybridize with Lelwel hartebeest to make the Kenya Highland hartebeest ( Alcelaphus buselaphus lelwel x cokii ) . - Bison are large, even-toed ungulates in the genus \\"Bison\\" within the subfamily Bovinae. - Tanzania , officially the United Republic of Tanzania, is a country in Eastern Africa within the African Great Lakes region. Parts of the country are in Southern Africa. It is bordered by Kenya and Uganda to the north; Rwanda, Burundi, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the west; Zambia, Malawi, and Mozambique to the south; and by the Indian Ocean to the east. Mount Kilimanjaro, Africa's highest mountain, is in northeastern Tanzania. - Kenya, officially the Republic of Kenya, is a country in Africa and a founding member of the East African Community (EAC). Its capital and largest city is Nairobi. Kenya's territory lies on the equator and overlies the East African Rift covering a diverse and expansive terrain that extends roughly from Lake Victoria to Lake Turkana (formerly called Lake Rudolf) and further south-east to the Indian Ocean. It is bordered by Tanzania to the south and southwest, Uganda to the west, South Sudan to the north-west, Ethiopia to the north and Somalia to the north-east. Kenya covers , and had a population of approximately 45 million people in July 2014. - The sheep (\\"Ovis aries\\") is a quadrupedal, ruminant mammal typically kept as livestock. Like all ruminants, sheep are members of the order Artiodactyla, the even-toed ungulates. Although the name \\"sheep\\" applies to many species in the genus \\"Ovis\\", in everyday usage it almost always refers to \\"Ovis aries\\". Numbering a little over one billion, domestic sheep are also the most numerous species of sheep. An adult female sheep is referred to as a \\"ewe\\", an intact male as a \\"ram\\" or occasionally a \\"tup\\", a castrated male as a \\"wether\\", and a younger sheep as a \\"lamb\\". - The lion (\\"Panthera leo\\") is one of the big cats in the genus \\"Panthera\\" and a member of the family Felidae. The commonly used term African lion collectively denotes the several subspecies in Africa. With some males exceeding in weight, it is the second-largest living cat after the tiger. Wild lions currently exist in sub-Saharan Africa and in India (where an endangered remnant population resides in Gir Forest National Park). In ancient historic times, their range was in most of Africa, including North Africa, and across Eurasia from Greece and southeastern Europe to India. In the late Pleistocene, about 10,000 years ago, the lion was the most widespread large land mammal after humans: \\"Panthera leo spelaea\\" lived in northern and western Europe and \\"Panthera leo atrox\\" lived in the Americas from the Yukon to Peru. The lion is classified as a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), having seen a major population decline in its African range of 3050% over two decades during the second half of the twentieth century. Lion populations are untenable outside designated reserves and national parks. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes of concern. Within Africa, the West African lion population is particularly endangered. - An antelope is a member of a number of even-toed ungulate species indigenous to various regions in Africa and Eurasia. Antelopes comprise a wastebasket taxon (miscellaneous group) within the family Bovidae, encompassing those Old World species that are not cattle, sheep, buffalo, bison, or goats. A group of antelope is called a herd. - The African Great Lakes are a series of lakes constituting the part of the Rift Valley lakes in and around the East African Rift. They include Lake Victoria, the second largest fresh water lake in the world by area, and Lake Tanganyika, the world's second largest freshwater lake by volume and depth. Collectively, they contain 31,000 km (7400 cu mi) of water, which is more than either Lake Baikal or the North American Great Lakes, and constitutes about 25% of the planet's unfrozen surface fresh water. - A herd is a social grouping of certain animals of the same species, either wild or domestic. The form of collective animal behavior associated with this is referred to as \\"herding\\". - The even-toed ungulates (order Artiodactyla) are ungulates (hoofed animals) whose weight is borne equally by the third and fourth toes. By contrast, odd-toed ungulates, such as horses, bear their weight primarily on their third toe. The aquatic Cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and porpoises) evolved from even-toed ungulate ancestors, and therefore modern taxonomic classification combines Artiodactyla and Cetacea into Cetartiodactyla. - The domestic goat (\\"Capra aegagrus hircus\\") is a subspecies of goat domesticated from the wild goat of southwest Asia and Eastern Europe. - Eurasia is the combined continental landmass of Europe and Asia. The term is a portmanteau of its constituent continents. Located primarily in the Northern and Eastern Hemispheres, it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Pacific Ocean to the east, the Arctic Ocean to the north, and by Africa, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Indian Ocean to the south. The division between Europe and Asia as two different continents is a historical and cultural construct, with no clear physical separation between them; thus, in some parts of the world, Eurasia is recognized as the largest of five or six continents. In geology, Eurasia is often considered as a single rigid megablock. However, the rigidity of Eurasia is debated based on the paleomagnet data. - Nairobi is the capital and largest city of Kenya. It is famous for having the Nairobi National Park, the world's only game reserve found within a major city. The city and its surrounding area also form Nairobi County, whose current governor is Evans Kidero and Deputy Governor is Jonathan Mueke.

FOX Sports newscaster Amy Campbell (center) was knocked over by high school football star Ermon Lane (right) while interviewing recruiting analyst Chad Simmons (left) at an elite summer football camp. In the video, picked up by local television station ABC WPBF, Campbell is listening intently to Simmons speak when Ermon comes running up behind her at full speed to catch a pass.

Given the context: How would Others feel as a result? The answer is:","response":"To determine how others would feel as a result of Kai's sincere apology and gesture, I would follow these steps: 1. Analyze the context: I would first need to understand the situation and the relationship between Kai and the others involved. This helps determine the gravity of Kai's actions and the potential impact on others' emotions. 2. Identify possible emotions: Based on the context analysis, I would identify potential feelings others might experience as a result of Kai's apology. These could vary from relief, happiness, appreciation, to skepticism, depending on the severity of the situation and the individuals involved. 3. Evaluate the gesture's efficacy: I would then assess the effectiveness of Kai's gesture (crossing their heart and hoping to die) in conveying sincerity. This would depend on cultural norms and how well the others know Kai. If the gesture is widely recognized and believed to be genuine, it would likely have a positive impact on others' emotions. 4. Consider individual reactions: I would also take into account each person's unique perspective, temperament, and past experiences with Kai, as they may influence the perception of the apology. 5. Synthesize the information: Finally, I would combine the information gathered from the above steps to make a well-rounded prediction of how others would feel as a result of Kai's apology and gesture. Given the limited context, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer.

It is an inland and in relative terms upland county having eastward-draining valleys while taking in moors of the Pennines and has a population of 2.2 million. West Yorkshire came into existence as a metropolitan county in 1974 after the passage of the Local Government Act 1972. - North Yorkshire is a non-metropolitan county (or shire county) and larger ceremonial county in England. It is located primarily in the region of Yorkshire and the Humber but partly in the region of North East England. - In geography, a confluence is the meeting of two or more bodies of water. Also known as a \\"conflux\\", it refers either to the point where a tributary joins a larger river, (main stem), or where two streams meet to become the source of a river of a new name, such as the confluence of the Monongahela and Allegheny rivers in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania creating the Ohio River. - York is a historic walled city at the confluence of the rivers Ouse and Foss in North Yorkshire, England. The municipality is the traditional county town of Yorkshire to which it gives its name. The city has a rich heritage and has provided the backdrop to major political events in England throughout much of its two millennia of existence. The city offers a wealth of historic attractions, of which York Minster is the most prominent, and a variety of cultural and sporting activities making it a popular tourist destination for millions. - A County town is usually the location of administrative or judicial functions within the county, or it has been established over time as the \\"de facto\\" main town of a county. The concept of a county town eventually became detached from its original meaning of where the county administration or county hall is based. In fact, many county towns are no longer part of the administrative county. For example, Nottingham is administered by a unitary authority entirely separate from the rest of Nottinghamshire. Many county towns are classified as cities, but all are referred to as county towns regardless of whether city status is held or not. - Yorkshire (or ; abbreviated Yorks), formally known as the County of York, is a historic county of Northern England and the largest in the United Kingdom. Due to its great size in comparison to other English counties, functions have been undertaken over time by its subdivisions, which have also been subject to periodic reform. Throughout these changes, Yorkshire has continued to be recognised as a geographical territory and cultural region. The name is familiar and well understood across the United Kingdom and is in common use in the media and the military, and also features in the titles of current areas of civil administration such as North Yorkshire, South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire and East Riding of Yorkshire. - A shire is a traditional term for a division of land, found in the United Kingdom and Australia. It was first used in Wessex from the beginning of Anglo-Saxon settlement, and spread to most of the rest of England in the tenth century. - South Yorkshire is a metropolitan county in England. It is the southernmost county in the Yorkshire and the Humber region and had a population of 1.34 million in 2011. It has an area of and consists of four metropolitan boroughs, Barnsley, Doncaster, Rotherham and Sheffield. South Yorkshire was created on 1 April 1974 as a result of the Local Government Act 1972 with Barnsley as its county town. - Scandinavian York ( also referred to as Jórvík ) or Danish / Norwegian York is a term used by historians for the south of Northumbria ( modern day Yorkshire ) during the period of the late 9th century and first half of the 10th century , when it was dominated by Norse warrior - kings ; in particular , used to refer to the city ( York ) controlled by these kings . Norse monarchy controlled varying amounts of Northumbria from 875 to 954 , however the area was invaded and conquered for short periods by England between 927 and 954 before eventually being annexed into England in 954 . It was closely associated with the much longer - lived Kingdom of Dublin throughout this period . - Northern England, or North of England, also known as the North or the North Country, is the northern part of England and one the country's three principal cultural areas, along with the Midlands and Southern England. Geographically, the area roughly spans from the River Trent and River Dee to the Scottish border in the north. - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight. - The Cathedral and Metropolitical Church of Saint Peter in York, commonly known as York Minster, is the cathedral of York, England, and is one of the largest of its kind in Northern Europe. The minster is the seat of the Archbishop of York, the second-highest office of the Church of England, and is the mother church for the Diocese of York and the Province of York. It is run by a dean and chapter, under the Dean of York. The title \\"minster\\" is attributed to churches established in the Anglo-Saxon period as missionary teaching churches, and serves now as an honorific title. Services in the minster are sometimes regarded as on the High Church or Anglo-Catholic end of the Anglican continuum. - The East Riding of Yorkshire, or simply East Yorkshire, is a ceremonial county of England. It is located in the region of Yorkshire and the Humber. The East Riding of Yorkshire may also refer to a local government district with unitary authority status, which does not include the city of Kingston upon Hull, the largest settlement in the ceremonial county, which is a separate unitary authority. The modern East Riding of Yorkshire (both ceremonial county and unitary authority), was formed in 1996 from the northern part of the non-metropolitan county of Humberside. - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.

Select from: (I) unacceptable. (II) acceptable.","response":"The test sentence provided, \\"the girls likes themselves,\\" is (I) unacceptable in terms of correct grammatical English sentence structure for the following reasons: 1. Subject-verb agreement: In English, the subject of a sentence must agree with the verb in terms of number (singular or plural). In the test sentence, the subject is \\"the girls\\" which is plural, but the verb \\"likes\\" is singular. The correct verb form should be \\"like\\" to match the plural subject \\"the girls.\\" Hence, it should be \\"the girls like\\" instead of \\"the girls likes.\\" 2. Pronoun usage: In the test sentence, the pronoun \\"themselves\\" is reflexive, which means it is used when the action of the verb is directed back towards the subject of the sentence. While \\"themselves\\" is used correctly in terms of being a plural reflexive pronoun, the sentence lacks the specific action taken by \\"the girls\\" that justifies the use of the reflexive pronoun. For example, a correct sentence using the reflexive pronoun \\"themselves\\" would be, \\"The girls prepared themselves for the game,\\" where the verb \\"prepared\\" allows for the use of the reflexive pronoun. To amend the test sentence into an acceptable English sentence, consider the following revision: \\"The girls like themselves.\\" In this corrected version, the subject-verb agreement is maintained, as \\"the girls\\" is plural and \\"like\\" is the appropriate plural verb form. The reflexive pronoun \\"themselves\\" is used correctly, as it reflects an action (liking) done by the girls affecting the girls themselves."},{"question":"Not that the back yard is anything more than a disaster zone at this point . Albeit slightly less of a disaster zone than the front yard . Of course during the grinding the neighbor 's sprinkler line was ground up , so I had to make an emergency trip to Ace to get some PVC pipe ( we had 3/4 \\" , the neighbor 's was 1/2 \\" ) and connectors to make that repair . The fence guy sort of took over as I was cleaning up the chewed ends of the existing pipe . Answer the following question: What may be the reason why the front and back yard was a disaster zone ?","response":"There could be several reasons why the front and back yard were in a disastrous state. It is essential to consider the context and the factors involved in determining the specific reason. In this case, some possible explanations include: 1. Ongoing construction or renovation work: It's possible that the house is undergoing significant construction or renovation work, leading to the front and back yards being in disarray. Construction and renovation projects often involve heavy machinery, digging, and moving materials, which can cause damage to the yards. 2. Storm damage or natural disaster: The disaster in the yards could potentially be due to a recent storm or other natural disasters such as heavy rainfall, hurricane, or tornado. These events can wreak havoc on landscapes, uprooting trees, causing flooding, and scattering debris. 3. Neglect or lack of maintenance: Another reason why the yards might be in a disastrous state might be due to neglect or lack of regular maintenance. If the homeowner has not been taking care of the property or has been away for an extended period, the yards might have become overgrown, cluttered, and unkempt. 4. Pest infestation: Sometimes, pest infestations can cause significant destruction in yards. Rodents, insects, and other creatures can damage lawns, gardens, and structures. In this case, the grinding up of the neighbor's sprinkler line might indicate that a pest was responsible for damaging the yards. 5. Accidents or human error: It could also be that an accident or an instance of human error occurred, causing damage to the yards. In this scenario, the fence guy might have caused the initial damage, leading to the necessity to repair the sprinkler system. 6. Vandalism or intentional damage: Even though it may be less likely, it is still possible that the yards were deliberately damaged by vandals or malicious individuals who trespassed onto the property. These are just a few potential reasons for the disaster in the front and back yards. To determine the exact cause, it would be necessary to analyze the specific situation, timeline of events, and any relevant evidence."},{"question":"Teacher:You are given a sentence in Polish.

When I called shark they won't gurantee anything they were asking 25 dollar for that small brush .This whole system sucks except that it cleans hardfloor nice thats why it earned 1 star. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? The answer to this question is:","response":"This review depicts the product in an unflattering light. The reviewer expresses dissatisfaction with the product's performance, specifically highlighting the issues with the side brush and battery life. They mention that the side brush stopped working after a month of usage, and even after replacement, the same issue occurred. Furthermore, the reviewer notes that the fully charged battery only works for 10-15 minutes, which is a short duration for a cleaning device. Additionally, the reviewer is unhappy with the customer service provided by the company, as they were asked to pay 25 dollars for a replacement brush. This negative experience adds more to the unflattering portrayal of the product. The only positive comment is that it cleans hard floors well, but that isn't enough to compensate for the other mentioned problems. Thus, based on the review's focus on the product's issues, poor customer service, and the reviewer's suggestion that potential buyers should avoid purchasing it, it can be concluded that the product is depicted in an unflattering light."},{"question":"Given the question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: What happens, according to the novel, when people subvert the expectations of their gender? Context: Absent mothers and abusive fathers are another theme in the novel. Scout and Jem's mother died before Scout could remember her, Mayella's mother is dead, and Mrs. Radley is silent about Boo's confinement to the house. Apart from Atticus, the fathers described are abusers. Bob Ewell, it is hinted, molested his daughter, and Mr. Radley imprisons his son in his house until Boo is remembered only as a phantom. Bob Ewell and Mr. Radley represent a form of masculinity that Atticus does not, and the novel suggests that such men as well as the traditionally feminine hypocrites at the Missionary Society can lead society astray. Atticus stands apart as a unique model of masculinity; as one scholar explains: \\"It is the job of real men who embody the traditional masculine qualities of heroic individualism, bravery, and an unshrinking knowledge of and dedication to social justice and morality, to set the society straight.\\" The answer is:","response":"When people subvert the expectations of their gender, according to the novel, they can lead society astray.

In 2013, Myanmar improved yet again, receiving a score of five in civil liberties and a six in political freedoms\\" Answer: A:","response":"After Myanmar transitioned to a new government in August 2011, several indications showed that people were able to speak and behave more freely. Some of these indications include: 1. Improved human rights record: According to the Crisis Group, Myanmar's human rights record improved following the transition. This is a sign that people were experiencing increased freedom and more relaxed restrictions on their actions and speech. 2. Better Freedom in the World ratings: The 2012 Freedom in the World report upgraded Myanmar's rating from 7 (its lowest rating) to a 6 due to improvements in civil liberties and political rights. In 2013, Myanmar's rating further improved, receiving a score of 5 in civil liberties and a 6 in political freedoms. 3. Release of political prisoners: The release of political prisoners is a significant sign of increased freedom in speech and behavior. It shows that the government was more lenient towards individuals expressing their political beliefs and allowed for greater diversity of opinions. 4. Loosening of restrictions: After the transition, Myanmar saw a loosening of restrictions on various aspects of daily life. This can include reduced censorship on media, greater internet accessibility, and increased freedom to form and join organizations. 5. Growth of independent media: The emergence and growth of independent media outlets, including newspapers and broadcasters, indicate that people were able to access a wider range of information and express their views more freely without fear of persecution or censorship. 6. Greater political participation: After the transition, there was an increase in political participation, with more political parties being formed and more candidates running for office. This development suggests that people were taking advantage of their newfound freedom to engage in the political process. 7. Increased civil society engagement: As restrictions loosened, civil society organizations were able to participate more actively in public life. This enabled individuals to become more active in advocating for rights, voicing opinions, and participating in social and political debates. In summary, the improvement in Myanmar's human rights record, better Freedom in the World ratings, release of political prisoners, loosening of restrictions, growth of independent media, greater political participation, and increased civil society engagement all demonstrate that people in Myanmar were able to speak and behave more freely after the transition in 2011."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you're given an ambiguous question (which can be answered in more than one way).

Today, I will tell you a story about something called \\"inflation\\" and some important lessons we learned from a time known as the 1970s. Inflation is when the prices of things you want to buy, like toys and candy, go up. When this happens, your money is not worth as much, and you might need more money to buy the same things as before. Now, let us start our journey back in time to the 1970s, when something really surprising happened. The prices of things people wanted to buy went up really fast! Here are some reasons why that happened and what we can learn from it. 1. Importance of Oil The 1970s was a time when people really needed something called \\"oil.\\" Oil is a black, liquid stuff we find in the ground, and it has many uses, from making cars go to keeping our houses warm. In the 1970s, there was less oil available, so the prices went up a lot. This made everything more expensive because most things need oil in some way. The lesson we can learn is that when something important gets more expensive, it can cause inflation. 2. Being Sure of What You Need One way to try to control inflation is by deciding how much money to make and put into the system. The people in charge change what they think is best because they want everyone to have jobs and to not have too much inflation. But, in the 1970s, they were not sure what to do, so they sometimes made too much or too little money. This made prices go up even more. So, one lesson we can learn is that knowing how much money to make and put in the system is very important. 3. Sticking Together During the 1970s, many people who worked at jobs like making cars or building things, felt like they needed more money because everything was getting so expensive. They decided to stop working until they got more money, which is called a \\"strike.\\" The problem was that when they stopped working, there were fewer cars and other things being made, so the prices went up even more. One good lesson from this is that everyone needs to work together to keep prices from going up too fast. 4. Patience is a Virtue Sometimes, when things go wrong, and prices go up quickly, it can be hard to stay calm and patient. People in the 1970s got scared and wanted a fast solution to fix the problem. But it takes time to understand what is going on and find the best ways to help. So, another important lesson from the 1970s is that being patient and staying calm can help in solving big problems like inflation. So, kiddos, this story about inflation in the 1970s has some important lessons. We need to remember how valuable things like oil are, be sure about our needs, stick together, and be patient when trying to solve problems. By learning from the past, we can help make sure that our ice cream and toy money keeps its value, so we don't have to worry about not being able to buy the things we want."},{"question":"If \\"A man in a cap, wearing no shirt or shoes, sits in a blue chair on a cobbled street and paints upon a canvas.\\", does this mean that \\"A man paints a store front on the cobbled street.\\"?","response":"Not exactly, little buddy.

Electronic storage is not only expensive, it also requires enough physical space for all that clunky hardware, ranging in size from a small printer up to a car. Knowing just how much storage to buy is tricky. Prices decrease over time as computers get more powerful. Companies and institutions that stock up on storage by purchasing larger systems now (to avoid replacement costs down the road) risk overspending on storage over the long haul. That's where Scale Computing, of Greenwood, Ind., brainchild of Jeff Ready, comes in. Unlike giants Hewlett-Packard ( HPQ - news - people ) and Dell ( DELL - news - people ), Scale allows customers to buy storage space in increments of one-, two- and four-terabyte storage \\"nodes,\\" each one roughly the size of a pizza box. Thanks to Scale's patent-pending software, called TrueCluster, customers can simply tack on more nodes as they need them--like Lego blocks--without having to buy new hardware. Building Blocks: 21 Computer Hardware Terms You Should Know Building Blocks: 23 Tech Security Terms You Should Know Result: Scale is able to charge roughly one-third the price for the same amount of storage. Three terabytes of network data storage from H-P costs roughly 31,000; Scale sells it for 11,000. In June, Ready--who in the last decade launched and sold two venture-backed companies--and his seven partners landed 3 million in VC funding from Blue Chip Venture, CID Capital and Spring Mill Ventures. In the same month, the state of Indiana's 21st Century Research and Technology Fund handed the company a 2 million grant (see: \\"Finding Dough In America's Breadbasket\\"). Ready and company have kicked in 500,000 of their own funds, too. Scale sells through distributors, including CDW ( CDWC - news - people ) and MicroAge. Since February the company has signed on 30 partners across the U.S. Its largest customer: Motorola ( MOT - news - people ), which uses Scale storage in eight hubs around the globe. This year, Ready estimates revenues could reach 2 million, a sliver of the 8 billion data storage market. That means plenty of room to grow. Ready's biggest challenge, he says: \\"Signing on more channel partners.\\" What was this article about?","response":"This article is about Scale Computing, a company based in Greenwood, Indiana, that offers an innovative data storage solution for corporations, schools, hospitals, and governments.

Desegregation in Birmingham took place slowly after the demonstrations. King and the SCLC were criticized by some for ending the campaign with promises that were too vague and \\"settling for a lot less than even moderate demands\\". In fact, Sydney Smyer, president of the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce, re-interpreted the terms of the agreement. Shuttlesworth and King had announced that desegregation would take place 90 days from May 15. Smyer then said that a single black clerk hired 90 days from when the new city government took office would be sufficient. By July, most of the city's segregation ordinances had been overturned. Some of the lunch counters in department stores complied with the new rules. City parks and golf courses were opened again to black and white citizens. Mayor Boutwell appointed a biracial committee to discuss further changes. However, no hiring of black clerks, police officers, and firefighters had yet been completed and the Birmingham Bar Association rejected membership by black attorneys.The reputation of Martin Luther King Jr. soared after the protests in Birmingham, and he was lauded by many as a hero. The SCLC was much in demand to effect change in many Southern cities. In the summer of 1963, King led the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom where he delivered his most famous speech, \\"I Have a Dream\\". King became Time's Man of the Year for 1963 and won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964. Four months after the Birmingham campaign settlement, someone bombed the house of NAACP attorney Arthur Shores, injuring his wife in the attack. On September 15, 1963, Birmingham again earned international attention when Ku Klux Klan members bombed the 16th Street Baptist Church on a Sunday morning and killed four young girls. FBI informant Gary Thomas Rowe was hired to infiltrate the KKK and monitor their activities and plans. Rowe was involved, along with the Birmingham Police, with the KKK attacks on the Freedom Riders, led by Fred Shuttlesworth, in Anniston, Alabama on May 14, 1961. In...

Choices: - smile - be happy - laughing - falling down - talk The rationale to choose \\"be happy\\" as the answer is that: The answer is:","response":"\\"Be happy.\\" The rationale for choosing \\"be happy\\" as the answer stems from several factors that need to be considered. These factors include the context of the situation, understanding of human emotions, various coping mechanisms and approaches to dealing with problems, and the relationship between the mother and daughter. 1. Context of the situation: The question mentions that the daughter is crying at her mother's death bed, which indicates a highly emotional and sensitive situation. Losing a loved one is one of the most painful and devastating experiences anyone can go through. Therefore, the response from the mother should be comforting and provide solace to the daughter in order to alleviate her pain and sadness. 2. Understanding of human emotions: Human emotions are complex and multifaceted, but at the core of them is the innate desire to feel happy and content. A mother's reassurance and guidance to her daughter would likely be focused on helping her acknowledge and process her grief, while simultaneously encouraging her to find happiness in life. \\"Be happy\\" serves as both an affirmation and a gentle reminder to the daughter that life will go on, and that it's essential to find happiness even after experiencing loss. 3. Coping mechanisms and approaches to dealing with problems: There are various ways to cope with and overcome issues, but cultivating happiness and positivity plays a significant role in a healthy and balanced life. By advising her daughter to be happy, the mother is encouraging her to focus on positive emotions and experiences, rather than dwelling on the loss and sadness she feels. This will not only help her daughter cope more effectively with her mother's passing but will also promote personal growth and resilience. 4. Relationship between mother and daughter: Mothers often serve as a primary source of love, support, and guidance for their children. In a time of immense sorrow and grief, it is natural for the mother to want her daughter to prioritize her well-being and find happiness. The phrase \\"be happy\\" encapsulates the depth of love and care that the mother has for her daughter, and it represents the mother's wish for her daughter to thrive even in her absence. Taking into account all these factors, it becomes clear that \\"be happy\\" is the appropriate and logical choice. The mother's reassurance to \\"be happy\\" is a beautiful and timeless piece of advice that transcends the bleakness of her death bed, encouraging her daughter to navigate through her own life in a positive and fulfilling manner. By choosing happiness, the daughter will be honoring her mother's memory and ultimately strengthening her own ability to face challenges and adversity."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Title: My first amish novel!

But in most cases, the NSA is the starting point for determining what holes need to be filled through other means of intelligence-collection. That’s because its information on foreign developments is so comprehensive and generally so reliable. It is the core of intelligence support to U.S. troops in battle. Any efforts to “rein in” the agency must allow for the possibility that change risks serious damage to U.S. security and the country’s ability to navigate in an increasingly uncertain world. The presumption that the NSA “spies” on Americans should also be challenged. In my experience, NSA analysts err on the side of caution before touching any data having to do with U.S. citizens. In 2010, at the request of then-Director of National Intelligence Dennis Blair, I chaired a panel investigating the intelligence community’s failure to be aware of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the “underwear bomber” who tried to blow up a commercial plane over Detroit on Dec. 25, 2009. The overall report remains classified, but I can say that the government lost vital time because of the extraordinary care the NSA and others took in handling any data involving a “U.S. person.” (Abdulmutallab, a Ni­ger­ian, was recruited and trained by the late Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S. citizen based in Yemen.) Regarding outrage over the NSA’s collection of telephone calling records, or metadata, I don’t know why anyone would have greater confidence in this information being held by private companies. And given the perceived threat to privacy, it’s astonishing how little attention has been paid to the Senate commerce committee’s recent report on companies that gather personal information on hundreds of millions of Americans and sell it to marketers, often highlighting people with financial vulnerability. Some companies group the data into categories including “rural and barely making it,” “retiring on empty” and “credit crunched: city families.” The aim is often to sell financially risky products to transient consumers with low incomes, the report found. That’s a real scandal — and a universe away from the NSA’s ethical standards and congressional oversight. The NSA, of course, is not perfect. But it is less a victim of its actions — the independent commission appointed by President Obama found no illegality or abuses — than of the broad distrust of government that has taken root in the United States in recent decades. Studies by Pew and others show distrust of government around 80 percent, an all-time high. This distrust is the only logical explanation I see for fear of data being held by “the government” — and it’s not a circumstance the NSA created. Although our society lauds, in almost “Stepford Wives”-like fashion, the merits of “transparency,” it lacks a collective, mature understanding of how intelligence works, how it integrates with foreign policy and how it contributes to the national welfare. Meanwhile, prurient interest in the details of leaked intelligence skyrockets, and people devour material that is not evidence of abuse but merely fascinating — and even more fascinating to U.S. adversaries. So what makes sense going forward? Clearly, the widespread perception that there is at least the “potential for abuse” when the government holds information even as limited as telephone call metadata must be addressed. The recent presidential commission recommended adding a public privacy advocate to the deliberation process of courts that approve warrants — one proposal that would do no harm. But as the administration contemplates reform, it must reject any ideas that add time and process between the moment the NSA picks up a lead overseas and the time it can cross-check records to determine whether there is a domestic dimension to overseas plotting. As our debate continues, the terrorist threat is not receding but transforming. The core leadership of al-Qaeda has been degraded and remains under pressure, but robust al-Qaeda affiliates have multiplied. With the decline of central government authority in the Middle East and North Africa in the wake of the Arab Spring and the war in Syria, terrorists have the largest havens and areas for operational planning in a decade. If anything, the atomization of the movement has made the job of intelligence more labor-intensive, more detail-oriented and more demanding. Now is not the time to give up any tool in the counterterrorism arsenal. What are the most important parts of this text?","response":"The most important parts of this text are: 1. The crucial role of the NSA in providing comprehensive and reliable intelligence to support U.S. troops and national security, and the acknowledgement that efforts to \\"rein in\\" the agency should consider potential harm to U.S. security and the ability to navigate in an uncertain world. 2. The challenge to the presumption that the NSA \\"spies\\" on Americans, highlighting the cautious approach NSA analysts take in handling any data involving U.S. citizens. 3. The comparison of NSA's metadata collection to the private companies' data-gathering practices, which often exploit vulnerable Americans for financial gain, and questioning the relative outrage directed at the NSA. 4. The text asserts that the NSA is less a victim of its actions than of the broad distrust of government present in the U.S., and the lack of a collective understanding of how intelligence works and contributes to national welfare. 5. The recommendation of adding a public privacy advocate to the courts' deliberation process and the need to address the widespread perception of potential abuse while avoiding any measures that slow down the process of cross-checking leads. 6. The evolving and increasingly decentralized nature of the terrorist threat, which increases the challenges and demands on intelligence agencies like the NSA, making it important to maintain all available counterterrorism tools."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of the first building at Covent Garden?, using the article: The central square in Covent Garden is simply called \\"Covent Garden\\", often marketed as \\"Covent Garden Piazza\\" to distinguish it from the eponymous surrounding area. Designed and laid out in 1630, it was the first modern square in London—originally a flat, open space or piazza with low railings. From about 1635 onwards there were many private residents of note, including the nobility, living in the Great Piazza. A casual market started on the south side, and by 1830 the present market hall had been built. The space is popular with street performers, who audition with the site's owners for an allocated slot. The square was originally laid out when the 4th Earl of Bedford, Francis Russell, commissioned Inigo Jones to design and build a church and three terraces of fine houses around the site of a former walled garden belonging to Westminster Abbey. Jones's design was informed by his knowledge of modern town planning in Europe, particularly Piazza d'Arme, in Leghorn, Tuscany, Piazza San Marco in Venice, Piazza Santissima Annunziata in Florence, and the Place des Vosges in Paris. The centrepiece of the project was the large square, the concept of which was new to London, and this had a significant influence on modern town planning as the metropolis grew, acting as the prototype for the design of new estates, such as the Ladbroke Estate and the Grosvenor Estate. Isaac de Caus, the French Huguenot architect, designed the individual houses under Jones's overall design.The church of St Paul's was the first building, and was begun in July 1631 on the western side of the square. The last house was completed in 1637. Seventeen of the houses had arcaded portico walks organised in groups of four and six either side of James Street on the north side, and three and four either side of Russell Street. These arcades, rather than the square itself, took the name Piazza; the group from James Street to Russell Street became known as the \\"Great Piazza\\" and that to the south of Russell Street as the \\"Little Piazza\\".

(iv). balances on a balance beam hanging above the water with her hands extended..","response":"The most logical next event in this scenario would be (iii). The person in scuba gear holds on to the other person in scuba gear and does something to her tank. This option seems the most logical because it directly involves an interaction between the two individuals in scuba gear and takes their context into consideration. Additionally, this interaction is related to a key element of scuba diving: the oxygen tank. Manipulating or adjusting a fellow diver's tank is a common practice in scuba diving, as this activity involves teamwork and mutual trust. Ensuring that fellow divers have their gear properly set up is essential for a safe and enjoyable diving experience, and the act of checking or adjusting a dive buddy's oxygen tank is both practical and reasonable in this context. Option (i) introduces an improbable humorous action (the belly flop), which is irrelevant to the context of scuba diving. It appears less logical compared to an interaction that directly pertains to diving safety and coordination. Option (ii) fails to provide clear information about the action being performed. Furthermore, in scuba diving, the divers already wear a mask covering their eyes and nose; hence, wrapping one's face is unnecessary and counterproductive to the activity. Option (iv) introduces an unrelated element (the balance beam) that is also implausible in the context of scuba diving. Balance beams are typically associated with gymnastics and are not designed for aquatic environments. This option does not add any benefit to the divers nor enhances their diving experience. In conclusion, option (iii) is the most logical next event because it is coherent with the given context and serves a purpose relevant to scuba diving. It reflects the cooperative nature of the activity and demonstrates an essential step in ensuring that the divers are well-prepared and safe underwater."},{"question":"What happens next?

Although you may not complete a thorough cleaning in a short amount of time, any effort you make will contribute to a more orderly and harmonious living space. The other options listed are less likely or not directly related to cleaning the house for a short time: A. Exhaustion: While cleaning can certainly be a physically demanding task, it is less likely for you to become exhausted from a brief cleaning session. Exhaustion usually occurs when you engage in strenuous or prolonged activities, whereas a short cleaning period cannot typically cause significant fatigue. B. Tiredness: Similar to exhaustion, tiredness is also a potential outcome of cleaning. However, if you are only cleaning for a short time, it is less probable that this activity will cause you to feel overly tired or fatigued. A more intense or longer cleaning session might more likely lead to tiredness. C. Sneezing: Sneezing is a possibility when cleaning, especially if you are exposed to dust or allergens. However, this outcome largely depends on your environment and individual sensitivities. Thus, it is not a guaranteed result when cleaning for a short amount of time. E. Make money: Cleaning your own house does not typically result in making money. This option would be more applicable if you were a professional house cleaner being paid for your services. In the context of cleaning your personal living space for a short period, making money is not a direct outcome of the activity. In conclusion, among the given options, the most suitable answer is creating order. A brief cleaning session can lead to a more orderly and organized living space, which positively impacts your overall well-being and mental state.

Although the local police confirm that no foul play is suspected, this mistake has raised concerns about the efficacy of the hospital's patient management system and its commitment to preserving the dignity of its patients. Investigations are also attempting to ascertain how a procedure, usually involving meticulous checks, failed so egregiously. As per sources within the facility, standard procedures dictate that the bodies of deceased patients are tagged, documented, and then transferred to the morgue in the presence of authorized hospital staff before being sent for final rites. Clearly, in this case, a significant breach in the protocol occurred. Such an incident is not only traumatic for the bereaved family but also calls into question the credibility and trustworthiness of the healthcare institution. Public relations experts point out that it is essential for the hospital to handle the delicate situation transparently and compassionately, especially given the emotional repercussions it could have on the afflicted family. In light of this tragedy, patients and their families may be questioning the patient safety culture in Minnesota's healthcare facilities, with policymakers and healthcare providers expected to conduct a thorough review of current patient management protocols. Moreover, third-party audits may be suggested to ensure that these facilities are adhering to the highest standards in both care and facilities management. The hospital's immediate action will be significant in rebuilding trust, both with the affected family and within the community. Mental health professionals also advise that the family be offered adequate counseling and support services to navigate this distressing situation that has now compounded the trauma of losing their loved one. Meanwhile, the grieving family deserves the right to seek legal recourse for the hospital's negligence. By understanding the potential legal implications of such a case, healthcare institutions may be encouraged to prioritize patient safety, dignity, and respect above all else. In conclusion, this heart-wrenching incident serves as a stark reminder of the importance of having a reliable and foolproof healthcare system that prioritizes the dignity and well-being of patients and their families. The Minnesota hospital in question must act fast and resolutely to rectify the shortcomings that led to this tragedy, ensuring that such a devastating mix-up is never repeated in the future."},{"question":"Generate a context and a hypothesis.","response":"Context: The educational system in developing countries has been facing multiple challenges for the last few decades. Infrastructure, socio-economic factors, disparities in resource allocation, and exposure to technology have a direct impact on the overall education quality and individual growth. A potential solution to some of these issues could incorporate modern technology. Using digital platforms and online learning tools to support conventional educational institutions can not only increase access to education but also enhance the learning experience. Hypothesis: Utilizing digital platforms and online learning tools in combination with traditional classrooms in developing countries will significantly improve the overall quality of education and individual growth by increasing accessibility, student engagement, and access to global resources. This hypothesis revolves around the idea that digital solutions can work in tandem with traditional educational methods, thereby addressing various concerns affecting the education system. There are multiple aspects of the hypothesis that merit further exploration, which can be broken down into the following points: 1. Accessibility: The availability of digital platforms and online learning tools can help overcome geographical barriers, socio-economic status, and even gender disparities, making education accessible to a larger population. This increased accessibility could lead to a more inclusive and diverse learning experience in developing countries. 2. Student engagement: Digital platforms and online learning tools often incorporate interactive content, simulations, and multimedia designed to enhance learning. These features can promote student engagement, increasing attention spans, and ultimately lead to better comprehension and retention of the subject matter. 3. Access to global resources: With online connectivity, students in developing countries can tap into a wealth of information and resources from around the world, allowing them to learn from top educators and access quality material otherwise unavailable to them. This increased access to global resources can expose students to various perspectives and help broaden their understanding. 4. Personalized learning: Digital platforms often offer personalized learning experiences, such as adaptive learning pathways, which can tailor the educational content to individual needs. This customization can help students develop at their own pace, addressing potential knowledge gaps and catering to unique learning preferences. 5. Teacher training and support: The use of digital platforms can also benefit educators by providing access to professional development and support resources. With appropriate training in using online tools and technology, teachers can enhance their teaching methods and ensure they are better equipped to meet the diverse needs of their students. 6. Cost and resource allocation: By adopting digital platforms and online tools, education systems in developing countries can allocate resources more efficiently. The reduced need for physical infrastructure, such as classrooms or libraries, can shift funds towards other essential aspects of education, such as teacher salaries and student support services. To test this hypothesis, future research could focus on implementing and evaluating pilot programs in select developing countries. By collecting qualitative and quantitative data on educational outcomes, resource allocation, accessibility, student engagement, and teacher effectiveness, the research can help establish the benefits and potential limitations of using digital platforms and online learning tools to supplement traditional classroom teaching in developing countries."},{"question":"Said Kovacevic: \\"Telekom Srbija is doing better financially than before, but needs to develop further.

The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, \\"alternative\\" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk). - Homogenic is the third international solo album by Icelandic musician Björk, released in September 1997.

Deriving from later idioms of acid house, the term was first used by the British music media and press as a way to describe the more experimental variant of breakbeat emerging from the Bristol Sound scene, which contained influences of soul, funk and jazz. It has been described as \\"Europe's alternative choice in the second half of the '90s\\", and \\"a fusion of hip hop and electronica until neither genre is recognisable\\". Trip hop music fuses several styles and has much in common with other genres; it has several qualities similar to ambient music, and its drum-based breakdowns share characteristics with hip hop.

It opens with an instrumental section and \\"gently burbling\\" synthesizers. It follows with the sounds of drum beats, including taiko drums, then transitions into a piano melody. After the first verse, the chorus follows, with Leto singing, \\"Lost in the City of Angels / Down in the comfort of strangers / I found myself in the fire burned hills / In the land of a billion lights\\". During the bridge, he ornaments his vocal lines with melodic crescendos, affirming \\"I am home\\". After the final chorus, the song reaches a drum-heavy climax. Emily Zemler from Billboard cited \\"City of Angels\\" as an example of variety and experimentation in Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams. She described the song as a \\"pulsating, subtler track that employs a blipping electronic beat rather than the band's usual rock backdrop\\".In a preview of the record, Jeff Benjamin from Fuse acknowledged the 1980s influences that resonated throughout the track and noted that \\"hard rock guitars and percussion come crashing in on the chorus.\\" Sarah O' Hara, while reviewing Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams for Lowdown, compared the song to \\"Kings and Queens\\", a track with a similar structure included on This Is War featuring sparse verses and slow atmospheric builds to the chorus. In an interview with Loudwire, Leto described \\"City of Angels\\" as a very personal song about a specific place. He said, \\"It's the story of my brother and I going to Los Angeles to make our dreams come true. It's a love letter to that beautiful and bizarre land.\\" Leto later explained that the song could refer to any place a person goes to fulfill his or her own dreams.

Knowing this was the only way out, I obeyed and diligently signed all the papers. I hated my parents but still felt the inescapable drive to prove to them that I was worth something. I had to show them I wasn't crazy. As the hours passed, I was shown to a blank room with plastic sheets and plastic pillows, which caused me to wonder what kind of distant confused souls had been imprisoned in this sterile place. There were bars on the windows and the only door out of the unit was locked 24/7. I knew my only refuge for the time being would be through the hour a day art therapy class and the smoke breaks I could take at will. They had given me a legal pad after my parents had told them of my affinity for writing. With it I set to work on the flow of words and the river of thoughts, both dark and hopeful that careened through my tired mind. Instead of sleep, I would write. I expressed my vicious frustration for the place and thought constantly of the passing hours, counting them down as they went. Because of this I was thankful for the eight to ten I would use up easily in my escapes to the world behind my eyelids. There I was free and could experience a life unhindered by limitations of ethics or gravity. When I'd awake I'd write what I could remember of my escapes on the obtrusive legal pad. I had the suspicion that the attendants would come in and read my thoughts as I was eating meals or watching TV and I wondered if this was hindering my ability to get out. I wondered what kind of opinions and judgments they were forming about me. I had bared my soul on those pages explaining desperately how the thoughts would not leave even in this place, where it mattered most that they were gone. The fuckers would never leave.

Given the context: Why did Tracy do this? Possible answers: be a good friend, avenge someone, spend time with Lee","response":"Step 1: Identify and review the context. - The context given is that there was an accident on a big camping trip, and Tracy took Lee's life afterward. Step 2: Consider the possible explanations provided in the question. - Be a good friend. - Avenge someone. - Spend time with Lee. Step 3: Reflect on each possibility and assess its plausibility in the story's context. A. Be a good friend - If the accident on the camping trip led to Lee being severely injured or in a life-threatening situation, it is possible that Tracy took Lee's life out of a belief that it was a mercy killing, to end Lee's suffering. This would fall under the category of being a \\"good friend\\" if Tracy genuinely believed this was the best (or only) option to spare Lee prolonged suffering. B. Avenge someone - If Lee was responsible for the accident on the camping trip and it caused harm or death to someone else, Tracy may have been motivated to take Lee's life as a form of revenge. In this case, Tracy would believe in enacting justice or avenging the person harmed in the accident. C. Spend time with Lee - This explanation seems highly unlikely in the given context, since Tracy taking Lee's life would not allow Tracy to spend more time with Lee. Taking someone's life would ultimately end their existence, and Tracy cannot spend more time with Lee if Lee is dead. Therefore, this explanation does not seem plausible. Step 4: Determine the most plausible explanation given the context. Based on the assessment above, the most plausible explanation regarding why Tracy took Lee's life after the accident on the big camping trip would be either \\"be a good friend\\" (in a mercy-killing scenario) or \\"avenge someone\\" (if Lee caused harm to someone else). \\"Spend time with Lee\\" seems unlikely due to the inherent contradiction it presents - taking someone's life does not lead to spending more time with them."},{"question":"In this task, you are given a sentence in the Swedish language and your task is to convert it into the English language.

Article: Liu Hui is very excited. The students in a school in Shanghai will go to the USA with his parents during the Spring Festival. \\"Overseas touring has always been a dream for me,\\" he said happily. Nowadays, Chinese people enjoy longer holidays, such as the three \\"Golden Week Holidays\\"(the Spring Festival, May Day and National Day). They have more time to travel. Rising incomes also make travelling abroad realistic for ordinary Chinese people. Nearly 7 million Chinese travelled overseas in 2001, according to the National Tourism Administration . The most common problem travellers face is how to choose the best routes . By the end of 2002, Chinese citizens were allowed to travel to 19 foreign countries and regions at their own expense. The top 10 places included Hong Kong, Macao and Thailand. European countries are also becoming increasingly popular. \\"More and more Chinese people have shown interest in travelling to Europe, particularly France and Finland,\\" said Tan Wen, a general manager of China Youth Travel Service. \\"Sooner or later, there will be a peak in European tours.\\" Another consideration is choosing the right travel agencies and finding the best price. The China Consumers' Association(CCA,)offered tips to consumers on choosing the right travel agencies to help prevent a relaxing vacation from turning into a costly disaster. \\"Price should not be the single most important factor in choosing a travel agency,\\" said Zhang Yuanchao, CCA vice-secretary general. Consumers are advised to choose large State travel agencies with good reputations and official approval to organize overseas tour groups. Zhang's association dealt with more than 5, 000 complaints about travel agencies last year. And the majority of the complaints were about _ in travel routes, bad tour guides, and forced shopping.

Ben studied more about magnesium, zinc and molybdenum, while his buddy Andy studied about sodium and potassium. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which person studied less about moving sodium ions (Na + ) out of the cell? Hint: Sodium and potassium are two of the most important elements in living things. They are present mainly as positively charged ions dissolved in water. The sodium-potassium pump moves sodium ions (Na + ) out of the cell and potassium ions (K + ) into the cell. In both cases, the ions are moving from an area of lower to higher concentration. Energy in ATP is needed for this \\"uphill\\" process. Figure below shows how this pump works. Trace these steps from left to right in the figure Answer:","response":"Given the information provided in the paragraph, Ben studied more about magnesium, zinc, and molybdenum, while Andy studied more about sodium and potassium. Therefore, the person who studied less about moving sodium ions (Na+) out of the cell is Ben. Andy's study subjects, sodium and potassium, are crucial elements in living organisms and are integral to the functioning of the sodium-potassium pump. This pump moves sodium ions (Na+) out of the cell and potassium ions (K+) into the cell, both against their concentration gradients. This process requires energy in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) to facilitate the ion movement from a lower concentration area to a higher concentration area. The sodium-potassium pump operates through several steps, as depicted in the provided figure. When tracing these steps from left to right, a better understanding of how the pump works is achieved. Here's a brief overview of the pump mechanism: 1. At the beginning of the process, three sodium ions (Na+) from inside the cell bind to the pump protein located on the cell membrane. 2. The binding of sodium ions triggers the phosphorylation of the pump protein (i.e., the addition of a phosphate group from ATP), causing a change in the protein's conformation. 3. The conformational change enables the release of the three sodium ions (Na+) to the outside of the cell. 4. Subsequently, two potassium ions (K+) from outside the cell bind to the pump protein. 5. The enzyme then dephosphorylates (removes the phosphate group) itself, reverting to its original conformation. 6. The return to its original conformation allows the pump protein to transport the two potassium ions (K+) into the cell, completing the ion exchange process. In summary, the person who studied less about moving sodium ions (Na+) out of the cell is Ben, as his focus was on magnesium, zinc, and molybdenum, while his friend Andy studied sodium and potassium and their involvement in the sodium-potassium pump."},{"question":"How to register a gun<br>Look up your state's gun laws online before purchasing a gun.

Very sunburned","response":"To describe the sentiment of the tweet \\"Very sunburned,\\" one would have to analyze the tone, context, and possible emotions or feelings conveyed through the words. In this case, the tweet is quite concise, so there isn't much context given apart from the fact that the person is experiencing sunburn. This leaves the interpretation to be somewhat subjective. However, we can still break down the sentiment into a few possibilities based on common associations with sunburns: 1) Negative Sentiment: Sunburns are generally considered an unfavorable experience as they cause physical discomfort, redness, and peeling of the skin. Therefore, the sentiment of this tweet could be interpreted as negative due to the unpleasant nature of sunburns as well as potential regret or frustration from the person tweeting. They may be feeling unhappy and irritated, wishing that they had taken better care to protect their skin from the sun. 2) Neutral Sentiment: Alternatively, the tweet could be regarded as simply a statement of fact and not carry a strong emotional tone. In this interpretation, the person is just sharing their current situation – being \\"very sunburned\\" – without expressing any particular emotion. The intention of the tweet might have been to update their friends or followers, without necessarily conveying a specific sentiment. 3) Positive Sentiment: Lastly, there is a possibility that the sentiment of this tweet could be positive. In some cases, people associate sunburns with spending time outdoors, engaging in fun activities, vacationing, or simply soaking up the sun, which are generally pleasant experiences. If the person tweeting is focusing on the positive aspects of the situation that led to the sunburn, the sentiment could lean more towards positivity. For instance, they might be sunburned after a fun day at the beach, but the memories and enjoyment of that day outweigh the temporary discomfort of the sunburn. In conclusion, the sentiment of the tweet \\"Very sunburned\\" could be interpreted as negative, neutral, or positive, depending on the context and how the reader perceives the emotions involved in the statement. Although sunburns typically bring unpleasant side effects, the context around the sunburn may lead individuals to interpret the sentiment differently."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given a multiple-choice question and you have to pick the correct option.

Stream of consciousness reasoning: When thinking about the history of newspapers in various languages, it is important to consider the influence of different factors such as culture, education, and the development of printing technologies. With respect to the Malayalam language, which is predominantly spoken in the Indian state of Kerala, there are many milestones in the evolution of its written press. Among these milestones, it is worth looking into the beginning of print media in this language to identify the first Malayalam newspaper ever published. While researching the beginnings of Malayalam newspapers, it becomes clear that there was a significant period in the early to mid-19th century when print media in different Indian languages began to flourish. The socio-cultural and political changes in India and, more specifically, in the state of Kerala, created a demand for newspapers that would cater to the native speakers of the Malayalam language. It is during this time that the earliest known Malayalam newspaper was published. Inspired by the growing newspaper culture in other parts of India, a man named Hermann Gundert contributed to the production and publishing of this newspaper. He was a German missionary and scholar, known for his work in the linguistics and literature of the Malayalam language. His dedication to promoting education and imparting knowledge in the Malayalam-speaking regions of India highlights his potential role in creating the first newspaper in Malayalam. Upon investigating further, the first Malayalam newspaper is found to be named \\"Rajyasamacharam.\\" It was published in 1847, and it marked the beginning of a new era for journalism in the Malayalam language. The newspaper was started by Hermann Gundert, who played a pivotal role in its inception and the propagation of the written word in the Malayalam language. Therefore, it is right to say that Rajyasamacharam was the first Malayalam newspaper to be published, sparking progress and development in the realm of print media for the Malayalam-speaking population of India."},{"question":"Dana Antal scored a tiebreaking goal early in the third period and Canada held on for a 2-1 victory over the United State in the championship game of the Four Nations Cup international women #39;s hockey tournament.

The use of a catalyst involves intermediate reactions which have lower activation complexes than the original reaction. On a simplified reaction energy diagram, this can be thought of as lowering the activation energy for a given transformation. If the activation energy of a reaction is decreased, more collisions will have enough energy to overcome this lower barrier, so the reactant-to-product transformation will occur more frequently. As a result, the overall reaction rate will be higher than for an identical reaction with a larger activation energy barrier. Now, I have a new situation: A chemist is working in the lab with two beakers, beaker R and beaker T, filled with identical solutions. In her experiment, she is going to pour one liquid into beaker R and the same amount of a different liquid into beaker T. After pouring the liquid into beaker R, there is no noticeable change. Pouring the liquid into beaker T, she observes a change in the liquid. Answer this question please: Which beaker had a reactant poured into it? A:","response":"Beaker T had a reactant poured into it.

Article:","response":"Title: Four Injured as Cross-Channel Ferry Collides with Harbour Wall Our maritime safety is once again under scrutiny, following an unfortunate incident in which a cross-channel ferry departing from Dover, England, destined for France, struck a harbour wall leading to four people being injured. The accident transpired under conditions yet to be explicated, throwing light on the necessity for advanced safety measures on board such large sea vessels. Precision in navigation and immediate attention to potential risks are among the fundamental requirements in such sea-bound travels. The ferry, bustling with passengers eager for their trans-channel journey, was jolted severely when it collided with the harbour wall during its departure from Dover. The immediate aftermath of the impact was a scene of shock and panic, as the unexpected encounter left four individuals injured. The severity of their injuries is not known at this time. Individuals present on the scene reported the loud noise of contact, followed by swift action by the crew members on board. The crew, trained for such exigencies, immediately started evacuating the area and administering first aid to the injured passengers. Yet, the incident raises questions about the preparedness and proficiency of the crew in handling the navigation of the vessel itself. Authorities were quickly alerted and arrived at the scene in a short span of time. They then commenced a detailed investigation into the incident. As part of the process, they will seek to determine the cause of the accident and whether it could have been averted. The focus will likely be on examining the navigation systems of the ferry, the weather conditions at time of departure, and the state of the harbour infrastructure that was hit. Meanwhile, the impacted ferry service has been temporarily halted to ensure the safety of future passengers. While this isn't the first incident involving a ferry in recent times, it reiterates the importance of stringent checks and precautionary measures. Questions will be asked, and deservedly so, regarding the effectiveness of existing safety protocols, and whether there was an error in navigation or judgement aboard the ferry. It's the right moment for the responsible authorities to review their safety norms and ensure flaws, if any, are addressed without delay. In the wake of the unfortunate event, our thoughts are with the injured, and we hope for their speedy recovery. Furthermore, it's a stark reminder that the safety of passengers should always remain as the paramount concern for all associated with ferry services. This cross-channel incident will undoubtedly cast a further spotlight on ferry safety and compel improvements where necessary. Rest assured that as these investigations unfold, we will be sure to provide updates, casting aside any shadows of doubt, and ensuring such incidents are kept at bay in the future. [End of Article] In writing this article, I complied with standard journalistic practices by confirming the facts set out in the summary while making some logical inferences related to the potential causes and implications of the incident. I also tried to provide a comprehensive view of the situation, incorporating possible outcomes of the investigations and steps that may be undertaken to prevent future occurrences."},{"question":"Definition: In this task, you are given a sentence in Persian, and your task is to translate it into English.

The Judiciary is often tasked with ensuring equal justice under law. - The Governor of California is the chief executive of the California state government, commander-in-chief of the California National Guard and the California State Military Reserve, whose responsibilities also include making annual State of the State addresses to the California State Legislature, submitting the budget, and ensuring that state laws are enforced.

The term is used to contrast with offices at state level, which are referred to as the central government, national government, or (where appropriate) federal government and also to supranational government which deals with governing institutions between states. Local governments generally act within powers delegated to them by legislation or directives of the higher level of government. In federal states, local government generally comprises the third (or sometimes fourth) tier of government, whereas in unitary states, local government usually occupies the second or third tier of government, often with greater powers than higher-level administrative divisions. - Representative democracy (also indirect democracy, representative republic, or psephocracy) is a type of democracy founded on the principle of elected officials representing a group of people, as opposed to direct democracy.

On the Jets' next play from scrimmage, Chad Pennington was intercepted by Artrell Hawkins. Two plays later, Tom Brady found Doug Gabriel open downfield for a long first down, but Victor Hobson forced a fumble and Kerry Rhodes recovered. The Jets followed with a time-consuming 16-play, 9:12 drive, capped off by a two-yard Kevan Barlow touchdown run for a 7-3 Jets lead. New England battled downfield, converting a 4th-and-1 from their own 44 with a run to fullback Heath Evans, and on the first play after the two-minute warning, Brady appeared to be intercepted by Drew Coleman, who ran the ball back 35 yards. But, the play was negated on a controversial roughing-the-passer call on Hobson, who dove at Brady as he was releasing the ball, but drove him into the ground, prompting the flag. The Patriots then converted on a 4th-and-3 from the Jets' 24, but settled for a 21-yard field goal from Gostkowski with four seconds left. Justin Miller ran back the opening kickoff of the second half 62 yards, and the drive ended with Pennington lining up in the shotgun on 4th-and-5 from the Patriots' 33, only to punt the ball to the New England 4. After a Patriots punt, Pennington led the Jets on another long drive, this one 15 plays and only 45 yards, but it ate 6:40 off the clock and resulted in Nugent's 34-yard field goal. Midway through the fourth quarter, Brady was intercepted by Erik Coleman, and Pennington tossed a 22-yard touchdown pass to Jerricho Cotchery, barely keeping his feet inbounds, although the play was never challenged. The Jets led 17-6 with 4:51 to go. However, operating out of a no-huddle offense, Brady led the Patriots 61 yards in 31 seconds, capped by a 15-yard touchdown pass to Reche Caldwell, and Brady found Caldwell again on the two-point conversion to narrow the lead to 17-14. But the next drive was critical, as the Jets forced New England to use all three timeouts, punting with 1:15 to go. New England took over at their own 11-yard line and moved the ball to the Jets' 46-yard line. On the final play of the game, Brady was sacked by Shaun Ellis.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","response":"A hurricane usually starts as an organized thunderstorm activity that stretches at least 100 miles across and maintains its identity for more than 24 hours. This initial stage is critical for the formation of a tropical cyclone, as it provides the necessary energy and moisture for the system to develop further. Warm ocean waters, typically above 80°F (27°C), and a suitable atmospheric environment, with low vertical wind shear, are the key ingredients for the development of these storms. Under the right conditions, the organized thunderstorm activity can develop further and start to spin around a low-pressure center. This rotation, which is caused by the Coriolis effect, is vital for the cyclone's organization and intensification. At this stage, the system is classified as a \\"tropical cyclone\\" or \\"tropical depression,\\" depending on its wind speeds and structure. If the system strengthens and wind speeds rise past 39 mph (63 km/h), the cyclone is dubbed a \\"tropical storm.\\" Tropical storms are given names to facilitate communication and warnings, as they can pose significant threats to life and property. The central pressure in the storm continues to drop, and the system organizes further, with a more pronounced rotation. Should the pressure in the center drops even further and the winds really pick up, the storm may eventually form a clearly defined \\"eye.\\" At this point, with wind speeds reaching at least 74 mph (119 km/h), the tropical storm becomes a hurricane. The hurricane's intensity can be ranked on the Saffir-Simpson scale, which ranges from category 1 (weakest) to category 5 (most powerful). Now, regarding the supposition that hunting happens during the hurricane formation process, it should be determined whether it would affect less powerful hurricanes directly, indirectly, or not impact any step of the process. The supposed perturbation in this context would most likely be indirectly impacting a step of the process. This is because hunting activities do not have a direct impact on hurricane formation or intensification. However, the indirect impacts could stem from the potential changes in the ecological systems and landscape that result from hunting. These changes may alter factors such as vegetation, which can influence evapotranspiration rates, soil moisture levels, and ultimately, the local climate. Changes in the local climate, on a large scale, could potentially influence atmospheric conditions that are necessary for the formation and intensification of hurricanes. It's important to note, however, that this indirect impact would likely be very minimal given the multitude of factors involved in hurricane formation. Hunting may play a negligible role in the overall process, and other natural and anthropogenic factors, such as global climate change, will likely have a more significant impact on hurricane formation, intensity, and frequency."},{"question":"Title: Awesome Power of God Product review: The first time I heard Selah was on the radio, with \\"You Raise Me Up.\\" I thought, WOW, that was so powerful.

The book was published in 1870 and remains a highly influential work within the genre of science fiction. The Nautilus is an iconic vessel, designed with advanced technology and engineering far ahead of its time. The submarine's name is derived from the Latin word 'nautilus', which means 'sailor' and is also the name given to be a type of marine mollusk known for its spiral shell. The Nautilus was described as a long, spindle-shaped vessel with a cylindrical hull made of steel plates, capable of withstanding significant water pressure at great depths. Captain Nemo, the enigmatic and reclusive commander of the Nautilus, is a brilliant inventor and engineer. He is portrayed as a man driven by his desire for vengeance against the injustices that compelled him to renounce society and live under the sea. The true identity of Captain Nemo is gradually revealed through the story — his name is actually Prince Dakkar, a descendant of Indian royalty and a polymath who possesses vast knowledge in various areas of science, literature, and art. The novel tells the story of French marine biologist Professor Pierre Aronnax, his servant Conseil, and Canadian whaler Ned Land, who find themselves aboard the Nautilus after their ship is attacked by an unknown creature, which turns out to be the submarine itself. Throughout their adventures, the trio discovers the wonders and dangers of the underwater world, while Captain Nemo reveals the capabilities and secrets of the Nautilus. The Nautilus is powered by electricity generated from sodium-mercury batteries, a concept quite revolutionary for the time the novel was written. The electric energy serves multiple purposes, including providing light, propulsion, and weapons such as the electric \\"shock\\" that the Nautilus uses to disable other vessels. The submarine is also equipped with diving suits that allow the crew to explore the ocean floor and collect valuable resources. In addition, the Nautilus features a luxurious interior, complete with a library, a salon with an extensive art collection, and even an organ that Captain Nemo plays. \\"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea\\" explores themes of adventure, technology, and the human desire for knowledge while raising concerns about the consequences of isolating oneself from society. The novel's innovative and captivating portrayal of the underwater world and advanced technology have made both the Nautilus and Captain Nemo enduring symbols in the realm of science fiction."},{"question":"Consider the question.

A. Tittle, was a professional American football quarterback. He played in the National Football League (NFL) for the San Francisco 49ers, New York Giants, and Baltimore Colts, after spending two seasons with the Colts in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC). Known for his competitiveness, leadership, and striking profile, Tittle was the centerpiece of several prolific offenses throughout his seventeen-year professional career from 1948 to 1964. Tittle played college football for Louisiana State University, where he was a two-time All-Southeastern Conference (SEC) quarterback for the LSU Tigers football team. A photo of a dazed Tittle in the end zone taken by Morris Berman of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette on September 20, 1964, is regarded among the most iconic images in the history of American sports and journalism. Tittle, in his 17th and final season, was photographed helmet-less, bloodied and kneeling immediately after having been knocked to the ground by John Baker of the Pittsburgh Steelers and throwing an interception that was returned for a touchdown at the old Pitt Stadium. He suffered a concussion and cracked sternum on the play, but went on to play the rest of the season. Post-Gazette editors declined to publish the photo, looking for \\"action shots\\" instead, but Berman entered the image into contests where it took on a life of its own, winning a National Headliner Award. The photo was published in the October 2, 1964, issue of Life magazine. It is regarded as having changed the way that photographers look at sports, having shown the power of capturing a moment of reaction. It became one of three photos to hang in the lobby of the National Press Photographers Association headquarters, alongside Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima and the Hindenburg disaster. A copy now hangs in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. After at first having failed to see the appeal of the image, Tittle eventually grew to embrace it, putting it on the back cover of his 2009 autobiography. \\"That was the end of the road,\\" he told the Los Angeles Times in 2008. \\"It was the end of my dream. It was over.\\" Pittsburgh player John Baker, who hit Tittle right before the picture was taken, ran for sheriff in his native Wake County, North Carolina in 1978, and used the photo as a campaign tool. He was elected and went on to serve for 24 years. Tittle also held a fundraiser to assist Baker in his bid for a fourth term in 1989. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: What was the famous photo about?","response":"The famous photo was about Y.A.

How to create a strong burning charcoal fire without lighter fluid Know that inexpensive chimney starters are the easiest way to get a strong fire every time.

Any more fuel and sparks will let in too much fire.; IV. Load the bottom of the chimney starter with lightly balled newspaper. Between 2 and 4 pieces of paper, depending on the size of the starter, should do.; Answer:","response":"IV. Load the bottom of the chimney starter with lightly balled newspaper. Between 2 and 4 pieces of paper, depending on the size of the starter, should do. Using a chimney starter without lighter fluid is not only environmentally friendly, but it also helps avoid any unwanted chemical taste in your grilled food. To create a strong burning charcoal fire using a chimney starter, follow these detailed steps: 1. Choose the appropriate fuel: Select high-quality charcoal briquets or hardwood lump charcoal for better heat and flavor. Hardwood lump charcoal tends to burn hotter and purer, while briquets offer a more consistent and longer-lasting burn. 2. Prepare the chimney starter: Place the chimney starter on a stable, heat-proof surface near your grill. Ensure that the handle is cool to touch and that it's in the locked position before proceeding. 3. Load the newspaper: Crumple 2 to 4 pieces of newspaper, depending on the size of your chimney starter, and place them at the bottom of the chimney. Make sure they are loosely balled, allowing for proper airflow. 4. Fill the chimney starter: Pour charcoal briquets or hardwood lump charcoal into the top of the chimney until it is full, ensuring that the briquets or lumps are evenly distributed. 5. Ignite the newspaper: Use a long match or lighter to ignite the newspaper through the holes at the bottom of the chimney starter. The flames will rise through the chimney, igniting the charcoal above. 6. Ensure proper airflow: To achieve a strong burning fire, it is essential to allow sufficient airflow through the chimney starter. Avoid blocking the vent holes at the bottom and top of the chimney. Proper ventilation will enable faster ignition and even heating of the charcoal. 7. Wait for the charcoal to heat: Once the newspaper is lit and the fire catches, allow the charcoal to heat up for about 15-20 minutes. When the charcoal becomes white and ashy on the surface, it's ready for use. 8. Safely dump the coals into the grill: Using heat-resistant gloves, securely grasp the handle of the chimney starter and slowly pour the hot charcoal into your grill. Distribute the coals as needed, creating either a direct or indirect heat source for your cooking. 9. Grill your food: Place the cooking grate over the hot coals and allow it to heat up for a few minutes. Then, place your food on the grate and enjoy grilling without the use of lighter fluid. By following these steps, you will have yourself a strong, clean-burning, and flavorful charcoal fire that rivals even the most experienced grill masters. Happy grilling!"},{"question":"Premise: Instead of going to London, however, the Sinn F??in members set up Dail ?‰ireann in Dublin and sparked the War of Independence. Hypothesis: The war of Independence was sparked by the members. Does the premise entail the hypothesis? (A). yes (B). it is not possible to tell (C). no","response":"(A). Yes The premise does entail the hypothesis. In the given premise, it is stated that the Sinn Féin members, instead of going to London, decided to establish Dáil Éireann in Dublin, which in turn sparked the War of Independence. The act of setting up Dáil Éireann by the Sinn Féin members directly contributed to the initiation of the conflict, thereby making them responsible for sparking the War of Independence. To understand this further, it is important to delve into the historical context and explore the events leading up to the establishment of Dáil Éireann and the subsequent War of Independence. The 1918 general election in Ireland was a turning point in the country's political landscape. The previous dominance of the Irish Parliamentary Party, which sought Home Rule within the United Kingdom, was challenged by the rise of a more radical and nationalist party - Sinn Féin. This party aimed to achieve complete independence from Britain and establish an Irish Republic. Sinn Féin emerged victorious in the 1918 election, capturing 73 out of 105 seats, mostly at the expense of the moderate Irish Parliamentary Party. However, instead of taking their seats in the British Parliament in London as expected, Sinn Féin refused to do so. They rejected the idea of being part of the British system and desired to create their own republican government. On the 21st of January 1919, the elected members of Sinn Féin established Dáil Éireann (Assembly of Ireland) in Dublin as an independent Irish parliament. This act of defiance and declaration of independence was a direct challenge to British rule in Ireland. It marked a shift from the pursuit of Home Rule within the United Kingdom to a complete break from British governance, which eventually led to the War of Independence. The War of Independence, also known as the Anglo-Irish War, took place between 1919 and 1921. It was a guerrilla war waged by the Irish Republican Army (IRA) against the British government and its forces in Ireland. The war was characterized by violence, assassinations, and attacks on police barracks, government buildings, and other symbols of British authority. The conflict ultimately led to the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty on December 6, 1921, which established the Irish Free State as a dominion within the British Commonwealth. However, the treaty also sparked the Irish Civil War (1922-1923) between those who supported the agreement and those who opposed it due to the partition of Ireland and allegiance to the British Crown. In conclusion, the premise entails the hypothesis as it is explicitly mentioned that the Sinn Féin members' actions in establishing Dáil Éireann in Dublin sparked the War of Independence. This act was a direct challenge to British authority in Ireland and marked the beginning of the violent and tumultuous path towards Irish independence."},{"question":"Produce a long descriptive sentence that uses all these words: Abner W.

Set in the 1940s, the film stars Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne, a mild-mannered banker who is wrongfully convicted of murder, and Morgan Freeman as Ellis \\"Red\\" Redding, a seasoned inmate who befriends Andy during his time at Shawshank State Penitentiary. Step 1: Briefly outline the plot The story revolves around Andy's life in prison, as he uses his intelligence and knowledge to help fellow inmates with their problems and combat the institutional corruption at Shawshank. Throughout his two decades at the prison, Andy maintains his innocence, while forming a strong bond with Red, who becomes the narrator of their story. Step 2: Analyze the performances Tim Robbins gives a nuanced and powerful performance as Andy, showing the character's deep sense of resilience and determination in the face of his wrongful imprisonment. Morgan Freeman effortlessly slips into the role of Red, bringing his trademark calm and wisdom to the character while narrating the story with an air of melancholy reflection. Step 3: Discuss the direction and cinematography Frank Darabont's careful direction presents the bleak environment of the prison in sharp contrast to the strong sense of hope that permeates the story. The cinematographer, Roger Deakins, masterfully captures the oppressive atmosphere of Shawshank with a gloomy yet beautiful visual palette, adding a sense of depth and realism to the film's setting. Step 4: Talk about the themes and messages The Shawshank Redemption's overarching theme of hope and the idea that the human spirit can rise above even the most oppressive circumstances is beautifully told through its characters and their interactions. Red's redemption arc, exploring the possibility of change and atonement, is a poignant counterpoint to Andy's tale of resilience and determination. Step 5: Give your overall impression In conclusion, The Shawshank Redemption is a timeless masterpiece that showcases brilliant performances, exceptional storytelling, and powerful themes.

The glaciers feeding the lake melted away and the lake evaporated. Fossils tell an obscure story of man's slow and sporadic development. Around 3000 b.c. , native Archaic Indians began to develop a lasting hunting and gathering culture. By this time, the valley was in much the same geographic state as it exists in today, with one exception — the presence of artesian springs that bubbled to the surface in several areas. These springs fed a network of streams draining through the Las Vegas Wash to the Colorado River. The areas surrounding the springs were desert oases: sprawling collections of grasses, trees, and wildlife. Many springs lay in areas that would eventually become the center of the modern Las Vegas metropolis. For about 4000 years, the Archaics thrived in a culture that included many signs of early civilization. Signs of even more advancement appeared halfway through the first millennium a.d. , when the Anasazi Indians inhabited the valley. Far more progressive than the Archaics, the Anasazi utilized such formal agricultural techniques as irrigation to assist their harvest. This permitted the Anasazi to achieve a benchmark of advanced society — the ability to live in permanent shelters year-round without need to follow wildlife. Mysteriously, the Anasazi vanished from the valley around a.d. Question: \\"When did the Anasazi begin to inhabit the valley?\\" Answer: \\"23,000 b.c\\" Is this answer correct?","response":"No, the answer is not correct. The Anasazi Indians began to inhabit the Las Vegas Valley around the first millennium A.D., not 23,000 B.C."},{"question":"I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

But just when the story of his career breaks, the world comes chasing it too. With an oil tycoon, heads of state and hungry journalists descending upon the frigid outpost to get their moment in the midnight sun, the one person who occupies Adam the most is Rachel Kramer. Not only is she an outspoken environmentalist, she also happens to be his ex-girlfriend.With time running out, Rachel, Adam and Nathan, an 11-year-old native Alaskan boy who learns to connect with his people and his culture, must rally an unlikely coalition of locals, oil companies and Russian and American military to set aside their differences and unite for a purpose they all believe in: freeing the whales in record time. As the Alaskans frantically try to dig miles of holes on one side of the ice and a Soviet icebreaker pushes inland on the other, they must perform the virtually impossible to bridge a four-mile gap. And if they miraculously succeed, the trapped whales will be freed to the safety of open sea to begin their 5,000-mile annual migration.As the worlds attention turns to the top of the globe for two weeks, saving these endangered animals becomes a shared cause for nations entrenched against one another and leads to an unexpected, momentary thaw in the Cold War.

On 21 December 1988, N739PA, the aircraft operating the transatlantic leg of the route, was destroyed by a bomb, killing all 243 passengers and 16 crew, in what became known as the Lockerbie bombing. Large sections of the aircraft crashed onto residential areas of Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 11 more people on the ground. Following a three-year joint investigation by Dumfries and Galloway Constabulary and the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), arrest warrants were issued for two Libyan nationals in November 1991. In 1999, Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi handed over the two men for trial at Camp Zeist, Netherlands after protracted negotiations and UN sanctions. In 2001, Libyan intelligence officer Abdelbaset al-Megrahi was jailed for life after being found guilty of 270 counts of murder in connection with the bombing. In August 2009, he was released by the Scottish government on compassionate grounds after being diagnosed with prostate cancer. He died in May 2012, the only person to be convicted for the attack. He had continually asserted his innocence. - Lockerbie is a town in Dumfries and Galloway, south-western Scotland. It lies approximately from Glasgow, and from the English border.

The village grew up on the south bank of an important crossing of the River Earn, whose sandstone bridge existed from at least the early 14th century, when it is known to have been repaired by order of King Robert I of Scotland (13061329) (site: NO 133 185). Substantial remains of the medieval bridge (rendered redundant by a replacement, still in use, slightly upstream in 1821-22) survived into the 1970s, when almost all the stonework was demolished, for (allegedly) being in a dangerously ruinous condition. This ancient bridge was a major landmark on the road between Edinburgh (39 miles south) and Perth (4 miles north) for several centuries.

Title: Crack in the World Movie plot: An international consortium of scientists, operating as Project Inner Space in Tanganyika, Africa, is trying to tap into the Earth's geothermal energy by drilling a very deep hole down to the Earth's core. The scientists are foiled by an extremely dense layer of material at the boundary between the two. To penetrate the barrier and reach the magma below, they intend to detonate an atomic device at the bottom of the hole. The leader of the project, Dr. Stephen Sorenson (Dana Andrews), who is secretly dying of cancer, believes that the atomic device will burn its way through the barrier, but the project's chief geologist, Dr. Ted Rampion (Kieron Moore), is convinced that the lower layers of the crust have been weakened by decades of underground nuclear tests, and that the detonation could produce a massive crack that would threaten the very existence of Earth. The atomic device is used and Rampion's fears prove justified, as the crust of the Earth develops an enormous crack that progresses rapidly. Sorenson discovers that there was a huge reservoir of hydrogen underground, which turned the small conventional atomic explosion into a huge thermonuclear one that was millions of times more powerful. Another atomic device is used in the hope of stopping the crack, but it only reverses the crack's direction. Eventually the crack returns to its starting point at the test site, and a huge chunk of the planet outlined by the crack is expected to be thrown out into space. Sorenson remains at the underground control center to record the event despite pleas by his wife Maggie to evacuate with the rest of the project staff.

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"The book was widely translated in Darwin's lifetime, but problems arose with translating concepts and metaphors, and some translations were biased by the translator's own agenda. Darwin distributed presentation copies in France and Germany, hoping that suitable applicants would come forward, as translators were expected to make their own arrangements with a local publisher. He welcomed the distinguished elderly naturalist and geologist Heinrich Georg Bronn, but the German translation published in 1860 imposed Bronn's own ideas, adding controversial themes that Darwin had deliberately omitted. Bronn translated \\"favoured races\\" as \\"perfected races\\", and added essays on issues including the origin of life, as well as a final chapter on religious implications partly inspired by Bronn's adherence to Naturphilosophie. In 1862, Bronn produced a second edition based on the third English edition and Darwin's suggested additions, but then died of a heart attack. Darwin corresponded closely with Julius Victor Carus, who published an improved translation in 1867. Darwin's attempts to find a translator in France fell through, and the translation by Clémence Royer published in 1862 added an introduction praising Darwin's ideas as an alternative to religious revelation and promoting ideas anticipating social Darwinism and eugenics, as well as numerous explanatory notes giving her own answers to doubts that Darwin expressed. Darwin corresponded with Royer about a second edition published in 1866 and a third in 1870, but he had difficulty getting her to remove her notes and was troubled by these editions. He remained unsatisfied until a translation by Edmond Barbier was published in 1876. A Dutch translation by Tiberius Cornelis Winkler was published in 1860. By 1864, additional translations had appeared in Italian and Russian.

He is best known for his early studies on mental disorders, especially in children. His work was largely unnoticed during his lifetime except for a few accolades in Vienna, and his studies on psychological disorders only acquired world renown posthumously. He wrote over 300 publications, mostly concerning a condition he termed \\"autistic psychopathy\\" (AP). There was a resurgence of interest in his work beginning in the 1980s, and due to his earlier work on autism spectrum disorders, Asperger syndrome (AS), was named after him. Both Asperger's original paediatric diagnosis of AP and the eponymous diagnosis of AS that was named after him several decades later have been controversial. - The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), published by the American Psychiatric Association (APA), offers a common language and standard criteria for the classification of mental disorders. It is used, or relied upon, by clinicians, researchers, psychiatric drug regulation agencies, health insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies, the legal system, and policy makers together with alternatives such as the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD), produced by the World Health Organization (WHO). The DSM is now in its fifth edition, DSM-5, published on May 18, 2013. It evaluated the patient on five axes or dimensions rather than just one broad aspect of 'mental disorder'. These dimensions relate to biological, psychological, social and other aspects. The DSM evolved from systems for collecting census and psychiatric hospital statistics, and from a United States Army manual. Revisions since its first publication in 1952 have incrementally added to the total number of mental disorders, although also removing those no longer considered to be mental disorders. - ICD-10 is the 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD), a medical classification list by the World Health Organization (WHO). It contains codes for diseases, signs and symptoms, abnormal findings, complaints, social circumstances, and external causes of injury or diseases. - Asperger syndrome (AS), also known as Asperger's, is a developmental disorder characterized by significant difficulties in social interaction and nonverbal communication, along with restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior and interests. As a milder autism spectrum disorder (ASD), it differs from other ASDs by relatively normal language and intelligence. Although not required for diagnosis, physical clumsiness and unusual use of language are common. Signs usually begin before two years old and typically last for a person's entire life. The exact cause of Asperger's is unknown. While it is probably partly inherited, the underlying genetics have not been determined conclusively. Environmental factors are also believed to play a role. Brain imaging has not identified a common underlying problem. The diagnosis of Asperger's was removed in the 2013 fifth edition of the \\"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\\" (DSM-5), and people with these symptoms are now included within the autism spectrum disorder along with autism and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified. It remains within the tenth edition of the \\"International Classification of Diseases\\" (ICD-10) as of 2015. There is no single treatment, and the effectiveness of particular interventions is supported by only limited data. Treatment is aimed at improving poor communication skills, obsessive or repetitive routines, and physical clumsiness. Interventions may include social skills training, cognitive behavioral therapy, physical therapy, speech therapy, parent training, and medications for associated problems such as mood or anxiety. Most children improve as they grow up, but social and communication difficulties usually persist. Some researchers and people on the autism spectrum have advocated a shift in attitudes toward the view that autism spectrum disorder is a difference, rather than a disease that must be treated or cured. In 2013, Asperger's was estimated to affect 31 million people globally. The syndrome is named... - International Organization is a quarterly peer-reviewed academic journal that covers the entire field of international affairs.

Social rules and relations are created, communicated, and changed in verbal and nonverbal ways. The process of learning these skills is called socialization. For socialization, Interpersonal skills are essential to relate one another. Interpersonal skills are the interpersonal acts a person uses to interact with others which are related to dominance vs. submission, love vs. hate, affiliation vs. aggression, control vs. autonomy categories (Leary, 1957).

In broader definitions ADHD is included, and the term used is neurodevelopmental disorders. Yet others include antisocial behavior and schizophrenia that begins in childhood and continues through life. However, these two latter conditions are not as stable as the other developmental disorders, and there is not the same evidence of a shared genetic liability. - Berlin is the capital and the largest city of Germany as well as one of its constituent 16 states. With a population of approximately 3.5 million people, Berlin is the second most populous city proper and the seventh most populous urban area in the European Union. Located in northeastern Germany on the banks of rivers Spree and Havel, it is the centre of the Berlin-Brandenburg Metropolitan Region, which has about 6 million residents from more than 180 nations. Due to its location in the European Plain, Berlin is influenced by a temperate seasonal climate. Around one-third of the city's area is composed of forests, parks, gardens, rivers and lakes. - Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired social interaction, verbal and non-verbal communication, and restricted and repetitive behavior. Parents usually notice signs in the first two years of their child's life. These signs often develop gradually, though some children with autism reach their developmental milestones at a normal pace and then regress. The diagnostic criteria require that symptoms become apparent in early childhood, typically before age three. Autism is due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Some cases are strongly associated with certain infections during pregnancy including rubella and use of alcohol or cocaine. Controversies surround other proposed environmental causes; for example, the vaccine hypotheses, which have since been disproven. Autism affects information processing in the brain by altering how nerve cells and their synapses connect and organize; how this occurs is not well understood. In the DSM V, autism is included within the autism spectrum (ASDs), as is Asperger syndrome, which lacks delays in cognitive development and language, and pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified (commonly abbreviated as PDD-NOS), which was diagnosed when the full set of criteria for autism or Asperger syndrome were not met. Early speech or behavioral interventions can help children with autism gain self-care, social, and communication skills. Although there is no known cure, there have been reported cases of children who recovered. Not many children with autism live independently after reaching adulthood, though some become successful. An autistic culture has developed, with some individuals seeking a cure and others believing autism should be accepted as a difference and not treated as a disorder. Globally, autism is estimated to affect 21.7 million people as of 2013. As of 2010, the number of people affected is estimated at about 12 per 1,000 worldwide. It occurs four to five times more often in boys than girls.

In the United States the DSM serves as a universal authority for psychiatric diagnoses. Treatment recommendations, as well as payment by health care providers, are often determined by DSM classifications, so the appearance of a new version has significant practical importance. - Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC, , or OPEP in several other languages) is an intergovernmental organization of 13 nations, founded in 1960 in Baghdad by the first five members (Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela), and headquartered since 1965 in Vienna. As of 2015, the 13 countries accounted for an estimated 42 percent of global oil production and 73 percent of the world's \\"proven\\" oil reserves, giving OPEC a major influence on global oil prices that were previously determined by American-dominated multinational oil companies. - Hungary is a unitary parliamentary republic in Central Europe. It covers an area of , situated in the Carpathian Basin and bordered by Slovakia to the north, Romania to the east, Serbia to the south, Croatia to the southwest, Slovenia to the west, Austria to the northwest, and Ukraine to the northeast. With about 10 million inhabitants, Hungary is a medium-sized member state of the European Union. The official language is Hungarian, which is the most widely spoken Uralic language in the world. Hungary's capital and largest metropolis is Budapest, a significant economic hub, classified as an Alpha- global city. Major urban areas include Debrecen, Szeged, Miskolc, Pécs and Gyr. - Vienna is the capital and largest city of Austria and one of the nine states of Austria. Vienna is Austria's primary city, with a population of about 1.8 million (2.6 million within the metropolitan area, nearly one third of Austria's population), and its cultural, economic, and political centre. It is the 7th-largest city by population within city limits in the European Union. Until the beginning of the 20th century, it was the largest German-speaking city in the world, and before the splitting of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in World War I, the city had 2 million inhabitants. Today, it has the second largest number of German speakers after Berlin. Vienna is host to many major international organizations, including the United Nations and OPEC. The city is located in the eastern part of Austria and is close to the borders of the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary. These regions work together in a European Centrope border region. Along with nearby Bratislava, Vienna forms a metropolitan region with 3 million inhabitants. In 2001, the city centre was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. - The Czech Republic, also known by the short name Czechia, is a nation state in Central Europe bordered by Germany to the west, Austria to the south, Slovakia to the east and Poland to the northeast. The Czech Republic covers an area of with mostly temperate continental climate and oceanic climate. It is a unitary parliamentary republic, has 10.5 million inhabitants and the capital and largest city is Prague, with over 1.2 million residents. The Czech Republic includes the historical territories of Bohemia, Moravia, and Czech Silesia. - World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War, or the Great War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved.

Carmen never seems to stop thinking about work and tends to ignore him. Carmen asks Dale, her boss to allow her to investigate the disappearances of several tourists in the fictional Polish village of Alvania, the man killed at the beginning of the film. She also mentions that the luggage of all the missing tourists ends up being found all around rural parts of central Europe. Dale isn't interested in another missing persons case, saying that people go missing all the time and does not give her permission to go.

A North Korean soldier looks south from the North side at the truce village of Panmunjom, South Korea, July 22, 2015. SEOUL North Korea has erected a new, taller launch tower at its missile base, possibly in preparation for firing a long-range rocket to mark an important national anniversary in October, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported on Wednesday. The 67-metre (220-ft) tower will be able to accommodate the launch of a longer-range missile than the rocket test-fired in December 2012. That launch was widely considered successful in putting an object into space orbit, the Yonhap report said. North Korea is banned under U.N. Security Council resolutions from conducting tests that use ballistic missile technology but has defied international warnings and sanctions to pursue missile and nuclear programs. \\"Our assessment is that the North will use the newly upgraded Tongchang-ri (missile) launch pad to launch a long-range missile larger than Unha-3,\\" Yonhap quoted a South Korean government source as saying. Unha-3 refers to the long-range rocket fired in 2012 from the base near its west coast. The launch is likely to come around the 70th anniversary of the founding of the North's ruling Workers' Party on Oct. 10, the source was quoted as saying. South Korea's Defense Ministry could not immediately confirm the report but an official said they were seeking to verify it. North Korea is believed to be developing an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) but is seen as years away from deployment. It is also working to miniaturize a nuclear warhead to mount on a delivery vehicle. (Reporting by Jack Kim; Editing by Paul Tait) ||||| SEOUL, July 22 (UPI) -- North Korea has built an extension to a rocket-launching platform near the China border in what Seoul said is preparation for a rocket launch ahead of a major anniversary. Construction began in late 2013 on a preexisting 50-meter launch pad at Sohae Satellite Launching Station in Tongchang-ri, North Pyongan Province, and the work of adding 17 meters to the site is near completion, an unidentified Seoul official told Yonhap on Wednesday. The purpose of the extension is to launch missiles twice the size of the Unha-3, according to South Korean news outlet Daily NK. The Unha-3 is an expandable carrier rocket that was launched in 2012 and fell into the Yellow Sea. The debris of a second stage launch fell into the Philippine Sea after an object had entered orbit. Another Seoul government source said intelligence indicated North Korea was producing long-distance rockets in a Pyongyang munitions factory and that South Korea had credible information Kim Jong Un had ordered the launch of a \\"satellite\\" to mark the 70th anniversary of the Workers' Party of North Korea. Activities at Pyongyang Mirim Airport showed preparations for a large-scale military inspection by Kim Jong Un. Scud missiles, 240-mm rocket launchers, artillery, armored vehicles and transportation equipment had been assembled. South Korea expects any launch around the Oct. 10 anniversary would be used as a provocation against Seoul. \\"We are closely watching the construction in Tongchang-ri,\\" South Korean Defense Minister Kim Min-seok told Yonhap. North Korea insists the site, which has audio, video and data connections to Pyongyang's control centers is for a \\"peaceful satellite launch.\\" ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","response":"North Korea has constructed a new, taller launch tower at its missile base, possibly in preparation for firing a long-range rocket to mark an important national anniversary in October.

Her friend Fay sealed up her home and spent most of her time indoors. Both friends lived in an area with moderate to high levels of air pollution and attended a seminar where they learned more about the impact of air pollution on human health. Which friend was exposed to less outdoor pollution? Hint: Recall that air pollution is due to chemical substances and particles released into the air mainly by human actions. When most people think of air pollution, they think of the pollution outdoors. But it is just as easy to have indoor air pollution. Your home or school classroom probably doesn't get much fresh air. Sealing up your home reduces heating and cooling costs. But this also causes air pollution to stay trapped indoors. And people today usually spend a majority of their time indoors. So exposure to indoor air pollution can become a significant health risk. Answer:","response":"The friend who was exposed to less outdoor pollution is Fay. This statement is derived from the information provided that indicated Patty spent most of her time outdoors, where there are moderate to high levels of outdoor air pollution. Despite the fact that Fay also lived in the same polluted area, she spent most of her time indoors, which directly reduces her exposure to outdoor air pollution. However, it's important to highlight that the question specifies \\"outdoor pollution\\". While Fay may have less exposure to outdoor pollution, she could have a higher risk of indoor air pollution since she has sealed up her home causing pollutants to stay trapped inside.

And I was wondering What does Sasha need to do before this? Answer:","response":"Before starting college in the middle of the year, Sasha would need to: 1. Research and identify potential colleges: Sasha should explore various colleges that offer mid-year entry and determine which ones are most suitable based on factors like location, course offerings, and campus environment. 2. Complete the application process: Sasha would need to gather the necessary documents, such as transcripts and personal statements, and submit applications to the selected colleges. This step may also include interviewing, depending on the colleges' admission requirements. 3. Secure financial aid or scholarships: To help cover the costs of tuition and other expenses, Sasha should explore financial aid options and apply for scholarships offered by the colleges, private institutions, or government agencies. Additionally, filling out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is a crucial step, as it can make Sasha eligible for federal financial aid. 4. Receive acceptance from a college: Once Sasha's applications have been reviewed and considered, they would wait for an acceptance letter from a college. This step may include being put on a waiting list or being granted a conditional offer, depending on the college and their policies. 5. Prepare for the move (if necessary): If Sasha needs to relocate for college, they must arrange for housing, either on-campus or off-campus, and plan their travel itinerary. Packing and making necessary preparations for the transition is also important. 6. Attend any necessary orientation or enrollment events: Before starting classes, Sasha should attend orientation or welcome events for mid-year students, which would provide essential information about campus life, academic expectations, and other resources available for students. 7. Register for classes: Sasha would need to select the courses they want to take and register for them, taking into consideration the requirements of their desired major or program. 8.

The stone we had was smoother than the other rock, so the","response":"decision was made to use it for our art project. Choosing the right materials is crucial in art projects, ensuring not just the overall visual appeal but also the longevity of the finished product. Art is a celebration of creativity and expression, and the stone, at first glance merely a piece of nature, was significant beyond its physical attributes. Its smoothness was desirable not just for aesthetic reasons, but due to practical considerations. A smoother stone would potentially make for an easier and more uniform painting surface, offering a seamless space for color to lay upon, compared to a rougher rock, which might soak up paint inconsistently and result in a less eye-pleasing image. A smoother stone is also more comfortable for hand-holding, which would be of import if the project was to create a touchable piece of art, like a worry stone or a talisman. Furthermore, a smoother stone can better reflect light, adding depth and dimension to the artwork, which a rougher surface wouldn't achieve to the same extent. Beyond these practical considerations, choosing the smoother stone could also symbolize the importance of process and effort in creating. Stones, in their rawest forms, are rarely smooth. They become so through the process of erosion, where the elements endlessly act upon them, wearing down their rough edges bit by bit. Understanding and appreciating this, the choice of the smoother stone might represent an admiration for the result of time and effort. However, it's not just about the stone. The decision to use it in an art project says a lot about the creator as well. It indicates the ability to find beauty and utility in ordinary, often overlooked objects. It also reveals an open-minded approach to material usage, not being confined to traditional art supplies. Finally, in considering the environment, using a natural item like the stone reduces the dependency on synthetic art materials, leading to a smaller carbon footprint and promoting a more sustainable worldview. This symbolism can further deepen the art project's meaning depending upon what is made of it. In conclusion, despite appearing as a small decision, choosing to use the smoother stone for the art project is a significant decision that a myriad of factors can influence. Its smoothness offers practical advantages in terms of working and handling it, and the broader symbolism could profoundly contribute to the project's meaning."},{"question":"Read the bio below and try to give details on bill lawrence -lrb- news personality -rrb- 's: - death place - alt - years active - caption - birth name - death date - spouse - children - birth date - name - image size - nationality - image - birth place - occupation Bio: william h. \`\` bill '' lawrence -lrb- january 29 , 1916 -- march 2 , 1972 -rrb- was an american journalist and television news personality whose 40-year career as a reporter began in 1932 and included a 20-year stint -lrb- 1941 -- 61 -rrb- with \`\` the new york times '' , for which he reported from major fronts of world war ii , korean war and , subsequently , as the newspaper 's white house correspondent . in 1961 he joined abc news where , for nearly 11 years , he served as the network 's political affairs editor and , during his first year , as an evening news anchorman . the recipient of a 1965 peabody award , he was posthumously honored with the trustees award at the 1972 emmy awards .

(KTVI) – A New York college student found himself stranded in St. Louis, Monday after being kicked off a Southwest Airlines flight that wasn’t even supposed to land here. The conflict raises a classic first amendment debate of free speech, versus vulgar language. Update: Man kicked off St. Louis flight for shirt now selling offensive shirts Daniel Podolsky was on a flight from Dallas to Chicago, and only set foot in Lambert Airport because of bad weather in the Windy City. But the college kid apparently forgot a couple of lessons from kindergarten about bad words, and playing well with others. At issue: his t-shirt. The garment, promoting the Comedy Central show “Broad City,” says in bold letters, “Broad F------ City,” but the “F-word” is fully spelled out. It was one of hundreds handed out by the comedy channel at the South By Southwest festival Podolsky had just left. He says his jacket was hiding the shirt when he walked around for all to see, but when he got on the plane, it was tight quarters and he took the jacket off. His flight made the unscheduled stop in St. Louis and he got off to use the restroom. That, he says, is when a Southwest gate agent noticed the shirt and said he would need to remove it. “It’s only when I got back on the plane when it was gonna take off, ya know, you have this much space, you’re gonna take your jacket off because it’s hot,” he explained. “I took my jacket off, so he sent someone to remove me from the flight.” We asked him if he was given an opportunity to remedy the situation. “Did they give you any opportunity to put your jacket back on, to change the shirt, to put it inside out?” we asked. Podolsky’s response: “It just happened so fast. Within thirty seconds the flight was gone. I mean I would have gladly done so.” But the video of the confrontation on the plane that Podolsky provided FOX 2 tells a slightly different tale. Saying he “would have gladly done so,” is clearly not the case. “They talked to you about your shirt?” the airline employee is seen asking him at the door of the aircraft. Podolsky responds, “They did.” Then the employee proceeds to provide him with several chances to keep his seat on the flight. (Worker) ”Can you change the shirt?” (Podolsky) ”Nope.” (Worker) “Can you put the jacket on and leave it on through the flight?” (Podolsky) (Inaudible) (Worker) “Can you put the shirt on inside out?” (Podolsky) “Nope.” (Worker) “Is there anything you can do not to display the shirt because at this point we can’t allow you to go.” (Podolsky) “I have freedom of speech.” (Worker) “I know you do…” (Podolsky) “Really it’s not bothering anyone.” (Worker) “I can show you in our contract of carriage that you can’t wear any shirts that says offensive…” (Podolsky) “Can we take a poll?” There would be no poll and he would be asked to leave the plane. He confronted the original gate agent as he left, and he says airport police escorted him from the terminal. He then contacted FOX 2. We asked him why he wore the shirt to begin with, considering the likelihood it would offend someone he encountered along his journey. “Well, is it really in the airline’s position to make that call?” he asked, “especially when the only time you can see the shirt I’m in my little box of space. “There are more than a hundred people on the plane trying to get to Chicago and the most important thing is my shirt? How does that work? Where’s the sense of priority?” Southwest Airlines backed the actions of their crew in a statement sent to us late Monday. “We rely on our Employees and Customers to use common sense and good judgment,” spokesman Dan Landson said. As for Podolsky, he was eventually allowed to board a 7:15pm Southwest flight to his final destination of New York. The agreement was reached after he changed his shirt. ||||| Yesterday, we learned that the First Amendment does not guarantee one the right to play baseball. Today we have more devastating news: The same amendment that doesn't guarantee you to have your opinions go uncriticized does not allow a dude to wear a vulgar shirt on a plane just because he might know how to say \\"uh, free speech\\" in the snottiest tone possible. Hip New Yorker Daniel Podolsky was stranded in a St. Louis airport when the crew of his Southwest flight took objection to his promotional Broad City t-shirt. The shirt, handed to Podolsky at SXSW, has the word \\"FUCKING\\" printed prominently on its center. While no one had any problem with it on the first leg of Podolsky's trip (Dallas to Chicago; people in Dallas are cool, man), some difficulties arose when his plane had to stop in St. Louis due to weather conditions in \\"The Windy City.\\" Fox 2 has a report of what happened when Podolsky got off the plane to use the bathroom and was spotted by a gate agent at the prudish Lambert airport: Advertisement \\"It's only when I got back on the plane when it was gonna take off, ya know, you have this much space, you're gonna take your jacket off because it's hot,\\" he explained. \\"I took my jacket off, so he sent someone to remove me from the flight.\\" We asked him if he was given an opportunity to remedy the situation. \\"Did they give you any opportunity to put your jacket back on, to change the shirt, to put it inside out?\\" we asked. Podolsky's response: \\"It just happened so fast. Within thirty seconds the flight was gone. I mean I would have gladly done so.\\" Except here's the best part: Podolsky is either a pathological liar or so incredibly entitled about his knowledge of \\"free speech\\" that he doesn't even notice that the tape he handed FOX 2 has a completely different story than the tale of woe he'd just told. In fact, instead of the Southwest agents coming off as cruel assholes intent on ruining a young man's day, it's Podolsky that comes across as an insufferable douche waffle. Sponsored (Worker) \\"Can you change the shirt?\\" (Podolsky) \\"Nope.\\" (Worker) \\"Can you put the jacket on and leave it on through the flight?\\" (Podolsky) (Inaudible) (Worker) \\"Can you put the shirt on inside out?\\" (Podolsky) \\"Nope.\\" (Worker) \\"Is there anything you can do not to display the shirt because at this point we can't allow you to go.\\" (Podolsky) \\"I have freedom of speech.\\" And these aren't polite \\"nopes.\\" They're righteously indignant refusals. Podolsky asked for a poll of the travelers onboard the flight (which probably annoyed everyone rather than rallied the troops for his cause) but was kicked off after being told that the agreement that he signed when buying his ticket allowed the airline to remove passengers at their discretion. Podolsky believes he was wronged, and that Southwest taking him off the plane was not prioritizing the needs of the other passengers, and that questioning his t-shirt wasn't really the airline's call to make (despite the agreement he signed). He made it to Chicago after changing his shirt to board another flight. FOX 2 points out that this story brings up the classic \\"freedom of speech\\" debate, but it appears that what's really going on isn't actually a freedom of speech issue but a misunderstanding of airline terms and conditions. The First Amendment protects your right to say and wear whatever you want; it doesn't protect the right for either of those things to go uncriticized or unpunished by entities other than the government. ||||| For those unfamiliar with the Comedy Central show Broad City, the two main characters are a pair of unapologetically potty-mouthed friends with a penchant for using colorful language to describe any and all situations. But in showing his fandom with a T-shirt bearing the word “F***ing” between “Broad” and “City,” a Southwest Airlines passenger was reportedly kicked off his flight after refusing to cover up during an unscheduled stopover. A college student on a Southwest flight from Dallas to Chicago landed in hot water with airline employees in St. Louis, when his plane made an unplanned stop at Lambert Airport due to bad weather, reports FOX 2 News. Though his T-shirt reading “Broad F***ing City” had been covered up while he had his jacket on, he took the outer layer off after deplaning to use the restroom. That’s when he says a gate agent noticed his shirt and told him he’d have to take it off. “It’s only when I got back on the plane when it was gonna take off, ya know, you have this much space, you’re gonna take your jacket off because it’s hot,” he explained. “I took my jacket off, so he sent someone to remove me from the flight.” Though he claimed to the news station that he wasn’t given a chance to take the shirt off or cover it up, and that he “gladly would’ve done so” before re-boarding the plane, he provided a video that shows otherwise. In the video, an employee asks him at the door of the aircraft if someone asked him about his shirt, which he affirms. The worker asks if he can change his shirt, to which he says, “Nope.” He then asks if he can put his jacket on and leave it on for the flight, and his answer is inaudible. Turn it inside out? “Nope.” “Is there anything you can do not to display the shirt because at this point we can’t allow you to go,” the worker says. At that point, the student brings up freedom of speech and insists it’s not bothering anyone. The worker notes that Southwest’s contract of carriage doesn’t allow for shirts with offensive sayings, and the passenger asks if a poll can be taken instead. That doesn’t happen, and he was instead asked to leave the plane. He says he was escorted by airport police from the terminal after he confronted the gate agent on the way out. He then reportedly contacted local media. “There are more than a hundred people on the plane trying to get to Chicago and the most important thing is my shirt?” he says. “How does that work? Where’s the sense of priority?” Southwest said in a statement that it stood behind the actions of its employees in the incident. “We rely on our employees and customers to use common sense and good judgment,” a spokesman told FOX 2. According to Southwest’s policy, it will “may refuse to transport, or remove from the aircraft at any point, any Passenger in any of the circumstances listed below as may be necessary for the comfort or safety of such Passenger or other Passengers and crew members,” including: “Persons whose conduct is or has been known to be disorderly, abusive, offensive, threatening, intimidating, violent, or whose clothing is lewd, obscene, or patently offensive.” The passenger eventually boarded a later flight to his final destination in New York after agreeing to change his shirt.

The staff had already stopped premature labor at six months gestation but it proceeded too quickly this time. Total labor 2.5 hours. Needless to say, they were tiny - female 2 lbs. 3 oz, male 3 lbs. 10 oz. Female was born dark blue - luckily, I was at the finest maternity hospital in this half of the State (McGee Women’s). They brought the female around to breathing, while I cried, thinking that she was dead. The twins were rushed to the NICU, too tiny to breast feed except with pumped milk through a feeding tube. Both were watched closely by doctors and nurses as they were not passing waste properly. The day it was decided that the male needed surgery, the female was discharged to home. The male was transferred to another very good hospital for surgery for a temporary colostomy. He was discharged to home after a week. What broke my heart was that I was allowed to visit him in the hospital but his older brother and twin sister were not allowed. Prior to his discharge, the staff instructed me in changing and maintaining his colostomy bag on a daily basis. He kept the colostomy bag until he was about 5 months old; back into the hospital for the colostomy reversal. The sign that I hung above their shared playpen said “Whatever doesn’t kill me, makes me stronger”. How did I cope with it? Mostly alone. The hospital offered group sessions for parents of severely premature infants. During the very first session, I had a zen realization that, once I realized that the circumstances were out of my control, I GAINED control of myself and my life. A bit like the Serenity Prayer. I shared that epiphany with the group and they looked at me like I had two heads. I had never heard of the Serenity Prayer and I’d been an atheist since age 13, so religion was not my go-to then, nor is it now. That realization helped. The twins are 37 now. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: Why did the babies have to go to the NICU? Options: - because the labor was too long - not enough information - because they were in a small town - because they were born 2 months early The answer is:","response":"because they were born 2 months early"},{"question":"If Think of Spike Lee at Morehouse College., can we conclude that \\"Think if Spike Lee ever went to college.\\"?","response":"Yes, if we think of Spike Lee at Morehouse College, we can conclude that Spike Lee indeed went to college. Spike Lee, a critically acclaimed and influential filmmaker, attended Morehouse College, a historically black liberal arts college for men, located in Atlanta, Georgia. Born Shelton Jackson \\"Spike\\" Lee on March 20, 1957, in Atlanta, Georgia, he grew up in a middle-class family in Brooklyn, New York. His mother was a teacher, and his father was a jazz musician. Lee's interest in arts and storytelling was nurtured from a young age, and he was often encouraged to explore his creativity. As he grew older, he developed a passion for film, which eventually led him to pursue higher education in the field. In 1975, Lee enrolled at Morehouse College, where he majored in Mass Communication with a concentration in film. This experience was pivotal in shaping his career, as Morehouse College offered a unique environment that encouraged African American men to thrive academically, culturally, and socially. While there, he became deeply committed to telling stories that portrayed the experiences of black people, aiming to challenge stereotypes, create meaningful dialogues, and drive change. During his time at Morehouse College, Lee took advantage of various opportunities to hone his filmmaking skills. For instance, he made several student films, beginning with his first-ever work, a Super 8 film titled \\"Last Hustle in Brooklyn.\\" It was through these projects that he began to develop his distinct directorial style and voice. Lee also attended Clark Atlanta University, which is part of the Atlanta University Center (AUC) consortium, along with Morehouse College and other historically black colleges. While there, he took film coursework that helped refine his understanding of the technical aspects of filmmaking. After graduating from Morehouse College with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1979, Spike Lee went on to earn a Master of Fine Arts (MFA) degree in Film and Television from New York University's Tisch School of the Arts. This provided him with the advanced skills and knowledge needed to begin his professional career in film. In summary, if we think about Spike Lee at Morehouse College, we can confidently say that he did attend college. His time at Morehouse College was pivotal for his growth and development as a filmmaker, providing him with the foundation needed to tell compelling stories that would have a lasting impact on the industry and the society at large. Spike Lee's college education played a significant role in shaping his career and establishing him as one of the most renowned filmmakers of his time."},{"question":"Solutions for male menopause Andropause /an•dro•pause/ (an´dro-pawz) a variable complex of symptoms, including decreased Leydig cell numbers and androgen production, occurring in men after middle age, purported to be analogous to menopause in women.* Experts say 52 percent of men age 40 to 70 have erectile problems – that’s about 30 million men in the United States. Is the answer a prescription like Viagra, or could it be andropause? Andropause is referred to as the male menopause, or colloquially as “manopause.” Each of these terms is used to describe the gradual decline of testosterone experienced by many men as they age. Testosterone levels typically peak in a man’s mid-to-late 20s and gradually decline with each passing year. As testosterone production declines, levels of other hormones, such as estrogen, begin to increase. These incessant fluctuations in hormone levels make it increasingly difficult for remaining testosterone to function effectively. The resulting deficiency of testosterone brings on many of the same symptoms that women experience during menopause: hot flashes, night sweats, weight gain, irritability, diminished sex drive, fatigue, hair loss, insomnia and decreased muscle mass. The key difference between menopause and andropause is that with andropause, hormone imbalances evolve gradually over time causing symptoms to go unnoticed or are dismissed as a normal part of the aging process. Testosterone assists the male body in building protein and is crucial for normal sex drive, stamina and the ability to achieve erection. Testosterone also contributes to several metabolic functions including bone formation, liver function, prostate gland growth and production of blood cells in bone marrow. While testosterone is declining in men, the sex binding hormone globulin (SHBG), also called androgen-binding protein, increases in levels. SHGB inhibits a substantial portion of remaining testosterone from working - the remaining working testosterone is referred to as bio-available testosterone or “free T.” Bio-available testosterone declines with time, causing the development of symptoms classically associated andropause. The risks and benefits of testosterone replacement may be evaluated by a qualified hormone therapy expert. Androgen replacement therapy is not a one size fits all treatment - testosterone replacement therapy is a treatment for men with low testosterone who want to boost their health and overall well-being. Through hormone therapy and a regimented treatment plan, the aches and pains of andropause may be minimized or eliminated – without the risk – testosterone therapy is not linked to prostate cancer and has been shown to improve cholesterol levels and decreases the risk of heart disease. *Dorland's Medical Dictionary for Health Consumers. © 2007 by Saunders, an imprint of Elsevier, Inc.

What is a short summary of the above article?","response":"Andropause, also known as male menopause or \\"manopause,\\" is when a man's testosterone levels gradually decrease as he ages.

The Blob Context: Left off after the events of the first movie The Blob, an oil pipeline layer named Chester (Godfrey Cambridge) returns to his suburban Los Angeles home from the North Pole, bringing with him a small sample of a mysterious frozen substance uncovered by a bulldozer on a job site. Prior to taking the blob to a lab to be analyzed, he places the storage container with the substance in his freezer, but he and his wife (Marlene Clark) accidentally let it thaw, releasing \\"the Blob\\". It starts by eating a fly, then a kitten, Chester's wife, and then Chester himself (while he is watching a television broadcast of the film The Blob). Lisa (Gwynne Gilford), a friend, walks in to see Chester being devoured by the Blob. She escapes, but cannot get anyone to believe her, not even her boyfriend Bobby (Robert Walker, Jr.). Meanwhile, the rapidly growing creature quietly preys upon the town. Some of its victims include a police officer and two hippies (Cindy Williams and Randy Stonehill) in a storm drain, a barber (Shelley Berman) and his client, transients (played by director Hagman, Burgess Meredith and Del Close), a Scoutmaster (Dick Van Patten), a farm full of chickens, and a bar full of people. At one point, Lisa and Bobby find themselves trapped in Bobby's truck with the creature attempting to find a way inside. In the panic, the truck's air conditioning is accidentally switched on and the Blob retreats because of its vulnerability to cold. The now-massive blob then invades a bowling alley and a skating rink (consuming dozens more people in the process). It is finally stopped when Bobby activates the rink's ice mechanism, freezing it. While the frozen blob is being filmed by a television crew, one of the crew's bright lights is positioned on the ground, melting a small portion of it, which oozes toward the sheriff and envelopes his feet as he is speaking on camera.

Sentence 1 - \\"NATO: Patriot missile battery operational on Syrian border\\" Sentence 2 - \\"Obama: Patriot missile batteries, troops to stay in Jordan near Syrian border\\" There are a few reasons why I have picked option IV (similarity level 3): 1. Both sentences deal with the same subject: Patriot missile batteries, a defensive missile system. 2. The location of interest for these sentences is the border of Syria. However, the first sentence specifically notes that the Patriot missile battery is positioned at the border, while the second sentence states that the missile batteries and troops are located in Jordan, a neighboring country that shares a border with Syria. This distinction reduces the level of similarity between the sentences. 3. The two sentences are indirectly connected through different parties: NATO (an international military alliance) and Obama (referring to the U.S. government under President Barack Obama). NATO would be involved in decisions about the broader strategy, while the U.S., as a member of the alliance, would have a prominent role in decisions about their own military deployment.

Blueberries were nasty in the pie, but delicious in the tart, since the Select from the following. i. pie was made with complementary flavors.. ii. tart was made with complementary flavors..","response":"Blueberries were nasty in the pie, but delicious in the tart, as the tart was made with complementary flavors. This curious phenomenon can be attributed to the careful and thoughtful combination of ingredients that were chosen to enhance and harmonize with the natural taste profile of blueberries in the tart, as opposed to the pie. When it comes to crafting mouthwatering and memorable desserts, flavor pairing plays an essential role in determining whether the final result is a hit or miss. In the case of the ill-fated blueberry pie, it appears that the other ingredients chosen to accompany the blueberries failed to form a pleasing palate experience. This may have been due to clashing textures, overpowering secondary flavors, or simply a poor choice of complementary elements that did not do justice to the sweet and slightly tart notes of blueberries. Conversely, the blueberry tart was a shining example of flavor pairing done right. Perhaps the tart began with a buttery and flaky crust that allowed the blueberry filling to be the star of the show. The tart's filling might have included an optimal balance of sweetness and tartness, carefully calibrated to accentuate the fresh blueberries' taste without overwhelming them. Furthermore, the successful tart could have employed different complementary flavors to achieve its winning taste. One possibility would be the addition of zesty citrus notes, such as lemon or orange, which can brighten and enhance the blueberries' natural sweetness. Another option might have incorporated subtle hints of warm spices such as cinnamon, nutmeg, or vanilla, which can add depth and complexity to the blueberry filling, resulting in a comforting and well-rounded dessert. In both the pie and tart, the use of blueberries signals an appreciation for their unique and delightful taste. However, it is only in the tart that the blueberries were allowed to shine to their full potential, thanks to the skillful handling of complementary flavors. A masterful dessert combines various components in such a way that each ingredient elevates the others, producing a harmonious and satisfying sensory experience for the consumer. In conclusion, the blueberries' perceived deliciousness in the tart versus their unappealing presence in the pie can be explained by the tart's successful integration of complementary flavors that highlighted and celebrated the blueberries' intrinsic qualities. The tart showcased the importance of understanding flavor pairing and the thoughtful consideration of accompanying ingredients to ensure each component works together to create a masterpiece of taste, texture, and satisfaction."},{"question":"Creatively image a question and justification for this answer: it is not possible to tell","response":"Question: Can anyone accurately predict the winner of the National Interdimensional Chess Championship? Justification: It is not possible to tell the winner of the National Interdimensional Chess Championship because the game is influenced by multiple dimensions and countless unknown variables. Each player competes against adversaries from different planes of existence, making it impossible to account for all potential factors that could influence the outcome. Moreover, since the game is based on theoretical physics principles and advanced mathematical models, even experts struggle to predict the winning strategies or favored players.

Later, Disraeli receives the welcome news that the spendthrift Khedive of Egypt is in dire need of money and is willing to sell the controlling shares in the Suez Canal. The purchase of the canal would secure control of India, but Michael Probert, head of the Bank of England, makes it clear to Disraeli that he is vehemently opposed to any such plan.

Disraeli, seeing promise in the young man and wanting Clarissa to be happy, convinces Charles to come work for him, and tells him about the canal purchase. But he does not tell him about the spies. Russia, eager to seize India for itself, has assigned two spies to watch Disraeli: Mrs. Travers, who has entree to the highest social circles, and Mr. Foljambe. Disraeli was not fooled; he has hired Foljambe as his personal government secretary, the better to deceive him. When Foljambe asks Charles if Myers is there to provide financial backing for the purchase of the canal, Charles says nothing, but his manner makes it clear that Foljambe has guessed correctly. Mrs. Travers orders Foljambe to leave the country and warn their masters. Disraeli soon discovers what has happened.

In both of these, he analyzed the improved living standards and social conditions of individuals, as well as their relationship to the market and state in Western societies. Democracy in America was published after Tocqueville's travels in the United States, and is today considered an early work of sociology and political science. Tocqueville was active in French politics, first under the July Monarchy (1830-1848) and then during the Second Republic (1849-1851) which succeeded the February 1848 Revolution. He retired from political life after Louis Napoleon Bonaparte's 2 December 1851 coup, and thereafter began work on The Old Regime and the Revolution. He argued that the importance of the French Revolution was to continue the process of modernizing and centralizing the French state which had begun under King Louis XIV. The failure of the Revolution came from the inexperience of the deputies who were too wedded to abstract Enlightenment ideals.

Article:","response":"Title: Zlatan Ibrahimovic: Sweden's Unparalleled Football Phenomenon Introduction When it comes to European soccer, players like Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo undoubtedly dominate the headlines, boasting multiple Ballon d'Or awards each to their names. However, there's another player who, despite not having as many accolades, easily surpasses his fellow countrymen in terms of talent, skill, and influence - the enigmatic Swedish striker, Zlatan Ibrahimovic. A Born Winner Born on October 3, 1981, in Malmö, Sweden, Zlatan Ibrahimovic possesses a blend of agility, athleticism, and audacity that sets him apart from not only other Swedish footballers, but also many players around the world. His incredible performances on the pitch have earned him numerous domestic league titles, including championships in the Netherlands, Italy, Spain, and France. Throughout his illustrious career, Ibrahimovic has scored an astonishing 500+ goals across various leagues and international competitions, firmly establishing himself as one of the most prolific and consistent goal-scorers in modern football history. The Journey: From Malmö to Milan Ibrahimovic began his professional career with his hometown club of Malmö FF in 1999. In 2001, he made his move to the Dutch powerhouse club, Ajax, where he would go on to help secure two Eredivisie championships in 2001-2002 and 2003-2004. It was also during his time with Ajax that the player began to gain notoriety for his flamboyant style, dazzling fans and critics alike with his dazzling skills and remarkable goals. In 2004, a high-profile move to Juventus followed, where he would spend two successful seasons, before joining their Italian Serie A rivals, Internazionale. It was here, under the guidance of charismatic coach Jose Mourinho, that Ibrahimovic truly began to evolve into a world-class player, leading the team to three consecutive Serie A titles. His next club? The famous FC Barcelona. And although his time in Spain was marred with disagreements with then-coach Pep Guardiola, Ibrahimovic still managed to make an impact, claiming a La Liga title and a domestic cup. Fast forward to his stints at AC Milan, Paris Saint-Germain, Manchester United, LA Galaxy, and then returning to AC Milan for a second spell, Ibrahimovic continued to collect silverware and contribute to his teams' successes. His indomitable spirit combined with his sheer talent has earned him a place in the record books, and his name will forever be synonymous with Swedish footballing excellence. International Glory with the Swedish National Team Undoubtedly, Zlatan Ibrahimovic's impact has also been felt at the international level. Over the course of his international career, which began back in 2001, the enigmatic striker has represented Sweden in multiple Euros and World Cups, becoming the nation's all-time leading goal-scorer with 62 goals in 116 appearances. Although Sweden may not have won any major international titles during Ibrahimovic's tenure, his contribution to his national team, as well as his ability to perform on the global stage, speaks volumes about his dedication and skill as a player. Conclusion To truly understand the genius of Zlatan Ibrahimovic, one needs to look beyond the trophies and individual awards. What sets him apart is his sheer dedication, hard work, and audacity on and off the field. And while he may not have the Ballon d'Ors of Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo, there is no disputing that when it comes to the greatest Swedish footballer of all time, Zlatan Ibrahimovic stands head and shoulders above the competition. In the years to come, the records he has set and the memories he has left for both football fans and aspiring players alike in Sweden and worldwide will make him a lasting figure in the annals of sporting history. As for the man himself, one thing is certain - Zlatan will continue to do what he does best: defy expectations and leave us all in awe with his incredible talent."},{"question":"Article:Save the Children says a quarter of boys in England - 90,000 - started reception class struggling to speak a full sentence or follow instructions. The report, based on a University of Bristol study, says children who start school behind often never catch up. A Department for Education spokesperson said \\"we are making a significant investment in the early years sector\\". The report compared girls' and boys' scores in the early language and communication goals of the Early Years Foundation Stage assessment. This assessment is taken at the end of Reception by all pupils in England. Children are expected to be able to listen and express themselves effectively, showing awareness of listeners' needs. They should be able to listen to simple instructions and answer \\"how\\" and \\"why\\" questions. Overall last year, 25% of boys were unable to meet these requirements, compared with 14% of girls. But for those on free school meals, the difference was more stark, with 38% of boys not meeting the standard compared with 23% of girls. The report found that there was no area in England where boys were outperforming girls in early language skills, on average. The gap between boys' and girls' EYFS scores was widest in St Helen's, Merseyside, where 31% of boys did not reach the expected level compared with 14% of girls. The narrowest gap was in Richmond upon Thames at 5%. Here, 11% of boys did not meet the standard compared with 6% of girls. The report said it was not clear whether this early gender gap was the result of biological differences and rate of development, or social processes. But it quotes earlier research suggesting girls are more likely to be able to develop the behaviour and attributes, such as persistence, independence and flexible thinking, that enable them to learn. It also highlights how girls outperform boys at every level of education. The report concludes: \\"We cannot wait for disadvantaged children and boys to get to school before they receive the support they need. \\"By this time many will have already fallen behind, with negative consequences for their childhoods, school attainment and life chances. \\"We must invest in the best early years provision, led by early years teachers and supported by skilled staff at all levels, particularly in the most deprived areas.\\" The director of poverty at Save the Children, Gareth Jenkins, said: \\"In England, too many children, especially boys, are slipping under the radar without the support they need to reach their potential. \\"They're falling behind before they even get to school and that puts their life chances at risk. \\"In 2016 this is unacceptable. A whole generation of boys is being failed.\\" Responding to the report, a spokesperson for the Department for Education said \\"the number of qualified staff is rising with more trained graduates in the workforce and a record number of providers rated Good or Outstanding. \\"This investment is paying off, latest figures show more than 80 per cent of children are reaching the expected communication and language skills by age five, but we will continue working with the sector until every child gets the high-quality education they deserve.\\" A summary of the above article is?","response":"This story is about a report that says a lot of boys in England - about 90,000 of them - are having trouble when they start school.

The report says that when children begin school and they're already having trouble, they often don't catch up. The people who make the rules for schools said they know about the problems and they're spending a lot of money to make things better.

They also noticed that boys who get free lunch at school did even worse. The report found that girls do better than boys in all areas of England when it comes to early language skills. They're unsure whether it's because girls grow and learn at a different rate than boys or if it's because of some other reason. The people who wrote the report say that it's important to help kids as soon as possible. If we wait until they're in school, it may be too late and it might affect them negatively later in life. A man named Gareth Jenkins who works at Save the Children said that too many kids, particularly boys, are not getting the help they need and this can affect their future.

Which language is this?","response":"This sentence is in German. \\"Familie Oberleitner heißt Sie herzlich Willkommen!\\" translates to \\"The Oberleitner family warmly welcomes you!\\" in English. German is a West Germanic language primarily spoken in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, and some parts of Belgium, Italy, and Luxembourg. It is the most widely spoken native language in the European Union. German belongs to the family of Germanic languages, which also includes English, Dutch, Swedish, Norwegian, and Danish, among others. It uses the Latin script, which is composed of 26 basic letters. In addition to these, German writing also employs umlauts (ä, ö, ü) and the special character \\"ß\\" (Eszett or \\"sharp S\\"). The language has a rich grammar and extensive vocabulary, making it a complex yet fascinating language to learn. German is an inflected language, meaning that words change their form in order to indicate grammatical information such as gender, number, case, and tense. There are three genders in German (masculine, feminine, and neuter), four cases (nominative, accusative, genitive, and dative), and both singular and plural forms for nouns. Verbs are conjugated for person, number, tense, and sometimes mood. An important characteristic of the German language is its extensive use of compound words. Instead of creating new words, Germans tend to combine existing ones to form compound words that might look long and intimidating to non-German speakers. However, this practice also allows for a very descriptive and precise vocabulary. The standard form of the German language – referred to as Hochdeutsch, or High German – evolved from the Middle German dialects during the Late Middle Ages and Early Modern periods. Today, there are several regional dialects of German across the countries where it is spoken, which differ in pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary. In recent years, German has gained importance as a foreign language globally, second only to English among European languages. It has become a widely taught language in both Europe and North America, with millions of students learning German as a foreign language. As a result, knowledge of German can be beneficial for various purposes, such as business, academics, tourism, or simply engaging in cross-cultural communication."},{"question":"Leo: If \\"Two people are riding dirt bikes on a sunny day in a forested area.\\" does that mean that \\"The woman rode the skateboard.\\"?

So, let's add 14 * g to both sides: 28 * g + 14 * g = 139 * g - 1067 Now, let's add the \\"g\\" terms on the left side: 42 * g = 139 * g - 1067 Next, let's subtract 42 * g from both sides to have all the g terms on one side: 0 = 97 * g - 1067 Now, let's add 1067 to both sides to get rid of the 1067 on the right side: 1067 = 97 * g Finally, we need to find the value of \\"g\\", so we will divide both sides by 97: 1067 ÷ 97 = g g = 11 So, the solution is g = 11."},{"question":"For the location and size of the rooms, Elara is a great value for a stay on the Vegas strip.

The reason often given is that if eat you too much food at night, the body will store all those excess kilojoules as fat because we’re inactive until the next day. The reason sounds plausible, but if it was one hundred percent true then world hunger could be solved by just feeding people one meal at night time. What really matters is how much is eaten over days and weeks for weight gain or weight loss, not so much when it is eaten. There is merit though in advice to eat less at night time as it can help a person to cut back on the total quantity of food eaten. Eating lots of food in the evening can also be a marker for unhealthy dietary habits, especially if much of that extra food is going to fuel couch surfing exploits. So even though advice to eat less at night time seems logical, it hasn’t actually been well tested by science to see how effective it can be for losing weight. Filling this gap, a short-term study involving 29 healthy men looked at how 2 weeks of restricted night time eating fared against 2 weeks of ‘normal’ evening eating. Advice on restricting night eating was very clear: avoid any food or drink containing kilojoules between the hours of 7 pm and 6 am the next morning. No other changes to the participants’ diet or lifestyle was required so each person was free to eat whatever they wished during the day time hours until early evening. Twenty seven of the twenty nine people complied with following this advice for 2 weeks as well as the 2 week control period. Eating at night a waistline hazard So did people eat less when restricting night time eating? Yes, equal to 1000 kilojoules (about 250 Calories) per day less than during their normal eating pattern. This small energy difference was enough to see the men lose 0.4 kg over the 2 week restriction period, and gain 0.6 kg over the 2 week control period. Question: After completing the study, how does the author feel about the results? Options: A. They believe restricting eating at night did result in a small amount of weight lost B. not enough information C. They believe they have unhealthy dietary habits D. They believe there were no changes === The correct answer is The answer to this question is:","response":"A. They believe restricting eating at night did result in a small amount of weight lost. The author outlines the findings of the study, stating that participants who restricted their night time eating consumed around 1000 kilojoules (about 250 Calories) less per day than their normal eating patterns. This led to a small weight loss of 0.4 kg over the 2-week restriction period. As a result, it can be inferred that the author believes eating less at night time can contribute to weight loss."},{"question":"Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: On a brief trip back to London, earnest, bookish bacteriologist Walter Fane (Edward Norton) is dazzled by Kitty Garstin (Naomi Watts), a vivacious and vain London socialite.

He received the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1978 and the Turing Award in 1975. His research was noted for its interdisciplinary nature and spanned across the fields of cognitive science, computer science, public administration, management, and political science. He was at Carnegie Mellon University for most of his career, from 1949 to 2001. Herbert Alexander Simon was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on June 15, 1916. His father, Arthur Simon (1881-1948), was an electrical engineer who had come to the United States from Germany in 1903 after earning his engineering degree from the Technische Hochschule of Darmstadt. An inventor who was granted \\"several dozen patents\\", his father also was an independent patent attorney. His mother, Edna Marguerite Merkel, was an accomplished pianist whose ancestors had come from Prague and Cologne. His European ancestors had been piano makers, goldsmiths, and vintners. Simon's father was Jewish and his mother came from a family with Jewish, Lutheran, and Catholic backgrounds. Simon called himself an atheist. Simon was educated in the Milwaukee public school system, where he developed an interest in science. He found schoolwork to be interesting and easy. Unlike many children, Simon was exposed to the idea that human behavior could be studied scientifically at a relatively young age due to the influence of his mother's younger brother, Harold Merkel, who had studied economics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison under John R. Commons. Through his uncle's books on economics and psychology, Simon discovered the social sciences. Among his earliest influences, Simon has cited Richard Ely's economics textbook, Norman Angell's The Great Illusion, and Henry George's Progress and Poverty. At that time, Simon argued \\"from conviction, rather than cussedness\\" in favor of George's controversial \\"single tax\\" on land rents. In 1933, Simon entered the University of Chicago, and following those early influences, he studied the social sciences and mathematics. He was interested in biology, but chose not to study it because of his \\"color-blindness and awkwardness in the laboratory\\". He chose instead to focus on political science and economics. His most important mentor was Henry Schultz, an econometrician and mathematical economist. Simon received both his B.A. (1936) and his Ph.D. (1943) in political science, from the University of Chicago, where he studied under Harold Lasswell, Nicholas Rashevsky, Rudolf Carnap, Henry Schultz, and Charles Edward Merriam. After enrolling in a course on \\"Measuring Municipal Governments\\", Simon was invited to be a research assistant for Clarence Ridley, with whom he coauthored Measuring Municipal Activities in 1938. Eventually his studies led him to the field of organizational decision-making, which would become the subject of his doctoral dissertation.

Lands that had been marginally productive were abandoned, as the survivors were able to acquire more fertile areas. Although serfdom declined in Western Europe it became more common in Eastern Europe, as landlords imposed it on those of their tenants who had previously been free. Most peasants in Western Europe managed to change the work they had previously owed to their landlords into cash rents. The percentage of serfs amongst the peasantry declined from a high of 90 to closer to 50 per cent by the end of the period. Landlords also became more conscious of common interests with other landholders, and they joined together to extort privileges from their governments. Partly at the urging of landlords, governments attempted to legislate a return to the economic conditions that existed before the Black Death.

He ran for President of the United States during the 2008 election, and was the Constitution Party's unsuccessful nominee for Governor of Colorado in 2010. Tancredo was elected to the Colorado House of Representatives in 1976 and served two terms. Context: Tancredo sponsored the Sudan Peace Act. The Sudan Peace Act says \\"A viable, comprehensive, and internationally sponsored peace process, protected from manipulation, presents the best chance for a permanent resolution of the war, protection of human rights, and a self-sustaining Sudan.\\" The Act passed the House of Representatives with a 359-8 vote, was passed unanimously in the Senate without amendment seven days later, and was signed into law on November 21, 2002. Tancredo introduced the Mass Immigration Reduction Act. The act would have imposed an indefinite moratorium on immigration to the United States. Under the act, only spouses and children of American citizens would be allowed to immigrate, which Tancredo estimated would amount to 300,000 immigrants annually. The moratorium would last for at least the first five years of the act and, after that, until such time as there were fewer than 10,000 illegal immigrants entering per year. When those conditions were met, immigration would only have been allowed at whatever level the president and both houses of Congress agreed would have no adverse impact on wages, housing, the environment, or schools. When last introduced in 2003, the bill had 11 cosponsors. Organizations that have endorsed Tancredo's bill include: NumbersUSA, Population-Environment Balance, Carrying Capacity Network, Federation for American Immigration Reform, Negative Population Growth, and the American Patrol. Tancredo introduced the bill in 2001 (H. R. 2712) and 2003 (H. R. 946). Tancredo did not re-introduce the bill in 2005. In 2007, he proposed an amendment to the U.S. Constitution to \\"establish English as the official language of the United States\\", (H.R. 19). In 2005, Tancredo introduced a resolution calling on the President to recognize the government of the Republic of China (Taiwan) and to abandon the One-China policy. He has been critical of the People's Republic of China. This has since been modified and reintroduced as H. Con. Res. 73. Question: What does the act say. Whats the answer?","response":"Okay, let me explain it simply for you! The Sudan Peace Act that Mr. Tancredo sponsored is a law that aims to help bring peace to a country called Sudan.

It tries to limit the number of people coming to live in the United States from other countries. Only close family members of American citizens would be allowed to come. Lastly, Mr. Tancredo wanted to make English the official language of the United States, so he proposed a change to the country's important rule book, called the Constitution, to do that.

Sens. Carl Levin, D-Mich., and John McCain, R-Ariz., the chairman and ranking member on the Armed Services Committee, told the Pentagon that \\"senior mentors exercise a level of ... influence\\" that demands public disclosure. They wrote that if the Pentagon resisted, they would propose legislation mandating it. Leigh Bradley, a top Pentagon lawyer, responded to their letter by seeking a ruling from the Office of Government Ethics to require public disclosures. Among the reasons she cited for greater transparency is the mentors' ability to affect Pentagon policy. \\"They will be in a unique position to inform and influence war planning at the highest level and may, ultimately, hold some sway, indirect or otherwise, regarding defense purchasing decisions,\\" Bradley wrote in a Sept. 27 letter. Rep. Robert Andrews, a New Jersey Democrat who chairs a panel on reforming defense acquisition, called the Pentagon's decision a \\"no brainer.\\" \\"Anybody who consults with the Pentagon about the right way to conduct its programs needs to disclose potential conflicts of interest,\\" Andrews said. A USA TODAY investigation last year found that mentors made up to 440 an hour in taxpayer dollars, many times their pay while in uniform. Mentors advise active-duty officers, take part in war games and aid in military planning. The earnings came on top of military pensions as high as 220,000 a year. At the same time, many mentors held jobs with defense contractors selling products and services to the Pentagon. In April, Defense Secretary Robert Gates responded to those findings, capping mentors' pay at 179,000 and requiring public financial disclosures. He also subjected them to rules barring conflicts of interest. The Pentagon, however, retreated from those restrictions this summer. A ruling from the Office of Government Ethics allowed mentors to file confidential disclosure forms. The Pentagon also considered shielding mentors' names, Bryan Whitman, a Pentagon spokesman, said in July. Whitman said Wednesday that the Pentagon is setting up a process that requires mentors to file the public disclosure forms. The new rule will apply to mentors making more than 119,553, according to a letter from William Lynn, deputy Defense secretary. Mandy Smithberger, a national security investigator for the Project on Government Oversight, a watchdog group, called the Pentagon's decision \\"fantastic news\\" for open and transparent government.

Here's a detailed explanation of the process: 1. People breathe and expel carbon dioxide: As humans breathe, they inhale oxygen (O2) and exhale carbon dioxide (CO2) as a waste product of respiration. 2. Engines produce carbon dioxide: Fossil fuel-powered engines, such as those found in vehicles and industrial processes, also produce carbon dioxide emissions when fuels are burned. 3. Living things produce waste: All living organisms produce waste, such as fecal matter or decaying plant material, which eventually accumulates in the environment. 4. Waste decomposes: Microorganisms break down this waste through the process of decomposition, which releases various substances, including greenhouse gases, back into the environment. 5. Decomposition produces methane: One of the greenhouse gases released during decomposition is methane (CH4), especially in anaerobic conditions where oxygen is scarce. 6. Water evaporates: Solar energy heats the Earth's surface, causing water to evaporate and become water vapor, joining other gases in the atmosphere. 7. Water vapor joins the atmosphere: Water vapor is also a greenhouse gas, and it contributes to the overall greenhouse effect by trapping heat in the Earth's atmosphere. In the final step, these greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, methane, and water vapor, accumulate in the Earth's atmosphere and contribute to the greenhouse effect. The greenhouse effect is a natural process in which certain gases, known as greenhouse gases, trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere, maintaining a stable temperature that is suitable for life. However, human activities, like burning fossil fuels and deforestation, have significantly increased the levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, intensifying the greenhouse effect and causing global temperatures to rise. This leads to the consequences of climate change, such as more frequent and severe weather events, rising sea levels, and changes in ecosystems and agriculture."},{"question":"If \\"A classroom of young children holding a pose.\\" does that mean that \\"The first grade class posed for a class picture.\\"?

From extensive consumer research and market analysis, he discovered that a significant portion of his target demographic – young adult women – preferred male protagonists, often associating them with strength, courage, and hidden emotional vulnerability. Harvey knew that the key to crafting a captivating, successful graphic novel was to create relatable characters with whom his readers could empathize and grow emotionally invested in. He wanted to ensure that his characters resonated with his female audience, so he decided to focus primarily on male leads. As a writer, Harvey was interested in exploring the challenges that his male characters faced in their emotional and interpersonal relationships while also showcasing their unique strengths and vulnerabilities. He wanted to develop characters who were dynamic and complex, drawing on real-life experiences and situations to emphasize the humanity and depth of these fictional beings. Harvey believed that this choice would allow him to create a more authentic connection with his readers, who might see themselves or their loved ones reflected in the personalities and experiences of his male protagonists. By choosing to focus on male characters, Harvey was also tapping into the widespread popularity of fictional couples and romantic storylines in the young adult market. This decision enabled him to introduce an additional element of intrigue and investment into his graphic novel, as his audience would naturally be curious about how the relationships between his characters would develop and evolve over time. Of course, Harvey knew that he needed to tread carefully when writing from perspectives outside of his own gender. As a responsible creator, he was adamant that he would not allow his male characters to dominate or overshadow the female characters within his story. Harvey understood that his female readers wanted to see themselves represented, and with that in mind, he made sure to incorporate a diverse range of supporting female roles. These female characters were equally as complex and rich as their male counterparts, providing contrasting viewpoints and experiences that aided in the story's growth. Harvey hoped that through this approach, he could craft a graphic novel that felt both well-rounded and inclusive, appealing to his primary readership and beyond. By choosing to write a graphic novel with predominantly male characters who were well-liked by female readers, Harvey was catering to the preferences and tastes of his target audience while still attending to the need for inclusivity and complex character development.

The food, unfortunately, did not make up for the poor service. I ordered the grilled chicken with vegetables, expecting a tender, well-seasoned dish. Instead, the chicken was overcooked, dry, and lacked any flavor. My partner's pasta dish was swimming in oil, making it practically inedible. What's worse, the portions were quite small considering the high prices. Additionally, the restaurant's unsanitary conditions were impossible to ignore. Our table was sticky and had not been wiped down properly before we sat down. The restroom facilities were equally abhorrent, with toilet paper strewn all over the floor and no hand soap in sight. In summary, I cannot recommend XYZ Restaurant and will not be returning in the future.

Explanation: Since we know that each bus can seat 6 passengers, we need to calculate how many passengers can be accommodated on all 15 buses combined. To do this, we perform a simple multiplication: Step 1: Identify the number of buses (15) and the seating capacity of each bus (6). Step 2: Multiply the number of buses by the seating capacity of each bus: 15 buses * 6 passengers per bus. Step 3: Calculate the result: 15 * 6 = 90.

However,some players complained right away that the new balls bounced differently and were actually harder to control than the leather ones. Physics helped answer questions about why the new balls felt different.For example,the scientists studied friction ,which in this case affects the ability of a player to hold onto a ball.\\"The greater the friction,the better it will stick to his hand,\\"explains a scientist. Tests on both wet and dry balls showed that while the synthetic ball was easier to hold onto when dry,it had less friction and became much harder to hold onto when wet.That's because _ stays on the surface of the synthetic balls but gets taken into the leather balls. The scientists also tested bounce and found that the logo printed on the new balls made their surface uneven and caused them to bounce a little strangely com- pared with the leather balls. In January,the NBA went back to using the leather balls.They aren't perfect,but for now,that's just the way the ball bounces.

The baby geniuses become involved in a scheme by media mogul Bill Biscane, later revealed to be known as Kane, who kidnaps children everywhere. Helping the geniuses is a legendary super-baby named Kahuna who stops Biscane's plots and saves children from being kidnapped by Biscane and his minions.

The term \\"Veterans Committee\\" (was composed of four committees of baseball veterans) is taken from the body's former official name: National Baseball Hall of Fame Committee on Baseball Veterans (1953). In July 2010, the Veterans Committee name was changed by the Hall of Fame Board of Directors and its name was no longer officially used by the Hall of Fame, which called three new 16-member voting committees by era: the Expansion Era Committee (1973-present), the Golden Era Committee (1947-1972), and the Pre-Integration Era Committee (1876-1946) - each, \\"The Committee\\" (the term \\"Veterans Committee\\" is still being used by some sports media). The three committees met on a rotating cycle once every three years to elect candidates from each era to the Hall of Fame that have been \\"identified\\" by a BBWAA-appointed \\"Screening Committee\\" named the \\"Historical Overview Committee\\" (10-12 representatives; BBWAA members). Context: The Veterans Committee election process, radically changed in 2001, was revamped yet again in July 2007. The changes that most directly affected this election involved elections of non-players (managers, umpires and executives). Under the 2001 rules, elections of non-players would be held every fourth year on a \\"composite ballot\\". No candidate was elected from the composite ballot in 2003 or 2007. With the 2007 rules changes, the composite ballot was split into two separate ballots--one for managers and umpires and the other for executives. Also, the voting membership of the Committee, which previously included all living members of the Hall, was now reduced to include just a handful of those members, plus additional executives and sportswriters (only one of whom had been among the previous electorate). Voting for both the managers/umpires and executives ballots will now take place prior to inductions in even-numbered years, starting with 2008. To be eligible, managers and umpires need to be retired for at least five years, or for at least six months if they are age 65 or older, while executives need to be either retired or at least age 65. A Historical Overview Committee of eleven sportswriters appointed by the BBWAA's Board of Directors met to develop a ballot of ten managers and umpires; the committee members were: Dave Van Dyck (Chicago Tribune), Bob Elliott (Toronto Sun), Rick Hummel (St. Louis Post-Dispatch), Steve Hirdt (Elias Sports Bureau), Moss Klein (Newark Star-Ledger), Bill Madden (New York Daily News), Ken Nigro (formerly Baltimore Sun), Jack O'Connell (MLB.com), Nick Peters (The Sacramento Bee), Tracy Ringolsby (Rocky Mountain News) and Mark Whicker (The Orange County Register). The managers/umpires list was submitted to a sixteen-member panel composed of ten Hall of Famers (eight players and two managers), three executives and three veteran media members for a final vote. A separate ballot of ten executives was developed by a twelve-member panel including seven executives, two players and three writers, which was the same committee which did the final voting in that area. On November 8, 2007, the final ballots were released. Each panel member could vote for up to four individuals on each ballot, and each candidate who received 75% of the vote from either panel would be elected; therefore, a maximum of five inductions was possible from each ballot. Voting was conducted at baseball's winter meetings in Nashville, Tennessee on December 2, 2007, with the results announced on December 3; it was the first time since 2001 that the Committee met to discuss candidates, as the previous three elections had been conducted by mail.

We did a pre - celebration on Thursday as both of us had a day off for different reasons and she thought she had to work on her birthday . Why might DD be ?","response":"DD might be an abbreviation referring to a person's name, such as \\"Dear Daughter\\" or \\"Darling Daughter.\\" In this context, it appears that the author is talking about their daughter, who recently celebrated her birthday. The text provides several potential indicators of DD's personality, values, and situation, which might shed more light on who she is as a person. Some of these potential clues include: 1. Attitude towards money: DD seems to be financially conscientious and does not like the idea of overspending, especially on her birthday. She likely appreciates the thought, effort, and love put into celebrations more than the financial expenditure behind them. 2. Importance of work ethic: The text mentions that DD thought she had to work on her birthday. This could imply that she has a strong work ethic and is committed to her job, even if it means working on special occasions, such as her birthday. 3. Valuing experiences over material gifts: DD's birthday celebration involved spending quality time together on a day off rather than indulging in expensive gifts or lavish parties. This could suggest that DD values shared experiences and making memories with loved ones over material items. 4. Flexibility and adaptability: Instead of rigidly celebrating her birthday on the actual date, DD was open to having a pre-celebration on Thursday, as it was more convenient for both her and the author. This can highlight her flexible nature and indicate that she is willing to adapt to changing circumstances to make the most of her situation. 5. Appreciation for simple pleasures: DD seemed to appreciate and enjoy the brownie cake that was bought for her birthday, describing it as delicious. This can show that she appreciates the smaller and simpler gestures of love and kindness in life, rather than needing extravagant celebrations or gifts. 6. Close relationship with the author: It is evident that DD shares a close bond with the author, as they spent their day off together and had a pre-celebration for her birthday. This suggests that DD cherishes her relationships with her close family members. In summary, DD seems to be someone who values relationships, shared experiences, and has a strong work ethic. She appears to be financially conscientious, preferring simpler and more meaningful celebrations over extravagant events or gifts. She may be flexible and adaptive to changes in life, and is likely someone who appreciates the smaller joys in life. The author's relationship with DD is indicative of a loving and close bond between them. Overall, these qualities provide a glimpse of DD’s personality and values."},{"question":"Write a summary based on this article: Thom Yorke performs during Pathway to Paris at Le Trianon on Dec. 4, 2015 in Paris.

Radiohead frontman Thom Yorke’s former partner, Rachel Owen, died Sunday (Dec. 18) at 48 following a battle with cancer. A celebrated scholar and artist, Owen was a retained lecturer in Italian at the University of Oxford's Pembroke College. She continued to teach as her health declined during the past year. Owen was an expert in medieval Italian literature and a renowned artist and printmaker. One of her last works, a series of prints inspired by the cantos of Dante’s first book of The Divine Comedy, will be exhibited at Pembroke’s JCR Art Gallery. While Owen and Yorke were together for 23 years, she lived a private life and was rarely seen in public with the singer. The couple had two children together -- a son, Noah, and a daughter, Agnes, age 15 and 12. Their August 2015 separation heavily influenced Radiohead’s latest album, A Moon Shaped Pool. ||||| It is with great sadness that the College marks the death of Dr Rachel Owen, who was a Retained Lecturer in Italian here at Pembroke. Dr Owen was an internationally renowned artist – mixing photography and printmaking – and at the same time a scholar in medieval Italian literature. As Retained Lecturer, she used to teach Dante’s Divine Comedy to Pembroke’s finalists in Italian. Dr Owen’s parallel passion for art and literature was already established in her university years at Exeter, where she studied Italian and Fine Art. She then moved to Royal Holloway, London, where she completed a PhD on the illustrations of the early manuscripts of Dante’s Divine Comedy. Each year, her Pembroke students enjoyed the pleasure and the privilege of a guided tour through the manuscripts of the Divine Comedy held at the Bodleian Library. Despite her declining health from cancer in the last year, she asked to continue to teach, which she did right until the end of last Michaelmas term. She was 48 years old and leaves behind a son, Noah, and a daughter, Agnes, aged 15 and 12. One of her latest artistic productions was a series of prints inspired by the Cantos of Dante’s first book of the Divine Comedy. The prints will be exhibited at Pembroke’s JCR Art Gallery during Trinity term. Rachel Owen, died on Sunday 18th December. ||||| Rachel Owen, artist, Oxford University lecturer and the former long-term partner of Radiohead frontman Thom Yorke, died on Sunday. She was 48 and had suffered from cancer. Owen and Yorke split last year after a 23-year-long relationship, and he announced the news in a statement. The pair have two children, Noah, who is 15, and Agnes, who is 12. This year, Yorke made reference to their split in Radiohead's most recent album, A Moon Shaped Pool. The pair met as art students at Exeter University. Owen was an artist and a printmaker but worked at Oxford University, where she was a Retained Lecturer in Italian at Pembroke College. Pembroke College announced her death in an obituary posted online on Monday. Owen had a PhD on the illustrations of the early manuscripts of Dante’s Divine Comedy. The work inspired one of her last artistic projects, a series of prints that will be exhibited at Pembroke’s JCR Art Gallery next Spring.

She was a respected scholar and artist, working as a retained lecturer in Italian at the University of Oxford's Pembroke College. Owen was an expert in medieval Italian literature and a renowned artist and printmaker. One of her last works, a series of prints inspired by the cantos of Dante's first book of The Divine Comedy, will be exhibited at Pembroke's JCR Art Gallery. Owen and Yorke were together for 23 years and had two children. Their separation in 2015 heavily influenced Radiohead's latest album, A Moon Shaped Pool."},{"question":"I love this movie, but the music at all the alumni gatherings is just stupid. The fateful game took place in 1972. That means that the protagonists graduated in 1972. But almost all of the music played at the dances etc. is from the 1950s and very early 1960s. Having just attended my 30th high school reunion, I can assure you that the last music to be played at a reunion or dance of former high school people is their parents' music. I understand the difficulty of finding relevant 1970s music -- we all know what a desolate time it was musically. But it wasn't completely bereft, and the producers of the film should have taken more care. I found those dance scenes very jarring to my otherwise willing suspension of disbelief in the rest of the film. This was a bad director and/or producer decision. Would you say this review is positive or negative? Select from: [i] negative [ii] positive","response":"Based on the context and tone of the review, it can be classified as negative. The reviewer expresses dissatisfaction with the music selection at the alumni gatherings, referring to it as \\"just stupid.\\" They also criticize the film's inability to select appropriate music from the 1970s, despite acknowledging the challenges in doing so. Furthermore, the reviewer places blame on the director and/or producer for this poor decision that negatively impacted their overall experience with the movie. In addition, the reviewer didn't mention any positive aspects to balance out their critique, so it's safe to say their review is more negative than positive."},{"question":"Q:Read the bio below and try to give details on benjamin percy 's: - caption - genre - spouse - awards - birth date - name - image - birth place - alma mater Bio: benjamin percy -lrb- born march 28 , 1979 -rrb- is a contemporary american writer .

Loosely based on Coffinman, a memoir by Shinmon Aoki, the film follows a young man who returns to his hometown after a failed career as a cellist and stumbles across work as a nokanshi--a traditional Japanese ritual mortician. He is subjected to prejudice from those around him, including from his wife, because of strong social taboos against people who deal with death. Eventually he earns their respect and learns the importance of interpersonal connections through the beauty and dignity of his work. Japanese funerals are highly ritualized affairs which are generally--though not always--conducted in accordance with Buddhist rites. In preparation for the funeral, the body is washed and the orifices are blocked with cotton or gauze. The encoffining ritual (called nokan), as depicted in Departures, is rarely performed, and even then only in rural areas. This ceremony is not standardized, but generally involves professional morticians (Na Guan Shi , nokanshi) ritually preparing the body, dressing the dead in white, and sometimes applying make-up. The body is then put on dry ice in a casket, along with personal possessions and items necessary for the trip to the afterlife. Despite the importance of death rituals, in traditional Japanese culture the subject is considered unclean as everything related to death is thought to be a source of kegare (defilement). After coming into contact with the dead, individuals must cleanse themselves through purifying rituals. People who work closely with the dead, such as morticians, are thus considered unclean, and during the feudal era those whose work was related to death became burakumin (untouchables), forced to live in their own hamlets and discriminated against by wider society. Despite a cultural shift since the Meiji Restoration of 1868, the stigma of death still has considerable force within Japanese society, and discrimination against the untouchables has continued. Until 1972, most deaths were dealt with by families, funeral homes, or nokanshi. As of 2014, about 80% of deaths occur in hospitals, and preparation of the bodies is frequently done by hospital staff; in such cases, the family often does not see the body until the funeral. A 1998 survey found that 29.5% of the Japanese population believed in an afterlife, and a further 40% wanted to believe; belief was highest among the young. Belief in the existence of a soul (54%) and a connection between the worlds of the living and the dead (64.9%) was likewise common. Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What was the greatest cultural background factor affecting the film?","response":"The greatest cultural background factor affecting the film \\"Departures\\" is the strong social taboo in Japanese culture against people who deal with death and the idea of defilement or \\"kegare\\" related to death. This causes prejudice and discrimination towards those working closely with the dead, such as morticians or nokanshi in the film."},{"question":"Sopimuksella kielletään demokratia, emmekä me voi hyväksyä sitä.

Grunge guitarists use very loud Marshall guitar amplifiers and some used powerful Mesa-Boogie amplifiers, including Kurt Cobain and Dave Grohl (the latter in early, grunge-oriented Foo Fighters songs ). Grunge has been called the rock genre with the most \\"lugubrious sound\\"; the use of heavy distortion and loud amps has been compared to a massive \\"buildup of sonic fog\\". or even dismissed as \\"noise\\" by one critic. As with metal and punk, a key part of grunge's sound is very distorted power chords played on the electric guitar.Whereas metal guitarists' overdriven sound generally comes from a combination of overdriven amplifiers and distortion pedals, grunge guitarists typically got all of their \\"dirty\\" sound from overdrive and fuzz pedals, with the amp just used to make the sound louder. Grunge guitarists tended to use the Fender Twin Reverb and the Fender Champion 100 combo amps (Cobain used both of these amps). The use of pedals by grunge guitarists was a move away from the expensive, studio-grade rackmount effects units used in other rock genres. The positive way that grunge bands viewed stompbox pedals can be seen in Mudhoney's use of the name of two overdrive pedals, the Univox Super-Fuzz and the Big Muff, in the title of their \\"debut EP Superfuzz Bigmuff\\". In the song Mudride, the band's guitars were said to have \\"growled malevolently\\" through its \\"Cro-magnon slog\\". answer the following question: What was the last name of the person who used a powerful amplifier in Foo Fighters songs?

Does the term gap mean the same thing in both these sentences?","response":"No, the term \\"gap\\" does not mean the same thing in both sentences. The word \\"gap\\" has multiple meanings, and these two sentences illustrate two different uses of the term. In the first sentence, \\"The exploring party went through the high gap in the mountains,\\" the term \\"gap\\" refers to a physical space or opening between two objects or geographic features. In this context, a gap is a passage or a break in a continuous structure, such as a mountain range or hills. It is often used to describe a natural break in the landscape that allows for easier navigation or travel through what might otherwise be a difficult or impassable terrain. Here, the exploring party utilizes this gap to traverse the mountain range. In the second sentence, \\"There was a gap in his account,\\" the term \\"gap\\" carries a different meaning. Here, it means a missing piece of information, an inconsistency, or a discrepancy in someone's explanation or narration of events. This use of the term \\"gap\\" pertains to the intangible or conceptual, not the physical. In this context, the sentence implies that there is a part of the narrative that does not add up, leaving questions or doubts about the accuracy or completeness of the individual's account. In conclusion, while the word \\"gap\\" in both sentences indicates a type of separation or opening, the nature and context of the separation differ significantly. In the first sentence, the term refers to a physical space in a landscape, while in the second, it represents a disconnection or missing component within a story or explanation."},{"question":"Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: A fellow speaker from California named Geri flew to Japan, in her favorite jeans and a casual jacket, to give her first speech. Fourteen hours later, four perfectly dressed Japanese gentlemen greeted her at Narita Airport. Smiling and bowing low, they handed her their business cards. With her bag in one hand, Geri took their cards with the other. She thanked them, glanced briefly at the cards, and put them into her jeans pocket quickly. When the five of them arrived at the hotel, they invited Geri to tea in the lobby . While sipping tea, the gentlemen presented her with a small gift which she eagerly opened. She was thrilled with the gift and shouted excitedly, \\"Oh, it's beautiful!\\" At this point, the four Japanese gentlemen stood up and, bowing only very slightly, said \\"Sayonara\\" and left immediately. Poor Geri was left astonished. What did she do wrong? Everything! Her jeans were the first gaffe. Even if you're coming off a bicycle in Japan, you do not meet c1ients casually dressed. The second mistake was Geri's handling of their business cards rudely. In Japan, the business card is one of the most important communicative tools. It is always presented and accepted respectfully with both hands. However, Geri put their cards away much too quickly. In Japan, people use business cards as a conversation starter. You chat about each other's cards and work and do not put theirs away until they gently and respectfully place yours in safekeeping. Putting it carelessly into her jeans pocket was the ultimate disrespect. Then, the fourth horror of horrors was that Geri should not have opened the gift in front of her clients. In a land where saving face is critical, it would be embarrassing to discover the gift they gave was not as nice as the one they received. What is worse, Geri hadn't even given them a gift! Question: What lesson can we draw from this story? Answer: 1). Honesty is the best policy.. 2). Think twice before you take any action.. 3). When in Rome, do as the Romans do.. 4). Don't claim to know what you don't know.. The answer is:","response":"The primary lesson we can draw from this story is the importance of cultural awareness and respect when interacting with people from different backgrounds and countries. In this case, the saying \\"When in Rome, do as the Romans do\\" best encapsulates the lesson. Geri, the speaker from California, unknowingly made a series of cultural missteps during her visit to Japan, exposing her lack of understanding of Japanese etiquette and social norms. This resulted in an uncomfortable situation and potentially damaged relationship with her Japanese hosts. Geri's first mistake was her casual attire. In Japan, people often dress more formally when interacting with clients and during business meetings, showing respect and professionalism. This can be a stark contrast to the casual approach commonly seen in Western business culture. Her second mistake was mishandling the exchange of business cards. In Japan, business cards play a significant role in establishing one's identity and professional status. Presenting and receiving them respectfully and with both hands is crucial in building relationships. Geri's next error was quickly putting away the business cards into her jeans pocket, which was considered disrespectful. In Japan, people usually hold onto the cards throughout the meeting and use them as conversation starters, learning more about each other's roles and companies in the process. Lastly, Geri's decision to open the gift in front of her hosts and not providing a gift in return was another cultural faux pas. In Japan, gifts are often exchanged to build relationships and are not typically opened in the presence of the person who gave it. This allows for maintaining face and avoiding any potential embarrassment or comparison between the gifts. From this story, we learn that understanding and respecting cultural differences are essential when interacting with people from diverse backgrounds. Familiarizing oneself with the local customs and etiquette can prevent misunderstandings, facilitate communication, and foster strong relationships built on respect and mutual understanding."},{"question":"dog or cat food, put up for retail sale, containing glucose, glucose syrup, maltodextrine or maltodextrine syrup but containing no starch or no milk products or containing <= 10% starch and < 10% by weight of milk products Repeat this setence, but with the correct capitalization.","response":"Dog or cat food, put up for retail sale, containing glucose, glucose syrup, maltodextrine or maltodextrine syrup but containing no starch or no milk products or containing <= 10% starch and < 10% by weight of milk products."},{"question":"Review: This is probably one of the worst French movies I have seen so far, among more than 100 french movies I have ever seen.

Using skeletal muscle in this way increases its size and strength. In exercises such as running, the cardiac muscle contracts faster and the heart pumps more blood. Using cardiac muscle in this way increases its strength and efficiency. Continued exercise is necessary to maintain bigger, stronger muscles. If you don’t use a muscle, it will get smaller and weaker—so use it or lose it. I am facing a new situation today: David got five exercise tips from his personal trainer, tip A, tip B, tip C, tip D, and tip E. Tip A involves weight lifting, but tip B does not involve weight lifting. Tip C involves running, but tip D does not involve running. Finally, tip E does not involve any exercise at all. David has to find out which tips are most useful for him. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: In which tip the skeletal muscle would not be bigger, tip A or tip B? A:","response":"Considering the information given in the background article, we can establish a connection between different types of exercises and their impact on various types of muscles. Specifically, weight lifting and running have different effects on the skeletal and cardiac muscles respectively. Weight lifting is suggested to result in the contraction of skeletal muscles against a resisting force. This, according to the article, leads to an increase in the size and strength of skeletal muscles. Therefore, exercises that involve weight lifting thus result in bigger, stronger skeletal muscles. On the other hand, exercises that do not involve weight lifting, naturally would not provide the same sort of resistance which contributes to the growth and strengthening of skeletal muscles. Instead, these exercises might focus more on flexibility, endurance, agility or other aspects of physical fitness, without promoting any significant muscle growth or strength. In your current situation, Tip A involves weight lifting and Tip B does not involve weight lifting. Knowing the correlation between weight lifting and skeletal muscle size and strength from the background article, we can infer that David's skeletal muscles are more likely to grow bigger with Tip A which involves weight lifting - as long as he also maintains a consistent exercise routine. In contrast, Tip B might not provide the same benefits for skeletal muscle size and strength, as it does not involve weight lifting. To answer the question, if the concern is regarding which tip would not result in bigger skeletal muscles, the answer would be Tip B. Tip B does not involve weight lifting exercise, which the background article indicates is key to increasing skeletal muscle size and strength. Without this resistance-induced muscle contraction, skeletal muscles are less likely to get bigger. In summary, according to the information provided in the background article, Tip B would not make the skeletal muscle bigger in comparison to Tip A."},{"question":"Brotherhood of Man are a British pop group who achieved success in the 1970s. They won the 1976 Eurovision Song Contest with \\"Save Your Kisses for Me\\". Created in 1969 by songwriter and record producer Tony Hiller, Brotherhood of Man was initially an umbrella title for a frequently-changing line-up of session singers. Early on, they scored a worldwide hit with the song \\"United We Stand\\". Brotherhood of Man were formed by record producer/composer Tony Hiller in 1969, and originally featured his co-writer John Goodison with Tony Burrows, Roger Greenaway, Sue Glover and Sunny Leslie. Greenaway was also a songwriter and had co-written hits such as \\"Something's Gotten Hold of My Heart\\" and \\"Melting Pot\\". Burrows was a well-known session singer, performing in various line-ups on hit singles such as the No.1 hit \\"Love Grows (Where My Rosemary Goes)\\" by Edison Lighthouse. The two female members, Glover and Leslie were an act in their own right, releasing singles as Sue and Sunny. The group came together in 1969 and began recording some songs with Hiller. Their first single \\"Love One Another\\" failed to chart, but the follow-up \\"United We Stand\\" (released in January 1970) was a worldwide hit. \\"United We Stand\\" was heavily played on British radio, and broke into the American market. The single became a Top 20 hit in the UK, Canada, and US. The song has since been used as the closing theme for television's Brady Bunch Hour and as an anthem for various causes. Burrows left the group soon after and as a four-piece, The Brotherhood of Man followed \\"United We Stand\\" with another hit, \\"Where Are You Going to My Love\\". The song charted in the UK, Canada, and US and has since been covered by Olivia Newton-John and The Osmonds among others. A debut album United We Stand followed soon after. Over the next two years, the group continued in varied line-ups. Goodison left the group at the beginning of 1971 and was replaced by American singer Hal Atkinson, Greenaway left soon after and was replaced by Russell Stone.

The gentry elite engaged in the arts as accepted pastimes of the cultured scholar-official, including painting, composing poetry, and writing calligraphy. The poet and statesman Su Shi and his associate Mi Fu (1051–1107) enjoyed antiquarian affairs, often borrowing or buying art pieces to study and copy. Poetry and literature profited from the rising popularity and development of the ci poetry form. Enormous encyclopedic volumes were compiled, such as works of historiography and dozens of treatises on technical subjects. This included the universal history text of the Zizhi Tongjian, compiled into 1000 volumes of 9.4 million written Chinese characters. The genre of Chinese travel literature also became popular with the writings of the geographer Fan Chengda (1126–1193) and Su Shi, the latter of whom wrote the 'daytrip essay' known as Record of Stone Bell Mountain that used persuasive writing to argue for a philosophical point.

Emperor Huizong was a renowned artist as well as a patron of the arts. A prime example of a highly venerated court painter was Zhang Zeduan (1085–1145) who painted an enormous panoramic painting, Along the River During the Qingming Festival. Emperor Gaozong of Song initiated a massive art project during his reign, known as the Eighteen Songs of a Nomad Flute from the life story of Cai Wenji (b. 177). This art project was a diplomatic gesture to the Jin dynasty while he negotiated for the release of his mother from Jurchen captivity in the north. contains an answer for the question: What was the last name of the person who painted an enormous panoramic painting?, what is it ?","response":"The last name of the person who painted an enormous panoramic painting is Zhang.

Step 2: Analyze the hypothesis - Our powerful computers will be cheap. - Everyone will be able to afford them. Step 3: Compare the premise and hypothesis - The premise mentions that the appeal of powerful computers is limited by their price, but it does not specifically mention that they will become cheaper in the future. - The hypothesis claims that powerful computers will be cheap and accessible to everyone. Step 4: Evaluate the consistency between the premise and hypothesis - Since the premise states that the appeal of powerful computers is limited by their price, it implies that these computers may not become cheaper as they become more powerful or acquire new skills. - The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that powerful computers will be cheap and available to everyone, which directly contradicts the premise's statement about the limiting factor of price. Step 5: Conclusion - Based on the premise provided, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis \\"Our powerful computers will be cheap, and everyone will be able to afford it.\\" is true. The premise suggests that although computers will continue to become more powerful and acquire new skills, their appeal will still be limited by their price."},{"question":"Iranian languages All Iranian languages are descended from a common ancestor, Proto-Iranian.

Her middle name, Folasade, means \\"honour confers a crown\\". Her parents, Adebisi Adu, a Nigerian lecturer in economics of Yoruba background, and Anne Hayes, an English district nurse, met in London, married in 1955 and moved to Nigeria. Her parents separated, however, and Anne Hayes returned to England, taking four-year-old Sade and older brother Banji with her to live with their grandparents near Colchester, Essex. In late 1985, the band released their second album, Promise, which peaked at number one in both the UK and the US and became the band's first album to reach number one on the US Billboard 200. The album topped the chart in 1986 and spent two weeks at the peak position. Eventually, the album went on to sell four million copies in the region and was certified four times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The album spawned two singles \\"Never as Good as the First Time\\" and \\"The Sweetest Taboo,\\" the latter of which was released as the album's lead single and stayed on the US Hot 100 for six months. \\"The Sweetest Taboo\\" peaked at number five on the US Billboard Hot 100, number one on the US adult Contemporary chart, and number three on the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks. Sade was so popular that some radio stations reinstated the '70s practice of playing album tracks, adding \\"Is It a Crime\\" and \\"Tar Baby\\" to their playlists. The following year, 1986, the band won a Grammy Award for Best New Artist.

Article: Playing with toy blocks may lead to improved language development in young children, a new study reported. Early childhood is an important period in the development of young minds. The newborn brain grows three times in size between birth and age 2. Scientists have said that certain activities during this important period may promote healthy development while others may hold it back, and development of memory and language may especially be helped by imaginative play. After six months, language scores among half of the 175 children aged 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 who were sent plastic blocks were 15 percent higher than a matched group that did not receive the free blocks, according to the study by researchers at the University of Washington in Seattle. Parents were given ideas about how to help their children play with the blocks, then were told to keep diaries of their children's activities over four days. Finally, all the parents filled out questionnaires that judged their children's vocabulary, grammar, and other language abilities. Study author Dimitri Christakis said unstructured play with blocks motivated children's thinking, memory and physical skills at a time when a child's brain is growing rapidly. \\"They are the foundation of thought and language,\\" he wrote of the skills learned from building blocks. \\"Older children begin to make up stories for these objects .\\" Such play may also take the place of less helpful activities such as watching TV, he said, adding parents ought to have doubts about some toy-makers' words. \\"An increasing number of media-based products are making ungrounded claims that they can make children smarter, more literate, and more musical,\\" Christakis said.

Finally, after what felt like hours of tense silence, Dr. Tremblay turned to Rachel and Professor Whittaker, her eyes glimmering with excitement. \\"I believe I recognize elements of this script from an ancient civilization I studied a few years ago. The civilization, known as the Eralona people, dates back thousands of years and was believed to have possessed advanced knowledge of spirituality, science, and technology. These symbols could be their sacred language which was thought to have been lost to time,\\" Dr. Tremblay revealed. For days, the trio poured over books and scholarly articles, drawing connections between the mysterious letter and the Eralona civilization. Slowly but surely, they began to unlock the secrets of the language, unveiling a cryptic message about a hidden treasure buried deep within a forgotten temple. The revelation sparked an adventurous spirit within Rachel, Professor Whittaker, and Dr. Tremblay, inspiring them to embark on an extraordinary journey to find the long-lost ancient treasure. As they set out on this intrepid quest, the trio navigated their way through ancient ruins, deciphering hidden clues and overcoming perilous traps. Bonded by their shared adventure, the trio eventually made their way to the forgotten temple mentioned in the mysterious letter. Through cunning and determination true to the spirit of adventure, they managed to locate the hidden treasure—a remarkable gemstone imbued with magical properties, which could bring balance and harmony to those who wielded its power wisely. Realizing that their discovery was not meant for them alone, Rachel, Professor Whittaker, and Dr. Tremblay opted to donate the magnificent gemstone to a prominent museum. The artifact became an invaluable piece in the global effort to study and understand the enigmatic Eralona civilization, further fueling the quest for knowledge and the spirit of human curiosity. In the end, the very letter that started off as an unknown oddity became the catalyst of an unforgettable adventure. Not only did it deepen the understanding of a lost civilization, but it forged the unbreakable friendship between Rachel, Professor Whittaker, and Dr. Eloise Tremblay. Moreover, it served as a testament to the notion that sometimes, mysteries have a way of finding those who dare to seek them out, and that bravery and determination can reveal the greatest treasures hidden within the depths of history."},{"question":"What would be an example of an positive review?","response":"Title: A Delightful Getaway at the Oceanfront Bliss Resort From the moment I set foot in the Oceanfront Bliss Resort, it was evident that this was going to be a vacation to remember.

It is a holiday paradise . The self-styled 'Ultimate Island' certainly has plenty for everyone. Where in the world ? Bali is located just off the eastern edge of the main Indonesian island of Java. To the east is the neighboring island of Lombok. To the south of Bali lies the expanse of the Indian Ocean, while to the north is the Bali Sea. The most popular resort with holidaymakers is Ubud north of Sanur. When to go? Bali has a tropical climate year round with an average daily temperature of 31degC(87degCF). The wet season is between October and April. The dry season is between May and September, and is the busiest time to visit the island as travelers take advantage of the long hot days and little rain. Beach Bali has a string of beaches, mainly in the south of the island. Head away from Bali's beaches and a totally different world awaits you. Ubud is an easily accessible jungle resort town with a good range of hotels, shops and restaurants. The active volcano of Mount Batur is a highlight and so are the mountain lakes. Family fun All of the resorts have plenty of facilities for families. In Ubud there is a monkey park, where young ones can see monkeys that are not kept in tiny cages and an elephant park where holidaymakers can ride an elephant. Eating out All of Bali's holiday resorts offer international cooking to suit every tourist's taste, with most of the better hotels having excellent restaurants. Indonesian Bintang beer is very popular. Getting around There are a limited number of local buses. The other public transport is to take the local \\"bemo\\" minibuses. These colourful little minibuses speed around the winding roads with fares negotiated on board, so it helps to speak a little of the local language. There are also taxis and both electric bikes and cars can be hired. Question: From the passage we learn that Bali is _ . Yes or no, is the answer \\"to the west of the Lombok Island\\"?

Since these statements do not contradict each other, merging these details can provide a more vivid and accurate depiction of the situation. However, to conclusively link these two statements and make a solid conclusion, it is necessary to ensure that both are referring to the same girl. To achieve this, consider any additional information that might be available, such as: 1. Time and location: Are both statements referring to the same time and place? Knowing that the situation took place at a specific point in time and location strengthens the connection between the two statements. 2. Source of information: Are these statements coming from a trustworthy and reliable source? Ensuring this strengthens the credibility of the information provided. 3.

They take the ship down and sit on the bottom to see how long they can stay down and almost get stuck. The U.S. Navy is warned about the sub.

The women's rights activist wears a determined expression on her face as she paces the dirt roads of this remote village, looking for the man who Turkish authorities say beat his wife and put her in a hospital twice in less than 12 months. \\"Have you seen Faruk?\\" she asks the village mayor's daughter. \\"He disappeared with his car.\\" \\"No one's seen him,\\" the woman replies. Some other villagers retreat behind the mud-brick walls of their homes as Yeni approaches. Convicted wife beater The man Yeni is looking for is Faruk Platin, one of the 600 residents of Kapikoy. In village of Kapikoy, where many residents eke out a living herding sheep,","response":"domestic violence has long been a hidden, unspoken problem. Even though it is a prevalent issue within the community, it remains largely unaddressed due to the deeply ingrained patriarchal values and gender norms that dictate the social behaviors and expectations of the villagers. Faruk Platin epitomizes the insidious problem of domestic violence that can be found in many rural areas like Kapikoy. As Yeni searches relentlessly for Faruk, she confronts the challenges that often plague domestic violence cases. One obstacle is a lack of cooperation from the villagers, who prioritize maintaining harmony and secrecy over working with an outsider to help a victim and bring an abuser to justice. Yeni's persistence in finding Faruk is fueled by her dedication to making a difference in the lives of women like Faruk's wife and helping to break the cycle of violence. Days turn into weeks, and Yeni continues her battle to track down Faruk. Along the way, she meets other victims of domestic violence in Kapikoy, gains the trust of some villagers and makes important allies, including a local police officer sympathetic to her cause. The officer agrees to help Yeni by keeping a watchful eye on the village and its inhabitants, looking for any clues that might lead to Faruk's whereabouts. Despite the many obstacles she encounters, Yeni remains steadfast in her resolve to find Faruk and to put an end to the abuse his wife has endured. As she scours the village and its surroundings, word of her mission gains momentum, spreading through the town and even reaching other nearby villages. The mounting pressure from her unyielding presence and a growing local concern about the violence in their midst begins to take its toll on Kapikoy's residents. Some feel compelled to finally break their silence and begin providing Yeni with valuable information. After countless hours spent piecing together the fragments of information collected over the weeks, Yeni finally finds the clue that leads her to Faruk—hiding in a dilapidated shack just outside the village. In a dramatic confrontation, she confronts Faruk about the abuse he inflicted upon his wife and demands that he take responsibility for the crimes he committed. Though Faruk initially resists Yeni's accusations and the gravity of his misdeeds, other villagers who have now gathered around the scene urge him to answer for his actions. Trembling, he confesses to his crimes, unable to escape the consequences any longer. Faruk is arrested by local law enforcement and brought to justice, while his wife is provided with the support, protection, and counseling needed to help her heal and build a safer, more hopeful future for herself and her children. Ultimately, Yeni's tireless pursuit of justice leads not only to Faruk's apprehension but also to a community-wide reckoning about the long-hidden epidemic of domestic violence plaguing their village. By confronting this deeply-rooted issue head-on, Yeni succeeds in finding the true extent of Faruk's guilt and emboldening both the victims and their community to no longer remain silent on the matter. The village of Kapikoy takes the first steps towards greater awareness, understanding, and action against domestic violence, and the villagers begin the process of healing and working together to protect the lives and rights of the women in their community."},{"question":"Solve this math problem Solve 37*o = 47*o for o.","response":"Alright, imagine you have the same amount of oranges (that's \\"o\\") in two different piles. One pile has 37 oranges and the other has 47 oranges. Now, let's try to figure out how many oranges are in each pile. The math problem says that 37 times the number of oranges is equal to 47 times the number of oranges: 37*o = 47*o. It's like saying there are two friends who have the same number of oranges (o), and the first friend got 37 oranges from another friend, while the second friend got 47 oranges from a different friend. Now, we want to know: Are the numbers of oranges the same for both friends (like, does the first friend have the same number of oranges as the second friend)? Since we know that 37 times the number of oranges equals 47 times the number of oranges, we can remove the same number of oranges from both sides. Let's remove 37 oranges from both piles. Then, we have: 0*o = 10*o (because 47*o - 37*o = 10*o) Now, we have a problem. If there are no oranges in the first pile (0*o), it means there are no oranges in the second pile as well. So, the only way this can be true is if there are zero oranges in both piles. So, the answer to the math problem is that there are no oranges (o = 0). But remember, this is just a fun way to explain a math problem and not really about oranges or fruit. The main idea is that when both sides of the equation are equal and the same variable is being multiplied, like in this case (37*o and 47*o), the only solution that makes sense is when the variable is zero (o=0)."},{"question":"Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: September 1991:In a flashback, FBI Special Agent Sean Archer (John Travolta) is taking his six year old son Michael for a ride on the Griffith Park carousel in downtown Los Angeles.

Options: - Sentence A: \\"he took the high-speed train to the moon\\" - Sentence B: \\"he took the high-speed train to his hometown\\" Let's solve this gradually.","response":"To determine which of the two sentences does not make sense, let's analyze the context and content of each sentence individually. Sentence A: \\"he took the high-speed train to the moon\\" This sentence implies that a person used a high-speed train as a mode of transport to reach the moon. However, the moon is a celestial body located in outer space, approximately 384,400 km (238,855 miles) away from Earth. Currently, trains are terrestrial means of transportation, meaning they operate only on Earth and cannot travel to space. Furthermore, no technology exists today that allows trains to transport people to the moon. Therefore, Sentence A does not make sense. Sentence B: \\"he took the high-speed train to his hometown\\" This sentence suggests that a person used a high-speed train to travel to their hometown. High-speed trains are a common mode of transportation for long-distance travel on Earth. It is feasible and makes sense for someone to use a high-speed train to go to their hometown, assuming there is a train connection between the starting point and the destination. Consequently, Sentence B does make sense. In conclusion, Sentence A: \\"he took the high-speed train to the moon\\" is the option that does not make sense when considering the context and content of both sentences."},{"question":"Question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the title of the one responsible for turning the girls of Norfolk into lesbian vampires? Jimmy and Fletch are two friends living in London, experiencing life problems. Jimmy is dumped by his unscrupulous girlfriend, and Fletch is fired from his job as a clown for punching a child. They decide to escape their woes and hike to a remote village in Norfolk that they find on an old map. As they arrive at a pub in the village, with Jimmy upset about Fletch destroying his phone, they see a number of attractive foreign female history students leaving. Hoping to find more beautiful women inside, they are greeted by a morose crowd of men and approached by a seemingly crazed vicar who believes Jimmy is a long lost descendant of a local vampire slayer. As the barman offers the two men free ale as an apology for the vicar, they learn the students they saw earlier are going to a cottage, where they are to stay the night. Jimmy and Fletch pursue the students' van, catching up to it as the engine has broken down, and are introduced to four girls (Heidi, Lotte, Anke and Trudi). They are invited to join a party on the bus. The group arrives at their destination, only to learn that a curse rests over the village and that every female child turns into a lesbian vampire on her 18th birthday. There is an old legend stating that the Vampire Queen, Carmilla, descended on the village during the night of a blood moon, killed its menfolk and seduced its women to her evil. When the ruler of the land, Baron Wolfgang Mclaren (Jimmy's great ancestor) returned from the Crusades, he discovered one of the women corrupted by Carmilla was his wife, Eva. The baron forged a sacred sword, then defeated Carmilla, but before dying, Carmilla cursed the village, adding that when the blood of the last of Mclaren's bloodline mixed with a virgin girl's blood, Carmilla would be resurrected.

They contain contrasting information about the bassist Duane Cowan's relocation. Let's examine the key differences between the two statements. Sentence 1: \\"The band then added bassist Duane Cowan, who had recently relocated from Japan to Los Angeles.\\" Here, the sentence suggests that Duane Cowan moved from Japan to Los Angeles and then joined the band. This indicates that his relocation to Los Angeles preceded his addition to the group. Additionally, the direction of the move is from Japan to Los Angeles. Sentence 2: \\"The band then added bassist Duane Cowan, who moved from Los Angeles to Japan recently.\\" In this case, the sentence implies that Duane Cowan joined the band and then relocated from Los Angeles to Japan. There is also a possibility that the move coincided with his addition to the band. Moreover, the direction of the move in this sentence is from Los Angeles to Japan, contrasting with the information presented in Sentence 1.

Translate to English","response":"In conclusion, more than 4,000 cases were suspended. To elaborate further on the statement, it appears that a significant number of legal cases faced suspension for unspecified reasons. In any legal system, the suspension of over 4,000 cases is a considerable event that may lead to various consequences. First, it is essential to understand that case suspensions can occur due to several factors. These factors may include lack of sufficient evidence, procedural errors, overburdened court systems, political interference, or matters being resolved outside of the court. Regardless of the reasons, such a tremendous scale of case suspensions can have an impact on the judiciary system and the people involved in these cases. From the perspective of the affected individuals, case suspensions can cause an array of emotions and inconvenience. The suspension of a legal case often results in postponing the resolution of the matter, which prolongs the uncertainty and anxiety for the parties involved. In some instances, this delay can impact their financial situation or personal relationships, adding extra stress to an already challenging experience. Additionally, a high volume of suspended cases has implications on the court system as well. An overburdened court system may struggle to process this backlog, resulting in prolonged wait times for the scheduling of new court dates and the resolution of other cases. This can decrease the efficiency of the court system, as well as contribute to the erosion of the public's trust in the administration of justice. Moreover, the suspension of so many cases may raise questions about the legal system's overall effectiveness and fairness. If the suspensions are due to political interference or systemic injustice, this can have long-lasting negative impacts on society's perception of the judiciary and may undermine the rule of law. On the other hand, if the suspensions are primarily due to procedural errors or mismanagement, this highlights the need for improvements in the legal processes and court administration. In any case, the suspension of more than 4,000 cases is a clear indicator of underlying issues that need to be examined and addressed. To maintain public trust in the legal system and ensure that justice is served, it is crucial to investigate the reasons behind such a massive surge in case suspensions, implement appropriate measures to process the backlog, and take necessary steps to improve and prevent similar occurrences in the future."},{"question":"Process: - The saliva breaks down the chemicals in the food a bit, which helps make the food mushy and easy to swallow - Your tongue helps out, pushing the food around while you chew with your teeth - The esophagus moves food from the back of your throat to your stomach - Strong muscles in the walls of the stomach and gastric juices break down food in your stomach - Your stomach moves the food into the intestines to complete digestion - Question: suppose during dieting happens, how will it affect LESS digestion occuring. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect","response":"B: less"},{"question":"Generate a short movie review that has negative sentiment.","response":"Title: Fade to Darkness Directed by: John Doe Starring: Jane Smith, Michael Roberts, and Eliza Johnson Fade to Darkness, director John Doe's latest attempt to leave an indelible mark on the world of cinema, sinks under the weight of its own misguided ambitions. Like a vessel swallowed up by the depths of the ocean, this film fails to captivate its audience, leaving them floundering in a sea of bafflement and disappointment. The plot, if one dares to call it that, follows the dreary story of a high-school musician (Jane Smith) who, in a desperate attempt to escape her small town and gain recognition, embarks on a journey that ultimately leads her down a path of despair and disillusionment. This tired narrative, riddled with clichés and overwrought tropes, feels like a retread of countless other coming-of-age stories that have graced the silver screen in years past. The performances offered by the cast members are nothing short of exasperating. Jane Smith's portrayal of the protagonist comes across as wooden and unconvincing, divorcing the viewer from any emotional connection with her plight. Further exacerbating the issue, Michael Roberts and Eliza Johnson are the epitome of insipidness in their roles as Smith's disloyal boyfriend and overly-concerned friend respectively. Director John Doe's failure to elicit anything resembling a worthwhile performance from his cast only adds to the movie's creative bankruptcy. His heavy-handed direction does little to salvage the flimsy script, and his obsession with dimly-lit, moody scenes only serves to numb the viewer, dragging down the pace of an already languid film. At its core, Fade to Darkness appears to be an attempt at an introspective contemplation of self-discovery and the pursuit of individual identity in a world of confusion and disillusionment. Unfortunately, the film's inability to present these themes in a unique and engaging manner only amplifies its lack of charm and creativity. The film's technical aspects also contribute to its downfall. The cinematography, though passable, is marred by an apparent overreliance on shaky camera movement and suffocating close-ups, doing little to enhance the viewing experience. The soundtrack, too, fails to resonate, with the score and needle drop selections feeling both disjointed and incoherent. In conclusion, Fade to Darkness is a film that suffers from an uninspired script, unremarkable performances, and aimless direction. Its attempt at offering a profound and meaningful exploration of an individual's journey to self-discovery ultimately falls flat, leaving viewers with a sense of emptiness, and quite frankly, an immense longing for the film's credits to finally roll. This is one cinematic misadventure best left consigned to the shadows of obscurity."},{"question":"If You were supposed to just stand there and be hopelessly authentic., can we conclude that \\"You were supposed to just be authentic.\\"?","response":"Yes, little buddy!

Here is a hypothesis: One such example is in 2009 when the newspaper \\"The Guardian\\" directly created a story in order to increase clicks and ad revenue. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","response":"Okay, let's break it down like this: A premise is like a starting idea. In this case, the premise is that news sometimes changes the rules to change the results. A hypothesis is like a guess or an example we want to investigate. In this case, the hypothesis is about how The Guardian newspaper created a story in 2009 to get more people to click and make more money from ads. Now, we want to know if the premise being true means the hypothesis is also true. The answer is: not necessarily. Even if the premise is true and news sometimes changes the rules for certain results, we can't be sure that the specific example with The Guardian in 2009 is also true. We would need more information and evidence to be sure. So, if the premise is true, it's possible that the hypothesis could be true, but we can't know for sure just based on the premise alone."},{"question":"Short general knowledge question: what currency is used in hungary? The answer to this question is:","response":"Hungary, a Central European nation rich in history and culture, uses the Hungarian Forint (abbreviation: HUF) as its official national currency. The currency was introduced on August 1, 1946, replacing the Pengő, which had suffered extreme hyperinflation in the years following World War II. The transition to the Hungarian Forint brought stability to Hungary's economy and helped counter the negative effects of inflation. The Forint is issued and regulated by the Magyar Nemzeti Bank (MNB), Hungary's central bank, which was established in 1924. The name 'Forint' is derived from the city of Florence, Italy, where gold coins called fiorino d'oro were minted in the 14th century. These florentines were used for trade throughout Europe, and their popularity eventually led to several European countries adopting the name for their currencies. Hungarian Forint banknotes are available in denominations of 500, 1,000, 2,000, 5,000, 10,000, and 20,000 HUF, while coins come in denominations of 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, and 200 HUF. The larger banknotes showcase the portraits of eminent Hungarian historical figures, such as King Matthias Corvinus, while the reverse sides often depict iconic landmarks or symbols of Hungarian heritage. Although Hungary joined the European Union (EU) in 2004, it has not yet adopted the Euro as its official currency. The country is part of the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM II), which is designed to reduce the exchange rate variability between EU member states' currencies and the Euro. However, Hungary has not yet met all the necessary criteria to join the Eurozone, and no specific timetable has been set for the country to adopt the Euro. In summary, the Hungarian Forint serves as the official currency of Hungary and plays an essential role in the nation's economic stability. Despite Hungary's membership in the European Union, the country has not yet transitioned to the Euro and continues to use the Forint as its national currency."},{"question":"our costa rica's call center nearshore it department features an integrated team of bilingual bpo technicians, creative designers, writers, programmers and marketing professionals that know everything about technologies and internet business to get online results.

The original premise states there are two toddlers, one in purple and one in white, sitting before each other on a wood floor. 2. The provided condition is that the toddlers live in the house. Now, let's think: To determine if the premise is true, we need to evaluate whether the information about the toddlers' living situation (in the house) affects the accuracy of the premise. Currently, nothing in the premise contradicts the given condition. However, it does not provide enough information about their location at the time they are sitting before each other. Justify: Though we know that the toddlers live in the house, we cannot definitively say whether they are sitting before each other on a wood floor inside or outside that house just based on the given information. Conclusion: We cannot determine if the premise is true or false based solely on the given condition that the toddlers live in the house, as it does not provide enough information about their location in relation to where they are sitting on the wood floor."},{"question":"Article:The hugely contentious area of abortion is one of them. The previous justice minister, David Ford, tried and failed to change the law. When asked on Wednesday how she would deal with the issue, Ms Sugden said her approach would be \\"subtle\\". But subtle is not a word many would use to describe the debate on proposed changes to the law during the past year. The new minister was assured she has and will have the \\"full confidence\\" and \\"full support\\" of the first and deputy first ministers. That is something that Mr Ford never enjoyed. With the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in diametrically opposed on the proposed changes to abortion law, that declaration of support will be strongly tested. On another contentious issue - same sex marriage - Sugden has said she plans to talk to executive ministers behind closed doors in attempt to change the approach to the issue. Of course, prisons are also highly contentious. As the daughter of a former prison officer, Ms Sugden will be more aware than most of the complexities and dangers involved. Two prison officers, David Black and Adrian Ismay, were killed during Mr Ford's time as minister, and the threat remains high. She will also be aware that her family background means every decision she makes about prisons, and the staff who work in them, will be subjected to intense scrutiny. A major reform programme has been under way for a number of years and a huge amount of work remains to be done. It was only seven months ago that a team of inspectors described Northern Ireland's high security prison at Maghaberry near Lisburn as one of the most dangerous in Europe. A follow up report in February said the situation had stabilised and improved, but it was far from a clean bill of health. Getting the funding needed to implement comprehensive reform, and improve the fabric of the prison estate, will be a huge challenge. It will also be another test of the promised support of Arlene Foster and Martin McGuinness. Policing is another area of intense public and political scrutiny. The chief constable is operationally independent, but it is up to the justice minister to set high level policy objectives and, most importantly, to determine the PSNI's annual budget. George Hamilton has said several times since his appointment that budget cuts have had a huge impact on the ability of his officers to do their jobs. So the new minister probably will not have to wait long for a chunky business case to land on her desk setting out why the PSNI needs more resources. Ms Sugden faces a huge task. Mr Ford has said publicly that he could only do the job of justice minister with the assistance of a very able Special Advisor (SPAD), and the support of his fellow MLAs and the Alliance party apparatus at Stormont. His successor does not have a party to turn to for advice or support. It is herself alone. A summary of the above article is?","response":"The new Justice Minister for Northern Ireland, Claire Sugden, has her work cut out for her as she attempts to tackle contentious issues such as abortion laws, same sex marriage, prison reform, and policing.

Sugden also plans to discuss the matter of same sex marriage with executive ministers privately, hoping to alter their stance on the issue. Furthermore, the justice minister will have to manage ongoing prison reforms and work on the annual budget for the Police Service of Northern Ireland, adding to her already extensive list of responsibilities."},{"question":"– Several more bodies have been brought ashore following South Korea's ferry disaster, bringing the death toll to 226 with 76 still missing, Yonhap News reports.

You can use this map in each room of your home to help you know what to place where. Specific spots in the room and specific objects have best possible energies, and the map helps you determine those spots. There is simple version of the map with just the names of the sections, and a more complicated version which gives examples of what all is represented by that section. Align the bottom portion of the map with the door/entryway to the room. Arrange the things that apply to each section on the map in the proper place in your room. In the lower left, place books which represent wisdom. In the middle right, which is “child” and represents creativity, place a musical instrument you play or a place where you can paint. It will take time and careful consideration, but if you want to apply feng shui properly, you need to give the process the proper time. Understanding the map and learning what each section represents is the only way you can apply it properly. Some versions of the Bagua map will have slightly different titles than these listed, but the basic idea of each section is intact. Lower left: Knowledge and growth, which can apply to learning and studying, investing in spiritual wisdom and faith, and personal growth. Lower-middle: Career and work success, which focuses on success in current jobs, getting promotions, moving to new careers, and achieving goals. Lower-right: Travel and helpful people, which applies to safety in travels, relocating to new places, seeking people who will help and mentor you in life. Middle-left: Family relationships and health, which means investing in the strength of your family, expanding your social life, and being committed to personal health. Center: Self or well being, which seeks to achieve harmony with yourself and environment, promote health and overcome illness, increase endurance and vitality. Middle-right: Child or creativity, which represents unlocking creativity, bettering communication and building the future. Upper-left: Wealth and power, which seeks prosperity, generating cash flow, and promoting abundance. Upper-center: Reputation and fame, which seeks public attention, becoming well known, and creating a strong reputation. Upper-right: Love and marriage, which includes improving relationships, attracting love, and increasing self-esteem. This map is a guide for what parts of the room are best for certain objects. It’s very important that you do your best to include something for every section because feng shui is all about creating balance. So if you load one section of the room, maybe the wealth section with ledgers and your piggy bank, but you neglect another section, you will upset the balance of the room. Maybe you don’t have a specific object, or enough space, to place something in every section. Something you can do instead is write down on a piece of paper something you care about which represents that or something you desire that represents that section. This can be a stand-in for the actual object. It’s also important to note that sometimes due to room or house layouts, parts of the map may be missing or partial. You can symbolically apply the feng shui to the wall where the missing section would be. Just make your intent for the missing section clear when you place something there. If you have broken objects around the house, especially things that you use frequently, they are likely to cause you frustration, which leads to negative energy in your home. To counteract this, it’s highly advised that you fix things as soon as they break to promote calm and good energy. The five elements of life are fire, water, earth, wood, and metal. Good feng shui in any room or home means having a mix of these elements. Most rooms will have a few of these already, depending on the structure of the room and furniture present. Look around your room and see what elements are already present and consider ways to add the remaining. Candles are the easiest way to add fire to any room. Faucets already bring running water, but in rooms without faucets, consider buying a small fountain which can constantly be running water. Plants are a great way to add earth to a room. If you can’t easily incorporate something physically made of the element, hanging a picture that represents the element is a good alternative. The door to the home is where the energy flows in, so make sure you use the front door as much as you can. If you typically enter through a door besides the main one, consider purposefully using the front door a few times a week to keep good energy flowing in. It’s hard to maintain good energy throughout the house if the door is always closed. If you are having trouble understanding the principles of feng shui, or your particular home is not cooperating with your endeavors, consider hiring a professional who can give you advice on how to apply feng shui to your specific living space. What is a summary?","response":"Feng shui is an ancient Chinese practice focused on creating balance and harmony in one's living environment. The Bagua map is a tool used to divide a room or space into nine sections, each representing a key aspect of life. By aligning the map with the room's entryway and placing objects that represent each aspect in their respective sections, one can establish a flow of positive energy and create well-being. The nine sections of the Bagua map focus on knowledge and growth, career and work success, travel and helpful people, family relationships and health, personal well-being, creativity and child, wealth and power, reputation and fame, and love and marriage. It is crucial to include objects that represent each section to maintain balance in the room. If space or resources are limited, writing down desires or goals for each section can serve as a stand-in until a physical object is obtained. In cases where a section is missing or partial due to the layout of the house, symbolic applications may be used. To further enhance the space's energy, it is essential to have a mix of the five elements of life - fire, water, earth, wood, and metal. Each element can be introduced through various objects, such as candles for fire, fountains for water, and plants for earth. If physical items cannot be included, images or pictures representing the elements can be used as alternatives. Using the front door regularly helps maintain positive energy flow throughout the house. Fixing broken items promptly minimizes negative energy caused by frustration, promoting calm and harmonious energy. If applying feng shui principles is challenging or confusing, consider consulting a feng shui professional to receive personalized recommendations for your living space."},{"question":"This is some data: Twilight (band), genre, Black metal; Aaron Turner, associatedBand/associatedMusicalArtist, Twilight (band); Aaron Turner, instrument, Singing; Black metal, musicFusionGenre, Death metal.

No Q: Carson told Ash the story of how his grandmother lost three children to the flu back in the days before medical advancement. Given the question \\"How would Ash feel as a result?\\", is \\"upset and sad it happened\\" a valid answer? A:","response":"A: Yes, \\"upset and sad it happened\\" is a valid answer as to how Ash would feel as a result of hearing Carson's story about his grandmother losing three children to the flu. This answer is plausible for several reasons, which can be understood by considering various aspects such as empathy, the role of storytelling, and common human experiences. 1. Empathy: Human beings have a natural tendency to empathize with each other's emotions and experiences. Empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of another person, which helps in forming social connections. When Ash listens to Carson's tragic story, he would likely feel empathy for Carson's grandmother and the immense loss she endured. This empathetic response would lead Ash to feel upset and sad about the unfortunate events that occurred. 2. The role of storytelling: People often share personal stories as a means of conveying complex emotions, experiences, and ideas. When Carson relates the story of his grandmother's struggles, he is not only sharing a historical account but also inviting Ash to connect on an emotional level. Storytelling is a powerful tool for eliciting emotional responses, and hearing such a heart-wrenching tale would reasonably cause Ash to feel sadness and melancholy. 3. Common human experiences: Although the specific details of Carson's story about his grandmother may be unique, the themes of loss, grief, and adversity are universal human experiences. These emotions transcend cultural, social, and generational boundaries, meaning that Ash could easily relate to the pain and suffering that Carson's grandmother went through. This shared understanding of loss could foster a sense of mutual sadness in both Ash and Carson. 4. Impact of medical advancements: The context of the story, which is set before significant medical advancements, is also worth considering. This would likely highlight for Ash how fortunate we are in the present day to have access to advanced medical technologies and treatments and instill a sense of gratitude while still feeling upset and sad about the past events. This could further deepen Ash's emotional reaction to Carson's story as he contemplates the distressing situation at the time. In conclusion, the answer \\"upset and sad it happened\\" is indeed a valid response to the question of how Ash would feel after hearing Carson's story about his grandmother. Such feelings can be attributed to empathy, the power of storytelling, the universality of human experiences, and the impact of medical advancements."},{"question":"Q:Extract the answer to the question from the following context.

N. Padfield. As well as his non-fiction work, he has also published four novels. Hypothesis: Peter L.N. Padfield liked writing naval history but didn't enjoy writing fiction as much.","response":"Based on the provided context, it is not possible to definitively draw the hypothesis that Peter L.N. Padfield liked writing naval history but didn't enjoy writing fiction as much. The context only provides factual information about Padfield's career and works, but does not offer direct insight into his personal preferences or level of enjoyment for different types of writing. However, we can analyze the given context and form a speculative point of view on Peter L. N. Padfield's interests and preferences. Peter is described as a British author, biographer, historian, and journalist who specializes in naval history and the Second World War period. The mention of his specialization might suggest that he has a keen interest in the discussed historical topics. Being an author of non-fiction work and non-fiction novels may also imply that he has expertise and passion in these subjects. It is also important to note that he has published four novels alongside his non-fiction works. The presence of fiction in his repertoire shows that he explored different writing styles and genres of literature. This may point to a certain level of interest in writing fiction, but it does not provide enough information to determine if he liked it more or less than writing non-fiction on naval history. The fact that his early journalistic work is under the name \\"P. L. N. Padfield\\" may indicate that he wanted to separate his fiction and non-fiction writing identities. This distinction might suggest that he maintained different focuses and motivations across the two categories. However, this still does not explicitly convey whether he enjoyed writing fiction or naval history more. Overall, the context only allows us to make educated guesses and inferences about Peter L.N. Padfield's preferences based on his career and works. To draw a more concrete hypothesis, further information about his thoughts and feelings towards writing naval history and fiction would be required."},{"question":"Write an article based on this summary: – The Philippines is making headlines on two fronts: First, somebody leaked a transcript of President Trump's phone call to Filipino counterpart Rodrigo Duterte last month. Second, Duterte, already renowned for his brutal crackdown on drugs, is considering imposing martial law nationwide as his troops battle militants linked to ISIS. The details: Praise on drugs: “I just wanted to congratulate you because I am hearing of the unbelievable job on the drug problem,\\" Trump told him. \\"Many countries have the problem, we have a problem, but what a great job you are doing and I just wanted to call and tell you that.” Duterte has been criticized by human rights groups for essentially declaring open season on drug dealers and users. Troops and vigilantes have killed an estimated 6,000 drug dealers since July, per the State Department, notes the Washington Post. Swipe at Obama? Duterte called drugs the \\"scourge of my nation,\\" and Trump said he understood, adding, \\"I think we had a previous president who did not understand that.\\" North Korea: “We can’t let a madman with nuclear weapons let on the loose like that. We have a lot of firepower, more than he has, times 20—but we don’t want to use it,\\" Trump said. He asked Duterte if he thought Kim were \\"stable or not stable,\\" and Duterte said unstable, adding that China is the \\"ace\\" card to be played. \\"It's only China.\\" Not-so-secret submarines: Trump told Duterte the US had \\"a lot of firepower over there,\\" referring to the Korean peninsula, and he specifically mentioned two nuclear submarines, \\"the best in the world.\\" The revelation is likely to raise more questions about Trump's handling of sensitive information, notes Reuters. Transcript: Here is the transcript of the phone call, from the Intercept. Trump's style: The New York Times says it sheds light on how he deals with fellow leaders: \\"He sounds much the way he sounds in public, casing issues in largely black-and-white terms, often praising authoritarian leaders, largely unconcerned about human rights violations and genuinely uncertain about the nature of his adversary in North Korea.\\" Hostages: Duterte has declared martial law in the southern island of Mindanao after militants affiliated with ISIS raided the city of Marawi. The militants took a Catholic priest and 13 others hostage, and thousands of civilians were fleeing the violence. The CBC has details. Mindanao also happens to be Duterte's native island in the archipelago. Nationwide? Duterte hinted he might expand martial law nationwide after suggesting ISIS also was showing strength in the northern island of Luzon, reports Bloomberg. Ominous quote: \\"If I think you should die, you will die. If you fight us, you will die. If there's an open defiance you will die and if it means many people dying, so be it. That's how it is,\\" said Duterte, per Reuters.","response":"The Philippines is currently in the international spotlight due to two recent developments. Firstly, reports emerged detailing a conversation between US President Donald Trump and Filipino President Rodrigo Duterte last month. Secondly, Duterte, who is already well known for his harsh crackdown on drugs, is considering extending martial law across the entire country as his forces fight against militants connected to ISIS. During the now-public telephone call, Trump congratulated Duterte on his approach to the Philippines’ drug problem, stating that he had done an “unbelievable job”. Duterte has previously been criticized by human rights campaigners for enabling the killing of drug dealers and users. Since he assumed power last July, Filipino troops and vigilantes have executed an estimated 6,000 drug dealers, according to the US State Department and the Washington Post. The conversation between Trump and Duterte also touched on former President Obama, who Duterte labeled as the “scourge” of his nation. Trump sympathized, claiming that Obama failed to “understand” the situation in the Philippines. The two leaders continued their conversation by discussing North Korea. Trump stated that the US could not risk the threat posed by Kim Jong Un, who he described as a “madman with nuclear weapons let on the loose like that”. Although Trump was keen to mention the significant firepower possessed by the US, he also stressed that he was not hoping to use it. In turn, Duterte classified Kim as “unstable”, suggesting that China holds the key in the developing situation. A fascinating aspect of Trump’s discussion with Duterte related to US submarines. Trump stated that the US had “a lot of firepower over there” referring to the Korean Peninsula. He specifically cited two nuclear submarines, which he claimed were \\"the best in the world\\". The involvement of nuclear submarines is likely to provoke further questions regarding Trump's handling of classified information. The leaked transcript of the telephone call provides some insight into Trump’s interactions with other leaders. It seems that his characteristic blunt style is ever present, both in public and private situations. Furthermore, he frequently offers praise to authoritarian rulers, often seeming unconcerned about the potential human rights abuses that could be tied to such regimes. In the meantime, numerous hostages have been taken in the southern island of Mindanao by ISIS-affiliated militants, prompting Duterte to declare martial law. Thousands of citizens have been displaced as a result of the ongoing violence. Furthermore, Duterte himself has hinted that he might extend martial law across the entire country, as he feels that ISIS is making its presence known on the northern island of Luzon. Duterte’s uncompromising approach to the situation has been clearly demonstrated in recent statements: “If I think you should die, you will die. If you fight us, you will die. If there's an open defiance you will die and if it means many people dying, so be it. That's how it is,” he announced to Reuters."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: After winning the 74th Hunger Games, Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) return home to District 12.

After the small parts are melted to make new raw parts, these raw materials are then used in the manufacturing of various new products. The type of new product depends on the type of raw material that has been recycled. For example, recycled aluminum can be used to create new aluminum cans, paper can be turned into cardboard, and plastic can be used in manufacturing new plastic products. Once the new products are created from the recycled raw materials, they undergo a quality control process to ensure they meet the necessary standards for their intended purpose. Following the quality control process, the new products are packaged and stored, ready for transportation. The new products are then transported and distributed to various retail stores, wholesalers, and other businesses, where they are ultimately sold to the customers as reused or recycled products. This not only contributes to the circular economy by reducing the need for virgin raw materials, but also promotes environmental sustainability and resource conservation. In summary, the final step of the recycling process is the creation, distribution, and sale of new products made from the recycled raw materials, which completes the recycling loop and contributes to a more sustainable and eco-friendly world."},{"question":"This House would Censor the Internet What is a possible side to this debate?","response":"A possible side to this debate is the side that supports censoring the Internet.

For a data set, it may be thought of as the \\"middle\\" value. For example, in the data set {1, 3, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9}, the median is 6, the fourth largest, and also the fourth smallest, number in the sample. For a continuous probability distribution, the median is the value such that a number is equally likely to fall above or below it. The median is a commonly used measure of the properties of a data set in statistics and probability theory. The basic advantage of the median in describing data compared to the mean (often simply described as the \\"average\\") is that it is not skewed so much by extremely large or small values, and so it may give a better idea of a \\"typical\\" value. For example, in understanding statistics like household income or assets which vary greatly, a mean may be skewed by a small number of extremely high or low values. Median income, for example, may be a better way to suggest what a \\"typical\\" income is. Because of this, the median is of central importance in robust statistics, as it is the most resistant statistic, having a breakdown point of 50%: so long as no more than half the data are contaminated, the median will not give an arbitrarily large or small result. What are the answers to this following set of questions: 1. What is of great importance in robust statistics? 2. The median is a measure of what? 3. A data set within what? 4. What is the advantage of the median? 5. Skewed so much as what? 6. What other helpful measure does it give? 7. What can skew a mean? 8.

Then what will happen?","response":"1. In robust statistics, the median is of great importance because it is less sensitive to outliers and extreme values compared to other measures like the mean. 2. The median is a measure of central tendency, which represents the middle value in a data set or distribution. 3. A data set can be defined as a collection of numerical values, observations, or measurements. 4. The advantage of the median is that it is less influenced by extreme values and provides a better representation of a \\"typical\\" value in the data set. This is particularly useful when dealing with skewed data or data with outliers. 5. The median is not skewed as much by extremely large or small values compared to the mean. 6. The median gives a helpful measure of the central value in a data set or distribution, offering a more accurate representation of what can be considered a \\"typical\\" value. 7. A mean can be skewed by a small number of extremely high or low values, which may cause the mean to be less representative of the central tendency of the entire data set. 8. Yes, in robust statistics, the median is considered the most resistant statistic due to its ability to withstand contamination from extreme values. 9. For a continuous probability distribution, the median is the value that divides the distribution in such a way that a number is equally likely to fall above or below it. 10. For a data set, the median can be described as the middle value when the data is arranged in ascending order. If there is an even number of data points, the median is the average of the two middle values. 11. In robust statistics, the median has a breakdown point of 50%, meaning it can tolerate up to 50% of contaminated data without providing an arbitrarily large or small result. 12. The median can't have more than half of the data contaminated. 13. If more than half of the data is contaminated, the median may no longer be an accurate representation of the central tendency of the data set, and its result may be significantly affected by the contaminated values."},{"question":"Translate \\"And meanwhile, at the international negotiating table, from the GATT to the WTO, our interests are not being protected.\\" to Finnish?","response":"Step 1: Identify the main subject, objects, and actions in the sentence. - main subject: \\"our interests\\" - objects: \\"the international negotiating table\\", \\"the GATT\\", \\"the WTO\\" - actions: \\"are not being protected\\" Step 2: Translate the key terms into Finnish. - \\"meanwhile\\" = \\"sillä välin\\" - \\"international negotiating table\\" = \\"kansainvälinen neuvottelupöytä\\" - \\"GATT\\" = \\"GATT\\" (abbreviation doesn't change) - \\"WTO\\" = \\"WTO\\" (abbreviation doesn't change) - \\"our interests\\" = \\"meidän etumme\\" - \\"not being protected\\" = \\"ei suojata\\" Step 3: Arrange the Finnish translations of each key term into a sentence that maintains the original meaning and has proper grammar. - \\"Sillä välin, kansainvälisellä neuvottelupöydällä, GATT:sta WTO:on, meidän etujamme ei suojata.\\" Final translation: \\"Sillä välin, kansainvälisellä neuvottelupöydällä, GATT:sta WTO:on, meidän etujamme ei suojata.\\""},{"question":"Please answer the following question: - The dishwasher heats the water - The detergent dispenser opens at the right time - Water is shot through the jets to clean the dishes - The dirty water is drained - More water is sprayed to rinse the dishes - The water is drained again - The air is heated in the dishwasher to dry the dishes. What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","response":"The first step in the process of a dishwasher cycle begins with preparing and loading the dishes properly. This ensures optimal cleaning performance and efficiency throughout the entire procedure. Here's a detailed description of the first step, along with an in-depth look at the rest of the steps involved in a dishwasher cycle: 1. Preparing and loading the dishes: Before starting the dishwasher cycle, it is crucial to ensure that the dishes are properly prepared and loaded to achieve the best cleaning results. Remove large food particles from the dishes, but there is no need to pre-rinse them, as modern dishwashers are designed to handle food residue. Load the dishes in the dishwasher racks, ensuring that they are placed securely and that each item has adequate space around it for water to reach all surfaces. Distribute the weight evenly, and make sure nothing obstructs the spray arms or the detergent dispenser. 2. The dishwasher heats the water: Once the dishwasher is started, it begins by filling the base with water, typically taken from the household's hot water supply. The dishwasher may also contain a built-in heating element to further increase the water temperature to a specific level (usually between 110°F to 170°F), which is necessary to dissolve detergents and remove grease effectively. 3. The detergent dispenser opens at the right time: The dispenser releases detergent into the dishwasher at the scheduled time during the wash cycle. This typically occurs after the dishwasher has filled with water and heated it to the desired temperature. This ensures the detergent is added at the optimum moment for maximum cleaning efficiency. 4. Water is shot through the jets to clean the dishes: The dishwasher pump propels the heated water mixed with detergent through the spray arms, causing it to forcefully spray onto the dishes in the upper and lower racks. This action dislodges the dirt and food particles from the surfaces of the dishes, breaking down grease and stains. 5. The dirty water is drained: After the initial wash cycle is complete, the dishwasher drains the dirty water out through the drain hose and into the household plumbing system. This step removes the majority of the food residues and detergents from the dishwasher. 6. More water is sprayed to rinse the dishes: Following the drainage of dirty water, the dishwasher fills with fresh water and heats it once more. Then, it sprays the clean water over the dishes to rinse off any remaining detergent or loosened food particles. 7. The water is drained again: Similar to the previous drainage step, the dishwasher now drains the rinse water to remove leftover contaminants and ensure that the dishes are thoroughly cleaned. 8. The air is heated in the dishwasher to dry the dishes: During the final stage of the process, the dishwasher activates its heating element or a fan to either heat the air or circulate it within the appliance. This step dries the dishes and eliminates any lingering moisture. After this, the dishwasher cycle is complete, and the dishes can be unloaded and put away. In summary, the first step in the dishwasher process is properly preparing and loading the dishes into the appliance. Each subsequent step ensures the effective cleaning, rinsing, and drying of the dishes until the entire process is completed, leaving you with spotless and dry dishes, ready to be used again."},{"question":"Question: Build a movie plot around this: While in Las Vegas Mallory calls Doug and he states? he and lois will always be there for her Answer:","response":"Title: High Stakes Hearts Plot Summary: In the bustling city of Las Vegas, Mallory, an ambitious event planner, is hired by a wealthy couple to organize an extravagant surprise anniversary party.

Uranus is categorized as an \\"ice giant\\" along with Neptune due to their distinct compositions compared to the larger gas giants, Jupiter and Saturn. Both Uranus and Neptune have a higher proportion of \\"ices\\" such as water, ammonia, and methane in their compositions. The interior of Uranus is primarily composed of ices and rock, which differentiates it substantially from the interiors of Jupiter and Saturn, whose compositions are mainly hydrogen and helium. In summary, the farthest point away from the interior of Uranus can be found in its outermost atmospheric layer, consisting of hydrogen, helium, and traces of methane. This outer layer is what gives Uranus its unique blue-green appearance."},{"question":"Continue the following story. John liked the old maps better than the new templates because the Choose your answer from: [a]. new templates are hard to read.. [b]. old maps are hard to read..","response":"[a]. new templates are hard to read. John liked the old maps better than the new templates because the new templates were hard to read. Even though many people praised the modern designs and features, he found them to be excessively complicated. They had an array of symbols, colors, and patterns that might be helpful for some, but for John, it was a constant struggle to comprehend. Step by step, he would go through the keys provided with a magnifying glass - a tool that had become his maps' best friend. But even so, the process remained tedious and problematic. First, he would locate the specific icon he needed to decipher, then cross-reference it with the key, a process he felt took far too long and often diverted his attention from the actual task at hand – to find the quickest and most efficient route to his destination. In contrast, the old maps had a simplicity that John cherished. Despite their lack of modern features and interactivity, those maps were straightforward and served the purpose he required - directing him to the correct location. They provided just enough detail without bombarding him with information and symbols that cluttered his thought process. The old maps allowed John to read them at a glance, focusing on the geographical features and notable landmarks pertinent to his journey. His familiarity with the area was often enough to compensate for the dated information on those aged depictions of roads and landscapes. Plus, there was something indescribably charming and nostalgic about holding a printed map with beautiful, hand-drawn illustrations of the world. Consequently, John decided to stick with the old maps, which he located from various second-hand bookshops, antique stores, and online auctions. Each time he acquired a new, yet old, map, he would gently unfold it, marveling at the craftsmanship and history imbued in its pages. In his daily life, John began to advocate for the continued use of old maps, urging others to consider the benefits of adopting a simplistic and more focused approach while navigating. Although his friends would often tease him about his seemingly old-fashioned preferences, they could not deny the sense of purpose and satisfaction John exhibited as he carried on with his cartographic treasure hunts. And in doing so, he never lost his way."},{"question":"Question: Read the following conversation and answer the question. W: That's a had cough. M: Yes, it's because I smoke.

Or maybe it did? The first night of filming at the Thornbury Bowls Club was for a test shoot with mine and Rosie’s camera, to work out which one we wanted to use for her film. The second night of filming involved us getting establishing shots of the location. The third night of filming involved us mainly shooting Rosie’s script. And the fourth night of shooting involved us mainly shooting Bell’s script and getting any other shots we needed to get. Perhaps we didn’t need an entire night of filming just to get establishing shots and filler shots, but it certainly made it a lot easier having multiple shots to choose from. For the two nights of shooting we certainly didn’t get that much coverage, which meant in the edit we were somewhat stuck using certain shots because we didn’t have other options. This was mainly because of time limitations with actors and batteries on cameras dying and such. I’m so neurotic I would have happily spent two nights shooting establishing shots and filler shots and two nights on each shoot, but not everyone wants to rearrange the rest of their life to fit around such projects. I get a tad obsessive if I’m allowed, which can often benefit me, although I do become a giant pain in everyone else’s ass. The main thing I learnt from the filming process was that you can plan out exactly what you want to do, and how your going to do it, but once you get into the location with the actors this plan often changes – however, you are still much better of having the plan than none at all! As the neurotic freak I am, I had all the shots I wanted to use storyboarded. I had originally planned to shoot all the establishing shots, stick them in a timeline and then also shoot the other shots (with fill in actors) and add them to the timeline to see how it looked. Of course no one else was interested in spending an entire night shooting the film – but with them as stands in – just so I could complete my psychotic endeavour of...

In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, yeast, and sugar. Then add the water and stir the ingredients to barely combine everything.","response":"Once the ingredients are barely combined, use a sturdy wooden spoon or your hands to bring the dough together, working it for about ten minutes or until the dough becomes smooth, elastic, and slightly tacky to the touch. As you continue to knead and stretch the dough, the gluten in the spelt flour will begin to strengthen and develop, creating the bread's structure and texture. If the dough feels too dry or crumbly, add a small amount of water, one tablespoon at a time, to adjust the consistency. On the other hand, if the dough is too sticky, you can add a bit more spelt flour to achieve the right balance. Once the dough is at the desired consistency, form it into a ball and allow it to rest in a lightly greased bowl, covered with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap, for an hour or until it has doubled in size. After the resting period, punch down the dough gently to release the trapped air, shape it into a loaf, and transfer it to a greased or parchment-lined baking sheet or loaf pan. Allow the shaped dough to rise once more, approximately 30 to 45 minutes, until it has expanded to nearly double in size again. Meanwhile, preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C), ensuring that your oven rack is positioned in the center to allow for even baking. Just before placing the loaf in the oven, use a sharp knife to make a few shallow slashes across the top, which will help the bread expand evenly during baking. Bake the spelt bread for 30 to 40 minutes, or until it turns golden brown and has a hollow sound when tapped on the bottom. Remove the loaf from the oven and let it cool on a wire rack for at least 30 minutes before slicing, which will allow the flavors and texture to develop fully, resulting in a delicious and satisfying homemade spelt bread."},{"question":"Q: Title: War, Inc Review: John Cusack - Great Actor - bad materialHilary Duff - Potential there - total wasteMarisa Tomei - Great Actress - bad materialJoan Cusack - Great Actress - bad materialDan Aykroyd - Great Actor - bad materialwas hoping it was a spin on Gross Pointe Blank.

The reviewer expresses disappointment about the quality of the material in the film War, Inc., which features several talented actors and actresses such as John Cusack, Hilary Duff, Marisa Tomei, Joan Cusack, and Dan Aykroyd. The reviewer believes that the film's script is weak and fails to utilize the immense talent of its cast members. Furthermore, the comparison to Gross Pointe Blank suggests that the reviewer had high expectations for this film, hoping it would be a creative successor to the earlier project in which John Cusack had a leading role. However, the dissatisfaction with War, Inc. becomes evident as the reviewer states that it isn't even in the same playing field as Gross Pointe Blank. The summary of this review – \\"sad. Fantastic Talent wasted\\" – also highlights the overall negative sentiment expressed by the reviewer. By commenting on the wasted potential of the actors, the reviewer implies that they deserved better material to showcase their abilities. This criticism is directed at the film's creators, suggesting that they failed to deliver a quality product that could have been a fitting vehicle for the actors' collective talents.

Investigating one of a series of large-scale power outages, Indiana electrical lineman Roy Neary experiences a close encounter with a UFO, when it flies over his truck and lightly burns the side of his face with its bright lights. Chasing it, he almost hits Barry and Jillian, and they encounter the UFO with three other UFOs. Neary joins three police cars pursuing them, but the spacecraft fly off into the night sky. Roy becomes fascinated by UFOs, much to the dismay of his wife, Ronnie. He also becomes increasingly obsessed with subliminal, mental images of a mountain-like shape and begins to make models of it.

'We are doing our best in this difficult time,' said Mial. 'It's a process, it isn't as smooth as you might expect.

A correct answer is one that correctly and completely answers the question. Do not write answers that address the question partially or incorrectly. The correct answer must be contained in the given paragraph. Q: Paragraph- Sent 1: For much of the world, the Algarve is synonymous with Portugal, yet the Portuguese will tell you the exact opposite: the region has little in common with the rest of the country. Sent 2: The southern stretch of coast is more reminiscent of a North African landscape than a European one. Sent 3: It has no cosmopolitan cities, like Lisbon and Porto, which are farther north. Sent 4: Most of Portugal is known for quaint towns, medieval castles, and grand palaces. Sent 5: The Algarve is more recognizable for impenetrable blocks of tourist apartments, hotels, and meticulously manicured golf courses. Sent 6: And beaches. Sent 7: Think Algarve and the mind pictures long, glorious stretches of golden sands, secluded coves framed by odd ochre-colored rock formations, and deep green waters. Sent 8: With about 160 km (100 miles) of coastline, Portugal's southern province is one of Europe's premier beach destinations. Sent 9: The occasionally chilly ocean is the Atlantic, but the Algarve has a sultry Mediterranean feel. Sent 10: Its consistent climate is the best in Portugal, and one of the kindest in the world: more than 250 days of sunshine a year — more than almost any other international resort area. Sent 11: The moderating effect of the Gulf Stream produces a fresh springtime breeze throughout winter, and in late January and February, white almond blossoms blanket the fields. Sent 12: In summer the heat is intense but rarely unbearable, and regardless, beautiful beaches and innumerable pools are always just a dive away. Sent 13: Magnificent year-round weather has made the Algarve a huge destination for sporting vacations. Sent 14: Superb golf facilities abound — several with tees dramatically clinging to cliffs and fairways just skirting the edge of the ocean — and horseback riding, tennis, big-game fishing, sailing, and windsurfing are immensely popular. Sent 15: Sports, beaches and hospitable weather — not to mention easily organized package vacations — are surely the reasons the Algarve receives as many visitors as the rest of Portugal in its entirety. Sent 16: But it's not just international tourists that descend on the Algarve; many Portuguese from Lisbon and elsewhere in the north have holiday homes and spend their summer vacations here. Sent 17: The coast is neatly divided into the rugged Barlavento to the west and the flat beauty of Sotavento to the east. Sent 18: West is where you'll find the famous orange cliffs and surreal eroded rock stacks. Question: Which region of Portugal gets the most sunshine on an average year?.

It actually wasn't half bad. Ben (Jimmy Fallon) is the world's #1 Red Sox fan, but his relationship with Lindsay Meeks (Drew Barrymore) may strain that. The movie is a fairly interesting look at how world events can affect peoples' relationships. It's especially eye-opening now that the Red Sox have ended their 80-odd-year losing streak. I guess that these sorts of things happen all the time and we just don't tend to notice them. Not too bad. Another movie portraying an unusual relation to baseball is 2000's \\"Frequency\\".

I'll miss my favorite TV program, Science Fiction Theatre.\\" can be translated as: \\"Nemůžu jít. Zmeškám svůj oblíbený televizní pořad, Sci-fi Divadlo.\\" Here's a breakdown of the translation: 1. \\"I can't go.\\" - \\"Nemůžu jít.\\" - \\"I\\" translates to \\"já\\" in Czech, but the subject pronoun is often dropped when the verb conjugation gives enough information about the subject. - \\"can't\\" is a combination of \\"cannot\\" which would be translated to \\"nemůžu\\" (nemohu is also acceptable) in Czech, where 'ne' is a negation and 'můžu' (or 'mohu') is the first person singular conjugation of the verb \\"can\\" (in Czech, \\"moci\\" or \\"mít možnost\\"). - \\"go\\" translates to \\"jít\\" in Czech, which is an infinitive form of the verb meaning \\"to go.\\" 2. \\"I'll miss\\" - \\"Zmeškám\\" - \\"I'll\\" is an abbreviation of \\"I will\\" which indicates future tense. In Czech, the future tense can be formed by using the appropriate future conjugation of the verb. In this case, \\"zmeškám\\" is the future tense of the verb \\"to miss\\" (in Czech, \\"zmeškat\\"). - \\"miss\\" translates to \\"zmeškat\\" in Czech, which is a verb meaning \\"to miss\\" or \\"to be late for.\\" 3. \\"my favorite TV program\\" - \\"svůj oblíbený televizní pořad\\" - \\"my\\" translates to \\"můj\\" in Czech, but when referring to something you possess (like your favorite TV program), \\"svůj\\" is more appropriate because it shows the relationship between the subject and the object. - \\"favorite\\" translates to \\"oblíbený\\" in Czech, which is an adjective meaning \\"preferred\\" or \\"favorite.\\" - \\"TV program\\" translates to \\"televizní pořad\\" in Czech. \\"televizní\\" is the adjective form of \\"television\\" and \\"pořad\\" means \\"program\\" or \\"show.\\" 4. \\"Science Fiction Theatre\\" - \\"Sci-fi Divadlo.\\" - \\"Science Fiction\\" can be translated as \\"sci-fi\\" or \\"vědecké fantastiky\\" in Czech. However, considering it's a show title and the fact that \\"sci-fi\\" is an internationally recognized term, it is better to keep it as \\"sci-fi\\" for the translation. - \\"Theatre\\" translates to \\"divadlo\\" in Czech, which means \\"theater\\" or \\"playhouse,\\" but it is also used in the context of show titles to convey the idea of a \\"spectacle\\" or \\"production.\\" Therefore, the whole sentence \\"I can't go. I'll miss my favorite TV program, Science Fiction Theatre.\\" is translated to \\"Nemůžu jít. Zmeškám svůj oblíbený televizní pořad, Sci-fi Divadlo.\\" in Czech."},{"question":"2 Palestinians killed as Israel raids West Bank June 22, 2014: A Palestinian woman cries in her home after a raid by Israeli troops as the army continues feverish searches for three missing Israeli teens, in Salim village near the West Bank city of Nablus. (AP) RAMALLAH, West Bank – Israeli troops shot dead a mentally ill Palestinian who approached them in a West Bank refugee camp Sunday, the army said, while another Palestinian was killed in clashes in the city of Ramallah. Sunday's deaths brought to four the number of Palestinians killed since Israel launched its most extensive military operation in the West Bank in years after the abduction of three Israeli teens on June 12. Israel has arrested more than 350 Palestinians, most affiliated with the Islamic militant Hamas, and raided some 1,600 locations. Israel has blamed the kidnappings on Hamas, which has praised the act, but not claimed responsibility. The sweeps have led to growing confrontations after years of relative calm. Increasingly, Israeli troops entering towns and refugee camps are met by crowds of Palestinian stone-throwers. Eleven human rights groups urged the Israeli military on Sunday to refrain from collective punishment of the Palestinian population. \\"Overall, the measures adopted and their extent do not seem to serve a military need that can justify the damage they have caused,\\" they wrote. There were also signs of growing Palestinian anger at Western-backed Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas who has defended his decision to continue security coordination with Israel, including in the search for the teens. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday that he has \\"unequivocal proof\\" of Hamas involvement in the abductions. He said he is sharing this evidence with several countries and will make it public soon. Abbas, meanwhile, said he has \\"no credible information\\" that Hamas was involved. \\"When Netanyahu has such information, he needs to update me and we will take care of the matter according to our own laws,\\" he told the Israeli newspaper Haaretz. In Ramallah, Israeli troops entered the downtown area at about 2 a.m. Sunday, searching offices in two commercial buildings. Several hundred Palestinians threw stones and flower pots at soldiers who fired live bullets and rubber-coated steel pellets, said Issam Rimawi, a photographer for a local newspaper. After the soldiers withdrew, dozens of protesters hurled stones at a nearby Palestinian police station and smashed windows of parked cars, said Rimawi and a protester, who spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid repercussions from the authorities. Palestinian troops fired live rounds, the two witnesses said. After the clashes, the body of Mohammed Ismail, 31, was found on a rooftop opposite the police station, they said. Dr. Saber Aloul, a Palestinian forensic pathologist, performed an autopsy and said Ismail was killed by an M-16 bullet in the shoulder. Palestinian forces do not use M-16s, said a spokesman, Adnan Damiri. The Israeli military, which is known to use M-16s, had no comment. Later Sunday, several dozen people marched in downtown Ramallah to protest Israeli-Palestinian security coordination. \\"Why, why security coordination? We get hit once by the Palestinian Authority and once by the Israeli army,\\" they chanted. Analyst Jihad Harb said the Israeli crackdown is weakening Abbas. \\"The Palestinian street is very angry at the Palestinian Authority and President Abbas in particular because they see him siding with Israel against them,\\" he said. In a separate incident Sunday, 27-year-old Ahmed Saoud was killed by Israeli troops as he walked to a mosque for dawn prayers in the Al-Ein refugee camp, said his father, Assad. The elder Saoud said his son suffered from mental illness. The army said a Palestinian man approached soldiers in a threatening manner early Sunday, and that they fired warning shots before shooting him. The army said an \\"initial inquiry\\" suggested the man was mentally unstable. The Israeli teens went missing as they were returning home from a Jewish religious school in the West Bank 10 days ago. They have not been heard from, and no group has asked for ransom or made other demands. In the Gaza Strip, Israel carried out airstrikes on four militant sites following rocket fire from Gaza into Israel, the army said. Also Sunday, a Palestinian armed with a hand grenade was caught near an Israeli town near the Gaza border, apparently after he broke through the border fence, the army said. What is a short summary of the above article?","response":"This is a news article from 2014 about Israeli troops searching for three missing Israeli teens in West Bank.

It was too hot too cook in the kitchen, so Mom decided we’d grill hot dogs & stuff outside. But we needed some things so Dad was elected to go to the grocery store. This turned out to be a big production; Dad was trying remember what all was needed without writing a list, and Mom kept adding things even as he was trying to leave. Finally, he got in the car and drove off. Mom & I had just turned around and sat down at our picnic table when all of sudden here was Dad pulling back into the driveway. He’d apparently just driven around the block & came right back. Mom & I looked at each other and smirked- she was thinking the same thing I was: “what’d he forget this time?” But then Dad got out of the car.. and on his face was the look. In my young life, I’d never seen that look before, but it chilled me to the core and I just knew something bad was coming. Mom knew it too; the smirk quickly left her face as Dad came over and said.. “Mom.. I hope I heard this wrong.. but on the radio they said a woman drowned at the lake.. I hope I’m wrong, I barely caught the name, but I think they said it was your sister..” The cookout was forgotten; we went inside & started making phone calls, and unfortunately it was indeed my aunt.

The ground then becomes positively charged. Over time the differences increase. Eventually the electrons are discharged. This is what we see as lightning. You can watch an awesome slow-motion lightning strike below. Do you have any questions?","response":"Hey there! Imagine you're rubbing your feet on the carpet, and then you touch a metal door handle and feel a little zap. That's called static discharge. Lightning is like a super big and bright version of that same thing happening in the sky! When there's a rainstorm, the clouds have different charged areas. Some parts become positive while others become negative. All these moving air, water, and ice make this happen. The negative charges are at the bottom of the cloud while the positives are at the top. The negative charges in the cloud push away negative charges on the ground, making the ground positive. As the charges become very different, the electrons want to make things balanced again. So, they send a big burst of light and energy between the cloud and the ground. And that's what we see as lightning! I hope that helps you understand what lightning is and how it's related to static electricity. Let me know if you have any more questions!"},{"question":"What was the question for this implicit rationale, and corresponding answer?

It is also considered a subcontinent of the Americas, which is the model used in nations that speak Romance languages. The reference to South America instead of other regions (like Latin America or the Southern Cone) has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil). - The Indian Ocean is the third largest of the world's oceanic divisions, covering (approximately 20% of the water on the Earth's surface). It is bounded by Asia on the north, on the west by Africa, on the east by Australia, and on the south by the Southern Ocean or, depending on definition, by Antarctica. It is named after the country of India. The Indian Ocean is known as \\"Ratnkara\\", \\"\\"the mine of gems\\"\\" in ancient Sanskrit literature, and as \\"Hind Mahsgar\\", \\"\\"the great Indian sea\\"\\", in Hindi. - In law, a conviction is the verdict that results when a court of law finds a defendant guilty of a crime. The opposite of a conviction is an acquittal (i.e. \\"not guilty\\"). In Scotland and in the Netherlands, there can also be a verdict of \\"not proven\\", which counts as an acquittal. There are also cases where the court orders that a defendant not be convicted, despite being found guilty; in England, Wales and Canada the mechanism for this is a discharge. - Wales is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and the island of Great Britain. It is bordered by England to the east, the Irish Sea to the north and west, and the Bristol Channel to the south. It had a population in 2011 of 3,063,456 and has a total area of . Wales has over of coastline and is largely mountainous, with its higher peaks in the north and central areas, including Snowdon, its highest summit. The country lies within the north temperate zone and has a changeable, maritime climate. - The Isles of Scilly (or \\"\\") are an archipelago off the south western tip of the Cornish peninsula of Great Britain. It is the southernmost location in England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most westerly in England. - Violence is defined by the World Health Organization as \\"the intentional use of physical force or power, threatened or actual, against oneself, another person, or against a group or community, which either results in or has a high likelihood of resulting in injury, death, psychological harm, maldevelopment, or deprivation\\", although the group acknowledges that the inclusion of \\"the use of power\\" in its definition expands on the conventional understanding of the word. This definition involves intentionality with the committing of the act itself, irrespective of the outcome it produces. However, generally, anything that is excited in an injurious or damaging way may be described as violent even if not meant to be violence (by a person and against a person). Globally, violence resulted in the deaths of an estimated 1.28 million people in 2013 up from 1.13 million in 1990. Of the deaths in 2013, roughly 842,000 were attributed to self-harm (suicide), 405,000 to interpersonal violence, and 31,000 to collective violence (war) and legal intervention. In Africa, out of every 100,000 people, each year an estimated 60.9 die a violent death. Corlin, past president of the American Medical Association said: \\"The United States leads the worldin the rate at which its children die from firearms.\\" He concluded: \\"Gun violence is a threat to the public health of our country.\\" For each single death due to violence, there are dozens of hospitalizations, hundreds of emergency department visits, and thousands of doctors' appointments. Furthermore, violence often has lifelong consequences for physical and mental health and social functioning and can slow economic and social development. In 2013, assault by firearm was the leading cause of death due to interpersonal violence, with 180,000 such deaths estimated to have occurred. The same year, assault by sharp object resulted in roughly 114,000 deaths, with a remaining 110,000 deaths from personal violence being attributed to other causes. Violence in many forms is preventable. There... - An ambush is a long-established military tactic in which combatants take advantage of concealment and the element of surprise to attack unsuspecting enemy combatants from concealed positions, such as among dense underbrush or behind hilltops. Ambushes have been used consistently throughout history, from ancient to modern warfare. In the 20th century, an ambush might involve thousands of soldiers on a large scale, such as over a choke point such as a mountain pass, or a small guerrilla band or insurgent group attacking a regular armed force patrol. - Middlesex (abbreviation: Middx) was a county in southeast England that is now mostly part of Greater London, with small sections in neighbouring counties. It was established in the Anglo-Saxon system from the territory of the Middle Saxons, and existed as an official unit until 1965. The historic county included land stretching north of the River Thames from east to west of the City of London with the rivers Colne and Lea and a ridge of hills as the other boundaries. The largely low-lying county, dominated by clay in its north and alluvium on gravel in its south, was the second smallest by area in 1831. - A country is a region that is identified as a distinct national entity in political geography. A country may be an independent sovereign state or one that is occupied by another state, as a non-sovereign or formerly sovereign political division, or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated people with distinct political characteristics. Regardless of the physical geography, in the modern internationally accepted legal definition as defined by the League of Nations in 1937 and reaffirmed by the United Nations in 1945, a resident of a country is subject to the independent exercise of legal jurisdiction. - Londinium was a settlement established on the current site of the City of London around 43. Its bridge over the River Thames turned the city into a road nexus and major port, serving as a major commercial centre in Roman Britain until its abandonment during the 5th century. - Charles Swan ( died 1690 ) was a reluctant buccaneer . Captain Swan was forced into piracy by his crew in the 1680s , and proceeded to write letters to the owners of his ship Cygnet in London , begging them to intercede with James II of England for his pardon - even as he looted his way up and down the coast of South America . He was present at the attack on Payta in 1684 , where he petulantly burned the town after no booty was found . On 25 August 1685 , he separated from his confederates Peter Harris and Edward Davis , and sailed up the coast of Mexico , but met with little success . He seized the town of Santa Pecaque but lost fifty men to a Spanish counter-attack , including Basil Ringrose . On 31 March 1686 he set out across the Pacific to ambush the Manila treasure galleon , but failed to over-take the ship . Due to the failure of the assault on Santa Pecaque provisions were short , and by the time they reached the East Indies the crew were plotting to eat their officers of the Cygnet as it crossed the Pacific ( starting with the Captain ) . ( Swan is reported to have remarked that the lean William Dampier would have made them a poor meal ; the captain himself was a remarkably fat man . ) Fortunately they arrived at Guam without resorting to cannibalism , and made their way on to the Sultanate of Mindanao . The arrogance of Swan and unruliness of his men soon spoiled their good relations with the local ruler , Raja Laut ; and when the captain decided to abandon the attempt on the galleon , his men mutinied . He managed to save five thousand pounds ( legally the property of the Cygnet 's owners ) from the mutineers , and remained in Mindanao , becoming an officer in Laut 's army ; but in 1690 he attempted to escape back to England on a Dutch ship with the money , and was chased by Laut 's warriors , who capsized his boat and speared him in the water . - Borders are geographic boundaries of political entities or legal jurisdictions, such as governments, sovereign states, federated states, and other subnational entities. Some borderssuch as a state's internal administrative border, or inter-state borders within the Schengen Areaare often open and completely unguarded. Other borders are partially or fully controlled, and may be crossed legally only at designated border checkpoints and border zones may be controlled. Mostly contentious, borders may even foster the setting up of buffer zones. A difference has also been established in academic scholarship between border and frontier, the latter denoting a state of mind rather than state boundaries. - Brazil, officially the Federative Republic of Brazil, is the largest country in both South America and Latin America. As the world's fifth-largest country by both area and population, it is the largest country to have Portuguese as an official language and the only one in the Americas. Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a coastline of . It borders all other South American countries except Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3% of the continent's land area. Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest, home to diverse wildlife, a variety of ecological systems, and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats. This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries, and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection. - Buccaneers were pirates of the Caribbean Sea who challenged Spanish hegemony on the region by attacking ships and sacking coastal settlements during the 17th and 18th centuries. Before long, they became a threat to non-Spanish settlements as well, and the target of anti-piracy crusades. Today the idea of a buccaneer plays a role similar to \\"pirate\\". Original buccaneer crews, however, were larger, localized to the Caribbean region, and more apt to attack well-defended ports than pirates who sailed to the Indian Ocean on the Pirate Round of the late 17th century. - James II and VII (14 October 1633 16 September 1701) was King of England and Ireland as James II and King of Scotland as James VII, from 6 February 1685 until he was deposed in the Glorious Revolution of 1688. He was the last Roman Catholic monarch of England, Scotland and Ireland. - A pardon is a government decision to allow a person who has been convicted of a crime to be free and absolved of that conviction, as if never convicted. - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency. - The River Thames is a river that flows through southern England. At , it is the longest river entirely in England and the second longest in the United Kingdom, after the River Severn. It also flows through Oxford (where it is called Isis), Reading, Henley-on-Thames and Windsor. The lower reaches of the river are called the Tideway, derived from its long tidal reach up to Teddington Lock. It rises at Thames Head in Gloucestershire, and flows into the North Sea via the Thames Estuary. The Thames drains the whole of Greater London. - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly. - Latin America is a group of countries and dependencies in the Americas where Romance languages are predominant. The term originated in 19th century France as \\"Amérique latine\\" to consider French-speaking territories in the Americas (Haiti, French Guiana, Martinique, Guadeloupe, Saint Martin, Saint Barthélemy) along with the larger group of countries where Spanish and Portuguese languages prevailed. It is therefore broader than the terms Ibero-America or Hispanic Americathough it usually excludes French Canada and modern French Louisiana. - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - An ocean (the sea of classical antiquity) is a body of saline water that composes much of a planet's hydrosphere. On Earth, an ocean is one of the major conventional divisions of the World Ocean, which covers almost 71% of its surface. These are, in descending order by area, the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic Oceans. The word \\"sea\\" is often used interchangeably with \\"ocean\\" in American English but, strictly speaking, a sea is a body of saline water (generally a division of the world ocean) partly or fully enclosed by land. - The Mayor of London is an elected politician who, along with the London Assembly of 25 members, is accountable for the strategic government of Greater London. The current mayor is Sadiq Khan, who took up office on 9 May 2016. The position had been held by Ken Livingstone from the creation of the role on 4 May 2000 until he was defeated in 2008 by Boris Johnson, who served two terms before being succeeded by Khan. - The Sea Peoples were a purported seafaring confederation of groups known to have attacked ancient Egypt prior to the Late Bronze Age collapse. Following the creation of the concept in the nineteenth century, it became one of the most famous chapters of Egyptian history, given its connection with, in the words of Wilhelm Max Müller: \\"the most important questions of ethnography and the primitive history of classic nations\\". - The Glorious Revolution, also called the Revolution of 1688, was the overthrow of King James II of England (James VII of Scotland) by a union of English Parliamentarians with the Dutch stadtholder William III of Orange. William's successful invasion of England with a Dutch fleet and army led to his ascension of the English throne as William III of England jointly with his wife Mary II of England, James's daughter, in conjunction with the documentation of the Bill of Rights 1689. - Piracy is an act of robbery or criminal violence by ship- or boat-borne attackers upon another ship or a coastal area, typically with the goal of stealing cargo and other valuable items or properties. Those who engage in acts of piracy are called pirates. The earliest documented instances of piracy were in the 14th century BC, when the Sea Peoples, a group of ocean raiders, attacked the ships of the Aegean and Mediterranean civilizations. Narrow channels which funnel shipping into predictable routes have long created opportunities for piracy, as well as for privateering and commerce raiding. Historic examples include the waters of Gibraltar, the Strait of Malacca, Madagascar, the Gulf of Aden, and the English Channel, whose geographic strictures facilitated pirate attacks. A land-based parallel is the ambushing of travelers by bandits and brigands in highways and mountain passes. Privateering uses similar methods to piracy, but the captain acts under orders of the state authorizing the capture of merchant ships belonging to an enemy nation, making it a legitimate form of war-like activity by non-state actors. - Scotland (Scots: ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain. It shares a border with England to the south, and is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to the east and the North Channel and Irish Sea to the south-west. In addition to the mainland, the country is made up of more than 790 islands, including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides. - The Pirate Round was a sailing route followed by certain Anglo-American pirates, mainly during the late 17th century. The course led from the western Atlantic, around the southern tip of Africa, stopping at Madagascar, then on to targets such as the coast of Yemen and India. The Pirate Round was briefly used again during the early 1720s. Pirates who followed the route are sometimes referred to as Roundsmen. The Pirate Round was largely co-extensive with the routes of the East India Company ships, of Britain and other nations. - Gibraltar is a British Overseas Territory located on the southern end of the Iberian Peninsula. It has an area of and shares its northern border with Spain. The Rock of Gibraltar is the major landmark of the region. At its foot is a densely populated city area, home to over 30,000 Gibraltarians and other nationalities. - </div> War is a state of armed conflict between societies. It is generally characterized by extreme aggression, destruction, and mortality, using regular or irregular military forces. An absence of war is usually called \\"peace\\". Warfare refers to the common activities and characteristics of types of war, or of wars in general. Total war is warfare that is not restricted to purely legitimate military targets, and can result in massive civilian or other non-combatant casualties. - The London Assembly is an elected body, part of the Greater London Authority, that scrutinises the activities of the Mayor of London and has the power, with a two-thirds majority, to amend the Mayor's annual budget and to reject the Mayor's draft statutory strategies. The assembly was established in 2000 and meets at City Hall on the South Bank of the River Thames, close to Tower Bridge. The assembly is also able to investigate other issues of importance to Londoners (transport, environmental matters, etc.), publish its findings and recommendations, and make proposals to the Mayor. - The Celtic Sea (; ) is the area of the Atlantic Ocean off the south coast of Ireland bounded to the east by Saint George's Channel; other limits include the Bristol Channel, the English Channel, and the Bay of Biscay, as well as adjacent portions of Wales, Cornwall, Devon, and Brittany. The southern and western boundaries are delimited by the continental shelf, which drops away sharply. The Isles of Scilly are an archipelago of small islands in the sea. - Tin is a chemical element with the symbol Sn (for ) and atomic number 50, is a post-transition metal in group 14 of the periodic table. It is obtained chiefly from the mineral cassiterite, which contains tin dioxide, SnO. Tin shows a chemical similarity to both of its neighbors in group 14, germanium and lead, and has two main oxidation states, +2 and the slightly more stable +4. Tin is the 49th most abundant element and has, with 10 stable isotopes, the largest number of stable isotopes in the periodic table, thanks to its magic number of protons. It has two main allotropes: at room temperature, the stable allotrope is -tin, a silvery-white, malleable metal, but at low temperatures it transforms into the less dense grey -tin, which has the diamond cubic structure. Metallic tin is not easily oxidized in air. - A privateer was a private person or ship that engaged in maritime warfare under a commission of war. The commission, also known as a letter of marque, empowered the person to carry on all forms of hostility permissible at sea by the usages of war, including attacking foreign vessels during wartime and taking them as prizes. Captured ships were subject to condemnation and sale under prize law, with the proceeds divided between the privateer sponsors, shipowners, captains and crew. A percentage share usually went to the issuer of the commission. Since robbery under arms was common to seaborne trade, all merchant ships were already armed. During war, naval resources were auxiliary to operations on land so privateering was a way of subsidizing state power by mobilizing armed ships and sailors. - Commerce raiding is a form of naval warfare used to destroy or disrupt logistics of the enemy on the open sea by attacking its merchant shipping, rather than engaging its combatants or enforcing a blockade against them. It is also known, in French, as guerre de course (literally, \\"war of the chase\\") and, in German, Handelskrieg (\\"trade war\\"), from the nations most heavily committed to it historically as a strategy. - Robbery is the crime of taking or attempting to take anything of value by force, threat of force or by putting the victim in fear. At common law, robbery is defined as taking the property of another, with the intent to permanently deprive the person of that property, by means of force or fear. Precise definitions of the offence may vary between jurisdictions. Robbery is differentiated from other forms of theft (such as burglary, shoplifting or car theft) by its inherently violent nature (a violent crime); whereas many lesser forms of theft are punished as misdemeanors, robbery is always a felony in jurisdictions that distinguish between the two. Under English law, most forms of theft are triable either way, whereas robbery is triable only on indictment. The word \\"rob\\" came via French from Late Latin words (e.g. \\"deraubare\\") of Germanic origin, from Common Germanic \\"raub\\" -- \\"theft\\". - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight.

Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","response":"Alright kiddo, imagine there is a really big game called Powerball where people can win lots and lots of money, something like 317 million, which is a huge amount! To play this game, people need to spend 2 on a ticket that has numbers on it. Now, everyone is very excited and rushing to buy these tickets to try their luck, even if it's very cold outside. This is a very special game because it's been a long time since someone has won the biggest prize. The game will tell everyone the lucky numbers tonight, and if someone's ticket has those same numbers in any order, they can win the biggest prize, which can be given to them slowly over 29 years or all at once. They can even win smaller prizes if their ticket matches some of the important numbers. But remember, this game is not easy to win – the chances are pretty low, something like 1 in 175 million. People all over America play this game and sometimes, they win big prizes!"},{"question":"If a company allocates 10 percent of its budget to advertising, 10 percent to capital improvements, and 55 percent to salaries, what fraction of its budget remains for other allocations? Options: (A) 4/5 (B) 1/4 (C) 3/10 (D) 1/5 (E) 1/10 Stream of consciousness first, then make a decision:","response":"First, let's add the percentages allocated to advertising, capital improvements, and salaries: 10% + 10% + 55% = 75%. Now, we need to find the fraction of the budget remaining for other allocations. Since the total budget is 100%, we subtract the allocated 75% to find the remaining percentage: 100% - 75% = 25%. Now, let's convert this percentage to a fraction. 25% can be written as 25/100. When we simplify this fraction, we get: 25/100 = 1/4. So the remaining fraction of the budget for other allocations is 1/4. Therefore, the correct option is: (B) 1/4"},{"question":"Rick held a fundraiser and is figuring out who still owes money. He marked on a sheet how much everyone has promised to contribute, but he forgot to note how much some people had actually paid. Altogether, everyone has promised to contribute 400, and Rick has actually received 285. Sally, Amy, Derek, and Carl all still owe money. Sally and Carl both owe equal amounts, Amy owes 30, and Derek owes half as much as Amy. How much, in dollars, do Sally and Carl each owe? Think carefully first, then make a decision:","response":"First, let's figure out how much money is still owed in total. Since the total promised amount is 400 and Rick has received 285, there is still 400 - 285 = 115 left to be paid. Next, let's find out how much Derek owes. Since he owes half as much as Amy, and Amy owes 30, Derek owes 30 / 2 = 15. Now, we know Sally and Carl owe equal amounts. Since only Sally, Amy, Derek, and Carl owe money, we can subtract Amy and Derek's owed amounts from the total owed to find how much Sally and Carl owe together. So, 115 - 30 (Amy) - 15 (Derek) = 70 left to be paid by Sally and Carl combined. Since Sally and Carl owe equal amounts, we can divide the remaining owed amount by 2. Each owes 70 / 2 = 35."},{"question":"Rate the similarity of the following two sentences on a scale from 0 to 5, where 0 is \\"no meaning overlap\\" and 5 is \\"means the same thing\\"?

The only difference between the two sentences is that the second one provides additional information about Niels' death occurring two years after the statement. However, the core meaning of both sentences remains the same."},{"question":"I can use this background: While the Grants were on the Galápagos, a drought occurred. As a result, fewer seeds were available for finches to eat. Birds with smaller beaks could crack open and eat only the smaller seeds. Birds with bigger beaks could crack and eat seeds of all sizes. As a result, many of the small-beaked birds died in the drought. Birds with bigger beaks survived and reproduced (see Figure below ). Within 2 years, the average beak size in the finch population increased. Evolution by natural selection had occurred. Now, I have a new situation: The explorers visited Galapagos 1 and Galapagos 2, both islands part of the same archipelago. Island 1 had experienced a drought in recent years. Both islands had populations of birds living there. Answer this question please: Which island had the average beak size in the finch population increase? Answer:","response":"Island 1 had the average beak size in the finch population increase. Step 1: Identify the situation The background information states that during a drought in the Galápagos, small-beaked birds struggled to find food and eventually died, leading to an increase in average beak size in the finch population due to the survival of birds with bigger beaks. Step 2: Determine the relevant island In the new situation, there are two islands: Galapagos 1 and Galapagos 2. Island 1 experienced a drought, while no information is given about the climate on Island 2. Step 3: Apply the background information to the situation Since Island 1 had experienced a drought, we can use the background information about the finch population during droughts to infer that the average beak size in the finch population on this island likely increased. Conclusion: Based on the information provided, Island 1 (Galapagos 1) experienced a drought, which led to an increase in the average beak size of the finch population, according to the process of evolution by natural selection."},{"question":"Lee went and talked to a therapist when Lee accumulated a lot stresses and the depression got worse.

Question: suppose the calorie count goes up happens, how will it affect less seeds grow. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect","response":"The process you have outlined involves planting seeds and nurturing them to grow. This involves several steps: getting seeds, picking a spot, digging a hole, watering the seed, covering it up, pressing down, and providing plant food. The question is about the potential increase in calorie count and how this increase might impact the number of seeds that grow. Additionally, it inquires about the influence of the supposed perturbation on the second mentioned effect. Firstly, let's examine the potential reasons for an increase in calorie count in the overall process, as this is not explicitly mentioned. An increase in calorie count could be due to several factors: for instance, more energy might be required to perform each step of the process (for example, due to increased labor, usage of machinery, or increased consumption of water). Another possibility could be that the seeds themselves carry a higher calorie count than before, which might lead to certain changes like richer nutrient content or greater energy storage within the plants. This could either stem from genetic modification or a change in seed variety. Now, let's address the question of how the increase in calorie count might affect less seeds growing. If the calorie count increase is due to increased labor or resource consumption, the overall process might become more expensive, resource-intensive, or time-consuming. This could lead to fewer people engaging in planting, or fewer resources being allocated for planting (such as water, machinery, or plant food), which could result in less seeds being planted and therefore reduced seed growth. Consequently, the effect on seed growth could be considered as less. Regarding the supposed perturbation influencing the second effect, let's assume the second effect mentioned is the impact of the increase in calorie count on the actual growth of planted seeds. In the context of this assumption, the perturbation refers to the external factors causing the calorie count increase, such as increased labor or different seed varieties. If the source of the increased calorie count is either genetic modification or a change in seed variety resulting in higher calorie content, it could have a more significant impact on seed growth. For example, if seeds with higher calorie content produce plants that require additional care, resources, or specific environmental conditions, fewer seeds might grow successfully. In this case, the perturbation would have a more substantial effect on seed growth. On the other hand, if the increased calorie count is due to external factors such as increased labor or resource consumption, the influence of the perturbation on seed growth might be less direct, as it would primarily affect the planting and nurturing process rather than the seeds themselves. In this scenario, it could have a less effect on seed growth. In conclusion, the effect of the increase in calorie count on less seeds growing depends on the underlying reasons for the increase. If the increased calorie count is due to factors that directly affect the seeds, such as seed variety or genetic modification, it could have a more effect on seed growth. If the increased calorie count arises from external factors such as labor or resource consumption, it could have a less effect on seed growth. It is crucial to consider the specific factors and circumstances involved when examining how the supposed perturbation influences the second effect mentioned."},{"question":"\\"chase had decided to go with the motto : if baxter did n't like you , chase did n't like you . not that mindy seemed to mind eric 's rude stares . heck , what did he know ? maybe girls liked to be gawked at . chase listened as his sister continued to sell the festival to their parents . he seriously doubted that mindy would tell them about eric going to the _ ...\\" What is the word in the blank space (_)?

His train pulls 3 red boxcars, 4 blue boxcars, and 7 black boxcars. If the black boxcars can each hold 4000 pounds of coal, which is half as much as what the blue boxcars can hold, and the red boxcars can hold 3 times as much as the blue boxcars, how many pounds of coal can all of the train's boxcars combined hold?. Me: Hmmm, let me think. I think this is the detailed solution:","response":"First, let's determine the capacity of each type of boxcar. 1. The black boxcars can hold 4000 pounds of coal. 2. The blue boxcars can hold twice as much coal as the black boxcars, so they can hold 2 * 4000 = 8000 pounds of coal. 3. The red boxcars can hold 3 times as much coal as the blue boxcars, so they can hold 3 * 8000 = 24,000 pounds of coal. Now, let's determine the total capacity for each type of boxcar. 1. The 3 red boxcars can hold 3 * 24,000 = 72,000 pounds of coal. 2. The 4 blue boxcars can hold 4 * 8000 = 32,000 pounds of coal. 3. The 7 black boxcars can hold 7 * 4000 = 28,000 pounds of coal. Finally, let's add up the total capacity for all of the boxcars on the train. Total capacity = Red boxcars capacity + Blue boxcars capacity + Black boxcars capacity Total capacity = 72,000 + 32,000 + 28,000 Total capacity = 132,000 pounds of coal.

Oliphant had delegated the task to two German refugee scientists, Rudolf Peierls and Otto Frisch, who could not work on Oliphant's radar project because they were enemy aliens and therefore lacked the necessary security clearance. Francis Perrin had calculated the critical mass of uranium to be about 40 tonnes (39 long tons; 44 short tons). He reckoned that if a neutron reflector were placed around it, this might be reduced to 12 tonnes (12 long tons; 13 short tons). Peierls attempted to simplify the problem by using the fast neutrons produced by fission, thus omitting consideration of moderator. He too calculated the critical mass of a sphere of uranium in a theoretical paper written in 1939 to be \\"of the order of tons\\".Peierls knew the importance of the size of the critical mass that would allow a chain reaction to take place and its practical significance. In the interior of a critical mass sphere, neutrons are spontaneously produced by the fissionable material. A very small portion of these neutrons are colliding with other nuclei, while a larger portion of the neutrons are escaping through the surface of the sphere. Peierls calculated the equilibrium of the system, where the number of neutrons being produced equalled the number escaping.Niels Bohr had theorised that the rare uranium-235 isotope, which makes up only about 0.7% of natural uranium, was primarily responsible for fission with fast neutrons, although this was not yet universally accepted. Frisch and Peierls were thus able to revise their initial estimate of critical mass needed for nuclear fission in uranium to be substantially less than previously assumed. They estimated a metallic sphere of uranium-235 with a radius of 2.1 centimetres (0.83 in) could suffice. This amount represented approximately 1 kilogram (2.2 lb) of uranium-235. These results led to the Frisch–Peierls memorandum, which was the initial step in the development of the nuclear arms programme in Britain. This..., what would be the answer ? Answer:","response":"The full names of the two people who calculated the critical mass of uranium are Rudolf Peierls and Otto Frisch. They were German refugee scientists working under the supervision of Mark Oliphant's team in Birmingham. Due to their status as enemy aliens, they were unable to work on Oliphant's radar project and were instead tasked with determining the critical mass of uranium.

First, there is the shutter speed, which you can adjust to control how much time the camera's shutter is open. Faster speeds will freeze action while slower ones create a blurry effect. Person A: Sounds interesting. What else? Person B: Then there is the aperture, which controls how much light gets in. It's the \\"f number\\" on your camera.

MSgt Mike Takashima, Col Glenn Stevenson, and 1st Lt John Gregg, all members of the U. S. Air Force Air Rescue Service at Ashiya Air Base, Japan, set out to rescue the survivors of a Japanese ship wrecked in a still-raging storm. As they fly to the site of the wreck, each man recalls a part of his past: Gregg remembers the avalanche caused in Europe when his H-19 Chickasaw helicopter came too close to a mountain. The avalanche subsequently buried alive the group of people whom he was attempting to rescue. The accident has since caused him to fear flying solo. Stevenson, deeply prejudiced against the Japanese, recalls the reason for his hatred: as a civilian pilot in the Philippines prior to World War II, he met and married Caroline Gordon. She and their infant son later died in a Japanese prison camp when they were refused medical supplies which were being saved for Japanese soldiers. Takashima, half-Polish (mother), half-Japanese (father), reminisces about his tragic love affair with Leila, an Algerian girl, when he was an Army paratrooper during World War II. He was unable to stop a bridge from being blown up, a bridge where Leila had run to look for him after learning that his unit was being withdrawn from town. Stevenson, Gregg and Takashima are the crew of the lead aircraft of a flight of two HU-16s dispatched to rescue the Japanese civilians at sea. When one HU-16 air rescue plane crashes while attempting to land in the treacherous seas, Stevenson refuses to jeopardize his plane for Japanese lives. At the last minute, however, he recalls Caroline's dying plea not to hate; he overcomes his prejudice. Takashima volunteered to parachute to the life rafts with rescue equipment. Stevenson and Gregg then land the plane at sea and rescue the survivors, but when Stevenson is injured in the landing, Gregg is forced to overcome his fear and handle the dangerous takeoff and the flight back to Ashiya. A:","response":"The full name of the person that overcomes his prejudice is Col Glenn Stevenson."},{"question":"Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: At about 4 am, after hours of being unable to sleep, of shivering in the cold mountain air and trying to silence my crying kids who kept waking up, of attempting to find a comfortable sleeping position, of listening to whether there might have been a bear outside our tent, I finally couldn't stand it any more. I complained, \\"Everything has gone wrong.\\" My wife and I were in one tent with our two young kids. A hundred yards east away was Summit Lake, where the glorious early morning mist was shimmering off the water. A couple miles to the southwest was the base of the Lassen Peak Trail. The base was 8,000 feet above sea level, and huge snow dotted the scenery even in mid August. Further west still was Bumpass Hell, with steam rising up. As the sun crept up over the edge of the Lassen peak, we fired up the camp stove and had breakfast. Half an hour later, my six-year-old daughter and I were in the parking lot of the Lassen peak trail, getting ready to go up the mountainside. We wouldn't make it all the way, but it didn't matter. We would see nature at its extremes: the volcanic ash that layered on the earth turning the melting snow a mysterious pink as the sun struck it; the blues of the sky shading into the blues of distant lakes, which in turn shaded into the whites and grays of the snow. My daughter grabbed my camera. She wanted to take a photo of \\"the composite \\"of _ . Looking out over that scenery, and seeing my daughter fascinated by nature, I felt stupid about my morning complaints. Yes, camping is uncomfortable. And yes, there's a lot to be said for getting out a credit card,reserving a room in a nice hotel, and going out for a fancy meal. But there's also something wonderful about being so close to raw nature.

Context: What are the worst examples of false advertising you've seen? Did you fall prey to their claims? Rather that vouch for myself - my story is trite, and not particularly interesting - I'll relay the tale one of my nurses shared with me when I was laid up in the hospital for a few weeks. Call her R. R was from an Eastern European country. We chit-chatted a lot, while she was taking my blood pressure readings and stuff. Lots of fun stories! But she relayed to me one of her first U.S. memories: She wanted to lose weight. She was impressed by some things the U.S. had to offer - \\"you have actual nutritional information on everything!\\" - and thus figured everything she encountered was on the level. And she found a \\"miracle cure\\" company who was along those lines! \\"These are AWESOME miracle shoe inserts! Wear them, and the pounds will melt away!\\" She saved her pennies and dimes; she sprung for the inserts. She received them... and they were shoe inserts; that much was true. But then there was their documentation: \\"using these insoles, combined with a 1200 calorie-per-day diet....\\" Like a 1200-calorie diet won't likely involve weight-loss, no matter what else you did, shoe inserts aside. The inserts did nothing, obviously. It was a sham. At which point she knew she was snookered, but really had no recourse. She wasn't explicit about it, but I got the feeling that it was a leading factor towards her chosen profession. \\"I might not have been the most sage medical person ever, but I'm gonna rectify that, and if ever I hear someone falling for that sort of gambit again, I'll be there to nip those sentiments in the bud with my own anecdotes.\\" Which is awesome. I still feel for her. I wish I had contact information, so I could touch base, and express those thoughts personally. But that's the most personally resonant version of false advertising affecting someone that I've seen. Question: What did the shoe inserts claim they would do? Answer: The answer is:","response":"The shoe inserts claimed that they would help the user lose weight, with the pounds melting away when the inserts were worn. However, the product turned out to be a sham, as it actually required users to follow a 1200 calorie-per-day diet for weight loss, which would likely lead to weight loss even without the use of the shoe inserts."},{"question":"Instructions: A text is given in Gujarati.

Translate this to English?","response":"\\"M. Manis (Sudan) associates himself with the statements made on behalf of the Group of 77 and China and the Group of African States.\\" This statement refers to a typical diplomatic approval or endorsement where an individual or a country aligns themselves with a particular statement made by another group or country. In this context, M. Manis who represents Sudan is expressing his agreement or support for the positions or statements made by the Group of 77, China, and the Group of African States. The Group of 77 is a coalition of developing nations at the United Nations that was established to promote its members' collective economic interests and create an enhanced joint negotiating capacity in the United Nations. When it was founded in 1964, it had 77 member countries, hence the name \\"Group of 77.\\" However, as of now, the group has expanded to 134 member countries. China, although not officially a member of the Group of 77 (because it is considered a developed nation by the UN), it is a significant player in many international political, economic, and social issues and frequently aligns itself with the views of the developing countries in the Group of 77. The Group of African States is a regional grouping of African nations within the United Nations. Its main aim is to represent and advance the economic, social, and political interests of the African continent at the United Nations. Therefore, M. Manis's association with the statements made by these groups signifies his endorsement of their positions and the fact that he stands in solidarity with them regarding the topic discussed. This type of endorsement is common in diplomatic platforms such as the United Nations, where nations often align with larger groups to collectively voice their concerns, negotiate, and influence decision-making. It reflects the dynamics of international relations and cooperation, with countries often forging alliances based on shared interests or goals."},{"question":"Does Jack Sparrow know any sea shantys? Think carefully first, then make a decision:","response":"Captain Jack Sparrow, the fictional character portrayed by Johnny Depp in the \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\" film series, is portrayed as a cunning and resourceful pirate who would likely be familiar with sea shanties. Sea shanties are work songs that were sung by sailors to pass time, coordinate work, and lift spirits during long voyages. Since pirates, by occupation, were a part of the maritime culture of the 17th and 18th centuries, it would be safe to assume that Jack Sparrow would know some sea shanties. In the film series, Jack Sparrow is often seen singing, humming, or whistling to himself, which suggests his knowledge of maritime music. One example of Jack Sparrow's familiarity with sea shanties is when he sings the famous \\"Yo Ho (A Pirate's Life for Me)\\" tune in \\"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl.\\" Another moment is during \\"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,\\" when the character leads the crew in singing \\"Dead Man's Chest.\\" While the movies don't show an extensive list of sea shanties sung by Jack Sparrow, given his role as a pirate captain and his demonstrated knowledge of these songs, it's reasonable to assume he would be familiar with multiple sea shanties."},{"question":"Instructions: In this task, you will be given a short story.

Proximity: The laundry room is likely located inside John's house or at least within his residential vicinity, making it easily accessible and more convenient for him to use as an alternative to the clogged kitchen sink. 2. Sink availability: Laundry rooms typically contain a utility sink designed for washing, making it a suitable environment for washing dishes in the absence of a functioning kitchen sink. 3. Practicality: Compared to the other options, the laundry room provides a more practical solution for John's needs. Using a laboratory or office sink may not be feasible due to access limitations, while washing dishes at a neighbor's house could be considered an invasive or uncomfortable request. Washing dishes in-home offers the most practical solution, but since the kitchen sink is clogged, the laundry room becomes the most viable option. 4. Privacy: Opting to use the laundry room allows John to maintain his privacy while addressing the clogged kitchen sink issue. It does not require him to involve others or enter other people's spaces, such as a neighbor's house or office, which could be uncomfortable or awkward.

Which language is this?","response":"This language is Turkish. The given text translates to: SETimes: Where does the interest in Albanian chromium come from? Albania, a small European country located in the southwestern part of the Balkan Peninsula, is rich in natural resources, including chromium. The interest in Albanian chromium can be attributed to several reasons: 1. Abundance of chromium reserves: Albania has a significant amount of chromium reserves, making it one of the leading chromium exporters in the world. The presence of such reserves in the country has naturally attracted international attention and foreign investors seeking to exploit these resources. 2. High-quality chromium: Albanian chromium ore is known for its high quality, which further boosts its value in the global market. The chromium extracted from Albanian mines is characterized by high chromium-to-iron ratios and low levels of impurities, making it more valuable for industrial applications such as stainless steel production and other types of corrosion-resistant alloys. 3. Strategic location: Albania's location in southeastern Europe grants it easy access to European markets, as well as Mediterranean and Middle Eastern markets. This strategic location allows for a streamlined transportation of the mined chromium, giving Albania a competitive edge in the industry. 4. Growing demand for chromium: Global demand for chromium has been on the rise over the recent years, driven by its widespread use in various industries, particularly in the production of stainless steel. This growing demand has propelled countries with substantial chromium reserves, like Albania, into the spotlight, driving more interest in their resources. 5. Political and economic factors: Albania has made significant strides towards building a stable and open market economy since the early 1990s. This includes reducing trade barriers, encouraging foreign investment, and establishing close ties with the European Union. These factors have increased not only its overall attractiveness for investments but also the interest in its natural resources, including Albanian chromium. 6. Environmental considerations: The European Union has been promoting more sustainable mining practices, focusing on the extraction of raw materials with a lower environmental impact. Albanian chromium mines, especially those under European investment and management, have made efforts to comply with these standards, making them more attractive to environmentally conscious investors. Overall, the interest in Albanian chromium stems from the country's rich natural resources, high-quality chromium, strategic location, and growing global demand for the metal. Furthermore, the improved political and economic landscape in Albania and the push for sustainable mining practices contribute to its growing popularity in the international market."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: In recent weeks, the investigation into possible collusion between President Donald Trump’s presidential campaign and Russia has intensified, raising the prospect that the probe could become an issue in advance of the November midterm congressional elections. Former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort made another appearance in federal court in Washington Wednesday, where he pleaded not guilty to the latest round of charges brought by special counsel Robert Mueller. Last week, Rick Gates, Manafort’s former deputy, pleaded guilty to lying to prosecutors and is now cooperating with the investigation. In mid-February, 13 Russians were indicted in connection with election meddling, which deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein described as an effort to “promote discord in the United States and undermine public confidence in democracy. We must not allow them to succeed.” Congressional inquiries also continue. Hope Hicks, the White House communications director and a longtime Trump aide, was the latest figure to testify before a congressional committee on the Russia probe. Hicks declined to answer some questions before a closed session of the House Intelligence Committee, frustrating several Democrats. “This is not executive privilege. This is executive stonewalling,” said ranking committee Democrat Rep. Adam Schiff. But there was more pushback from the White House this week. President Trump fired off a series of tweets dismissing the probe as a “WITCH HUNT.” “They have had this phony cloud over this administration, over our government,” Trump told reporters at the White House last month. “And it has hurt our government, it does hurt our government. It is a Democrat hoax.” Democrats reject that view, including Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee. “I continue to believe that this is the most important thing that I will work on in my whole public career, and getting the whole truth out is extraordinarily important,” he said. Warner’s committee is also investigating possible... What did Trump think of Sen. Mark Warner the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee?

Fishburne's expresses to the viewer Othello's torment as he falls prey to Iago's lies very convincingly, even providing a realistic epileptic episode. Jacob is the loving and loyal wife who becomes either the instrument of Iago's revenge against Othello, or the object of his wrath (it is not clear which since no motive for Iago's behavior is offered). Although Kenneth Brannagh (sp?) displays his usual talent for Shakespeare in this movie, he is somewhat marginalized. The characters of Cassio and Emilia also wander in and out of scenes even though they, like Iago, seem more crucial to the plot. I have not checked the movie against the play to see how many lines were cut out, but I know that Shakespeare tends to develop his characters, even the seemingly unimportant ones, very well. If I had any criticism of the movie it would be that the story unfolds too quickly, and that the relationships between some of the characters are not laid out more. The director had a great cast, and no one offered a bad performance. The relationship between Cassio and Othello and that between Emilia and Desdemona need to be further developed earlier in the film. I have a feeling that they were closer to each other than the movie suggests, although you get a sense of this very late into the movie. Also, Othello and Desdemona need more time together. Although their anguish is convincing, the amount of interaction they have with each other makes it seem like they just met. On the other hand, maybe the did just meet---like Romeo and Juliet.

An examination of 238 sitcoms and dramas airing during four weeks in 2011 and 2012 found a third of the episodes included content that ârose to the level of sexual exploitationâ of females, according to the Parents Television Council report released Tuesday. The likelihood that a scene would include exploitation increased when a teen girl was involved, the report found, as did the odds that a show would try for a laugh: Girls were more likely to be the target of sexually exploitive jokes than adult women, 43 percent as compared to 33 percent. The instances cited by the report varied widely, from an adolescent boy and girl playing strip poker in an episode of âGleeâ to jokes spun off the topics of sexual violence, harassment and trafficking, according to the groupâs researchers. âAt what point in time is it OK to laugh at sexual trafficking or rape?â council President Tim Winter said. The PTC said its study relied on a United Nationsâ definition of sexual exploitation as involving abuse of a position of vulnerability, power, or trust for sexual purposes including profiting financially, socially or politically. Although the report doesnât include an independent assessment of the social effect of such media images, Winter contended that itâs a certainty: An industry that attracts billions of ad dollars meant to influence buying habits must acknowledge that it has an impact on viewers, especially youngsters, he said. Among the sitcom humor cited by the report: A May 2012 episode of âFamily Guyâ in which teenager Meg appears onstage and an announcer says, âThis girl is perfect if you want to buy a sex slave, but donât want to spend sex slave money.â âYoung people are having difficulty managing the distinction between appropriate and inappropriate sexual conduct,â and TVâs confusing messages are one reason, said the Rev. Delman Coates, a PTC board member. The report is the councilâs third in a series about media sexualization of young girls. Last year, the nonpartisan group launched its 4 Every Girl initiative aimed at combating such depictions and replacing them with what it calls âhealthy, respectful images.â The latest study reveals âthe frequency with which sexual humor is used to communicate beliefs and perpetuate offensive narrowly defined female stereotypes among underage girls,â according to a PTC summary. Fox and ABC declined comment on the findings. NBC, CBS and CW did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Broadcasters compete with cable channels that draw viewers away with far more explicit material. Critics have said that itâs unfair to study broadcast content and not include the unregulated programming on cable, or to ignore that viewers demonstrate what they want by tuning in risque shows. The reportâs release, intended for last year, was delayed by the PTCâs decision to focus its resources on the subject of violence in media after the Newtown, Conn., school shootings. Networks also werenât heard from on that PTC study, which was released last May and found that violence remained a prime-time TV staple even immediately following Newtown. TV executives typically are reluctant to talk about sensitive issues such as violence or sexuality and, when pressed, downplay the link between on-screen fare and real-life behavior. Theyâve also questioned aspects of PTCâs methodology. The new study, for instance, includes scenes from âLaw & Order: Special Victims Unit,â a drama that focuses on those trying to stop sexual predators. Winter said itâs important to distinguish between the treatment the topic receives in that show compared to a comedy, but added that âthere still need to be heightened scrutinyâ of the effect on viewers. He called for a broad dialogue about media content and its effect, and renewed the PTCâs insistence that the Federal Communications Commission enforce its âsafe harborâ rule barring indecency or profanity from airing during the hours of 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. Lynn Elber is a national television columnist for The Associated Press.

Stream-of-consciousness explanation: Within a day, we often go about our daily activities: waking up, working, spending time with loved ones, and sleeping. But let's consider how many hours in total we have within one day to do all these things and plan our schedules, as time affects every aspect of our lives. To break down a day into hours, we need to understand the units of time. One year has 365 days or 366 days in a leap year. A month generally has 30 or 31 days, except for February, which has 28 days or 29 days in a leap year. Each week contains 7 days, with each day composed of 24 hours. The concept of the 24-hour day has been used for centuries and comes from the ancient Egyptians, who divided the day into 10 hours of light, followed by 12 hours of night, and then 2 additional hours to represent the twilight hours. This system eventually evolved into the 24-hour day we use today. In a standard day, there are two 12-hour periods, commonly known as AM (from Latin \\"ante meridiem,\\" meaning before midday) and PM (from Latin \\"post meridiem,\\" meaning after midday). Each of these periods has 12 hours, starting from midnight (00:00) and ending at 11:59 PM.

Espresso: Espresso is a concentrated form of coffee made by forcing hot water through finely-ground coffee beans under high pressure. It is often served in small cups and has a strong, rich flavor. 2. Latte: A latte is a coffee drink made with espresso and steamed milk. It typically has a more mellow flavor due to the large amount of milk, which dilutes the strong taste of the espresso. The ratio of milk to espresso in a latte is usually about 1:3. 3. Cappuccino: A cappuccino is another espresso-based drink, but with a different ratio of espresso, steamed milk, and milk foam. It usually consists of equal parts espresso, steamed milk, and foam, giving it a balanced taste and a creamy, frothy texture.

H.G. Ragavendhra, Jaipur's superintendent of police, told CNN that police found nine newly-purchased bicycles at the scene, and think they were used to carry the explosives. The owner of the bike shop is helping police draw a sketch of the person who purchased them. Police have also picked up six suspects and were questioning them. Jaipur, known as the \\"pink city\\" for its rose-colored forts and palaces, is a popular tourist attraction. The majority Hindu city of 2.7 million people has a sizable Muslim population. The day-long curfew, authorities said, was meant to prevent \\"communal violence.\\" It was intended to prevent large crowds from gathering at the blast site and hampering the investigation, said Jaipur police director Kanhaiya Lal. Also, tempers could flare as mourners spend the day carrying bodies to their home villages and to crematoriums, he said. Home ministry officials suspect the Islamic militant group Harkat-ul-Jihad al-Islami (HuJi) of being behind the attacks, according to CNN's sister network CNN-IBN and the Press Trust of India. No one has claimed responsibility. In the past, officials have blamed attacks within its borders on \\"foreign\\" Islamic extremist groups fighting against Indian rule in the disputed Himalayan territory of Kashmir. It is a term that is commonly understood to refer to Pakistan. Kashmir has been the source of bitter dispute and two wars between India and Pakistan. Both control parts of the region, which is predominantly Muslim. Pakistan has denied any involvement in the attacks. See the aftermath of the explosions. ». Raje told reporters Wednesday that the military had been placed on alert and security tightened around the borders of the state, the western edge of which lies next to Pakistan. She also took to task the central government, saying it had provided no advance warning about the possibility of such an attack. Furthermore, Raje said, the central government left a state-proposed organized crime bill unapproved for two years. The bill would have allowed local police more leeway to interrogate suspects plotting attacks, she said. On Tuesday evening, eight bombs tore through crowded markets and a packed Hindu temple in Jaipur's walled city. The blasts went off within a 12-minute span and within 500 meters (0.3 miles) of each other. Police defused a ninth bomb. The Jaipur blasts bear an eerie resemblance in its pattern to a deadly attack two years ago in India's financial capital, Mumbai. In July 2006, more than 200 people were killed when seven explosions targeted commuter trains in Mumbai, formerly Bombay. In that incident, the explosions went off within a span of 11 minutes. Both attacks used RDX, one of the most powerful kinds of military explosives, and ammonium nitrate, an oxidizing agent in explosives. And both attacks took place during the evening hours and on Tuesdays. The Jaipur blasts occurred near the temple on a day when devotees pray to Hanuman, the Hindu monkey king. Nearby markets and bazaars that were also targeted were filled with tourists and locals. In the Mumbai attack, the blasts were timed to go off during the height of rush hour. And authorities said the bombs all appeared to have been planted on trains that left the Churchgate station -- used daily by thousands of commuters in the metropolis of more than 11 million people. Indian officials blamed Pakistan's intelligence services and a Pakistan-based militant group, Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, for the attack. Pakistan, which banned Lashkar-e-Tayyiba in 2002, denied any involvement. The Jaipur blast has one more element in common with yet another deadly attack: the use of bicycles. Just as on Tuesday, assailants used bombs strapped to bicycles in an attack at a mosque in the western Indian city of Malegaon in September 2006. At least 33 people were killed and more than 100 wounded in that explosion, which took place on a Friday -- when the mosque is filled with Muslim worshippers. That attack was also blamed Lashkar-e-Tayyiba. Authorities have not connected the Jaipur blast to any previous attacks. HuJi -- or the Movement of Islamic Holy War -- is considered a terrorist organization by the United States. It is banned in neighboring Bangladesh, where it is accused of carrying out several attacks, including a foiled plot to kill the country's former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in 2000. And it has been blamed for several attacks inside India, including one at the American Center in Calcutta that killed five policemen in 2002. India ranks among the countries where terrorism is most common, the U.S. State Department said. \\"The conflict in Jammu and Kashmir, attacks by extreme leftist Naxalites and Maoists in eastern and central India, assaults by ethno-linguistic nationalists in the northeastern states, and terrorist strikes nationwide by Islamic extremists took more than 2,300 lives this year,\\" the agency said. CNN's Tess Eastment and Saeed Ahmed contributed to this report.","response":"On May 13, 2008, near-simultaneous bomb attacks in Jaipur, India, killed at least 63 people and injured over 200.

Jaipur's Superintendent of Police, H.G. Ragavendhra, shared that nine newly-purchased bicycles were discovered at the scene, which were likely used to carry the explosives.

Raje criticized the central government for not providing advance warning of potential attacks and for not approving a state-proposed organized crime bill. The Jaipur bombings shared similarities with previous attacks in 2006 in Mumbai and Malegaon - the use of powerful military explosives, timing of the bombings during peak hours, and the use of bicycles.

While it's possible that Austin wants to do something special, there is no information in the context to suggest this. - The third option, \\"did this to be informed,\\" is the most relevant to the context. Austin retraced his steps, which implies that he is trying to gather information or understand a situation better. This option directly addresses his actions and their purpose. Step 4: Choose the best answer Based on the analysis, the best answer would be: \\"did this to be informed.\\" Austin's action of retracing his steps shows that he wants to become informed about something, whether to solve a problem or make a decision.

Here is a hypothesis: The arrival of a leader wanting to unify the country starts Nepal's modern history. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","response":"Yes, it is possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. This is because the premise and the hypothesis essentially convey the same underlying message, albeit in slightly different wording and structure. Both statements attempt to identify a singular moment or event - the arrival of a dynamic leader with the intention to unify Nepal - as the starting point of modern Nepalese history. To break it down, let's analyze each of the components in the premise and hypothesis. In the premise, three key elements are present: 1. \\"Modern Nepalese history\\" 2. \\"Arrival of a dynamic leader\\" 3. \\"Bent on unifying the country\\" The same elements can be found in the hypothesis: 1. \\"Nepal's modern history\\" 2. \\"The arrival of a leader\\" 3. \\"Wanting to unify the country\\" Although there are slight differences in wording and phrasing, the inherent meaning and relationship between these components remains consistent across both statements. This allows us to deduce that if the premise were true and universally accepted, it would also be valid to assume the truth of the hypothesis. However, it's important to note that determining the truth of the premise and hypothesis requires understanding the broader historical context behind these statements and assessing the evidence in support of this particular interpretation of modern Nepalese history. That being said, from a logical standpoint, the connection between the premise and the hypothesis is indeed strong, and if the premise is true, it's reasonable to conclude that the hypothesis is also true."},{"question":"Anderseits können, falls die Politik die Konjunkturmaßnahmen zu lange aufrechterhält, außer Kontrolle geratende Haushaltsdefizite eine staatliche Schuldenkrise herbeiführen (schon jetzt bestrafen die Märkte fiskalpolitisch undisziplinierte Länder mit erhöhten Risikoaufschlägen).

An action-packed sequel to \\"Captain America: The First Avenger,\\" important players in this film are made up of highly talented actors including: 1. Chris Evans as Steve Rogers / Captain America: A World War II veteran who was bio-engineered to possess physical prowess and works as an agent for S.H.I.E.L.D. Evans's nuanced performance captures the character's morally upright character and determination to protect humanity. 2. Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: A highly trained spy working for S.H.I.E.L.D. Johansson's dynamics with Evans adds depth to the storyline and her fierce depiction of Black Widow adds to the film's intensity. 3. Sebastian Stan as Bucky Barnes / Winter Soldier: Initially Steve's best friend, he becomes the Winter Soldier after being brainwashed. Stan's eerily cold portrayal of the Winter Soldier shows the terrifying extent to which his character was manipulated. 4. Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson / Falcon: A former Air Force pararescue airman who helps Steve throughout his mission. Mackie's lighthearted portrayal of Falcon brings much-needed moments of levity amid the movie's tense scenarios. 5. Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury: The director of S.H.I.E.L.D., he becomes a crucial figure in the story's development.

Emily VanCamp as Sharon Carter / Agent 13: A S.H.I.E.L.D. agent assigned to monitor Steve Rogers without his knowledge. VanCamp's portrayal of Sharon Carter presents a strong yet compassionate figure who is determined to perform her duty, no matter the cost. 9. Robert Redford as Alexander Pierce: A member of the World Security Council and the Secretary of Defence, who is revealed to be a HYDRA operative. Redford's stellar performance adds a cunning and deceitful layer to the film's narrative, further intensifying the storyline. 10. Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter: Steve Rogers' love interest from the previous film, she is seen as an aged woman suffering from Alzheimer's in this film. Although her presence is minimal, Atwell's performance packs an emotional punch. Supported by a robust cast including Toby Jones as Arnim Zola, Georges St-Pierre as Georges Batroc, Maximiliano Hernandez as Jasper Sitwell, and others, each actor contributes to crafting this film into an intense, action-driven narrative."},{"question":"LAHORE, Pakistan (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A court in Pakistan sentenced a mother to death on Monday for burning her daughter alive as punishment for marrying without the family's consent. Parveen Bibi confessed before a special court in the city of Lahore to killing her daughter in June for what she said was \\"bringing shame to the family\\". Police said 18-year-old Zeenat Rafiq married Hassan Khan and eloped to live with his family a week before she was killed. The court sentenced Rafiq's brother Anees to life in prison after the evidence showed her mother and brother had first beaten her, before her mother threw kerosene on her and set her on fire. After Rafiq's murder in a poor district of Lahore, none of her relatives sought to claim her body, police said, leaving her husband's family to bury her charred remains after dark in a graveyard near the city. Violence against women is rampant in Pakistan, according to the independent Human Rights Commission of Pakistan. Citing media reports, it said there were more than 1,100 \\"honor killings\\" in 2015. Pakistan's parliament passed legislation against \\"honor killings\\" in October, three months after the murder of outspoken social media star Qandeel Baloch. Her brother was arrested in relation to her strangling death in July. Perceived damage to a family's \\"honor\\" can involve eloping, fraternizing with men or other breaches of conservative values. In most cases, the victim is a woman and the killer is a relative who escapes punishment by seeking forgiveness for the crime from family members. Under the new law, relatives can forgive convicts in the case of a death sentence, but they would still have to face a mandatory life sentence.

Visit news.trust.org) ||||| LAHORE, Pakistan - A prosecutor says a court has sentenced a woman to death for burning her daughter alive for marrying a man of her choice in eastern Pakistan. Abdur Rauf said judge Chaudhry Ilyas in eastern Lahore on Monday convicted Parveen Bibi of burning to death Zeenat Rafiq a week after her marriage to Hassan Khan last June. Rauf said the court sentenced Anees Rafique to life in prison for helping his mother kill his 18-year-old sister. Defense lawyer Shahid Iqbal said the son had no role in the killing and was wrongly convicted. Authorities say Bibi brought Rafiq back home with a promise of celebrating the wedding but burned her alive instead. Neighbors in the congested, working-class neighborhood in the sprawling eastern Pakistani city came running when they heard the screams, but family members kept them from entering the house, said Nighat Bibi, who lives nearby. The police eventually arrived and found the charred body near a staircase. They arrested the mother soon thereafter. STR/AFP/Getty Images The victim’s husband, Hassan Khan, told reporters the two had been “in love since our school days” but the family had rejected several marriage proposals, forcing them to elope last month. He showed an affidavit of consent signed by his wife before a magistrate. He also showed cellphone photos of a smiling Zeenat wearing a red dress. Khan told Pakistani media that his wife had only returned to her own family for a visit after being assured it would be a celebration of her marriage, and she would not be harmed. He said he agreed reluctantly to let her return Akhtar, the a local police official, said Parveen confessed to killing her daughter with the help of her son Ahmar. He quoted the woman as saying “I don’t have any regrets.” Another police officer, Ibadat Nisar, said the body showed signs of beating and strangulation. For generations now in Pakistan, they’ve called it “honor” killing, carried out in the name of a family’s reputation. The killers routinely invoke Islam, but rarely can they cite anything other than their belief that Islam doesn’t allow the mixing of sexes. Even Pakistan’s hard-line Islamic Ideology Council, which is hardly known for speaking out to protect women, says the practice defies Islamic tenets. It doesn’t matter: in slums and far-off villages, away from the cosmopolitan city centers, people live in a world where religion is inextricably tied to culture and tradition, where tribal councils can order women publicly punished, and a family can decide to kill one of its own, even to avenge a wrongdoing committed by someone else. In the vast majority of cases, the “honor” killer is a man and the victim is a woman. She is a sister who falls in love with a man not of her family’s choosing. She is a daughter who refuses to agree to an arranged marriage, sometimes to a man old enough to be her father. She is a wife who can no longer stay in an abusive marriage and divorces her husband. He is a brother who cannot bear the taunts of other men brought up as he was, believing that women are subservient and must be kept in the shadows, their worth often measured by the number of sons they can produce. He is a neighbor who doesn’t think his friend did anything wrong in taking his sister’s life. He is a father who is angry about her killing not because she is dead, but because her death will reveal her “shame” to other members of the family and beyond. As modernity pushes against tradition, Pakistan has seen an increase in the number of women and girls killed in the name of honor: in 2015, 1,184 people died, only 88 of them men. The year before, the figure was 1005, and in 2013 it was 869, according to the independent Human Rights Commission of Pakistan. The true numbers are believed to be higher, because many cases go unreported. The killings have fueled a growing public outrage at the practice, and a chorus of voices saying that there is no honor in killing - only dishonor. They are working to close the legal loophole that lets killers go free. A proliferation of television channels and newspapers has brought the horrors of girls strangled, burned alive or shot in the head out of the secrecy of the home and into the public. But for many who have been fighting this kind of killing, it is the mindset of the boy who could kill his sister, or the parent who could kill a daughter, that has to be understood and changed. ||||| LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) — A prosecutor says a court has sentenced a woman to death for burning her daughter alive for marrying a man of her choice in eastern Pakistan.

Do you need a giant rocket to overcome gravity? No, you actually overcome gravity every day. Think about when you climb a set of stairs. When you do, you are overcoming gravity. What if you jump on a trampoline? You are overcoming gravity for a few seconds. Everyone can overcome gravity. You just need to apply a force larger than gravity. Think about that the next time you jump into the air. You are overcoming gravity for a brief second. Enjoy it while it lasts. Eventually, gravity will win the battle. According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"What are some examples of overcoming gravity?\\" is \\"Jump Rope\\"?","response":"Based on the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"What are some examples of overcoming gravity?\\" would include activities like climbing a set of stairs, jumping on a trampoline, and even simply jumping into the air. While jump rope is not explicitly mentioned, it can also be considered a valid example of overcoming gravity. When you jump rope, you exert a force greater than gravity for a brief moment, allowing you to elevate off the ground temporarily. In essence, any activity where you apply a force larger than gravity to leave the ground, even for a short period of time, can be considered an example of overcoming gravity. While gravity ultimately wins the battle and brings you back down, these activities demonstrate our ability to overcome it momentarily. Some other examples of overcoming gravity include: 1. Playing sports like basketball, where you jump to shoot or block a shot. 2. Gymnastics, where athletes perform flips, jumps, and other acrobatic movements. 3. Bungee jumping, where you experience a brief freefall before the elastic cord pulls you back up. 4. Skydiving, which involves falling from a high altitude and experiencing a sensation of freefall before deploying the parachute. 5. Parkour, where practitioners use their bodies to navigate obstacles and perform various jumps and flips. While most of these examples involve temporary victories over gravity, human-made spacecraft and rockets provide more lasting examples of overcoming gravity. These vehicles use powerful engines to escape Earth's gravitational pull, allowing them to travel vast distances in space where gravity's influence is minimal or even negligible."},{"question":"Classify the given hotel review based on the sentiment it expresses into two classes: negative and positive.

Adjust the pressure. Set the timer.","response":"Title: Step-by-Step Guide to Operating a Heat Press Machine for Optimal Results Introduction A heat press machine is a versatile tool that is widely used for printing designs on various materials, such as fabrics, ceramic tiles, mugs, and more. With the ability to apply heat and pressure simultaneously, it can create lasting impressions on items with precision. However, to achieve the best results, it's crucial to understand how to properly operate the machine. In this article, we will walk you through a step-by-step guide on setting up and operating a heat press machine like a pro. 1. Prepare the workspace and materials Before operating the heat press, ensure that your workspace is clean, well-ventilated, and free of any flammable materials. Keep the machine and all the necessary tools and materials, such as the substrates and transfers, easily accessible. Additionally, always wear heat-resistant gloves while working with the machine. 2. Open the heat press Lift the handle of the heat press to open it. Make sure that there is enough space between the top and bottom plates to place the material you intend to print on, without any obstruction. The open position will also allow you to have a clear view of the control panel where the temperature, pressure, and timer settings will be adjusted. 3. Adjust the temperature The heat press machine's temperature plays a critical role in ensuring proper transfer of the design onto the material. Check the manufacturer's guidelines for the recommended temperature settings when using your chosen transfer paper or vinyl. To set the temperature, locate the temperature control knob or digital panel and adjust it accordingly. Allow the machine to heat up to the desired temperature before proceeding with the printing process. 4. Adjust the pressure An accurate pressure setting is essential for a consistent and flawless print. Too little pressure may result in an incomplete transfer, while too much pressure can cause the material to stretch or the colors to bleed. To adjust the pressure, locate the control knob, which is typically found on the top platen of the machine. Turn the knob clockwise to increase the pressure and counterclockwise to decrease it. It is best to do a test print before starting your project to determine the ideal pressure setting for your material. 5. Set the timer The duration of heat application varies depending on your chosen transfer material and the substrate you're printing on. Check the manufacturer's guidelines for the recommended time settings. The timer can usually be set using a digital display or a mechanical dial on the control panel. Once you have set the timer, ensure it starts counting down when the heat press is closed. This will give you an accurate reading of the time spent in printing. 6. Load and press the material Place the material on the bottom platen of the heat press, positioning it correctly to align with the design you want to print. Place the transfer paper or vinyl on the material, ensuring that it is smooth and wrinkle-free. Close the heat press and secure it by pulling down the handle. Allow the machine to operate for the set time, and once the timer goes off, lift the handle to release the pressure and open the heat press. Carefully remove the transfer paper or vinyl from the material, and let the printed item cool down. Conclusion Operating a heat press machine requires precision and attention to detail. By following this step-by-step guide, you can ensure that your heat press projects are completed with accuracy and produce optimal results. Remember to always consult the manufacturer's guidelines for specific temperature, pressure, and time settings for your chosen materials, and to always wear heat-resistant gloves while operating the machine. With the right knowledge and practice, you can master the art of heat press printing and bring your creative vision to life."},{"question":"Question: How does youtube now operate as a business?

Answer choices: - white - amoeba - embryos - a fish - alpacas - swea - Schwinn - polyp A:","response":"The sea creature that reproduces without gamete fusion among the given answer choices is the amoeba. Amoebas are single-celled organisms, specifically within the phylum Protozoa, that live in aquatic habitats, including the ocean. They reproduce asexually through a process called binary fission, which does not involve the fusion of gametes. Binary fission occurs when the amoeba duplicates its genetic material and cytoplasm, then divides symmetrically into two daughter cells. This method of reproduction allows for rapid population growth, as long as conditions in their environment are favorable. While polyps, which are the sessile forms of marine invertebrates like corals and sea anemones, are also capable of reproducing without gamete fusion, the correct answer among the options provided is amoeba. Polyps can reproduce asexually through processes like budding, fragmentation, and fission, which do not involve the fusion of gametes. However, certain species of polyps may also reproduce sexually by releasing gametes into the water column, which then fuse to form a zygote. The resultant zygote develops into a motile larval stage before metamorphosing into a new polyp. The other answer choices are either unrelated or are not sea creatures. For example, alpacas are terrestrial mammals, and Schwinn is a brand of bicycles. White could be referring to a color or a surname, embryos are early developmental stages of animals, while a fish is a sea creature that generally reproduces sexually through the fusion of gametes. Lastly, \\"swea\\" could be a typo or a term unrelated to sea creatures."},{"question":"You are considering whether to buy a product. You look at the reviews.

Generate a detailed description of this data. Sentence:","response":"The data provided revolves around the Philippines, a Southeast Asian country consisting of approximately 7,641 islands, with the reference to a notable leader, Maria Lourdes Sereno. Located in the western Pacific Ocean, the Philippines is known for its rich biodiversity, beautiful geography, and a mix of indigenous and foreign-influenced cultural heritage. The nation has a long and complex history, with periods of Spanish colonization (beginning in the 16th century) and American rule (starting in the late 19th century), followed by Japanese occupation during World War II. Finally, the Philippines gained independence as a republic in 1946. As an archipelagic country, the Philippines consists of three main island groups (Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao) and numerous smaller islands. The nation boasts a population of about 109 million, making it the 13th most populous country in the world. The official languages are Filipino (based on Tagalog) and English, with Filipino being predominantly spoken in everyday communication and English being used in government, business, and education. The Philippine economy has been on an upward trajectory in recent years and has been considered one of the fastest-growing countries in Asia. The main economic drivers have been agriculture, industry (e.g., electronics, petroleum refining, and shipbuilding), and the service sector (particularly information and communication technology, as well as the business process outsourcing industry). Maria Lourdes Sereno, the leader mentioned in the data, is a noteworthy figure in the Philippine legal and political landscape. Born on July 2, 1960, she is an accomplished jurist, teacher, and public servant. Sereno earned her Bachelor of Arts degree in Economics from the Ateneo de Manila University, and later graduated cum laude from the University of the Philippines College of Law. She also obtained a Master of Laws degree from the University of Michigan. Maria Lourdes Sereno's contributions to her country have been remarkable. She has served in various capacities within the Philippine judicial and legal system, such as working as a legal consultant for the Office of the President, being a law professor at the University of the Philippines, and acting as an Associate Justice of the Court of Appeals. However, her most significant role came on August 25, 2012, when Sereno was appointed by then-President Benigno Aquino III as the 24th Chief Justice of the Philippines' Supreme Court. In taking the oath, she made history by becoming the first woman to hold the prestigious position in the country. Sereno became known for her advocacy for judicial reform and commitment to improving the administration of justice. During her tenure as Chief Justice, Maria Lourdes Sereno faced numerous challenges and controversies. In May 2018, an unprecedented decision by her colleagues on the Supreme Court led to her ouster, citing procedural grounds. The event was considered highly controversial and stirred heated debates on the independence of the judiciary and the Philippine Constitution's preservation. In conclusion, the data provides an insight into the Philippines - a culturally diverse, populous, and geographically remarkable Southeast Asian country - and its connection to a prominent, groundbreaking leader, Maria Lourdes Sereno. Her appointment as the first female Chief Justice of the Supreme Court speaks to her resilience and dedication to serving the country and its people, despite the challenges and controversies she faced during her tenure."},{"question":"Please capitalize where necessary: sierra de guadarrama national park","response":"Sierra de Guadarrama National Park"},{"question":"Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the region that supports supports a 59 million-a-year Tortugas pink shrimp industry? from the following article ? Three species of mangrove trees exist in the region: red (Rhizophora mangle), black (Avicennia germinans), and white (Laguncularia racemosa), although all are from different families. All have the same characteristics: they are tolerant of salt, brackish, and fresh water; they grow in oxygen-poor soil; and they can survive drastic water-level changes. Black and white mangroves excrete salt from under their leaves, and red mangroves filter the salinity of sea water. All species are integral to coastline protection during severe storms. Red mangroves, for example, have far-reaching roots that trap sediments. The trees not only stabilize coastlines, but add land as more sand and decaying vegetation is trapped in the root systems. All three mangroves also absorb the energy of waves and storm surges. The estuaries act as fisheries for fry and nurseries for crustaceans. Shrimp, oysters, crabs, whelks, cockles, and snails thrive in these waters, as do primordial horseshoe crabs (Limulus polyphemus). The region supports a 59 million-a-year Tortugas pink shrimp (Farfantepenaeus duorarum) industry, and a 22 million-a-year stone crab (Menippe mercenaria) industry. Between 80 and 90 percent of species that are harvested commercially in Florida are born or spend time in the shallow waters near the Everglades. Oysters and mangroves work in tandem to build up the coastline. The sand around the coastline has minute white particles of quartz and fine shells. When currents are right, oysters grow in colonies or beds, and deposit their shells, reinforcing the bed. Mangrove seeds, called propagules, are full embryos and float in water until they reach a favorable location and take root, often on oyster beds. They shed skin and litter, ensuring other trees will not compete for space and nutrients.Mangroves also serve as excellent rookeries for birds. Wading birds, such as roseate spoonbills (Platalea ajaja), egrets, and tricolored herons (Egretta tricolor) use the mangroves as a nursery, due to the proximity of food sources...

The only thing interesting about this movie is the box. On the box it says \\"from the director of the boogeyman\\" so I figured...eh whatever, if this was made recently I'm sure the directing at least won't be TOO bad :-, but after I saw the movie and looked at what \\"boogeyman\\" they were talking about, it's some nonsense from the early 1980's that he made. Great way to rope in unsuspecting viewers. ANYWAY, I think that they just liked the name \\"Zodiac Killer\\", and didn't bother to research any of the actual Zodiac's crimes or his MO, or even the years that he was active. All of the crimes they talk about have nothing to do with the Zodiac and the \\"stories\\" about the original Zodiac take place several years after the actual Zodiac's crimes did. They also compare the Zodiac to \\"Vampire of Dusseldorf\\" Fritz Haarman throughout the movie and talk to Fritz's \\"son\\" quite often. The Zodiac and Haarman were nothing alike, and it makes more sense to compare him to BTK who also shot people, not a man who killed people by chewing through their necks. None of the Haarman facts are correct either, just a bunch of jumbled nonsense. His son even says \\"Don't forget, his name was Fritz Haarman with 2 t's\\"...His actual name just has one! I think that the writer/director simply typed in a google search for serial killers and the quickest ones that came up were the Zodiac Killer and Fritz Haarman. \\"Ooh those sound like cool names, let's make a movie about them without doing any outside research! great idea!\\" Perhaps my favorite inconsistency in this movie is the way that the experts as well as the young killer describe suffering from DSM-IV and getting cured of it. \\"I was also diagnosed with DSM-IV and have since recovered\\", etc. For those of you who don't know, DSM-IV is the psychological manual for mental disorders. If anybody suffers from the book itself then they must have some SERIOUS problems! Haha. Anyway, my point is that this goes on the bottom of my top 5 worst movies of all time list, and it's rare that a movie ever reaches that point. But, if you are interested in watching a totally non-fact based story about serial killers that happens to be nothing more than boring, full of inexperienced actors, and not completely rational, I'd say check out this movie. ...Oh, and I liked how the killer \\"tear gassed\\" a few of his victims with dry ice.

Whorf is widely known as an advocate for the idea that differences between the structures of different languages shape how their speakers perceive and conceptualize the world. This principle has frequently been called the \\"Sapir-Whorf hypothesis\\", after him and his mentor Edward Sapir, but Whorf called it the principle of linguistic relativity, because he saw the idea as having implications similar to Einstein's principle of physical relativity. Throughout his life Whorf was a chemical engineer by profession, but as a young man he took up an interest in linguistics. Context: Until his return from Mexico in 1930 Whorf had been entirely an autodidact in linguistic theory and field methodology, yet he had already made a name for himself in Middle American linguistics. Whorf had met Sapir, the leading US linguist of the day, at professional conferences, and in 1931 Sapir came to Yale from the University of Chicago to take a position as Professor of Anthropology. Alfred Tozzer sent Sapir a copy of Whorf's paper on \\"Nahuatl tones and saltillo\\". Sapir replied stating that it \\"should by all means be published\\"; however, it was not until 1993 that it was prepared for publication by Lyle Campbell and Frances Karttunen. Whorf took Sapir's first course at Yale on \\"American Indian Linguistics\\". He enrolled in a program of graduate studies, nominally working towards a PhD in linguistics, but he never actually attempted to obtain a degree, satisfying himself with participating in the intellectual community around Sapir. At Yale, Whorf joined the circle of Sapir's students that included such luminary linguists as Morris Swadesh, Mary Haas, Harry Hoijer, G. L. Trager and Charles F. Voegelin. Whorf took on a central role among Sapir's students and was well respected. Sapir had a profound influence on Whorf's thinking. Sapir's earliest writings had espoused views of the relation between thought and language stemming from the Humboldtian tradition he acquired through Franz Boas, which regarded language as the historical embodiment of volksgeist, or ethnic world view. But Sapir had since become influenced by a current of logical positivism, such as that of Bertrand Russell and the early Ludwig Wittgenstein, particularly through Ogden and Richards' The Meaning of Meaning, from which he adopted the view that natural language potentially obscures, rather than facilitates, the mind to perceive and describe the world as it really is. In this view, proper perception could only be accomplished through formal logics. During his stay at Yale, Whorf acquired this current of thought partly from Sapir and partly through his own readings of Russell and Ogden and Richards. As Whorf became more influenced by positivist science he also distanced himself from some approaches to language and meaning that he saw as lacking in rigor and insight. One of these was Polish philosopher Alfred Korzybski's General semantics, which was espoused in the US by Stuart Chase. Chase admired Whorf's work and frequently sought out a reluctant Whorf, who considered Chase to be \\"utterly incompetent by training and background to handle such a subject.\\" Ironically, Chase would later write the foreword for Carroll's collection of Whorf's writings. Question: What year did he attend Yale? Answer:","response":"Benjamin Lee Whorf began attending Yale University in 1931, when his mentor Edward Sapir joined the faculty as Professor of Anthropology. Whorf enrolled in a program of graduate studies, participating in the intellectual community around Sapir and taking his first course on \\"American Indian Linguistics.\\""},{"question":"Durant leurs années de travail qui ont précédé l’inscription à Compagnie des travailleurs du Nouveau-Brunswick, les participants avaient occupé en moyenne un total de 11 emplois différents pour une durée variant entre 3 semaines et plus de 30 ans.

The surface of the pet that has less friction is the (A) bearded dragon (B) bunny rabbit The answer is:","response":"(B) bunny rabbit Here's why: The task is to decide which of William's pets, the bearded dragon or the bunny rabbit, has less friction on its surface. This is based on the given information about their surfaces when petted. Friction is resistance to sliding, rolling, or flowing motion. It can be dependent on the roughness or smoothness of surfaces that come into contact. So, a rougher surface would create more friction, while a smoother surface would create less friction. According to the logic test question, William notices that his bearded dragon's skin is rougher than his bunny rabbit's when petting them. This implies that the bunny rabbit's skin is smoother and hence offer less friction than the bearded dragon's. Given this, the answer should be (B) bunny rabbit."},{"question":"Is the following a factual statement? \\"Artisan paints ceramic models made by hand and knits together woven baskets.\\" Options: - yes - no Your chain-of-thought:","response":"The statement can be considered factual based on the information provided.

A:","response":"A: The leader who played a significant role in the unification of Germany under Prussian dominance was Otto von Bismarck, a Prussian statesman who served as the first Chancellor of the German Empire from 1871 to 1890. Bismarck, also known as the \\"Iron Chancellor,\\" was a master of diplomatic and military strategies and implemented a series of carefully planned policies that ultimately achieved German unification. Born on April 1, 1815, in Schönhausen, Prussia, Otto von Bismarck belonged to an aristocratic family. He studied law and entered civil service in Prussia but left to pursue agriculture and politics. In 1847, Bismarck became a member of Prussia's first elected parliament, where he quickly gained recognition for his conservative and pro-monarchist views. Throughout the 1850s, Bismarck held various diplomatic positions, including Prussian envoy to the German Confederation and ambassador to Russia. In 1862, during a time of political crisis, King Wilhelm I of Prussia appointed Bismarck as the minister president and foreign minister of Prussia. Bismarck's principal objective was to strengthen and expand Prussia's dominance and ultimately unify the numerous independent German states under Prussian control. To achieve this goal, Bismarck pursued a policy known as \\"Blood and Iron,\\" which emphasized the importance of war and force in achieving political objectives. He conducted a series of wars and diplomatic maneuvers between 1864 and 1871 that changed the balance of power in Central Europe and led to the establishment of the German Empire: 1. The Danish-Prussian War (1864): Bismarck formed an alliance with Austria against Denmark, resulting in Prussian-Austrian victory and the acquisition of the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein. 2. The Austro-Prussian War (1866), also known as the Seven Weeks' War: Bismarck initiated a war against Austria to weaken its influence in the German Confederation. Prussia emerged victorious and replaced the German Confederation with a new alliance, the North German Confederation, under Prussian dominance. 3. The Franco-Prussian War (1870-1871): Bismarck skillfully engineered a diplomatic crisis with France, leading to war between Prussia and France. The conflict resulted in Prussian victory and the ultimate collapse of Napoleon III's regime. This war marked a turning point in German unification as the southern German states, initially neutral or allied with France during the war, joined the North German Confederation. On January 18, 1871, in the aftermath of the Franco-Prussian War, the German Empire was proclaimed with King Wilhelm I of Prussia as its first emperor (Kaiser), establishing a powerful new nation state in Europe. Bismarck served as the first chancellor of the German Empire, where he continued to shape its foreign policy and domestic affairs until his dismissal in 1890. In conclusion, Otto von Bismarck was the key figure responsible for the unification of Germany under Prussian leadership. His astute diplomacy and military strategies transformed the fragmented collection of German states into a powerful empire, which had a significant impact on European politics and history leading into the 20th century."},{"question":"Teacher:In this task you are given a sentence.

Mardaman, once the capital of a Mesopotamian province and its own independent kingdom, is believed to have begun as early as 4,800 years ago and is cited in sources dating to the Akkadian Empire, the first empire in history, report Smithsonian and Heritage Daily. Archaeologists from Germany's University of Tübingen, however, didn't know the site they were working on top of until last year, when they discovered 92 cuneiform tablets inside a vessel covered in clay while excavating a ruined palace in Bassetki. Deciphered from Assyrian, the 3,250-year-old tablets identify the city as Mardaman, then an important commercial hub in the Middle Assyrian Empire, connected by trading routes to Mesopotamia, Anatolia, and Syria, reports Live Science. It was also the administrative seat of an unknown Assyrian province, headed by governor Assur-nasir, per the tablets, which date to the time the palace was destroyed. \\"All of a sudden it became clear that our excavations had found an Assyrian governor's palace,\\" lead researcher Peter Pfälzner says in a statement. While it isn't clear why the palace was destroyed—Mardaman was repeatedly razed and rebuilt—the tablets appear to have been purposefully hidden afterward. \\"Perhaps the information [contained] was meant to be protected and preserved for posterity,\\" says Pfälzner. He adds the tablets, revealing Assur-nasir's \\"administrative and commercial affairs,\\" show the city \\"achieved a final significance as a Middle Assyrian governor's seat\\" after its heyday between 1900BC and 1700BC, though it would keep flourishing for perhaps another 800 years, per Live Science.

Kenneth Duxbury, an 82-year-old army veteran, was attacked by two drug addicts, Stephen McLeish and John Carroll, who made away with £250 that Mr. Duxbury was intending to use to pay a bill. Kenneth Duxbury had led a quiet and respectable life, spending his younger years serving in the military and subsequently working diligently to provide for his family. His wife, Iris Duxbury, aged 79, had long been his rock in both life and marriage. Together, they raised a loving family and enjoyed a peaceful retirement in their later years. The brutal attack significantly rattled the senior Duxbury's life. According to the family, Kenneth Duxbury was no longer the same man after the harrowing experience. Just a day after he informed his wife about the mugging, Iris Duxbury suffered a stroke. The great-grandmother was immediately admitted to the hospital, but despite the best efforts of the doctors and other medical staff, she passed away on September 12th. Overwhelmed with grief and stress, Mr. Duxbury's health began to deteriorate rapidly. It was clear that the ordeal had taken a significant toll on his well-being, despite the stoic front he initially displayed. Barely 48 hours after his wife's death, Kenneth Duxbury succumbed to his ill health, leaving behind a heartbroken family mourning the loss of two cherished elders. The two career criminals behind the chain of events, Stephen McLeish and John Carroll, were finally brought to justice yesterday. Both men faced a slew of charges related to the mugging, which included robbery and assault. After a somber and emotional trial that saw the Duxbury family recount the tragedy that unfolded, McLeish and Carroll were each sentenced to three years in jail. Justice, however, can only provide a small measure of comfort for the bereaved family members. The tragic story of Kenneth and Iris Duxbury serves as a stark reminder of the indirect consequences that can stem from a single reprehensible act by career criminals. As the community gathers to mourn the loss of the beloved elderly couple, questions are raised about how such tragedies can be prevented in the future. The need for stricter deterrents against repeat offenders and increased support systems for drug addicts are among the topics being debated in the wake of this heart-rending case. In the end, it is the collective responsibility of society to take care of its most vulnerable members and ensure that their golden years remain unblemished by such heinous acts of violence and deceit."},{"question":"Information: - Clett is a small uninhabited Scottish islet near the north coast of Caithness , just to the west Holborn Head north of Scrabster . - Old Norse was a North Germanic language that was spoken by inhabitants of Scandinavia and inhabitants of their overseas settlements during about the 9th to 13th centuries. - Thurso (pronounced , ) is a town and former burgh on the north coast of the Highland council area of Scotland.

Damon is not shown; instead, Etty illustrates the scene from Damon's viewpoint. By placing the audience in Damon's position, Etty aimed to induce the same reactions in the viewer as Damon's dilemma as described by Thomson; that of whether to enjoy the spectacle despite knowing it to be inappropriate, or to follow the accepted morality of the time and look away, in what art historian Sarah Burnage has described as \\"a titillating moral test for spectators to both enjoy and overcome\\".The pose of Musidora is based on that of the Aphrodite of Cnidus and the Venus de' Medici. It is possible that Etty was also familiar with Thomas Gainsborough's Musidora, which shares similar elements. Gainsborough's Musidora, his only large nude, was never exhibited in his lifetime and remained in private hands until 1847, but Etty was familiar with its then-owner Robert Vernon and may have seen it in his collection. The setting for the painting is a pool in the grounds of The Plantation, a house in the village of Acomb, near York. The Plantation was the home of his close friend and patron the Reverend Isaac Spencer, vicar of Acomb, and its grounds were a scene Etty had previously painted. In 1846 Etty bought a house in York for his retirement; Burnage speculates that Etty chose Acomb on the grounds that a view of York was quintessentially English.Although Etty had traditionally worked in the Venetian style of painting, with rich colours and detail, for Musidora he adopted a much softer and earthier palette, although his use of reflected light on flesh is derived from Venetian styles. He moved away from Rubens, who up to this time had been his greatest influence, and closer to the style of Titian. This is likely owing to the nature of the subject matter.

What is the name of the sea-going vessel used by the Royal Australian Army during 1945 but also use as early as 2nd century AD and developed rapidly during the Song Dynasty? The answer is:","response":"The name of the sea-going vessel used by the Royal Australian Army during 1945, which was also in use as early as the 2nd century AD and developed rapidly during the Song Dynasty, is the Junk. Junks were ancient Chinese sailing ships that were widely used for centuries in China, and they were primarily designed for long-distance voyages in challenging ocean conditions. The origins of the junk can be traced back to the Han Dynasty (206 BC – 220 AD), and their design and construction improved greatly during the succeeding periods, particularly during the Song Dynasty (960 – 1279 AD). The Song Dynasty saw advancements in shipbuilding technology, making junks stronger, faster, and more seaworthy. The distinctive features of the junk include its fully battened sails, which were typically made of bamboo slats or grass mats, providing better control and making the vessel more stable in various wind conditions. The hull of the junk was sturdy and could withstand rough seas, and the watertight compartments made it less prone to capsizing or taking on water. During the 1940s, during World War II, the Royal Australian Army used junks to conduct reconnaissance and patrol missions in the Pacific region. The Australian forces found junks to be a useful and versatile alternative to conventional naval vessels, as they were relatively small, easy to maneuver, and could navigate shallow waters. Although they were not as advanced as the naval ships of the time, they were functional and suited the needs of the Royal Australian Army in specific situations. In summary, the sea-going vessel used by the Royal Australian Army during 1945, which had a history dating back to the 2nd century AD and experienced significant advancement during the Song Dynasty, is the Junk - a versatile and enduring Chinese ship design that played a role in various naval endeavors throughout history."},{"question":"Process: - Sediment transport is the movement of solid particles (sediment) - The movement is due to a combination of gravity acting on the sediment, and/or the movement of the fluid in which the sediment is entrained - Sediment transport occurs in natural systems where the particles are clastic rocks (sand, gravel, boulders, etc.), mud, or clay - The fluid is air, water, or ice - And the force of gravity acts to move the particles along the sloping surface on which they are resting - Sediment transport due to fluid motion occurs in rivers, oceans, lakes, seas, and other bodies of water due to currents and tides - Transport is also caused by glaciers as they flow - suppose not many strong winds happens, how will it affect more sediment moved by fluid motion. Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process","response":"The absence of strong winds would indirectly impact a step of the sediment transport process. In the case of sediment transport, strong winds can contribute to the movement of sediment by inducing surface currents, waves, and tides in water bodies, as well as aeolian (wind) transportation in dry environments. These wind-driven processes can increase the erosion and mobilization of sediment particles in both land and aquatic environments. Without strong winds, sediment movement due to fluid motion would be reduced, as the primary driving forces (surface currents, waves, and tides) would be weaker in general. As a result, the rate of sediment transport and erosion would likely be slower, which in turn might affect various morphological processes like coastal erosion, riverbed formation, and dune migration in the environment. So, in this scenario, the absence of strong winds would be an indirect perturbation that affects the sediment transport process as it influences the fluid motion that causes the movement of sediment particles."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the professor trying to do while being interrupted by the neighboring office?

I suppose these chapters are \\"politically incorrect\\" these days so someone took the liberty to remove them without notifying the readers? We have read the Russian translation which is complete, hence we noticed the discrepancy.I wouldn't recommend this book, as it is incomplete. Answer:","response":"The given review would most likely decrease the chances of me buying the product. The reasons for this are as follows: 1. Incomplete Product: The primary concern mentioned in the review is that the book is incomplete, with missing chapters. This means that if I were to buy this book, I wouldn't get the full experience or the entire story, which devalues the product's worth. Unless I am willing to search for another edition with those missing chapters, it discourages me from purchasing this particular one. 2. Lack of Transparency: The reviewer mentioned that the chapters were removed without notifying the readers, thus raising questions about the publisher's transparency and honesty. As a customer, I would want to be informed about any changes made to a product, especially if they impact its content and quality. This lack of transparency weakens my trust in the product and its publisher. 3. Politically Incorrect Content: The reviewer mentioned that the missing chapters might have been removed due to concerns about political correctness. If it's true, the issue could affect my perception of this product in one of two ways. On one hand, I might appreciate the publisher's intention to remove content that might not conform to modern values or could be offensive to some readers. On the other hand, such removal could also be seen as censorship or a distortion of the original work, diminishing the book's value as a historical or cultural artifact. 4. Russian Translation Comparison: The reviewer stated that they noticed the discrepancy because they had read the complete Russian translation. It's a legitimate point of comparison for the reviewer, but this information could be less relevant to me if I'm unable to read or access the Russian version. Nevertheless, knowing that a complete version exists in another language might prompt me to seek out a complete English version, instead of settling for an incomplete product. 5. Negative Recommendation: Overall, the reviewer doesn't recommend the book due to the reasons mentioned above. When considering a purchase, especially when there are many options available, recommendations from other customers play a critical role in the decision-making process. A negative review like this could significantly impact my decision-making and ultimately decrease the likelihood of me buying the product."},{"question":"Given the following passage \\"It is admitted that the doctrine as defined by Pius IX was not explicitly mooted before the 12th century.

The distinction or status of being part of the principalia was a hereditary right. However, it could also be acquired, as attested by the royal decree of 20 December 1863 (signed in the name of Queen Isabella II by the Minister of the Colonies, Jose de la Concha). This distinguished upper class was exempted from tribute (tax) to the Spanish crown during the colonial period. From the beginning of the colonial period in the Philippine, the Spanish government built on the traditional pre-conquest socio-political organization of the barangay and co-opted the traditional indigenous princes and their nobles, thereby ruling indirectly. The barangays in some coastal places in Panay, Manila, Cebu, Jolo, and Butuan, with cosmopolitan cultures and trade relations with other countries in Asia, were already established principalities (Kinadatuan) before the coming of the Spaniards. In other regions, even though the majority of these barangays were not large settlements, yet they had organized societies dominated by the same type of recognized aristocracy and lordships (with birthright claim to allegiance from followers), as those found in more established, richer and more developed principalities. The aristocratic group in these pre-colonial societies was called the datu class. Its members were presumably the descendants of the first settlers on the land or, in the case of later arrivals, of those who were datus at the time of migration or conquest. The duty of the datus was to rule and govern their subjects and followers, and to assist them in their interests and necessities. What the chiefs received from their followers was: to be held by them in great veneration and respect; and they were served in their wars and voyages, and in their tilling, sowing, fishing, and the building of their houses. The natives attended to these duties very promptly, whenever summoned by their chief. They also paid their chief tribute (which they called buwis) in varying quantities, in the crops that they gathered. The descendants of such chiefs, and their relatives, even though they did not inherit the Lordship, were held in the same respect and consideration, and were all regarded as nobles and as persons exempt from the services rendered by the others, or the plebeians (timawas). The same right of nobility and chieftainship was preserved for the women, just as for the men.

Plot title: Priest Movie plot: Father Greg Pilkington, newly assigned to St. Mary's parish in inner-city Liverpool, is startled to discover Father Matthew Thomas is engaged in a sexual relationship with rectory housekeeper Maria Kerrigan. Moreover, Father Thomas is a left-wing radical and an outspoken proponent of Liberation Theology, leading him to constant clashes and bickering with the Bishopâwho nevertheless appreciates his abilities. While the young protagonist's personal traditional conservatism and religious beliefs are offended by the older priest's blatant disregard for his vow of celibacy, he struggles with his own homosexual urges, especially after he meets Graham at a local gay hangout and the two embark on a physical relationship. Meanwhile, student Lisa Unsworth has confided she was sexually abused by her father, who confirms her story. Both have revealed their secret in the confessional, however, so Father Greg is required to honour the sanctity of the Sacrament of Penance and not reveal what he has been told. He tries to warn her mother to keep a close watch on her, but the naive woman believes her daughter is safe while in the care of her husband. When Mrs. Unsworth discovers her husband molesting Lisa and realises the priest knew what was happening, she lashes out at him. Adding to his torment is his arrest for having sex with Graham in a parked car. When he pleads guilty to the charge, the story is headlined on the front page of the local newspaper and, unable to face his parishioners, Father Greg relocates to a remote rural parish headed by a disapproving and unforgiving priest. Father Matthew convinces him to return to St. Mary's, and the two preside over a Mass that is disrupted by the loud protests of those opposed to Father Greg's presence on the altar. Father Matthew demands they leave the chapel. The two priests then begin to distribute the Eucharist, but the remaining parishioners ignore Father Greg and line up to receive communion from Father Matthew.

Each stitch Jenna makes is 1/4 inch long. If Jenna makes 24 stitches per minute, how many minutes does it take Jenna to hem her dress? Let's be accurate as possible.","response":"Let's break down the problem step by step. Step 1: Convert 3 feet to inches. 1 foot = 12 inches, so 3 feet = 3 * 12 = 36 inches. Step 2: Determine the number of stitches needed to hem the dress. Since each stitch is 1/4 inch long, we'll divide the length of the hem in inches by the length of each stitch. Number of stitches = 36 inches / (1/4 inch/stitch) = 36 * 4 = 144 stitches. Step 3: Calculate the time it takes Jenna to make 144 stitches. Jenna can make 24 stitches per minute, so we'll divide the total number of stitches by the number of stitches she can make per minute. Time (in minutes) = 144 stitches / (24 stitches/minute) = 144 / 24 = 6 minutes.

While they may be phrased differently, they share the same underlying intent: seeking information about any forthcoming films in the Percy Jackson series. As for the answer to the questions, the original Percy Jackson film series, which began with \\"Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief\\" (2010) and continued with \\"Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters\\" (2013), did not fare particularly well in terms of critical reception and box office performance. Due to these factors, it is highly unlikely that any more movies within this particular series will be produced. However, fans of the franchise can look forward to a fresh adaptation in the form of a television series instead. In May 2020, it was announced that a Percy Jackson TV show was in development for the Disney+ streaming platform. The series' creator, Rick Riordan, and his wife, Becky Riordan, will be heavily involved in the project. This latest adaptation aims to stay more faithful to the source material - the popular book series written by Rick Riordan - which many fans felt was lacking in the original film adaptations.

Hanssen has been recalled from a detail post at the State Department to FBI headquarters ostensibly to head up a new division specializing in Information Assurance. Initially, Hanssen insists on a strict formality between the two men. He frequently rails against the bureaucracy of the FBI and complains that only those who regularly \\"shoot guns\\" are considered for senior positions instead of those, like himself, who are involved in vital national security matters. He calls the bureau's information technology systems antiquated and laments the lack of coordination and information exchange with other intelligence agencies. Eventually, Hanssen becomes a friend and mentor to O'Neill and takes a personal interest in him and his wife Juliana (Caroline Dhavernas), who is suspicious of Hanssen and resents his intrusions. A devout Catholic who is also a member of Opus Dei, Hanssen urges O'Neill, a lapsed Catholic, and his secular East German-born wife to become active churchgoers. O'Neill finds no evidence of Hanssen leading a secret double life and develops a growing respect for his boss, so he confronts his handler in the undercover assignment, Kate Burroughs (Laura Linney), and she admits that the sexual deviance allegations are only a secondary consideration.

To find the answer he did two tests, test A and test B. In test A he warmed up the reactants, but in test B he cooled down the reactants. To see a practical example of these tests he conducted two more tests, test C and test D. In test C he kept a food item in the refrigerator, but in test D he kept the same food item on the table top. Would particles of reactants in test A have lower or higher energy than particles in test B? Hint: When the temperature of reactants is higher, the rate of the reaction is faster. At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. As a result, they are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. For example, food spoils because of chemical reactions, and these reactions occur faster at higher temperatures (see the bread on the left in the Figure below ). This is why we store foods in the refrigerator or freezer (like the bread on the right in the Figure below ). The lower temperature slows the rate of spoilage. Answer:","response":"The particles of reactants in test A would have higher energy than particles in test B. The reason for this is that raising the temperature increases the energy of the reactants. In John's tests, he warmed up the reactants in test A and cooled them down in test B. Warming up the reactants increases their temperature and hence their energy. This is evident in terms of molecular behavior, where particles move faster and collide more often and with greater force when they have higher energy, making chemical reactions occur more quickly. Cooling the reactants in test B lowers their temperature and consequently reduces their energy. Hence, the particles move slower and collide less often and with less force, slowing down the rate of reactions. This principle is also evident in John's practical tests C and D.

This is because the hull is inedible and may have a bitter taste which can affect the flavor of the jam. Additionally, removing the hulls allows for a smoother jam consistency. Option 2, pureeing the entire strawberry without removing any portion of it, is not correct because it includes the inedible hulls in the jam-making process. This would lead to an undesirable texture and flavor."},{"question":"Q:Question: Polly didn't know her way around, so she navigated by landmark. She used statues, stores, and distinctive building.

Options: - countryside - national park - map - neighbourhood - city Explain why a human would choose \\"city\\" to answer the question above: A:","response":"A human would choose \\"city\\" to answer the question above for the following reasons: 1. Presence of landmarks: Cities typically have a wide variety of distinctive landmarks such as statues, stores, and unique buildings that people use to navigate. In the context of the question, Polly used landmarks for navigation, making \\"city\\" a suitable choice. 2. Urban setting: The options of countryside and national park imply natural settings with fewer distinctive man-made landmarks for navigation. City, on the other hand, has a high concentration of man-made features, which makes it easier for Polly to navigate using the mentioned landmarks. 3. Store density: Stores are more likely to be found in cities, where there is a higher population density and commercial activity. Therefore, the mention of Polly using stores as landmarks points more towards a city setting than any other option. 4. Comparison with other options: \\"Map\\" is not a suitable answer, as it doesn't represent a geographical location. \\"Neighbourhood\\" could potentially work, but it typically has fewer and less-varied landmarks compared to a city.

Young William Wallace (James Robinson) witnesses Longshanks' treachery, survives the deaths of his father (Sean Lawlor) and brother (Sandy Nelson), and is taken abroad on a pilgrimage throughout Europe by his paternal Uncle Argyle (Brian Cox), where he is educated. Years later, Longshanks grants his noblemen land and privileges in Scotland, including Prima Nocte. Meanwhile, a grown Wallace (Mel Gibson) returns to Scotland and falls in love with his childhood friend Murron MacClannough (Catherine McCormack), and the two marry in secret. Wallace rescues Murron from being raped by English soldiers, but as she fights off their second attempt, Murron is captured and publicly executed. In retribution, Wallace leads his clan to slaughter the English garrison in his hometown and send the occupying garrison at Lanark back to England. Longshanks orders his son Prince Edward (Peter Hanly) to stop Wallace by any means necessary. Wallace rebels against the English, and as his legend spreads, hundreds of Scots from the surrounding clans join him.

Your child will rise from bed and walk or engage in other activities that they would normally do when they are awake. Their eyes will be open but they will appear to be in a dream-like state, and will probably not answer when you talk to them, although they may carry out conversations. Sleepwalking can last a few seconds , a few minutes, or more. Sleepwalking can be an indication that certain parts of the brain may not be relaxing properly at bedtime. It can be caused by illness or fever, tiredness, stress or anxiety. It is thought to occur in the beginning, slow-wave stages of non-rapid eye movement sleep before dream sleep. It may be related to the lack of magnesium , and it is very possible that hormonal changes in body could cause it. Certainly a child is more likely to be a sleepwalker if one of his parents suffered, too . Sleepwalking itself is not dangerous and is generally not a sign of any more worrying problems. But if your child sleepwalks regularly, you have to take safety measures to make sure that he doesn't hurt himself while sleepwalking. Makes sure that any doors can't be opened by a child, and lock doors to the cellar, kitchen and other dangerous places. Check each night before lights go out for sharp objects or, indeed , anything on the floor which your child could trip over or hurt himself on. A child may sleepwalk once and never sleepwalk again. Others may sleepwalk once a month or so. Still others may sleepwalk almost nightly. If you are worried you should consult your doctor. Options: A Sleepwalking itself is not dangerous.

Who is the biggest traitor in U.S. history? Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","response":"The biggest traitor in the history of Italy is arguably Benito Mussolini. Mussolini was born in Italy on July 29, 1883, and eventually went on to establish the National Fascist Party. He rose to power as the Prime Minister of Italy in 1922 and eventually became Italy's dictator during the fascist regime. Mussolini drastically changed Italy into a one-party dictatorship, suppressing political opposition and free press, while implementing aggressive expansionist policies. During World War II, Mussolini aligned Italy with Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany, leading the country into a devastating war that resulted in countless deaths, including the Italian civilian population. Mussolini's policies and military alliance with Hitler were regarded as acts of betrayal to the Italian citizens, particularly as the outcomes of the war became apparent – defeat and destruction. Eventually, Mussolini was overthrown, and he was executed by Italian partisans on April 28, 1945. In contrast, the biggest traitor in U.S. history is often considered as Benedict Arnold. Born on January 14, 1741, Arnold was initially a respected military officer, who fought with distinction for the American Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. He was instrumental in capturing Fort Ticonderoga in 1775 and leading a force during the invasion of Quebec. However, Arnold grew resentful due to a lack of recognition and promotions within the army. He eventually turned against the American cause in 1780 and conspired with the British in a treasonous plot. Arnold planned to hand over the American fort at West Point to the British forces, but his treason was discovered before the plan could be executed. He managed to escape to the British side, where he was given a position in the British army but received little trust or respect. After the war, he lived in exile in England, where he passed away on June 14, 1801. These two questions are not paraphrases of each other. While both inquire about the biggest traitors in the histories of Italy and the United States, they refer to two distinct historical figures – Benito Mussolini and Benedict Arnold – each with different backgrounds, affiliations, and reasons for their actions. The consequences of their betrayals also differed considerably, considering the global scale and repercussions of Mussolini's actions in response to Arnold's localized act of treason in the American Revolutionary War."},{"question":"Q:Given this review: \\"Vishal Thakor Aj style\\" Would you recommend this app to a friend?

A. near shore B. a romulian space craft C. sail on sea D. heading east E. run aground The best answer is","response":"There are several factors that can cause a ship to stop moving, and the best answer from the given options would be E. run aground. When a ship runs aground, it comes into contact with the seafloor or land, which ultimately stops its movement. This can happen near the shore, on a sandbar, reef, or other underwater obstacles. Here's an explanation for each option: A. Near shore: Being near the shore doesn't necessarily cause a ship to stop moving. However, if it is too close and encounters the shallow waters or obstacles near the shore, it may run aground and stop. B. A Romulan spacecraft: This is a fictional scenario from the Star Trek universe, where a Romulan spacecraft could potentially cause a spaceship to stop in outer space. This option does not apply to a ship moving on the water. C. Sail on the sea: A ship with sails relies on wind to move. While lack of wind can cause a sailing ship to stop, simply having sails won't cause a ship to stop moving on their own. D. Heading east: The direction a ship is moving, like heading east, doesn't inherently cause it to stop moving unless there is an obstacle in that direction. So, the best answer chosen for the scenario that would cause a ship to stop moving, is E. run aground."},{"question":"Q: You are given a sentence in Hebrew.

Passage: The Polish Army was made up of soldiers who had formerly served in the various partitioning empires, supported by some international volunteers, such as the Kościuszko Squadron. Boris Savinkov was at the head of an army of 20,000 to 30,000 largely Russian POWs, and was accompanied by Dmitry Merezhkovsky and Zinaida Gippius. The Polish forces grew from approximately 100,000 in 1918 to over 500,000 in early 1920. In August 1920, the Polish army had reached a total strength of 737,767 soldiers; half of that was on the frontline. Given Soviet losses, there was rough numerical parity between the two armies; and by the time of the battle of Warsaw, the Poles might have even had a slight advantage in numbers and logistics.Among the major formations on the Polish side was the First Polish Army.

Pick your answer from: [i] Yes [ii] No The answer is:","response":"[ii] No The answer is not \\"absorbing nutrients\\" because nutrients are not responsible for causing cool objects to warm up. Nutrients are substances that provide nourishment essential for the growth and maintenance of living organisms, while the process of warming up cool objects involves the transfer of energy, primarily in the form of heat. Heat can be transferred between objects or their surroundings in various ways, such as conduction, convection, and radiation. In the context of your given example, \\"absorbing sunlight causes cool objects to warm up,\\" the process involved is radiation. Radiation is the transfer of heat energy through electromagnetic waves, such as sunlight. When cool objects absorb sunlight, they are essentially absorbing radiant energy, which in turn raises the object's temperature and warms it up. Other mechanisms to warm up cool objects include: 1. Conduction: This occurs when heat is transferred through direct contact between objects. For example, when a cool object comes into contact with a warmer object, heat energy will flow from the warmer object to the cooler object, causing the cooler object to warm up. 2. Convection: This process involves heat transfer through the movement of fluids, such as air or water. When cool objects are surrounded by a warmer fluid, the temperature of the objects will increase due to the transfer of heat from the warmer fluid. In summary, although absorbing sunlight is one way that cool objects can warm up, the process is not related to nutrients. Instead, the warming involves the transfer of heat energy through various mechanisms like radiation, conduction, and convection."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: As academic work is becoming arguably more precarious and competitive, shorter contracts are becoming the norm, and the number of people completing PhDs in the UK is increasing, the risks associated with researching academia are high. This post discusses and explores my experiences of being a PhD student researching women’s lived experiences of research evaluation in the UK, and my thoughts on and experiences of interviewing very senior and esteemed academics as a junior researcher. My PhD study explored research evaluation in the form of the Research Excellence Framework (REF) – a weighty force in UK academia – the outcomes of which, I argue, hold the potential to alter the course of an academic career considerably, as well as playing a role in the type of work that some academics do, particularly given the REF impact agenda. There is currently an international trend towards research evaluation with programmes such as the Excellence in Research for Australia (ERA), the Performance-Based Research fund in New Zealand (PBRF), and equivalents in countries including Denmark, Switzerland and the Netherlands. What is clear is that there is not enough qualitative, exploratory research into the effects of research evaluation on academic careers, especially for women, and so my PhD study was born. My findings suggest that research evaluation in the UK actively contributes to the continuance of gender inequality regimes in the academy, and that the ability to negotiate managerial control and be politically savvy is increasingly important in the academic world. Before embarking on my PhD, I was acutely aware of the sensitivity of my research, as well as my own positionality with regards to my participants.

The change to Old English from Old Norse was substantive, pervasive, and of a democratic character. Old Norse and Old English resembled each other closely like cousins and with some words in common, they roughly understood each other; in time the inflections melted away and the analytic pattern emerged. It is most “important to recognize that in many words the English and Scandinavian language differed chiefly in their inflectional elements. The body of the word was so nearly the same in the two languages that only the endings would put obstacles in the way of mutual understanding. In the mixed population which existed in the Danelaw these endings must have led to much confusion, tending gradually to become obscured and finally lost.” This blending of peoples and languages happily resulted in “simplifying English grammar.” What language influenced Old English as a result of the Viking invasions?

Horacio Agulla restored Bath's lead before the break and the boot of Wales fly-half Rhys Priestland kept Worcester at bay in the second half. Worcester claimed a losing bonus point courtesy of Tom Heathcote's kicking. Victory for Bath was their first in seven weeks and only their third in the Premiership this season. Priestland, handed a rare start ahead of England fly-half George Ford, drove Bath to victory by mixing his running and kicking game and notching 11 points for the hosts. After Devoto touched down on 10 minutes for Bath, Ryan Mills struck a long-range penalty to keep Worcester in reach. A clever run on the blindside of the scrum by Vuna saw him cross for the try which gave the visitors an 11-10 lead. Argentina international Agulla snuck over in the corner before running out of space to get Mike Ford's men back in front on the stroke of half-time. Priestland and Heathcote exchanged penalties after the break before the Welshman's third proved to be the final score with 12 minutes remaining. Bath coach Toby Booth said: \\"The challenge for us now is where we go from here. We have been a case of win one, lose one, win one. Consistency is key, and if you can put together three or four wins in a row, it makes the world of difference to everything.\\" Worcester director of rugby Dean Ryan said: \\"We will take the bonus point.

The requirement, attached to this year’s National Defense Authorization Act, was inspired by war veteran Kristofer Goldsmith, who says he was removed from service without a proper diagnosis. Goldsmith deployed to Iraq in 2005, focusing on intelligence reporting from the field. He participated in more than 300 combat missions, and his duties included photographing victims of torture found in a mass grave. He attempted suicide shortly before a scheduled second deployment, and the Army discharged him for “Misconduct: Serious Offense,” a status that made him ineligible for student aid through the Post 9-11 GI Bill. The Department of Veterans Affairs diagnosed Goldsmith with post-traumatic-stress disorder two months after his removal. The defense spending bill would require at least one mental-health expert to sit on military review boards that review discharges. The goal is to prevent the government from unfairly denying access to benefits that troops earn through military service, including VA medical care, disability checks and student aid. “This will benefit veterans from every generation — past, present and future,” Goldsmith said in a statement on Friday. Sens. Jon Tester (D-Mont.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), who represents Goldsmith’s home state, sponsored the discharge provision as a stand-alone bill and pressed to include it in the defense-spending bill. “We must ensure that the men and women of our military who risk their lives to protect our country receive the care they earned,” Gillibrand said in a statement on Friday. “Too many of our service members have been discharged as a result of an undiagnosed or improperly diagnosed mental health condition.” Goldsmith has applied twice to an Army review board to have his status upgraded to honorable discharge, but the panel has denied his appeals both times. At his last hearing, a physician with no background in mental health was called as an expert witness to review his mental health files. “Justice is finally within reach for the countless veterans who, like me, have been inappropriately discharged from the military due to improperly or undiagnosed service-related illnesses and injuries,” he said in his statement. After seven years of treatment from the VA, Goldsmith is recovering from post-traumatic-stress disorder and attending Nassau Community College under the school’s vocational rehabilitation program.

Context: Paul Reynolds crisscrossed his sketchbook with furious strokes, filling the pages with images of the vengeance he would take on his former coworkers at Fear and Loading Games. He'd founded the company three years back and, just a few hours ago, his partners and erstwhile friends had fired him without cause or warning. He concentrated hard as his pen brought to life demonic figures from one of the best-selling comics he'd created, scythe wielding cyber-men called Myrmidons who tore into surprised computer programmers with fangs and claws. Elsewhere on the page, computers assembled themselves into 21st century Golems, rising up against traitorous CEO's and producers to crush them to bloody pulp as they cowered beneath their desks. Sitting at the bar in Señor Goldstein's Mexican Restaurant in San Jose, California, Paul's own artwork engaged him for the first time in months, maybe years. Under other circumstances, that would have made him happy. But today's circumstances allowed only two emotions: despair and a burning desire for revenge. Not wanting to succumb to the former, and not quite wanting to find a gun and go back to the office, he instead drew. He had turned to a fresh page and begun to sketch his most elaborate revenge-scheme yet when a woman walked into his line of vision.

The United States, France and Britain fired 105 missiles at three Syrian chemical weapons facilities on Saturday, in response to an alleged Syrian chemical weapons attack in the city of Douma that killed at least 40 people and wounded or sickened hundreds of others. The Syrian government has repeatedly denied any use of banned weapons. The combined military strike on Syria comes as the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump and the government of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un are preparing for an expected summit in late May or early June to discuss dismantling the North’s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees. Trump’s willingness to use force against Syria can be seen to reinforce his “maximum pressure” campaign message, that in addition to imposing tough sanctions banning most North Korean exports, the U.S. would take military action, if necessary, to force Kim to terminate his nuclear program and end the continued development of a nuclear armed intercontinental ballistic missile that can reach the U.S. mainland. Calling the U.S. attack on Syria “a warning for Pyongyang,” the South Korean newspaper the Korea Joongang Daily, in an editorial on Monday said, “If Kim wants to be free from the fear of a potential raid, then he must be willing to denuclearize.” From this perspective the U.S. show of force in Syria will increase pressure on the leadership in North Korea to offer meaningful nuclear concessions at the Trump-Kim summit. “Unless it abandons at least part of its nuclear and missile capabilities then the Trump administration will not be satisfied,” said Bong Young-shik, a political analyst with the Yonsei University Institute for North Korean Studies in Seoul However the U.S. military strike on Syria could also reinforce concerns in North Korea that giving up its nuclear deterrent would make the...

There was Landon Donovan, calmly sweeping the ball into the net in the last, frantic minutes of the third and final group game against Algeria in 2010 in Pretoria, South Africa. As he ran to the corner flag to celebrate, he was mobbed by his delirious teammates; Donovan had delivered them into the knockout round. In the quarterfinals against Ghana a few days later, it was Donovan who stepped up to take a penalty kick, which he dispatched like the veteran he is, although the U.S would lose in extra time. But now you can call him Lan-done. Or Gone-ovan. Donovan, one of the anchors of the U.S. national soccer team for the last decade, was cut Thursday by coach Jurgen Klinsmann, who reduced his 30-man squad to the mandatory 23. For pro soccer players looking to book a spot at the World Cup, the last cut is the cruelest. Joining Donovan on the sidelines were two other 2010 teammates, Maurice Edu and Clarence Goodson. Brad Evans, Michael Parkhurst, Joe Corona and Terrence Boyd were also told they won’t be making the trip. Klinsmann called dumping Donovan “the toughest decision in my coaching career.” “I just see some other players slightly ahead of him,” Klinsmann said. Among those are Aron Johannsson, a 23-year-old, American-born, Iceland-raised forward who plays in Holland and has impressed Klinsmann with his ability to make an impact on a game. He also selected 31-year-old Chris Wondolowski of the MLS San Jose Earthquakes. A few minutes watching Wondo play and you’d think he might be a good addition to your weekend pub team; what he lacks in style he makes up for in his penchant for scoring goals, which is not a bad thing in a World Cup. On the other hand, Klinsmann also picked Jozy Altidore, who plays for Sunderland in England’s Premier League and who has been allergic to the goal this season. Still, Altidore is also 23, and his strength at holding and shielding the ball is valuable. And Klinsmann prefers guys who play in top leagues. That leaves Clint Dempsey, late of Fulham and now with the MLS Seattle Sounders, as his most experienced forward. The least experienced forward is Julian Green, an 18-year-old son of an American father and German mother who plays for Bayern Munich, Germany’s top club, although he spent most of the season on the B team. The squad also includes a number of German-born players—like Green they are sons of American servicemen—whose selection will provide some ruggedness to the squad as well as European experience. They include John Brooks, Timmy Chandler and Fabian Johnson, who play in Germany’s Bundesliga, as well as Jermaine Jones, who now plays for Besiktas in Turkey. Donovan’s omission from the roster, although shocking, isn’t altogether unexpected. When Klinsmann took over as U.S. coach two years ago, he warned the veteran players that their status was meaningless to him. He wanted players to compete for positions at every practice, and have no expectations of starting, which has sometimes been a point of contention within the team. They want to know where they stand. Donovan, burned out from playing constantly in the MLS, in the Premiership for Everton, and for the national team, decided to take a four month sabbatical last year. That never sat well with Klinsmann. In leaving Donovan behind, Klinsmann is giving up a ton of World Cup experience. It’s something that a team such Italy would hesitate to do—the Italians respect maturity in a player, particularly when it comes to high-pressure games. But given the Americans’ ridiculous first- round schedule—Ghana, Portugal, Germany—Klinsmann feels he needs more youth, and perhaps an X factor in players such as Johannsson. Donovan isn’t the first U.S. legend to be let go this way. Before the 1998 World Cup in France, coach Steve Sampson dropped John Harkes, a stalwart, hardnosed footballer he had previously named “Captain for Life” over what was then described as Harkes’ refusal to play as a holding midfielder and other “leadership” issues. The reason was more complicated than that, but Harkes’ exit left Sampson with a hole that his other players couldn’t fill. The U.S. lost three straight in the opening round, including a game against Germany—in which Jurgen Klinsmann, by the way, scored a stunning goal. Sampson lost his job shortly after the tournament. Klinsmann understands that if Donovan’s goalscoring isn’t replicated by one of the 23 he picked, he’s going to suffer the same fate. 2014 FIFA WORLD CUP – U.S. ROSTER BY POSITION | DETAILED ROSTER GOALKEEPERS (3): Brad Guzan (Aston Villa), Tim Howard (Everton), Nick Rimando (Real Salt Lake) DEFENDERS (8): DaMarcus Beasley (Puebla), Matt Besler (Sporting Kansas City), John Brooks (Hertha Berlin), Geoff Cameron (Stoke City), Timmy Chandler (Nürnberg), Omar Gonzalez (LA Galaxy), Fabian Johnson (Borussia Mönchengladbach), DeAndre Yedlin (Seattle Sounders FC) MIDFIELDERS (8): Kyle Beckerman (Real Salt Lake), Alejandro Bedoya (Nantes), Michael Bradley (Toronto FC), Brad Davis (Houston Dynamo), Mix Diskerud (Rosenborg), Julian Green (Bayern Munich), Jermaine Jones (Besiktas), Graham Zusi (Sporting Kansas City) FORWARDS (4): Jozy Altidore (Sunderland), Clint Dempsey (Seattle Sounders FC), Aron Johannsson (AZ Alkmaar), Chris Wondolowski (San Jose Earthquakes) Write a title for it.","response":"Landon Donovan Cut from U.S. National Soccer Team for 2014 World Cup"},{"question":"Add spaces between the words in the following text: InMay2013,PietàisplayedatDivadleHorniPocerniceinPrague,featuringtheactressVilmaCibulková.ThestagingwasalsorecordedandbroadcastbyCzechradio.","response":"In May 2013, Pietà is played at Divadle Horni Pocernice in Prague, featuring the actress Vilma Cibulková.

Barrie's 1904 play Peter Pan and Barrie's own novelization of it, Peter and Wendy. The music is mostly by Mark \\"Moose\\" Charlap, with additional music by Jule Styne, and most of the lyrics were written by Carolyn Leigh, with additional lyrics by Betty Comden and Adolph Green. The original 1954 Broadway production, starring Mary Martin as Peter and Cyril Ritchard as Captain Hook, earned Tony Awards for both stars. It was followed by NBC telecasts of it in 1955, 1956, and 1960 with the same stars, plus several rebroadcasts of the 1960 telecast. Several productions of Peter Pan were staged early in the 20th century, starting in London in 1904, starring Nina Boucicault as Peter and on Broadway in 1905, starring Maude Adams. In a nod to the original play, and the pantomime tradition it derives from, the title role of Peter Pan in the musical is usually played by a woman, including Mary Martin, Sandy Duncan and Cathy Rigby, among others. Producer Edwin Lester, founder and director of the Los Angeles Civic Light Opera, acquired the American rights to adapt Peter Pan as a play with music for Mary Martin. The show was not successful in its pre-Broadway West Coast tour, so director Jerome Robbins hired lyricists Comden and Green and composer Jule Styne to add more songs, including \\"Never Never Land,\\" \\"Distant Melody\\" and several other numbers, turning the show into a full-scale musical. The musical, instead of using Barrie's original ending, in which Peter simply let Wendy and the other children return home, includes an additional scene that Barrie had written later and titled An Afterthought (later included by Barrie in his 1911 novelization Peter and Wendy). In this ending, Peter returns after many years to take Wendy back to Never Never Land for spring cleaning. He finds that he has been away so long that Wendy is now an adult, married woman with a daughter. Despondent at first, he is delighted when Wendy's daughter Jane offers to be his new mother, and instead takes her with him. The musical premiered at the Curran Theatre in San Francisco on July 19, 1954. The initial four-week run was followed by an eight-week engagement in Los Angeles. The show opened on Broadway on October 20, 1954 at the Winter Garden Theatre for a planned limited run of 152 performances. The busy 1954 Broadway season also included The Boy Friend, Fanny, Silk Stockings and Damn Yankees. While still in tryouts, a deal was made for Peter Pan to be broadcast on the NBC anthology series Producers' Showcase on March 7, 1955, which ensured that it was a financial success despite the limited run. The revised score and Tony Award-winning performances by Martin and Cyril Ritchard made the musical a critical success, and tickets sold out throughout the Broadway run. The show closed on February 26, 1955 to prepare for the television broadcast. A Broadway cast album was made of the songs, and it is still in print today. The show was revived in 1979 on Broadway at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre, produced by Nancy and Ronnie Horowitz, starring Sandy Duncan and George Rose, and ran for 554 performances. Duncan was nominated for the Best Actress Tony, and the show was nominated for Best Revival of a Musical. A third Broadway production was mounted in 1990, originally at the Lunt-Fontanne, running for 45 performances. A return engagement opened 10 months later, this time at the Minskoff Theatre, running for an additional 48 performances. Both engagements starred former Olympic gymnast Cathy Rigby as Peter; the first co-starred Stephen Hanan and the second J. K. Simmons. The production was nominated for Best Revival of a Musical at the 1991 Tonys, and Rigby was nominated for Best Actress. Rigby returned to Broadway as Peter Pan in 1998 at the Marquis Theatre, with Paul Schoeffler co-starring. This production ran for 48 performances. A return engagement with the same stars opened in 1999 at the George Gershwin Theatre and ran for 166 performances. This engagement was nominated for the 1999 Tony for Best Revival of a Musical. It was then recorded at the La Mirada Theater for broadcast in October 2000 on the A&E Network. The video release cuts the program to about 96 minutes and was shot using eight cameras, produced by Line By Line Productions for McCoy/Rigby Entertainment, directed by Gary Halvorson and produced by Marc Bauman. Designers of the production were John Iacovelli (set), Shigeru Yaji (costumes) and Martin Aronstein (lights). Flying illusions are by ZFX Inc. Craig Barna is the musical director.

Jack Noseworthy is the only male actor to have played Peter Pan on Broadway; he was an understudy in the revue Jerome Robbins' Broadway. The Darling Nursery As Mr. and Mrs. Darling prepare for an evening out, two of their children, Wendy and John, play at being their parents. When Mrs. Darling notices Michael is left out, she gets him into the game and joins in with all of them (\\"1, 2, 3\\") watched by the dog Nana, their nursemaid. When Mr. Darling comes in to have his tie tied, he questions having a dog as a nursemaid, but Mrs. Darling defends her. The previous week, while the children slept, Nana saw a boy in the room who flew out of the window before she could catch him, leaving behind his shadow, which Mrs. Darling has put away in a drawer. In spite of this, Mr. Darling insists on Nana spending the night downstairs. Mrs. Darling and the children sing a lullaby (\\"Tender Shepherd\\"). The children fall asleep. A fairy, Tinker Bell, and Peter Pan fly in through the window to look for his shadow. Wendy is woken up by the boy's cries when he is unable to re-attach his shadow and helps him by sewing it back on. Peter is thrilled when his shadow is re-attached (\\"I've Gotta Crow\\") and tells her that he lives in Neverland (\\"Never Never Land\\") with the Lost Boys. Wendy wakes her brothers up, and Peter invites them all to Neverland, and promises to teach them to fly. Peter happily launches himself into the air (\\"I'm Flying\\"). Peter sprinkles the children with fairy dust and tells them to \\"think lovely thoughts\\" (\\"I'm Flying - Reprise\\").

Context: I’ve learnt a great amount throughout this studio, first and foremost I was taught: how the art world functions, how specific galleries such as Gertrude St Contemporary run and how artists earn a living. The studio also provided me with basic filmmaking skills such as how to: create a shooting schedule, write a shooting script, set up three-point lighting, conduct an interview, utilise visual storytelling and edit a short film. Throughout the shooting process with my artist I also developed my abilities regarding how to use a: Sony Zoom H2N (and other such handy recorders), a lapel mic, my own Canon EOS 60D and Adobe Premiere Pro editing software. Overall I think the studio functioned quite successfully, it was great to be in a studio with nineteen people who all were interested in the same topics as you. I felt that overall, the studios had a very happy and supportive environment, and you walked away knowing a great deal about the art world and how to make short documentaries. The project itself taught me a great deal about how to work with talent, as well as my group members. Having to work independently forced me to be completely all over every aspect of the shoot, whether that be choosing which questions to ask, deciding what to focus on, where I wanted the shoot to happen, deciding what gear to use, getting to the shoot, carrying all the gear, what I wanted to shoot, managing the audio, managing the lighting, managing the camera set-ups, managing the talent, editing the film, and finding a great soundtrack for it. I’m a pretty self-conscious person and I often doubt the decisions I make or ask someone else for their opinion (should I shoot this angle, or what do you think of this question etc.). Working independently pushed me to go with my gut instincts, to make decisions and to not seek others approval. It forced me to develop my aesthetic as a filmmaker and to own the work that I ended up producing, so ultimately I was really glad with how everything panned out.

Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","response":"Question 1: Where does Mac Outlook 2011 store its data files? Mac Outlook 2011 stores its data in a file format called Outlook for Mac Data Files (also known as OLM files). These files are designed to function specifically on the macOS operating system. The files are typically found within the user's home folder inside the Documents directory. More specifically, the path to the data file storage location is: /Users/[User_Name]/Documents/Microsoft User Data/Office 2011 Identities/Main Identity/ It is important to note that the file storage location may differ if a user has set up a custom location. Additionally, there may be multiple Identity folders if multiple user profiles have been set up in the Outlook application. Question 2: How do I open mac outlook email files? Mac Outlook email files, which use the OLM file format, can be opened using compatible email clients or specialized software tools. Here are a few methods to open Mac Outlook email files: 1. Using Outlook for Mac: If you have Outlook installed on your Mac, simply double-clicking the OLM file should open it with the Outlook application. However, it's important to ensure that the OLM file is associated with the appropriate version of the Outlook application. 2. Importing into Outlook for Mac: You can import OLM files into your current Outlook for Mac profile. To do this, follow these steps: a. Open Outlook for Mac. b. Click on \\"File\\" from the top menu bar and select \\"Import.\\" c. In the Import window, choose \\"Outlook Data File (.olm)\\" and click the \\"Continue\\" button. d.

Once the import process is complete, you will be able to access the contents of the imported .olm file within your Outlook for Mac profile. 3. Opening with specialized OLM viewers or converters: Several third-party applications can open, view, and even convert OLM files. Applications such as OLM File Viewer and OLM File Exporter can be used to access and examine the contents of .olm files without Outlook installed on your Mac. Many of these tools also allow users to convert .olm files to more common file formats such as .pst, .mbox, .msg, or .eml. Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing? No, questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. Question 1 asks about the storage location of Mac Outlook 2011 data files (OLM files), while question 2 seeks information on how to access or open those email files.

Here are a few you can consider: Free sites: PlentyofFish, OkCupid Tastebuds.fm (based on taste in music), PassionsNetwork, DateHookup, Mamba (Russian-based). Paid sites: Match.com, eHarmony, True.com, Lavalife, Lovestruck (UK, Hong Kong and Singapore), Zoosk, Meetic.

Atheists: FreeThinkerMatch This is probably the most important step in the whole process. Your profile is your first impression in the online dating world, and it can make or break whether potential partners are interested in you. Consider these areas: Your username. Consider basing it in your initials, favorite number, or favorite hobby. Avoid using words like \\"hot,\\" \\"sexy,\\" \\"daddy,\\" or any sexualized descriptor in your username — most women will read it as creepy. Choose a good profile picture. Your profile picture should follow three rules: it should be recent, provide a good look at your face, and make you seem approachable. If you don't currently have a photo that fits this description, take a new one! Bring along a camera next time you go to a social event, and ask a friend to take a quick snap of you. Avoid professional headshots. They're too stilted for an online dating site, and you'll look like you're trying too hard. Your bio. Most websites will provide a short bio or \\"about me\\" section for you to fill in. Don't write a novel, but do provide enough information that potential partners will feel like they're gaining a sense of who you are. You can discuss your hobbies, your goals, what you look for in a relationship, any children you have, or whatever else defines you as a person. Resist the urge to vent about your previous relationship. \\"Recently divorced from a lying, cheating harlot\\" reads as \\"bitter and angry\\" instead of \\"dateable and balanced.\\" Your interests. Some sites will have a separate area for you to list interests or hobbies. Sports, musical genres or groups, crafts, historical periods, movie genres, types of food, travel destinations, and books are all appropriate topics for this part of your profile. Who you're interested in meeting. Try not to be too restrictive on these parameters. You never know — your soulmate might only be a year or two older than the top age you specify. Keep your ranges broad, and remember that you're not obligated to date everyone who contacts you. If you're asked to describe in writing the type of girl you'd like to meet, this is the place to knock it out of the park. Don't say \\"I just want someone to talk to\\" — no girl wants to be \\"just someone to talk to\\" when another man will call her a princess or the light of his life. Talk up your future partner in the best terms you can muster. For instance, you might try something like \\"I'm looking for the woman of my dreams, who will share my passion for cooking, cycling and honesty, and who will allow me to treat her like the queen she is.\\" Your contact settings. Some sites allow you to pick and choose who can see your profile or contact you. If you want to get a lot of responses, make sure it's easy for people to message or email you. Summary:","response":"For a safer dating experience, consider using online dating sites rather than regular social networking platforms. There are numerous free and paid dating sites available, as well as sites catering to specific religions. When creating a profile, choose a non-sexualized username, a recent and approachable profile picture, and provide a balanced description of yourself in the bio section. Mention your interests, be open-minded on the age range and qualities of potential partners, and describe what type of person you'd like to meet. Finally, adjust your contact settings to be easily reachable by potential matches."},{"question":"Toshiba takes Hynix to task in patent clash Toshiba has accused Hynix of infringing its DRAM and Flash patents, and has begun legal proceedings against its South Korean rival in the US and Japanese courts.

This score typically determines details of rhythm, pitch, and, where two or more musicians (whether singers or instrumentalists) are involved, how the various parts are coordinated. The written quality of the music has enabled a high level of complexity within them: J.S. Bach's fugues, for instance, achieve a remarkable marriage of boldly distinctive melodic lines weaving in counterpoint yet creating a coherent harmonic logic that would be impossible in the heat of live improvisation. The use of written notation also preserves a record of the works and enables Classical musicians to perform music from many centuries ago. Musical notation enables 2000s-era performers to sing a choral work from the 1300s Renaissance era or a 1700s Baroque concerto with many of the features of the music (the melodies, lyrics, forms, and rhythms) being reproduced.

Greater evidence of such a people is found on Mallorca and Menorca than on Ibiza, but one of the Balearics' most important sites is actually on the island of Formentera, where the megalithic monument/tomb of Ca Na Costa has been dated to 2000 b.c. Ibiza's key location between Africa and ancient Iberia made it a convenient stopover for Mediterranean seafarers, such as the Phoenician traders, who called the island Ibosim. The Greeks dubbed it Ebysos, the Romans called it Ebusus, and the Moors, Yebisah. The Carthaginians: A detailed history of the island doesn't begin until it became a colony of Carthage in the 7th century b.c. . The Carthaginians originally came from the area comprising present-day Lebanon, and from their bases in North Africa and what's now Spain, they challenged the Roman Empire for domination of the Mediterranean region. Their interest in Ibiza lay partly in its vast salt flats, which to this day remain the source of a profitable industry. They capitalized on the natural resources by using the salt to cure fish, which they exported to their home country. The Carthaginians also carried out lead mining and continued to be of significance up until this century. It is believed that the lead pellets which were used by the Carthaginian general Hannibal were made on Ibiza. The Carthaginians also considered the island a holy place, and here in great splendour they buried thousands of their citizens in a huge necropolis on the Puig des Molins (Hill of the Windmills) below the Dalt Vila (Old Town) of Ibiza. Under the gnarled olive trees archaeologists have uncovered a treasure trove of statues, jewellery, pitchers, tools, and coins, which are now displayed in the town's two archaeological museums. The Romans never really infiltrated Ibiza, and even after the defeat of Hannibal in 202 b.c. during the Second Punic War their influence was restrained. Only with the fall of Carthage in 146 b.c. did they manage to make inroads, but, as local historians stress, Ibiza was neither conquered nor annexed by Rome, but confederated, retaining remarkable autonomy. For centuries to come the old Carthaginian traditions were allowed to continue on Ibiza alongside the new Roman way of life.

Article: If there's a child in your house who likes pixies , nature, or magic, Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure is sure to be a hit. This beautifully animated film is a first class production in every way, and features the familiar voices of Kristin Chenoweth, Anjelica Huston, Jane Horrocks, Lucy Liu, and Raven Symone. The movie offers up an adventure that's easy enough to follow, but complex enough to hold one's attention, and even throws in a nice little moral about friendship. What can I say? I'm pleasantly surprised. The up-and-coming Mae Whitman voices Tinker Bell herself, a far more dynamic character than we met in Peter Pan. Though Tinker still possesses her fiery temper, it doesn't manifest itself immediately, and takes a backseat to this pixie's many good qualities. As it turns out, Tinker Bell is extremely skilled at tinkering , so she is a natural choice to build a special scepter , for Pixie Hollow's Autumn Celebration. The scepter will hold the moonstone through which the light of the Blue Moon will pass, supplying Pixie Hollow with enough pixie dust for the year ahead. For days, Tinkers works hard on the perfect scepter design while her good friend Terrence does his best to assist. When Terrence accidentally breaks the Moon Stone, Tinker Bell \\"explodes\\" and sends him away. One of Tinker's more literal friends finds this extremely concerning, as she doesn't quite understand that the outburst was emotional rather than physical ----- very funny indeed. After hearing the legend of the lost treasure, Tinker Bell strikes out on her own to find a new Moon Stone. She faces many difficulties and meets new friends along the way, but when Terrence comes to the rescue at Tinker's darkest hour, she realizes the value of a truly loyal friend. Though the film is engaging and offers a positive message to young viewers, it's the animation that makes Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure stand out. Pixie Hollow is a charming, visually stunning world basked in lush color1s. It's...

The plan for was hatched by Jaan Anvelt and Karl Rimm. The latter was a veteran of the Russian Civil War. The plan envisaged the main attack aimed at Tallinn, with subsequent coups in Tartu, Narva, Pärnu, Viljandi, Rakvere, Kunda, and Kohila. The revolt was supposed to start at 5:15 a.m. The 279 communists, mostly infiltrated from the Soviet Union, were armed with 5 Thompson light machine guns, 55 rifles, 65 hand grenades, 8 explosive devices and 150 pistols. It was mistakenly expected that the workers and soldiers would join the insurgency and would seize power in the capital together. The plan called for the establishment of an Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic and of a \\"working people's government\\". Most of the schemes were spoiled by the Trial of the 149 in November 1924, which eliminated many potential communist organisers. The gunmen's first priority was to take over the Estonian National Defence College based in the Tondi suburb south of the city centre, the main narrow gauge railway station in Tallinn-Väike, and a battalion of engineering troops in Nõmme. Based on the above article, answer a question. How many less Thompson light machine guns did the communists have than explosice devices?","response":"According to the information provided, the communists were armed with 5 Thompson light machine guns and 8 explosive devices. To find out how many less Thompson light machine guns they had compared to explosive devices, we can subtract the number of Thompson light machine guns from the number of explosive devices: 8 (explosive devices) - 5 (Thompson light machine guns) = 3 So, the communists had 3 less Thompson light machine guns than explosive devices."},{"question":"Q:I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot. Could you help me answer this question? If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\". Plot title: Testament Movie plot: The Wetherly familyâhusband Tom (William Devane), wife Carol (Jane Alexander), and children Brad (Ross Harris), Mary Liz (Roxana Zal), and Scottie (Lukas Haas) -- live in the fictional suburb of Hamelin, California, within a 90-minute drive of San Francisco, where Tom works. On a routine afternoon, Carol (a stay-at-home mom and volunteer for school functions such as directing the school play) listens to an answering-machine message from Tom saying he's on his way home for dinner. Scottie watches Sesame Street on TV as Brad adjusts the TV antenna on the roof, when the show is suddenly replaced by white noise; suddenly, a San Francisco news anchor appears onscreen, saying they have lost their New York signal and there were explosions of \\"nuclear devices there in New York, and up and down the East Coast.\\" The anchorman is cut off by the Emergency Broadcast System tone with the Civil Defense Insignia being shown on the Screen, then an announcer's voice states that the White House is interrupting the program: \\"Please stand by for the President and do not use the telephone.\\" At the introduction of the President of the United States (who is never seen; only the Presidential Seal is shown on the TV), the phone rings but it goes dead along with the TV and electricity just as Carol answers it. Suddenly, the blinding flash of a nuclear detonation is then seen through the window. The family huddles on the floor in panic as the town's air-raid sirens go off; minutes later, several of their neighbors are running around on the street outside, dazed in fear and confusion. The family hopes Tom will return, but the circumstances are hard to ignore. The suburb of Hamelin survives relatively unscathed, because apparently the town is far enough from San Francisco to avoid blast damage. Frightened residents meet at the home of Henry Abhart (Leon Ames), an elderly ham radio operator. He has made contact with survivors in rural areas and internationally, and tells Carol that he was unable to reach anyone east of Keokuk, Iowa; a... My question: Who does the family hope will return?

Can I get it somewhere So I can save lot of electricity by motion of machines? Do those questions have the same meaning?","response":"The primary reason for the piezoelectric effect is mechanical stress. The piezoelectric effect is the ability of certain materials to generate an electric charge in response to applied mechanical stress. When subjected to mechanical stress, the internal arrangement of the material's atoms changes, causing the material to generate an electrical field. This means that the mechanical stress is the cause, and the electric field is the result. Piezoelectric materials are special types of materials that exhibit the property of piezoelectricity. These materials include some crystals, ceramics, and biological matter, like bones, proteins, and DNA. Examples of piezoelectric materials are quartz, lead zirconate titanate (PZT), and barium titanate. It is possible to use piezoelectric materials for energy harvesting and converting mechanical motion into electricity. There are various applications where this is done, like in energy-efficient roads, wearable electronics, and vibration-powered devices. However, the electricity generated from piezoelectric materials typically isn't enough to replace conventional power sources entirely. It is best used as a supplementary energy source or for low-power applications. As for the questions, they do not have the same meaning. The first question asks about the primary reason for the piezoelectric effect, while the second question asks about the availability and potential use of piezoelectric materials in saving electricity. These questions address different aspects of the piezoelectric effect and its applications."},{"question":"Write a short summary for this text: the police thursday night began random searches of backpacks and packages brought into the new york city subways as officials expressed alarm about the latest bomb blasts in the london transit system .","response":"On Thursday night, in response to the recent bomb blasts in London's transit system, the police initiated random searches of backpacks and packages carried by passengers entering New York City's subway system.
