Calcutta is not abroad A:","response":"Title: \\"The Uncharted Path of Devdas\\" Step 1: Establish the protagonist and his background The protagonist, Devdas, is a talented and ambitious young man from Calcutta. He comes from a traditional and wealthy Bengali family, who has high expectations for his future. Step 2: Introduce the setting and reason for studying abroad Devdas receives a scholarship to study at a prestigious university abroad, specifically in London. His major is International Relations, which he chose due to his desire to bridge the gap between India and the Western world. Step 3: Introduce secondary characters Upon beginning his journey, Devdas meets three significant characters: 1. Parvati (Paro) - Devdas's childhood love from Calcutta, who inspires him to succeed while staying grounded to his roots. 2. Chandramukhi - A fellow Indian student in London, who is struggling against the cultural constraints of her own upbringing and seeks solace in Devdas's friendship. 3. Robert - A British student who becomes Devdas's close friend and guide to the Western world, helping him navigate his newfound environment. Step 4: Incorporate conflict and character development As Devdas adapts to his new life abroad, he faces multiple challenges: 1. Balancing his traditional values with the freedom and independence of Western society. 2. Struggling to maintain his long-distance relationship with Paro while also being drawn to Chandramukhi. 3. Encountering racism and discrimination, as he tries to prove himself in a foreign land. Through these experiences, Devdas begins to question his own identity and purpose in life, leading to a transformative change in his character. Step 5: Climax and resolution The climax of the movie occurs when Devdas, struggling to find a balance between his roots and his life abroad, receives tragic news of Paro's impending marriage to another man in Calcutta. Devdas is devastated and makes an impulsive decision to return to India. Paro urges Devdas to follow his dreams and return to London. Step 6: Conclusion Understanding the sacrifices Paro has made for him, Devdas returns to London, determined to complete his education and make a difference in the world. He completes his degree and goes on to become a prominent diplomat, working to bridge the gap between India and Western countries. He carries the lessons of his past with him, never forgetting the people who shaped his journey, particularly Paro. The film ends with Devdas visiting Paro in India one last time, and they part ways as friends, with their love and respect for each other intact. Thus, the movie's central theme ultimately revolves around self-discovery, sacrifice, and the challenge of balancing one's cultural identity in a globalized world."},{"question":"2 months ago 06:10 xhamster double penetration, double anal, anal Can you repeat this sentence, but capitalize it correctly?","response":"2 Months Ago 06:10 XHamster Double Penetration, Double Anal, Anal"},{"question":"Given the question: \\"Percy (film)\\", given a list of categories: company, educational institution, artist, athlete, office holder, mean of transportation, building, natural place, village, animal, plant, album, film or written work, what category does the title belong to?

Papaya is a tropical fruit that grows on the Carica papaya plant. It is native to Central and South America and is now widely cultivated in many tropical and subtropical countries. Papaya fruits come in different shapes, sizes, and colors, but they are not oranges. When ripe, papaya skin is usually yellow or orange-yellow, while unripe papaya is usually green. The inside flesh of a ripe papaya is typically yellow, orange, or pinkish, depending on the variety. It has numerous black seeds in the fruit's central cavity. The term \\"brown oranges\\" appears to be a misidentification or a mix-up of two different fruits. Oranges are a separate fruit, belonging to the Citrus genus.

Title: Alexander Nevsky Movie plot: The Teutonic Knights invade and conquer the city of Pskov with the help of the traitor Tverdilo and massacre its population. In the face of resistance by the boyars and merchants of Novgorod (urged on by the monk Ananias), Nevsky rallies the common people of Novgorod and in a decisive Battle of the Ice, on the surface of the frozen Lake Peipus or Chudskoe, they defeat the Teutonic knights. The story ends in the retaken Pskov where the ordinary foot-soldiers are set free, the surviving Teutonic knights will be held for ransom and Tverdilo is swarmed over by the vengeful people (and supposedly torn to pieces). A subplot throughout the film concerns Vasili Buslai and Gavrilo Oleksich, two famous warriors from Novgorod and friends, who become commanders of the Novgorod forces and who engage in a contest of courage and fighting skill throughout the Battle on the Ice in order to decide which of them will win the hand of Olga Danilovna, a Novgorod maiden whom both of them are courting. Vasilisa, the daughter of a boyar of Pskov killed by the Germans, joins the Novgorod forces as a front-line soldier, and she and Buslai fight side by side (which makes a strong impression on Buslai); she also personally slays the traitor Ananias. After both Gavrilo and Buslai have been seriously wounded, Buslai publicly states that neither he nor Gavrilo was the bravest in battle: that honor goes to Vasilisa, and that after her came Gavrilo.

Zappa's relationship with long-time manager Herb Cohen ended in 1976. Zappa sued Cohen for skimming more than he was allocated from DiscReet Records, as well as for signing acts of which Zappa did not approve. Cohen filed a lawsuit against Zappa in return, which froze the money Zappa and Cohen had gained from an out-of-court settlement with MGM over the rights of the early Mothers of Invention recordings. It also prevented Zappa having access to any of his previously recorded material during the trials. Zappa therefore took his personal master copies of the rock-oriented Zoot Allures (1976) directly to Warner Bros., thereby bypassing DiscReet.In the mid-1970s Zappa prepared material for Läther (pronounced \\"leather\\"), a four-LP project. Läther encapsulated all the aspects of Zappa's musical styles—rock tunes, orchestral works, complex instrumentals, and Zappa's own trademark distortion-drenched guitar solos. Wary of a quadruple-LP, Warner Bros. Records refused to release it. Zappa managed to get an agreement with Phonogram Inc., and test pressings were made targeted at a Halloween 1977 release, but Warner Bros. prevented the release by claiming rights over the material. Zappa responded by appearing on the Pasadena, California radio station KROQ, allowing them to broadcast Läther and encouraging listeners to make their own tape recordings. A lawsuit between Zappa and Warner Bros. followed, during which no Zappa material was released for more than a year. Eventually, Warner Bros. issued different versions of much of the Läther material in 1978 and 1979 as four individual albums (five full-length LPs) with limited promotion.Although Zappa eventually gained the rights to all his material created under the MGM and Warner Bros. contracts, the various lawsuits meant that for a period Zappa's only income came from touring, which he therefore did extensively in 1975–77 with relatively small, mainly rock-oriented, bands.

Indoors, pollutants such as radon or asbestos can also increase your cancer risk. Lastly, air pollution can lead to heart disease, including heart attack and stroke. Now, I have a new situation: Michael recently moved to Xin Jiang, where there is a large amount of air pollutants due to the chemical manufacturing industry there.

Taking the time to assess patient satisfaction means improving the communication between physicians and the patients they treat. Surveys and similar assessment practices can make patients feel more listened to and cared for. This makes it easier for patients to trust their physicians and open up to medical staff about health issues. Patient satisfaction surveys also give medical practices an understanding of what they need to do to improve overall. This includes things like physical surroundings, timeliness of staff, duration of time taken to receive test results, waiting time, hand hygiene, friendliness of staff, etc. Conducting a patient satisfaction survey can be a good thing, but you need to make sure that everyone involved is interested in actively improving. Everyone involved with your medical practice must be brought on board. This includes those actively involved with patients (physicians, nurses, nursing assistants, other office staff) as well as those who run things behind the scenes. Quality work must be at the center of your practice's mission and vision. Keep in mind that patients have lots of choices when it comes to healthcare, so make sure that all of your staff members understand the importance of maintaining and enhancing patient satisfaction. Determine how much you can afford to spend on this project before you embark on it. The rest of your decisions concerning the project will need to be based on that figure. Customer satisfaction surveys that are operated completely in-house are much more affordable in monetary terms, but they will require a greater time investment. Most large healthcare corporations hire large healthcare satisfaction companies to asses patient satisfaction. This allows for objective studies without any bias associated with the results. Conducting a survey through an outside vendor will save time, but it will cost you more money. Expect to pay at least 300 to 400 per physician if your practice has at least three physicians associated with it. You also need to consider the cost of analysis. If you are confident that someone in the practice has the time and skill to analyze the results quantitatively and accurately, you can save money by doing this in-house. If this isn't the case, though, you will need to outsource the analysis of results to a firm that specializes in the analysis of healthcare related data. Written surveys are the most popular and, under most circumstances, the most accurate. Other options used can include phone surveys, focus groups, and personal interviews. The areas you assess will be the same regardless of the tool you decide on, even though the exact questions you might ask could vary between formats. The right choice mostly depends on cost and practicality for your specific circumstances. Make sure that all of your staff and professional colleagues know what to expect from the survey. Explain your reasons for embarking on a patient satisfaction assessment. These may include improvement in performance, timeliness, physical aesthetics, reception staff impression. etc. Point out that patients deserve to have a say in provider performance. Also, mention that patients may comment on any aspect of care, from check-in to following up with test results. Also point out that it is important to be consistent with quality care and to ensure that everyone is following protocols, policies, and national guidelines. Also explain how the results will be evaluated and acted upon. This step will need to be done continually throughout the entire process. In other words, everyone involved should be kept updated from start to finish. What is a summary?","response":"A summary of the article is that patient satisfaction is an essential aspect of healthcare, and it goes beyond accurate diagnoses and medical knowledge. Implementing patient satisfaction surveys helps improve communication and trust between patients and healthcare providers. To conduct such surveys, it's crucial to involve the entire medical practice team and ensure everyone's commitment to improvement. Costs associated with conducting these surveys and analyzing the results need to be considered and should influence the chosen methods, such as written surveys, phone surveys, focus groups, or personal interviews. Keeping the staff informed about the survey's objectives and goals, as well as consistently updating them about the process, can lead to better outcomes and overall improvements in patient care and satisfaction."},{"question":"Paragraph: The Glory of Melaka: In the early days, if you were not a pirate or a mosquito, Melaka was not much of a place to live. The land was infertile, just a swampy plain, the river small and sluggish. But it had a sheltered harbor, protected from the monsoons by neighboring Sumatra. Later, the strategic location and deep-water channel close to the coast brought in the bigger vessels of the trade-wind traffic crossing the Indian Ocean. The first to realize the larger commercial potential, as so often throughout the country's subsequent history, were the Chinese. In 1409, under a new directive from Emperor Chu Ti to pursue trade in the South Seas and the Indian Ocean, a Chinese fleet of 50 ships headed by Admiral Cheng Ho called in at Melaka. They made Parameswara an offer he could not refuse: port facilities and an annual financial tribute in exchange for Chinese protection against the marauding Thais. In 1411, Parameswara took the money to Beijing himself, and the emperor gratefully made him a vassal king. Twenty years later, the Chinese withdrew again from the South Seas trade. The new ruler of Melaka, Sri Maharajah, switched his allegiance to the Muslim trading fraternity by marrying into the Muslim faith, wedding the daughter of a sultan in Sumatra. Islam won its place in Malaya not by conquest — as had been the case in North Africa and Europe — but by trade, dynastic alliances, and peaceful preaching. Bengali peddlers had already brought the faith to the east coast. In Melaka and throughout the peninsula, Islam thrived as a strong, male-dominated religion of individuality, offering dynamic leadership and preaching brotherhood and self-reliance — all qualities ideally suited to the coastal trade. At the same time, Sufi mystics synthesized Islamic teaching with local Malay traditions of animistic magic and charisma, though Islam did not become the state religion until Muzaffar Shah became sultan of Melaka (1446–1459). But the key figure in the sultanate was Tun Perak, bendahara (prime minister) and military commander. He expanded Melaka's power along the west coast and down to Singapore and the neighboring Bintan islands. He also had orang laut pirates patrolling the seas to extort tribute from passing ships. After Ailied district chiefs had repelled assaults from Thai-controlled armies from Pahang, Tun Perak personally led a famous victory over a Thai fleet off Batu Pahat in 1456. Question: \\"Who was the first emperor to notice the commercial potential to Melaka?\\" Answer: \\"Emperor Chu Ti\\" Based on the paragraph, is this answer correct","response":"Yes, the answer \\"Emperor Chu Ti\\" is correct. According to the paragraph, in 1409, under a new directive from Emperor Chu Ti to pursue trade in the South Seas and the Indian Ocean, a Chinese fleet of 50 ships headed by Admiral Cheng Ho called in at Melaka. This shows that Emperor Chu Ti was the first emperor to notice the commercial potential of Melaka."},{"question":"Coming off their win over the Texans, the Eagles flew to Cowboys Stadium for a Week 14 NFC East duel with the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday night.

Many place-names in eastern and northern England are of Scandinavian origin. Norse borrowings are relatively rare in Old English literature, being mostly terms relating to government and administration. The literary standard, however, was based on the West Saxon dialect, away from the main area of Scandinavian influence; the impact of Norse may have been greater in the eastern and northern dialects. Certainly in Middle English texts, which are more often based on eastern dialects, a strong Norse influence becomes apparent. Modern English contains a great many, often everyday, words that were borrowed from Old Norse, and the grammatical simplification that occurred after the Old English period is also often attributed to Norse influence.

Usage: Before classifying the review, we should understand the nature of Yelp reviews. Yelp is a platform where customers write about their experiences at a specific business. In the sample, the review is about a customer's experience at a French bistro. Understanding the context is important so we can extract meaningful information from the review. Part #2: Identifying key phrases indicating sentiments. Usage: Sentiments, either positive or negative, are often expressed through certain phrases. For example, in the given review \\"Great service at this nice little\\", \\"wonderful dinner\\", \\"really was the WOW factor\\", and the \\"Solid 4 stars\\" reflect positive comments. However, phrases like \\"I give it less than 5 stars\\", \\"flavors weren't balanced properly\\", and \\"very few options\\" indicate some negative sentiments as well. Part #3: Balancing positive and negative sentiments. Usage: Sometimes, a review might contain both positive and negative elements just like the given sample. In such cases, the overall sentiment has to be determined by weighing these elements. In the sample, although there are some criticisms, the reviewer mentions more positive sentiments, indicating an overall positive experience. Part #4: Assigning the label. Usage: Based on the analysis, a label, either \\"POSITIVE\\" or \\"NEGATIVE\\", is assigned to the review. In the example, despite minor criticisms, the overall impression of the review is positive (the reviewer gives four out of five stars and writes positively about several dishes and the restaurant in general). Therefore, the review would be labelled as \\"POSITIVE\\"."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: What makes a house a home?

Two early goals from the 35-year-old striker saw him reach a total of 211 goals for Roma, which means he has scored more goals for one club than any other player in Serie A history. His tally sees him surpass the previous record of 210 set by the prolific Swedish striker Gunnar Nordahl who played for AC Milan in the 1950s. \\"It's what I've always wanted, to wear this shirt and beat one record after another,\\" said Totti, AFP reported. \\"I've overtaken Nordahl and I'm proud of that.

Chain-of-thought: 1. Identify the three main groups of Indigenous peoples in Canada: First Nations, Inuit, and Métis. 2. Research First Nations membership rules: First Nations communities typically determine their membership based on either the Indian Act or their own membership code. 3. The Indian Act is a federal statute that affects the lives of First Nations people in various ways, including governing how bands can determine their membership. Some First Nations have taken control of their membership and established their own rules under what is known as a 'membership code' or 'citizenship code.' 4. Research Inuit membership rules: Inuit are not governed by the Indian Act but instead have unique regional organizations and land claims agreements. Like the First Nations, the Inuit also have their membership guidelines, such as the Nunavut Agreement, which set out enrolment procedures and criteria based on Inuit ancestry and other factors. 5. Research Métis membership rules: Métis are not governed by the Indian Act, and membership is determined by their distinct communities and organizations, such as the Métis National Council. Métis organizations typically have their membership criteria based on self-identification, ancestry, and community acceptance. In conclusion, it is not accurate to say that the Indigenous peoples in Canada do not have their own membership rules.

According to my research, the Louisville Mega Cavern is a former limestone mine that spans approximately 100 acres beneath the city of Louisville, Kentucky. It was mined for limestone from the early 1930s until the 1970s. The caverns were then used for various purposes, such as storage, recycling facilities, and business parks.

The Brooks family, which had amassed a fortune in the shipping insurance business and had been investing in Chicago real estate since 1863, had retained Chicago property manager Owen F. Aldis to manage the construction of the seven-story Grannis Block on Dearborn Street in 1880. It was Aldis, one of two men Louis Sullivan credited with being \\"responsible for the modern office building\\", who convinced investors such as the Brooks brothers to build new skyscrapers in Chicago. By the end of the century, Aldis would create over 1,000,000 square feet (93,000 m2) of new office space and manage nearly one fifth of the office space in the Loop.Daniel Burnham and John Wellborn Root met as young draftsmen in the Chicago firm of Carter, Drake, and Wight in 1872 and left to form Burnham & Root the following year. At Aldis's urging, the Brooks brothers had retained the then-fledgling firm to design the Grannis Block, which was their first major commission. Burnham and Root would become the architects of choice for the Brooks family, for whom they would complete the first high-rise building in Chicago, the 10-story Montauk Building, in 1883, and the 11-story Rookery Building in 1888. The Great Chicago Fire of 1871 had destroyed a 4-mile (6.4 km) by 0.5-mile (0.80 km) swath of the city between the Chicago River and Lake Michigan, and subsequent commercial development expanded into the area far south of the main business district along the river that would come to be known as \\"the Loop\\". Between 1881 and 1885, Aldis bought a series of lots in the area on Peter Brooks' behalf, including a 70-by-200-foot (21 by 61 m) site on the corner of Jackson and Dearborn streets.

Former President Barack Obama and Republican powerhouse Mitt Romney find themselves in an unprecedented role reversal, forcing a reevaluation of their respective political strategies and public personas. In this article, we will examine the contributing factors surrounding this unique phenomenon and how it may ultimately impact the outcome of the election. Historical Context: In 2012, the American people witnessed a heated election race between incumbent President Obama, seeking reelection for a second term, and Romney, former governor of Massachusetts and Republican nominee. The two candidates stood in stark contrast to each other, with Obama emphasizing social issues, such as healthcare and income inequality, while Romney championed a platform of conservative economic policies. However, the tables have turned in recent years, with the two men trading their typical political personas and finding unexpected common ground across party lines. The Catalyst for Change: The Trump Administration Upon reflection, it is clear that the most significant contributing factor to this role reversal lies in the election and subsequent presidency of Donald Trump. As the 45th President of the United States, Trump has been a polarizing and divisive figure, both domestically and abroad, largely due to his unique leadership style and penchant for social media. In response to the perceived chaos of the Trump administration, Romney has emerged as an advocate for traditional Republican values, such as rule of law, democratic norms, and constitutional order, deviating from his prior championing of economic conservatism. Meanwhile, Obama has transitioned into the role of elder statesman, opting for caution and experience when discussing potential solutions for the myriad challenges facing the nation. Impact on the Election But how exactly will this role reversal affect the outcome of the upcoming election? Undoubtedly, these shifts have prompted a reassessment of strategies by both political parties. For the Republicans, with Romney at the helm of the party's more traditional guard, they find themselves grappling with a need to distance themselves from the controversial Trump presidency, while simultaneously not alienating Trump's passionate base. This delicate balancing act could have a significant impact on voter turnout and party unity, as the Republicans seek to reestablish their foundational principles and values amid turbulent times. On the other hand, the Democrats may find strength in Obama's newfound role as a calm and unifying figurehead. With the nation struggling to overcome the challenges of a global pandemic, economic downturn, and social unrest, Obama's emphasis on unity, experience, and stability could resonate with voters seeking reassurances from their political leaders. However, Democrats also face the challenge of appeasing the more progressive wings of the party, who may view Obama's cautiousness as a hindrance to pushing forward bold, transformative policies. Conclusion In a world marked by uncertainty, the role reversal of Obama and Romney proves that politics is anything but predictable. As the election draws nearer, both Democrats and Republicans will need to mobilize voters and present a clear vision for the future in order to garner the support needed to secure the presidency. This unexpected role reversal has placed both Romney and Obama at the forefront of a shifting political narrative, as they struggle to navigate and adapt to the ever-evolving circumstances. The implications of this change are numerous, and one can only wonder how the eventual outcome of the election will reflect these historical revisions and realignments. Ultimately, the presidential election will likely be determined by the party that best communicates its ideals and aspirations, while effectively navigating this uncharted political territory. As the clock ticks down, all eyes will remain on these influential figures as they continue to redefine their roles and, quite possibly, the future of American politics."},{"question":"Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? kung pow is oedekerk 's realization of his childhood dream to be in a martial-arts flick , and proves that sometimes the dreams of youth should remain just that .","response":"To determine whether the given phrase is positive or negative, let's analyze it step by step: 1. \\"kung pow is oedekerk's realization of his childhood dream to be in a martial-arts flick\\" - This part of the sentence seems neutral, as it states that Kung Pow is the fulfillment of Oedekerk's dream to be in a martial arts film. 2. \\"sometimes the dreams of youth should remain just that\\" - This part of the sentence implies that not all childhood dreams should come true, suggesting that maybe the creation of Kung Pow wasn't such a good idea.

(A) Ocean - The Euphrates is a river that flows into the ocean, and oceans are much larger than rivers. So, the Euphrates is not larger than an ocean. (B) Planet - The Euphrates is a geographical feature of the Earth. The Earth is a planet, and it is significantly larger than any river, including the Euphrates. (C) Trees - Comparing a river to trees in terms of size is not appropriate as they are entirely different entities. Rivers and trees have different characteristics and cannot be directly compared. (D) Sea - Seas are larger bodies of water typically connected with oceans. The Euphrates flows into the sea, so it is not larger than a sea. (E) Inches - Inches is a unit of measurement for length, not a comparative object or entity. Comparing the Euphrates to inches doesn't make sense in the context of the question. (F) Sediment - Sediment refers to fragments of rocks, minerals, and organic materials that accumulate in water bodies such as rivers. Since sediment is a part of the river itself, comparing the Euphrates to sediment is not a direct comparison. (G) Stream - A stream is a smaller watercourse that usually flows into larger rivers. The Euphrates, being a large river, is expected to be larger than a stream, which makes sense in terms of comparison. (H) Length - Length is another unit of measurement like inches. It doesn't make sense to compare the Euphrates to length in this context. Of all the options provided, only option (G) - stream allows for a direct comparison to the Euphrates river.

If ever noticed or bothered, he never let on. It was difficult to walk together--and because of that, we didn't say much as we went along. But as we started out, he always said, \\"You set the pace.

Answer choices: - increase - evaporation - diminish - absorb - decrease - It expands - electrically - heat A:","response":"The action of using a bellows to fan a fire would \\"increase\\" the amount of oxygen near the fire. Bellows work by forcing air, rich in oxygen, towards the fire. This increase in available oxygen helps the fire to burn hotter and brighter. Oxygen serves as a fuel source for the fire, so providing more of it aids in combustion. Therefore, the correct answer to your question is 'increase'. The other response options don't accurately depict the action of bellows on oxygen around a fire: - Evaporation and absorb aren't relevant terms in this context since we are discussing transferring oxygen, not moisture or substances. - Diminish and decrease would suggest the reduction of oxygen, which is the opposite of what a bellows does. - \\"It expands\\" could be partially true since forcing air can cause it to disperse, but it doesn't directly speak about the impact on oxygen. - Electrically and heat aren't correct in the context of how a bellows influences the oxygen near a fire.

Their popular albums included Wishbone Ash (1970), Pilgrimage (1971), Argus (1972), There's the Rub (1974), and New England (1976). Wishbone Ash are noted for their extensive use of the harmony twin lead guitar format which had been attracting electric blues bands since Jeff Beck and Jimmy Page had played together in the Yardbirds in 1966. Their contributions helped Andy Powell and Ted Turner to be voted \\"Two of the Ten Most Important Guitarists in Rock History\\" (Traffic magazine 1989), and to appear in the \\"Top 20 Guitarists of All Time\\" (Rolling Stone). Turner was replaced by bassist and vocalist John Wetton, formerly of Family, King Crimson, Roxy Music, Uriah Heep and UK. Number the Brave was released in April 1981 and featured Wetton's lead vocals on just one song, although during album sessions he had offered songs such as \\"Here Comes the Feeling\\" that would eventually sell millions when released on Asia's 1982 debut album. Wetton did not continue with Wishbone Ash beyond the album sessions and rejoined Asia. Wetton was replaced on the Number the Brave tour by the former Uriah Heep bassist Trevor Bolder. Also joining the band was female backing vocalist, Claire Hamill, who had sung on both the Just Testing and Number the Brave albums. In 1982, after Hamill's departure, the band experimented with heavy metal on the Twin Barrels Burning album. It became the highest charting Wishbone Ash album in years (UK #22). Bolder left the group to rejoin Uriah Heep in 1983, to be replaced by bassist/vocalist Mervyn Spence (ex-Trapeze). The group continued with a heavy metal side on 1985's Raw to the Bone, which became the first Wishbone Ash album not to make the charts. Not long after, Wisefield left after serving as guitarist in the band for eleven years, going on to a varied career that would include work with Tina Turner, Joe Cocker, Roger Chapman, Jeff Wayne and the Queen musical We Will Rock You. He was replaced by Jamie Crompton, who in turn was succeeded briefly by Phil Palmer. Early in 1986, Mervyn Spence quit as well, to be replaced by ex-Kinks bassist Andy Pyle.

In the post-battle assessment, Gen. Omar Bradley (Karl Malden) decides what's needed is the best tank commander they've got. Patton answers the call and arrives amid wailing sirens and a cloud of dust. He's also early and catches most of the soldiers off guard, a mistake they quickly learn not to make again. Believing the casual attitude displayed by the troops to be the primary source of their defeat, he quickly begins to set things to rights. Patton's belief in himself is unshakable, and there's only one way to get things done-his way. Quickly establishing discipline and routine, he commands his men with an iron fist. He also has great respect for the Germans he's up against, and has studied the tactics of Rommel in the field.In Berlin, the Germans are also assessing Patton. His reputation is considerable, and they study his idiosyncracies looking for a clue to the man's character.

On both occasions, Galileo seems to have mistaken Neptune for a fixed star when it appeared close—in conjunction—to Jupiter in the night sky; hence, he is not credited with Neptune's discovery. At his first observation in December 1612, Neptune was almost stationary in the sky because it had just turned retrograde that day. This apparent backward motion is created when Earth's orbit takes it past an outer planet. Because Neptune was only beginning its yearly retrograde cycle, the motion of the planet was far too slight to be detected with Galileo's small telescope. In July 2009, University of Melbourne physicist David Jamieson announced new evidence suggesting that Galileo was at least aware that the 'star' he had observed had moved relative to the fixed stars.\\".

Which group's cans had the air molecules inside move faster? A team of hikers split into two groups. Group Jones hiked north and camped there overnight. Group George went east. Both groups made campfires and heated cans of soups. Group Jones didn't make holes in the cans, so the cans exploded. The others heated their soup cans the right way, by venting them first. Hint: It would be very unadvisable to place a can of soup over a campfire without venting the can. As the can heats up, it may explode. The kinetic-molecular theory explains why. The air inside the rigid can of soup is given more kinetic energy by the heat coming from the campfire. The kinetic energy causes the air molecules to move faster and they impact the container walls more frequently and with more force. The increase in pressure inside may eventually exceed the strength of the can and it will explode. An additional factor is that the soup may begin boiling which will then aid even more gas and more pressure to the inside of the can. The answer to this question is:","response":"Group Jones' cans had the air molecules inside move faster. This is because they did not vent their cans before heating them, causing the air molecules to gain more kinetic energy from the heat, and consequently move faster. This increased pressure inside the cans eventually led to the cans exploding."},{"question":"Q: You are given a sentence in Spanish. Your job is to translate the Spanish sentence into Italian.

Upon calling the comment line Sunday morning at (202) 456-1111, a woman's voice reads the following message: “Thank you for calling the White House. Unfortunately, we cannot answer your call today because congressional Democrats are holding government funding, including funding for our troops and other national security priorities, hostage to an unrelated immigration debate,\\" she says.

The government shutdown stretched into its second day on Sunday, with no clear indication that an agreement to reopen it is imminent. Meanwhile, Republicans and Democrats have steadfastly blamed the other side for causing the shutdown. Democrats have opposed any funding measure that doesn't include assurances for addressing the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. Republicans have argued that by doing so, Democrats are holding government funding hostage.

But Washington's painful shutdown will nonetheless drag into Day Three. Shortly after 9 p.m. Sunday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced that the chamber would vote on a plan at noon Monday to fund the government through Feb. 8. In an attempted concession to Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, McConnell said he would take up legislation to protect some young immigrants from deportation if a deal to address their status is not reached by the time funding expires in early February. Story Continued Below But Democrats were not ready to call it a deal, even as McConnell implored the Senate to vote Sunday night to reopen the government. \\"The shutdown should stop today,\\" he said. Schumer said further negotiations were needed and spurned McConnell's request, pushing a vote until Monday, when hundreds of thousands of federal employees will be furloughed. \\"Talks will continue, but we have yet to reach an agreement on a path forward that would be acceptable for both sides,\\" Schumer said. The vote Monday is expected to fail absent further progress between the two party leaders before then. Senate Republicans will have a conference meeting at 11 a.m. Monday to discuss the state of play, aides said. The late-night exchange capped a furious round of negotiations Sunday between Schumer and McConnell, as well as a group of deal-making senators desperate to reopen the shuttered government. Senators from both parties took a proposal to the party leaders after the centrists met for 90 minutes on Sunday afternoon. Their proposal would reopen the government through Feb. 8 and have McConnell commit on the Senate floor to holding an immigration vote before that date — a commitment that McConnell approached but did not definitively agree to, in part because Republicans worry they could not complete an immigration debate before the next funding deadline. Keeping the shutdown going given McConnell’s stated goal of an immigration vote would be “counterproductive,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) as the Senate adjourned for the night. As for Democrats’ push for a more firm immigration commitment from the GOP leader, Graham suggested McConnell’s Sunday night statement would have to suffice: “I assume if we get a deal, it will be more formal.” Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), who along with Graham is meeting with roughly 20 senators in both parties, said he hoped the group would meet again. After not speaking on Saturday, McConnell and Schumer met privately for more than 30 minutes on Sunday. Schumer, however, did not talk to the president, an aide said.

Flake said the Senate needs to move independently of the White House at this point to resolve the confrontation that's produced the first shutdown in more than four years. “The important thing is breaking with the White House on this and not relying on the White House to give its approval,\\" Flake said. Despite his public thaw after two days of lashing Democrats, it remains to be seen whether McConnell can provide enough reassurance to Democrats to win their votes. Some Democrats said they need to know the House would take action on an immigration bill, too. “We have to have in our own mind some way to ensure that the House feels a need to bring up the issue as well,” said Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.). The centrists are eager to end the brinkmanship that has erupted at the one-year mark of Donald Trump’s presidency. Democrats insist that any funding legislation extend Obama-era protections for undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children, while Republicans have said they won’t negotiate on immigration until the government reopens. The group of roughly 20 moderates includes Sens. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), Chris Coons (D-Del.), Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), Susan Collins (R-Maine), Flake, Graham, Mark Warner (D-Va.), Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), Tim Kaine (D-Va.) and Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.). Some liberals are still wary. They fear that Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) could repeat the exercise of 2013, when the Senate passed an immigration bill and the House didn't take it up. “It depends on whether it’s part of a must-pass bill. That is my strong preference. The goal is to have the [DREAM] Act passed,” said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) in an interview. “I have no confidence, zero, in Paul Ryan bringing that bill to the floor.\\" Republican leaders are also skeptical. They believe committing to an immigration vote would just throw Democrats a lifeline and prefer to negotiate on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program only after the government reopens. “Does that mean if we have an agreement by [Feb.] 15 that that’s not good enough?” Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) said of the plan to hold an immigration vote by Feb. 8. “I just think people are nervous because they shut down the government and are looking for face-saving.” Still, McConnell listened to the presentation by a group of GOP senators to allow such a vote by Feb. 8. He thanked those Republicans on the floor Sunday evening. So far, House Republican leaders have rejected the idea of committing to holding an immigration vote on the House floor and are refusing to negotiate on anything beyond a three-week continuing resolution. Ryan said Sunday the House will accept a short-term bill through Feb. 8 but will commit only to an immigration bill “that the president supports to fix this problem.” poster=\\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201801/526/1155968404_5716672082001_5716668620001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\\" true Lawmakers had hoped to reach a deal before Monday, when federal employees would normally return to work, to lessen the impact of the shutdown. Though negotiations in the Senate gained some traction, both parties continued to execute their public relations strategies. Democrats blasted Trump, blaming him for walking away from an immigration deal with Schumer on Friday that they say could have prevented the shutdown. “How can you negotiate with the president under those circumstances where he agrees face-to-face to move forward with a certain path and then within two hours calls back and pulls the plug?” Durbin said on ABC’s “This Week with George Stephanopoulos.” Schumer offered Trump support for the border wall in exchange for a deal to protect the nearly 700,000 so-called Dreamers facing deportation. But since then, Republicans and Democrats have publicly sparred over whether Schumer was offering full funding for the wall or not. Republicans, meanwhile, accused Democrats of taking “hostages” in order to strong-arm the GOP into an immigration deal that has eluded Congress for years. “This is the Democrats trying to hold our military hostage for an issue that has been with us for decades,” House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) said on ABC. “I think we need to resolve it — the president wants to resolve it — but you don’t do that in the middle of a shutdown.” But even Republicans seemed uncomfortable defending a Trump campaign ad saying Democratic leaders would be “complicit” in murders committed by undocumented immigrants during the shutdown. Republican leaders know they will need Democratic cooperation to break the shutdown logjam. “I don’t know if that’s necessarily productive,\\" Ryan said of the Trump ad. So far, Trump has not called for a meeting with the “Big Four” congressional leaders — McConnell, Schumer, Ryan and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) — and Republicans on the Sunday news shows gave no indication he would do so. But White House legislative affairs director Marc Short said Trump has been in touch with GOP leaders throughout the weekend. \\"The president has been involved,\\" Short said on NBC's \\"Meet the Press.\\" \\"Yesterday he was speaking to Leader McConnell, Leader Ryan. He also spoke to Kevin McCarthy.\\" John Bresnahan and Rachael Bade contributed to this report. |||||","response":"There's a problem with the White House's phone line right now.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Zappa's relationship with long-time manager Herb Cohen ended in 1976. Zappa sued Cohen for skimming more than he was allocated from DiscReet Records, as well as for signing acts of which Zappa did not approve. Cohen filed a lawsuit against Zappa in return, which froze the money Zappa and Cohen had gained from an out-of-court settlement with MGM over the rights of the early Mothers of Invention recordings. It also prevented Zappa having access to any of his previously recorded material during the trials. Zappa therefore took his personal master copies of the rock-oriented Zoot Allures (1976) directly to Warner Bros., thereby bypassing DiscReet.In the mid-1970s Zappa prepared material for Läther (pronounced \\"leather\\"), a four-LP project. Läther encapsulated all the aspects of Zappa's musical styles—rock tunes, orchestral works, complex instrumentals, and Zappa's own trademark distortion-drenched guitar solos. Wary of a quadruple-LP, Warner Bros. Records refused to release it. Zappa managed to get an agreement with Phonogram Inc., and test pressings were made targeted at a Halloween 1977 release, but Warner Bros. prevented the release by claiming rights over the material. Zappa responded by appearing on the Pasadena, California radio station KROQ, allowing them to broadcast Läther and encouraging listeners to make their own tape recordings. A lawsuit between Zappa and Warner Bros. followed, during which no Zappa material was released for more than a year. Eventually, Warner Bros. issued different versions of much of the Läther material in 1978 and 1979 as four individual albums (five full-length LPs) with limited promotion.Although Zappa eventually gained the rights to all his material created under the MGM and Warner Bros. contracts, the various lawsuits meant that for a period Zappa's only income came from touring, which he therefore did extensively in 1975–77 with relatively small, mainly rock-oriented, bands.

Its color varies very little (unlike the domestic llama), ranging from a light brown to dark cinnamon and shading to white underneath. Guanacos have grey faces and small, straight ears. - Camelids are members of the biological family Camelidae, the only currently living family in the suborder Tylopoda. The extant members of this group are: dromedary camels, Bactrian camels, wild Bactrian camels, llamas, alpacas, vicuñas, and guanacos. - Vicugna is a genus containing two South American camelids , the vicuña and the alpaca . Previously thought to be descended from the llama , the alpaca was reclassified as part of Vicugna after a 2001 paper on alpaca DNA . The paper showed that the alpaca is descended from the vicuña , not the guanaco . - An alpaca (\\"Vicugna pacos\\") is a domesticated species of South American camelid. It resembles a small llama in appearance. - The vicuña (\\"Vicugna vicugna\\") or vicugna (both ) is one of two wild South American camelids which live in the high alpine areas of the Andes, the other being the guanaco. It is a relative of the llama, and is now believed to be the wild ancestor of domesticated alpacas, which are raised for their coats. Vicuñas produce small amounts of extremely fine wool, which is very expensive because the animal can only be shorn every three years, and has to be caught from the wild. When knitted together, the product of the vicuña's wool is very soft and warm. The Inca valued vicuñas highly for their wool, and it was against the law for anyone but royalty to wear vicuña garments; today the vicuña is the national animal of Peru and appears in the Peruvian coat of arms. - The llama (Lama glama) is a domesticated South American camelid, widely used as a meat and pack animal by Andean cultures since the Pre-Columbian era. - The Andes or Andean Mountains are the longest continental mountain range in the world. They are a continuous range of highlands along the western edge of South America. This range is about long, about wide (widest between 18° south and 20° south latitude), and of an average height of about . The Andes extend from north to south through seven South American countries: Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Argentina and Chile. - A camel is an even-toed ungulate within the genus Camelus, bearing distinctive fatty deposits known as \\"humps\\" on its back. The three surviving species of camel are the dromedary, or one-humped camel (\\"C. dromedarius\\"), which inhabits the Middle East and the Horn of Africa; the Bactrian, or two-humped camel (\\"C. bactrianus\\"), which inhabits Central Asia; and the critically endangered wild Bactrian camel (\\"C. ferus\\") that has limited populations in remote areas of northwest China and Mongolia. Bactrian camels take their name from the historical Bactria region of Central Asia (Yam & Khomeiri, 2015). Both the dromedary and the Bactrian camels have been domesticated; they provide milk, meat, hair for textiles or goods such as felted pouches, and are working animals with tasks ranging from human transport to bearing loads.

Here are possible answers to this question: - shaker - fast food restaurant - kitchen cupboard - people - table I believe the correct choice is \\"fast food restaurant\\", here's why: The answer is:","response":"Fast food restaurants are likely to use too much salt in their food for a variety of reasons. Although other options, such as people and shakers, may indeed be involved in the process of using or consuming excessive amounts of salt, fast food restaurants have a significant impact on our overall salt consumption. The following factors contribute to fast food restaurants being the correct choice: 1. Flavor enhancement: One of the primary reasons fast food restaurants use excessive amounts of salt in their food is to enhance the flavor. Salt is a simple yet powerful taste enhancer that can make even bland food taste better. This is especially important for fast food chains as they aim to offer flavorful and satisfying meals that appeal to a wide range of customers. 2. Preservation and shelf life: Salt acts as a preservative, prolonging the shelf life of food products. Fast food restaurants often use preservatives in their dishes to ensure they remain fresh and appetizing even after being transported, stored, or prepared in advance. By using more salt, these establishments can cut down on food waste and maintain the quality of their offerings. 3. Texture and appearance: In addition to enhancing taste, salt can also improve the texture and appearance of food. For example, using salt in bread and other baked goods can lead to a more appealing crust and better overall quality. By incorporating more salt into their dishes, fast food restaurants can create visually enticing and appetizing menu items. 4. Cost-effectiveness: Salt is a relatively inexpensive ingredient, and employing it as a flavor enhancer or preservative can be a cost-effective strategy for fast food restaurants. By relying on salt to improve the taste and quality of their food, these establishments can keep their prices low and attract more customers. 5. Consumer preferences and habits: Many people have already developed a taste for salty foods, making them more likely to enjoy the high salt levels found in fast food. This preference could be driven by biology, as salt is a necessary element for our bodies, or by habits formed during a lifetime of consuming salty foods. Fast food restaurants capitalize on this preference by providing food that's high in salt and, by extension, palatable to a large number of customers. Therefore, fast food restaurants are the most likely to use too much salt in their food due to the myriad benefits that salt provides, such as flavor enhancement, preservation, cost savings, and their keen understanding of consumer preferences. Other possible choices in the list may play a role in excessive salt consumption, but fast food restaurants are the primary culprits when it comes to using too much salt in the preparation and serving of meals."},{"question":"Background: Cholesterol has been implicated in heart disease for decades.

When I was 21 years old I produced a play. It was actually my second. The first was really successful. With the second I bit off a lot more than I could chew and I got too big for my britches and I ended up with a sprawling money eating disaster that caused me to have to move to a poor part of town and to go to court with my publicist and to be in debt for a couple of years. I could have absolutely let this ruin me and discourage me. And I realized this was a very delicate situation for my creativity and my sense of hope for the future. So I said to myself one day, “let me take a walk to the park and have this situation out with myself once and for all.” Two blocks from my house was this wonderful neo classical park with beautiful stairs leading from level to level. I walked up and down the stairs and basically said to myself “this was a failure. I am having a failure experience. But I have a choice of how I look at this. And the big Takeaway for me with this experience is that I have talent and there is a big creative future for me. And I have hope. I have to slow down. I have to make sure I don’t get ahead of myself. I definitely have to clean up this mess and be patient for however long it takes . But bottom line the big take away from this experience is that I have talent and I have a future and I have Hope.” It was one of the most amazing moments I’ve ever had with myself. There are about 100 other experiences in my life where I wish I had had a conversation like this. This one was a treasure.

Instead, they chose to focus on their talent, hope, and potential for a bright creative future. They realized the need to slow down, be more cautious, and patiently deal with the consequences of their failed venture. The author's ability to transform their mindset allowed them to turn a difficult situation into a moment of personal growth and confidence in their ability to succeed in the future."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Scientific Progress Most scientific progress is the result of careful consideration of work that has already been done. The wonderful world which lies before us today has been put up by hardworking men with clear heads and inventive mind, and these who follow them along life's road will improve on their efforts. It is sometimes necessary to question and even to disbelieve some of the statements made by experts. Action or experiment can often end an argument or achieve a breakthrough. When men were wondering whether it was possible to reach India by sailing westwards from Europe, and whether there was any land on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean, Christopher Columbus decides to act. He gathered some men, invited them to go on board his three ships, and set out across the dangerous waters of the Atlantic Ocean. He was successful in finding land, but it was not India. The result of his action was that the arguments came to the end. Any young man who wishes to do research must be courageous enough to question old beliefs and do some original thinking about them. Although we seem to know so much, there are many things we don't know. Even when we pull an atom to pieces, we do not really know what the pieces are, we often do not reach the reality behind what we discover, and the more we learn, the better we realize our ignorance. Question: Christopher Columbus decided to set out his trip because he wants to _ Options: A: travel round the world B: bring words into action C: discover the truth with action D: bring the argument to an end Answer:","response":"The passage suggests that Christopher Columbus embarked on his journey not because he wanted to travel the world for the sake of travel, but rather due to a motivation to validate or disprove a theory that was under debate - whether it was possible to reach India by sailing westwards from Europe and if there was land on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean. Columbus turned theory into action by launching his expedition, demonstrating courage to challenge existing beliefs and willing to push boundaries to discover the truth. Given the options provided, option B: \\"bring words into action\\" and option C: \\"discover the truth with action\\" both align with the description in the text. Columbus indeed brought the debates and theoretical discussions into tangible action by setting sail. He sought to \\"discover the truth with action,\\" by proving or disproving the theory through direct experience, which was the voyage. However, option D: \\"bring the argument to an end,\\" aligns even more tightly with the outcome of Columbus' journey, as emphasized in the text that \\"the result of his action was that the arguments came to an end.\\" His successful voyage did end the continuing arguments about the feasibility of reaching India by sailing westwards from Europe and the existence of land beyond the Atlantic. So, even though options B and C are valid interpretations of Columbus' motivation to some extent, option D: \\"bring the argument to an end\\" most accurately captures the motive and the eventual outcome of Columbus' journey as depicted in the text. Therefore, option D is the best answer."},{"question":"@cleiomao so....did ya watch it at lunch? perhaps not the nsfw part in the office though?

They had no idea who she was, but she liked to think that they could sense her strength and that it intimidated them.

How to become an er physician Go to college. You need at least 3 years of undergraduate school or a bachelor's degree to enter medical school. You can major in pre-medicine or a related area such as physics, biology or chemistry since these majors include all the prerequisites, but a science major is not required.","response":"After completing your bachelor’s degree, here are the steps you need to follow to become an ER physician: 1. Take the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT): This standardized, multiple-choice examination is designed to assess your problem-solving, critical thinking, and knowledge of natural, behavioral, and social science concepts and principles prerequisite to the study of medicine. Your MCAT scores, along with your academic performance, will be used during the medical school admission process. 2. Apply for medical schools: Start researching and applying to medical schools that offer programs aligned with your career goals and interests. It is recommended to apply to multiple medical schools to increase your chances of being accepted. When selecting schools, consider factors such as location, tuition fees, class size, and program curriculum. 3. Complete a Doctor of Medicine (MD) or Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO) Program: Medical school typically takes four years to complete. In the first two years, you will participate in coursework that covers basic sciences, such as anatomy, biochemistry, and physiology. You will also learn about medical ethics, laws, and patient care. The last two years of medical school primarily consist of clinical rotations in various medical specialties, including emergency medicine. 4. Take the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) or Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Licensing Examination (COMLEX): To practice medicine in the United States, you must pass a licensing exam – either the USMLE or COMLEX, depending on your medical school program. These exams consist of multiple steps or levels and are taken at different times during your medical education. 5. Apply for Emergency Medicine Residency: After completing medical school, you need to undergo a specialty-specific residency program. For emergency medicine, the residency lasts three to four years, during which you will gain hands-on experience and training in an emergency department under the supervision of experienced ER physicians. You may also have opportunities to participate in research projects or receive additional training in related fields. 6. Obtain Board Certification: Once you complete your residency, it is essential to become board-certified in emergency medicine by passing the American Board of Emergency Medicine (ABEM) or the American Osteopathic Board of Emergency Medicine (AOBEM) examination. Board certification demonstrates your commitment to the field and your competence in providing high-quality patient care. 7. Obtain State Licensure: You must apply for and obtain a medical license in the state where you intend to practice. The requirements for licensure vary by state but generally include submitting your medical school diploma, residency program completion certificate, and passing the USMLE or COMLEX exams. 8. Maintain Continuing Medical Education (CME) and Licensure: As an ER physician, you must constantly enhance your skills and knowledge in the rapidly evolving field of emergency medicine. Participate in CME opportunities to stay current with advancements in emergency care practices, medications, and technology. You must also renew your state medical licensure periodically, which typically requires proof of ongoing CME participation. 9. Consider a Fellowship: If you wish to specialize further in a specific area of emergency medicine, such as pediatric emergency medicine, toxicology, or emergency medical services, you might consider completing a fellowship program. Fellowships typically last one to three years and provide specialized training and experience, allowing you to become an expert in your chosen sub-specialty. 10. Find a job and start your career: After completing all the necessary steps and obtaining the required certifications and licensures, you can start applying for ER physician positions. The high demand for qualified emergency physicians ensures various opportunities in hospitals, urgent care centers, and academic institutions. Networking and staying connected with mentors and colleagues can also help you discover job opportunities and advance your career as an ER physician."},{"question":"Generate a short movie review that has \\"(1).\\" sentiment (Available options: (1). negative; (2). positive;).","response":"Step 1: Identify the sentiment requested The user has requested a movie review with negative sentiment, denoted as \\"(1).\\" Step 2: Choose a fictional movie To avoid potential copyright issues, let's create a fictional movie Title: \\"Fading Dreams\\" Genre: Romantic drama Step 3: Generate the short negative movie review \\"Fading Dreams\\" falls desperately short of its ambitions, despite its attempt to evoke strong emotions in viewers.

At the lowest level are motor areas in the medulla and pons, which control stereotyped movements such as walking, breathing, or swallowing. At a higher level are areas in the midbrain, such as the red nucleus, which is responsible for coordinating movements of the arms and legs. At a higher level yet is the primary motor cortex, a strip of tissue located at the posterior edge of the frontal lobe. The primary motor cortex sends projections to the subcortical motor areas, but also sends a massive projection directly to the spinal cord, through the pyramidal tract. This direct corticospinal projection allows for precise voluntary control of the fine details of movements.

Let's break down the review's components to better understand the reviewer's perspective. Flattering aspects: 1. Positive review: The reviewer begins by indicating that they overall give the book a positive review which suggests that they found value and enjoyment from reading it. 2. Fast read: The reviewer mentions that they finished the book quickly, reading it in just 3 nights. This could be seen as a flattering aspect as it implies that the book was engaging, well-paced, or held their interest throughout. Unflattering aspects: 1. Short chapters: The reviewer acknowledges a common criticism regarding the book's short chapters. Short chapters might not allow readers to fully immerse in the story or might cause the narrative to feel rushed or underdeveloped. 2. Lack of depth in specific content: The reviewer expresses disappointment in the handling of the topic of football groupies, as the book offered only superficial insight and did not provide any intriguing stories. This indicates that the reader was left unsatisfied with the exploration of this subject matter. 3. Unfulfilled expectations: Having expected deeper stories or more comprehensive discussions, the reviewer was left wanting more from the book. This suggests that the book may have missed opportunities to engage readers or provide a richer reading experience.

The Norman languages of Guernésiais, Jèrriais and Sarkese spoken in the Channel Islands are similar to French. A cant, called Shelta, is spoken by Irish Travellers, often as a means to conceal meaning from those outside the group.

A:","response":"Bacteria While fungi spores are haploid and have the ability to develop into a new organism without being fertilized, they remain in the domain of fungi and not one of the other indicated options. It is essential to understand the distinctions between the various kingdoms and domains of life, as well as the properties and characteristics of fungi spores, to answer this question effectively. Fungi belong to a separate kingdom of life, distinct from bacteria, plants, or animals. They reproduce by releasing spores—a tiny, resilient and lightweight structure—that can propagate without the need for sexual reproduction. These spores, which contain a single set of chromosomes (haploid), can form a new fungal organism when the proper environmental conditions are met. Bacteria, on the other hand, belong to a separate domain of life called prokaryotes. They are single-celled microorganisms that reproduce by binary fission, a process in which one cell divides into two. While it may be observed that bacteria are haploid entities, they are not the products of fungal spore development. Therefore, connecting fungal spores and bacteria would be inappropriate. The other options presented in the list are not relevant to the question, as they either belong to different biological categories or represent substances or structures not directly related to fungi and their reproductive mechanisms. Therefore, the best answer based on the original options provided is “Bacteria.” However, it is important to note that the provided list does not contain the most accurate answer to the question.

Not only is it unable to see, but because it cannot receive the visual stimulus from its environment that a sighted child does, it is likely to be slow in intellectual development. Now the ten-month old son of Dr. and Mrs. Dennis Daughters is the subject of an unusual psychological experiment designed to prevent a lag in the learning process. With the aid of a sonar-type electronic that he wears on his head, infant Dennis is learning to identify the people and objects in the world around him by means of echoes . The device is an improvement of the \\"Sonicguide\\", an instrument produced by Telesensory Systems, Inc., of Palo Alto, Calif, and used by blind adults in addition to a smart or guide dog. As adapted for Dennis, it consists of a battery-powered system about the size of a half dollar that is on a headgear. A transmitter sends out an ultrasonic pulse that creates an 80 degree cone of sound at 6 feet. Echoes from objects within the cone are perceived (felt) as sounds that vary in pitch and volume with the size and distance of the object. The closer an object is, the lower the pitch, and the larger the object, the louder the signal. Hard surfaces produce a sharp ping, while soft ones send back signals with a slightly fuzzy quality. An object slightly to the right of Denny's sends back a louder sound to his right ear than to the left. Thus , by simply moving his head right and left and up and down, he can not only locate an object but also get some notion of its shape and size, thanks to the varying qualities of sounds reaching his ears as the cone of ultrasound passes _ . Dennis likes to use the device to play a kind of peek-a-boo with his mother. Standing on her knee and facing her directly, he receives a strong signal in both ears. By turning his head away, he makes her seem to disappear. \\"From the first time he wore it,\\" says Mrs. Daughters, \\"it was like a light going on in his head.\\" What remains to be determined is how well the device will help Dennis cope with...

Step 2: Introduce the movie Begin by introducing the movie in a negative way, highlighting its poor performance and reception. Introductory Paragraph: The much-anticipated big screen adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber's \\"Cats\\" (2019), directed by Tom Hooper, turned out to be a catastrophic venture. Plagued by an array of problematic issues, including unrefined visual effects, disjointed storytelling, and awkward character portrayals, \\"Cats\\" remains a forgettable and regrettable rendition of the classic Broadway hit. Step 3: Discuss the plot (or lack thereof) In this step, I'll elaborate on the weaknesses in the movie's plot. Afterward, I'll discuss the convoluted story and how it affects the overall experience. Plot Paragraph: The plot of \\"Cats\\" was nothing short of incoherent, leaving its audience bewildered and largely uninvested in the characters. In an attempt to define the purpose of each personality introduced, the movie sacrificed a cohesive storyline in favor of clumsy expositions. The primary premise, focusing on a group of cats aiming to ascend to the Heaviside Layer and obtain a new life, failed to hold the attention of its viewers, resulting in an experience akin to aimlessly wandering through an unrelated series of events. Step 4: Critique the visual effects and design choices In this part, I'll address the movie's unsettling visual effects, including the uncanny appearance of the characters and the unrealistic CGI. Visual Effects Paragraph: Visual effects played a significant role in undermining \\"Cats.\\" The human-cat hybrid characters fell directly into the uncanny valley, leaving audiences feeling disturbed rather than awed. The incomplete CGI, exemplified through characters like Judi Dench's \\"Old Deuteronomy\\", sporting human hands and wedding rings in some scenes, made it abundantly clear that rushed design decisions marred the supposed charm of the movie. These effects produced a visually jarring experience that failed to captivate the viewers as intended. Step 5: Comment on the actors' performances and character development For this portion, I'll express how the actors’ performances and the characters' lack of depth both contributed to the movie’s overall negative reception. Performances Paragraph: Adequate character development was conspicuously absent in \\"Cats.\\" Despite the movie boasting an all-star cast, including the likes of Idris Elba, Jennifer Hudson, and Ian McKellen, the actors’ talents were wasted on shallow, unclear roles. The underdeveloped characters resulted in a lack of emotional investment, and the sporadic bursts of song from the ensemble seemed odd and unnecessary. While some performances, such as Hudson's moving rendition of \\"Memory,\\" were momentarily impressive, their impact was eclipsed by the film's glaring inadequacies. Step 6: Provide a closing statement Wrap up the negative review by summarizing the main points of critique and reiterating the overall poor quality of the movie. Conclusion: In summary, \\"Cats\\" (2019) is a film that crumbles under the pressure of its own ambition. Hindered by a confusing plot, unsettling visual effects, and lackluster character development, this movie fails to capture the magic and allure of its theater predecessor. Instead, \\"Cats\\" remains a disappointing spectacle that should have remained an unrealized dream."},{"question":"Problem: Solve 40*g - 6*g = 238 for g. And the answer is...","response":"To solve the equation 40*g - 6*g = 238 for g, begin by combining the terms with the same variable, g, on the left side of the equation. Step 1: Combine like terms on the left side 40*g and -6*g both have the same variable g, so we can combine them to simplify the equation. 40*g - 6*g = (40-6)*g = 34*g So, the simplified equation is: 34*g = 238 Step 2: Solve for g To find the value of g, we need to isolate g on one side of the equation. Since 34 is multiplied by g, we can perform the opposite operation, which is division, to isolate g. Divide both sides of the equation by 34: (34*g) / 34 = 238 / 34 Since 34/34 = 1, we are left with: g = 238 / 34 Step 3: Calculate the value of g Now, we need to calculate the value of g by performing the division: 238 / 34 = 7 Step 4: Verify the solution To verify that our solution, g=7, is correct, we can plug this value back into the original equation: 40*g - 6*g = 238 40*7 - 6*7 = 238 280 - 42 = 238 238 = 238 Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution of g = 7 is indeed correct. So, the answer is g = 7."},{"question":"How to choose a pug<br>Use breed standards to assess the puppy.

Use these standards to feel confident in selecting a puppy who is truly a purebred. Can we draw the following conclusion? The american kennel club standard for pugs is the only standard. Choices: (a). Yes. (b). It's impossible to say. (c). No.","response":"(c). No. We cannot draw the conclusion that the American Kennel Club (AKC) standard for pugs is the only standard. While the AKC is a widely-recognized and respected organization in evaluating purebred dogs, there are other international and national organizations that have their own standards for different breeds, including pugs. One such example is the Fédération Cynologique Internationale (FCI), which is the World Canine Organization. They have their own breed standards for dogs across the globe. Additionally, various countries may have local canine organizations with their own standards. Consequently, it would be incorrect to assume that the AKC is the only standard. Although the AKC breed standards serve as a helpful guideline when choosing a pug, it's essential to consider the standards and guidelines set forth by other organizations as well. Furthermore, it's crucial to acknowledge the breeders' reputation, the puppy's health and temperament, and the quality of care they receive before purchasing one."},{"question":"Sentence 1: The pressure to reduce administrative costs resulting from competition in an emerging global market drove many finance organizations to find more efficient ways to deliver their services.

After announcement fighting rapidly resumed on border in Lugansk region. New battles were also underway in Tarany in the Donetsk region. Write an article based on these highlights.","response":"Title: Conflict Escalates as Petro Poroshenko Refuses to Extend Ceasefire, Promising to Attack Subtitle: Vladimir Putin Claims Helplessness in Controlling Insurgents; Fierce fighting Resumes in Eastern Ukraine On [Date], Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko announced in a televised address that he would not be extending the ceasefire between Ukrainian government forces and Russia-backed insurgents, and vowed to commence full-scale attacks. The previous ceasefire, which began on [Date], had been an effort to give negotiations a chance between the Ukrainian authorities and the separatists in the Eastern regions of Luhansk and Donetsk. However, negotiations faltered as both parties accused each other of violating the ceasefire agreement, leading to Poroshenko's decision to resume military action against the insurgents. \\"We will attack, and we will liberate our land,\\" said the President during his address, many interpreting this statement as a direct challenge to Russia's involvement in the conflict. On the other side, Russian President Vladimir Putin expressed his inability to dictate the terms of any agreement to the rebels, asserting that Russia was not directly involved in the conflict. He stated that it was up to the insurgents themselves if they wished to lay down their arms. Following Poroshenko's announcement, fighting rapidly resumed in the Luhansk region, along the Ukrainian-Russian border, as both the separatists and government forces sought to gain an upper hand. Confrontations erupted in Tarany, as well, a crucial economic center in the Donetsk region. The increasing intensity of these skirmishes signaled the potential for the conflict to escalate into a widespread and catastrophic event. The situation in Eastern Ukraine has been tense since 2014 when Russia annexed Crimea, a move widely condemned by the international community. The Luhansk and Donetsk regions subsequently declared themselves republics, following controversial referendums. Since then, the conflict pitted the Ukrainian government against Russian-backed insurgents, resulting in thousands of deaths and displacing hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians from their homes. Poroshenko's refusal to extend the ceasefire raised immediate concerns among the international community that a full-scale conflict, with the potential of turning into an all-out war, might be imminent. The United Nations, the European Union, and individual countries, such as the United States and Germany, have expressed their concerns and urged all parties to maintain dialogue, respecting the principles of international law and human rights. As the situation remains precarious, the local population continues to suffer the consequences of intensifying clashes between the conflicting forces. According to human rights groups and media sources, a significant number of civilian casualties have been reported as collateral damage in the recent wave of fighting. Given the severity of the developments in Eastern Ukraine and the increasing involvement of external powers, diplomatic efforts must be intensified to find a viable solution, one that ensures the peaceful coexistence of all parties involved. Failure to do so could result in a dangerous scenario, the ramifications of which may be detrimental to the future of Ukraine and the stability of the already volatile international relations landscape."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: \\"Jenny Gerbasi\\", given a list of categories: company, educational institution, artist, athlete, office holder, mean of transportation, building, natural place, village, animal, plant, album, film or written work, what category does the title belong to?

Does it follow that \\"The estimates for costs are pretty accurate for the mailings.\\"?","response":"While dividing the costs for each postal activity by the total volume to obtain an estimate of the marginal cost can provide a basic understanding of the costs involved in mailings, it does not necessarily follow that these estimates will always be accurate. Several factors can contribute to variations and potential inaccuracies in these estimates. Here is an analysis of some of these factors: 1. Mail volume fluctuations: Mail volumes can vary significantly over time, depending on factors such as seasonal demand, economic conditions, and shifts in communication methods (e.g., the growth of electronic mail and digital communication). Consequently, the division of postal activity costs by total volume may not produce accurate cost estimates if these fluctuations are not taken into account. 2. Variation in postal activities: Postal activities entail a wide range of cost components, including labor costs, transportation costs, equipment maintenance and depreciation, and facility expenses. The marginal costs of these individual components can differ significantly, and the estimation process may not fully capture these variances, which can lead to inaccuracies in the overall cost assessment. 3. Allocation of fixed and variable costs: Postal services have both fixed and variable costs. Fixed costs, such as facility leases and equipment purchases, are incurred independently of mail volume, while variable costs, such as labor and transportation, may vary with volume. A challenge in accurately estimating costs lies in separating fixed and variable costs and attributing them to specific mail volumes. If this allocation is done inaccurately, it could lead to incorrect cost estimates. 4. Differences in mail types and services: The cost structure and processing requirements can differ substantially between various mail types (e.g., letters, parcels, priority mail, etc.) and services (e.g., domestic, international, express, etc.). If the estimation process does not adequately differentiate between mail types and services, the resulting cost estimates may be inaccurate. 5. Efficiency and productivity variations: The efficiency and productivity of postal operations can vary between different facilities, regions, and time periods. Factors such as labor productivity, technology adoption, and management practices can contribute to these variations. If the estimation process does not account for differences in efficiency and productivity, the resulting cost estimates may not reflect the true expenses involved in mail processing and delivery. 6. Changes in input costs: Input costs, such as wages, fuel prices, and material costs, can change over time and affect the overall costs of postal activities. If these changes are not adequately captured in the estimation process, the derived cost estimates may not accurately reflect the current expenses associated with mailings. In summary, while using total mail volume to derive an estimate of marginal costs can provide a baseline understanding of the costs involved in postal activities, it is crucial to consider the various factors that can influence these estimates' accuracy. Failure to account for volume fluctuations, cost components, fixed and variable costs allocation, mail types and services, efficiency and productivity variations, and changes in input costs could result in inaccurate cost estimates for mailings. It is essential for postal organizations to continuously review and update their cost estimation methodologies to capture these factors and ensure that cost estimates are as accurate as possible."},{"question":"Select your answer: Which is this about?

Chain of thought:","response":"1. First, let's consider the activity in question: windsurfing. Windsurfing is a water sport that involves riding on a board while holding on to a sail, which is powered by the wind. 2. Next, let's look at the location: Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico is an island in the Caribbean with many beaches and water sports opportunities. Therefore, it would be possible to windsurf along its coastlines under normal conditions. 3. Now, let's think about the specific event mentioned: Hurricane Maria. Hurricane Maria was a powerful Category 5 hurricane that struck Puerto Rico in September 2017, causing widespread destruction and loss of life. 4. Hurricanes create extreme wind and weather conditions, such as high winds, heavy rain, and storm surges. 5. Considering the conditions mentioned in step 4, a hurricane like Maria would create a highly dangerous environment for windsurfing. The high wind speeds would make it almost impossible to control the sail, and the intense surrounding weather, such as torrential rains and storm surges, would be hazardous for anyone attempting the sport. 6. Additionally, during a hurricane, authorities typically advise people to stay indoors or seek safe shelter to protect themselves from the storm's dangers. Conclusion: Although Puerto Rico is a location where one could normally go windsurfing, attempting to do so during Hurricane Maria would have been extremely dangerous and ill-advised due to the extreme weather conditions and safety risks associated with such a powerful storm."},{"question":"Problem: Solve 6*z + 75 = 87 for z.

She looked just like she did most days back then--a glamour queen, a movie star (\\"Just like Lena Horne,\\" my friend Chloe had once said, \\"only darker--oh, sorry, Leah!\\"), but today her beauty somehow had a harder, more defiant edge to it. I could smell the expensive Dior perfume as soon as I opened the door, which surprised me, because my mom was usually fastidious about not getting perfume on her clothes. She was wearing her bug glasses--huge dark things with lenses that bulged out like fly eyes and reflected my face like a fun-house mirror. She had tied a yellow silk scarf around her hair and was taking deep pulls on a cigarette held between two immaculately manicured fingers. Only I knew about the nicotine stains she carefully covered with her special order \\"forest sable\\" cream each morning. Tiffany, a stupid but vicious senator's daughter who I had the misfortune of sharing a classroom with, suddenly dashed from inside the school, her face flushed. \\"Hello, Mrs. Wilson,\\" she called. Before my mother could respond, she giggled and ran back to three of her friends waiting beyond the door. I could hear them laughing, but I was glad I couldn't understand their words. They were all fascinated with my mother--the black housekeeper who dressed like Katharine Hepburn and drove a Cadillac, whose daughter's \\"light toffee\\" skin indicated that she might just like her coffee with a lot of cream. Sometimes I hated those girls. \\"Get in the car, Leah,\\" my mother said. Her already husky voice was pitched low, as though she'd been crying. That made me nervous. Why was she here? \\"Ma, Chloe was going to show me her dad's new camera.

Do you want to know about my staying in America? Well, to tell you the truth, it is really an eye-opening experience here. In China, I had English classes five times a week since Grade Five. But I didn't know textbook English could be so different from everyday English until I came to Hotchkiss School, Connecticut.

Context: The Department of Health and Human Services lost track of nearly 1,500 migrant children it placed with sponsors in the United States, an agency official told a Senate subcommittee Thursday. The children were taken into government care after they showed up alone at the Southwest border. Most of the children are from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala, and were fleeing drug cartels, gang violence and domestic abuse. The agency learned the 1,475 children could not be found after making follow-up calls to check on their safety, the committee was told. The news has raised concern that the children could fall into the hands of human traffickers or be used as laborers by people posing as relatives. “You are the worst foster parents in the world. You don’t even know where they are,” said Democratic Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota. “We are failing. I don’t think there is any doubt about it. And when we fail kids, that makes me angry.” Since the dramatic surge of border crossings in 2013, the federal government has placed more than 180,000 unaccompanied minors with parents or other adult sponsors who are expected to care for the children and help them attend school while they seek legal status in immigration court. An AP investigation in 2016 found that more than two dozen of those children had been sent to homes where they were sexually assaulted, starved or forced to work for little or no pay. Since then, the Department Health and Human Services has boosted outreach to at-risk children deemed to need extra protection, and last year offered post-placement services to about one-third of unaccompanied minors. But advocates say it is hard to know how many minors may be in dangerous conditions, in part because some disappear before social workers can follow up with them, and they never show up in court. Republican Senator Rob Portman of Ohio gave HHS and the Department of Homeland Security until Monday to deliver a time frame for improving monitoring. “These kids, regardless of their immigration status, deserve to...

What does a pilot do on a long haul flight? Choose your answer. Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? Select from the following. [i] no [ii] yes","response":"[i] no The two questions are not paraphrases of each other, as they address different aspects of long-haul flights, specifically about the selection of aircraft types and the activities of pilots during long flights. I will answer each question in detail below. Question 1: Why are 747s and other wide body aircraft rarely, if ever, used on US long-haul domestic routes? There are several reasons for this, including operational efficiency, economic viability, and airspace congestion. 1. Operational Efficiency: Wide-body aircraft, such as the Boeing 747, are typically designed to carry a large number of passengers over long distances. These airplanes are also heavier and require larger amounts of fuel to operate, making them less efficient for domestic routes which are generally shorter when compared to international long-haul routes. For shorter routes, airlines often prefer to use smaller, more fuel-efficient aircraft, such as the Boeing 737 or Airbus A320, which offer better operational efficiency. 2. Economic Viability: The cost of operating a wide-body aircraft is significantly higher due to their large size and increased fuel consumption. This means that airlines need to fill most, if not all, of the seats in the airplane in order to make a profit on the route. Long-haul domestic routes in the US usually don't have the same demand for passenger capacity. Thus, airlines often choose smaller aircraft that allow for better flexibility in managing seat capacity and adjusting to changes in market demand. 3. Airspace Congestion: Major airports in the United States often suffer from airspace congestion, particularly during peak travel times. Smaller, narrow-body aircraft can take off and land more quickly, therefore reducing the impact of congestion on airport operations and improving punctuality. 4. Hub-and-spoke model: US-based airlines have favored the hub-and-spoke model for their domestic operations. In this system, passengers are flown from smaller cities to large hub airports, where they connect to flights going to their final destination. This model allows airlines to maximize the use of smaller aircraft on a variety of routes while still providing efficient connections for passengers. Question 2: What does a pilot do on a long haul flight? On a long haul flight, pilots have several responsibilities to ensure the flight's safety and smooth operation. These include: 1. Pre-flight preparations: Before the flight, pilots review important information such as weather updates, route planning, and fuel management. They also perform a walk-around inspection of the aircraft to check for any visible issues and confer with the flight operations team to discuss any potential concerns. 2. Takeoff and climb: During the takeoff and initial climb, pilots work closely with air traffic control to follow departure procedures, and they manage the aircraft's speed, altitude, and heading. They also continuously monitor the aircraft's systems and performance during this critical phase of flight. 3. Cruise: While cruising at a high altitude, pilots typically engage the aircraft's autopilot to maintain a steady course and altitude. However, they continue to monitor the aircraft's systems and performance, communicate with air traffic control, and update the route as needed due to changing weather conditions or other factors. During a long-haul flight, pilots will take turns resting in the crew rest area while the other pilot maintains control of the aircraft. 4. Descent, approach, and landing: As the aircraft approaches its destination, the pilots will start the descent and prepare for landing. This phase involves interacting with air traffic control to ensure a safe approach, preparing the aircraft for landing, and managing the landing procedure, including adjusting the aircraft's speed, altitude, and heading, as well as deploying flaps and landing gear. 5. Post-flight duties: After the aircraft has landed and reached the gate, pilots have various tasks to complete, such as shutting down the aircraft's engines and systems, discussing any issues encountered during the flight with maintenance crews, and completing necessary paperwork. They may also conduct a post-flight debrief with their fellow crew members to discuss the flight and any areas for improvement. In addition to these tasks, pilots also work closely with the flight crew to ensure the safety and well-being of passengers on board, addressing any concerns and coordinating efforts during unexpected situations such as turbulence or medical emergencies."},{"question":"Definition: In this task, you are given a sentence or phrase in Xhosa.

Later, Disraeli receives the welcome news that the spendthrift Khedive of Egypt is in dire need of money and is willing to sell the controlling shares in the Suez Canal. The purchase of the canal would secure control of India, but Michael Probert, head of the Bank of England, makes it clear to Disraeli that he is vehemently opposed to any such plan. Disraeli then summons Hugh Myers, a leading Jewish banker. Meanwhile, Lord Charles Deeford proposes to Lady Clarissa Pevensey. Although she is in love with him, she turns him down. He is content to enjoy his wealth and high social standing, and lacks the ambition she wants in a husband; further, she is a great admirer of the Prime Minister and Charles has no strong opinion about him. Disraeli, seeing promise in the young man and wanting Clarissa to be happy, convinces Charles to come work for him, and tells him about the canal purchase. But he does not tell him about the spies.

Nazarbayev, the steelworker-turned-Communist-Party-boss who has ruled the country since 1989. That impression was heightened on Sunday when one of the president’s three challengers acknowledged that he, too, had voted for Mr. Nazarbayev. “I am sure that the current president will be the victor, so I am giving him my vote as well,” the challenger, Mels Yeleusizov, an environmental activist, told the Interfax news service as he emerged from a polling station in the city of Almaty. He said his family was voting for Mr. Nazarbayev as well. The president, who called snap elections two years ahead of schedule, won by 94.8 percent, according to an exit poll by the Association of Sociologists and Political Scientists of Kazakhstan. Meanwhile, early results from the Central Election Committee suggested that turnout was an extraordinarily high 89.9 percent, despite opposition leaders who denounced the election as a farce and encouraged voters to stay home. Mr. Nazarbayev, 70, is credited with making oil-rich Kazakhstan into Central Asia’s island of stability, but he has drawn criticism from the West for stifling dissent. In February, seeking to shore up his reputation as an international statesman, Mr. Nazarbayev abruptly rejected the idea of a referendum that would have granted him the presidency until 2020. The election provided an even playing field, he told reporters on Sunday. “All candidates had equal opportunities to visit regions and had access to mass media,” Mr. Nazarbayev said on Sunday, as he emerged from the country’s National Academic Library, a grandiose new structure that is shaped like a Möbius strip. “They expressed their ideas and unveiled their messages to the people of Kazakhstan. There are some valuable thoughts that we have to keep in mind. We are open to our society.” In Semey, a university city near the border with Siberia, students showed up in large numbers in a snowstorm on Sunday morning, and poll workers said there were already lines when they opened the doors at 7 a.m. Tolebay K. Rakhypbekov, rector of the Semey State Medical University, said political competition would come to Kazakhstan — but only gradually. “There is none now,” he said. “But what competition can there be against our president? We all love him.” Lyudmila A. Lyapunova, 60, said voters were there because they risked losing their jobs or university spots if they did not show up. As a retiree, she said, she could afford to openly denounce the process, and planned to cross out every name on the ballot: an improvised version of “against all,” a traditional option that was omitted from this year’s poll. But virtually all voters said they were casting ballots for the president. Ada G. Komanova, 76, raved over the services provided to the elderly through the Nazarbayev Fund: a health clinic, concerts, a senior center “so cozy, it’s like a fairy tale.” Kanat, a construction worker who would not give his last name, said he had voted for Mr. Nazarbayev, even though he thought the president and his family had enriched themselves fabulously over the last two decades. “They already have everything they need,” he said. “They can afford to think about the public.”","response":"Kazakhstan's incumbent President, Nursultan A.

It is the root of the English word \\"vicar\\". - Hasdrubal Barca (245207 BC) was Hamilcar Barca's second son and a Carthaginian general in the Second Punic War. He was the brother of the famous Hannibal. - Hispania was the Roman name for the Iberian Peninsula. Under the Republic, Hispania was divided into two provinces: Hispania Citerior and Hispania Ulterior. During the Principate, Hispania Ulterior was divided into two new provinces, Baetica and Lusitania, while Hispania Citerior was renamed Tarraconensis. Subsequently, the western part of Tarraconensis was split off, first as Hispania Nova, later renamed Callaecia (or Gallaecia, whence modern Galicia). From Diocletian's Tetrarchy (AD 284) onwards, the south of remaining Tarraconensis was again split off as Carthaginensis, and probably then too the Balearic Islands and all the resulting provinces formed one civil diocese under the \\"vicarius\\" for the Hispaniae (that is, the Celtic provinces). The name, Hispania, was also used in the period of Visigothic rule. - Tarraco is the ancient name of the current city of Tarragona (Catalonia, Spain). It was the oldest Roman settlement on the Iberian Peninsula, founded during the Second Punic War by Scipio Calvus, and became capital of the Roman province of Hispania Citerior, and of Hispania Tarraconensis during the Roman Empire. - The Second Punic War, also referred to as The Hannibalic War and (by the Romans) the War Against Hannibal, lasted from 218 to 201 BC and involved combatants in the western and eastern Mediterranean. This was the second major war between Carthage and the Roman Republic and its allied Italic socii, with the crucial participation of Numidian-Berber armies and tribes on both sides. The two states fought three major wars with each other over the course of their existence. They are called the \\"Punic Wars\\" because Rome's name for Carthaginians was \\"Poeni\\", derived from \\"Poenici\\" (earlier form of \\"Punici\\"), a reference to the founding of Carthage by Phoenician settlers. - Hannibal (247 between 183 and 181 BC), fully Hannibal Barca, was a Punic military commander from Carthage, generally considered one of the greatest military commanders in history. His father Hamilcar Barca was the leading Carthaginian commander during the First Punic War. His younger brothers were Mago and Hasdrubal, and he was brother-in-law to Hasdrubal the Fair. - The Battle of Cissa was part of the Second Punic War. It was fought in the fall of 218 BC, near the Greek town of Tarraco in north-eastern Iberia. A Roman army under Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Calvus defeated an outnumbered Carthaginian army under Hanno, thus gaining control of the territory north of the Ebro River that Hannibal had just subdued a few months prior in the summer of 218 BC. This was the first battle that the Romans had ever fought in Iberia. - Hasdrubal the Fair (c. 270 BC 221 BC) was a Carthaginian military leader and politician, governor in Iberia after Hamilcar Barca's death, and founder of Cartagena. - Hispania Ulterior (English: \\"Further Spain\\", or occasionally \\"Thither Spain\\") was a region of Hispania during the Roman Republic, roughly located in Baetica and in the Guadalquivir valley of modern Spain and extending to all of Lusitania (modern Portugal, Extremadura and a small part of Salamanca province) and Gallaecia (modern Northern Portugal and Galicia). Its capital was Corduba. - The Battle of Ebro River was a naval battle fought near the mouth of Ebro River in the spring of 217 BC between a Carthaginian fleet of approximately 40 quinqueremes, under the command of Himilco, and a Roman fleet of 55 ships, under Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Calvus. Hasdrubal Barca, the Carthaginian commander in Iberia, had launched a joint expedition to destroy the Roman base north of the Ebro River. The Carthaginian naval contingent was totally defeated after a surprise attack by the Roman ships, losing 29 ships and the control of seas around Iberia. The reputation of the Romans was further enhanced in Iberia after this victory, causing rebellion among some of the Iberian tribes under Carthaginian control. - Gallaecia or Callaecia, also known as Hispania Gallaecia, was the name of a Roman province in the north-west of Hispania, approximately present-day Galicia, northern Portugal, Asturias and Leon and the later Suebic Kingdom of Gallaecia. The Roman cities included the port Cale (Porto), the governing centers Bracara Augusta (Braga), Lucus Augusti (Lugo) and Asturica Augusta (Astorga) and their administrative areas Conventus bracarensis, Conventus lucensis and Conventus asturicensis. - Hamilcar Barca or Barcas (c. 275 228 BC) was a Carthaginian general and statesman, leader of the Barcid family, and father of Hannibal, Hasdrubal and Mago. He was also father-in-law to Hasdrubal the Fair. - The Balearic Islands are an archipelago of Spain in the western Mediterranean Sea, near the eastern coast of the Iberian Peninsula. - The Principate is the name sometimes given to the first period of the Roman Empire from the beginning of the reign of Augustus in about 30 BC to the Crisis of the Third Century in 284 AD, after which it evolved into the so-called \\"Dominate\\". - The Battle of Dertosa , also known as the Battle of Ibera , was fought in the spring of 215 BC on the south bank of the Ebro River across from the town of Dertosa . A Roman army , under the command of Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Calvus and Publius Cornelius Scipio , defeated a similarly sized Carthaginian army under Hasdrubal Barca . The Romans , under Gnaeus Scipio , had established themselves in Hispania after winning the Battle of Cissa in 218 BC. Hasdrubal Barca 's expedition to evict them had ended in the defeat of the Iberian contingent of the Carthaginian navy at the Battle of Ebro River in 217 BC. Hasdrubal launched another expedition in 215 BC , but the defeat at Dertosa cost the Carthaginians a chance to reinforce Hannibal at a critical juncture , and the Romans gained the initiative in Hispania . The Scipio brothers continued with their policy of subjugating the Iberian tribes and raiding Carthaginian possessions . After losing of most of his field army , Hasdrubal had to be reinforced with the army that was to sail to Italy and reinforce Hannibal . Thus , by winning this battle , the Scipios had indirectly prevented the situation in Italy from getting worse in addition to improving their own situation in Iberia . This battle also demonstrates the danger of implementing the double envelopment tactic . - Publius Cornelius Scipio (died 211 BC) was a general and statesman of the Roman Republic. - The Iberian Peninsula , also known as Iberia , is located in the southwest corner of Europe. The peninsula is principally divided between Portugal and Spain, comprising most of their territory. It also includes Andorra and a small part of France along the peninsula's northeastern edge, as well as Gibraltar on its south coast, a small peninsula which forms an overseas territory of the United Kingdom. With an area of approximately , it is the second largest European peninsula, after the Scandinavian. - The Roman Republic was the era of ancient Roman civilization beginning with the overthrow of the Roman Kingdom, traditionally dated to 509 BC, and ending in 27 BC with the establishment of the Roman Empire. It was during this period that Rome's control expanded from the city's immediate surroundings to hegemony over the entire Mediterranean world. - The term tetrarchy (from the , \\"tetrarchia\\", \\"leadership of four [people]\\") describes any form of government where power is divided among four individuals, but in modern usage usually refers to the system instituted by Roman Emperor Diocletian in 293, marking the end of the Crisis of the Third Century and the recovery of the Roman Empire. This tetrarchy lasted until c. 313, when internecine conflict eliminated most of the claimants to power, leaving Constantine in control of the western half of the empire, and Licinius in control of the eastern half. - Constrained Energy Lapped Transform (CELT) is an open, royalty-free lossy audio compression format and a free software codec with especially low algorithmic delay for use in low-latency audio communication.

Development of the format was maintained by the Xiph.Org Foundation (as part of the Ogg codec family) and later coordinated by the Opus working group of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). - Hispania Citerior (English: \\"Hither Spain\\", or \\"Nearer Spain\\") was a Roman Province in Hispania during the Roman Republic. It was on the eastern coast of Spain down to the town of Cartago Nova, today's Cartagena in the autonomous community of Murcia, Spain. It roughly covered today's Spanish autonomous communities of Catalonia and Valencia. Further south there was the Roman Province of Hispania Ulterior (\\"Further Spain\\"), which further away from Rome. The two provinces were formed in 197 BC, four years after the end of the Second Punic War (218-201 BC). During this war Scipio Africanus defeated the Carthaginians at the Battle of Ilipa (near Seville) in 206 BC. This led to the Romans taking over the Carthaginian possessions in southern Spain and on the east coast up to the River Ebro. Several governors of Hispania Citerior commanded wars against the Celtiberians who lived to the west of this province. In the late first century BC Augustus reorganised the Roman provinces in Hispania and Hispania Citerior was replaced by the larger province of Hispania Tarraconensis, which included the territories the Romans had conquered in central, northern and north-western Hispania. Augustus also renamed Hispania Ulterior Hispania Baetica and created a third province, Hispania Lusitania. - Lusitania or Hispania Lusitana was an ancient Iberian Roman province including approximately all of modern Portugal south of the Douro river and part of modern Spain (the present autonomous community of Extremadura and a small part of the province of Salamanca). It was named after the Lusitani or Lusitanian people (an Indo-European people). Its capital was \\"Emerita Augusta\\" (currently Mérida, Spain), and it was initially part of the Roman Republic province of Hispania Ulterior, before becoming a province of its own in the Roman Empire. Romans first came to the territory around the mid 2nd century BC. A war with Lusitanian tribes followed, from 155 to 139 BC. In 27 BC, the province was created. - Hispan, Espan, Hispalo or Hispano, is a mythological character of Antiquity, who would derive the name Hispania, according to some ancient writers. Therefore, Hispan is the eponymous hero of Hispania. Hispan is mentioned first by the Gallo-Roman historian Gnaeus Pompeius Trogus (1st century BC) in his work \\"Historiae Philippicae\\", preserved only in a later summary, probably made in the 3rd century AD by Justinus. During the Middle Ages, Hispan was also known as Espan, told of him various legends. - The First Punic War (264 to 241 BC) was the first of three wars fought between Ancient Carthage and the Roman Republic. For more than 20 years, the two powers struggled for supremacy, primarily on the Mediterranean island of Sicily and its surrounding waters, and also in North Africa. The war signaled the beginning of a strategic transformation in the western Mediterranean. Carthage began the war as the great sea-power of the western Mediterranean, while Rome had but a small fleet of fighting ships. Over the course of the war, Rome built up a powerful navy, developed new naval tactics, and strategically used their navy, army, and local political alliances on Sicily in order to achieve a victory that expelled the Carthaginians from Sicily. The First Punic War ended with a treaty between Rome and Carthage, but years of bloodshed were to follow in the Second and Third Punic Wars before the strategic issue of power in the western Mediterranean was resolved in favor of Rome, and in the total destruction of Carthage. - Tin is a chemical element with the symbol Sn (for ) and atomic number 50, is a post-transition metal in group 14 of the periodic table. It is obtained chiefly from the mineral cassiterite, which contains tin dioxide, SnO. Tin shows a chemical similarity to both of its neighbors in group 14, germanium and lead, and has two main oxidation states, +2 and the slightly more stable +4. Tin is the 49th most abundant element and has, with 10 stable isotopes, the largest number of stable isotopes in the periodic table, thanks to its magic number of protons. It has two main allotropes: at room temperature, the stable allotrope is -tin, a silvery-white, malleable metal, but at low temperatures it transforms into the less dense grey -tin, which has the diamond cubic structure. Metallic tin is not easily oxidized in air. Given the information, choose the subject and object entities that have the relation of 'part of'.

The Radical MP and anti-Corn Law activist Richard Cobden often praised Burke's Thoughts and Details on Scarcity. The Liberal historian Lord Acton considered Burke one of the three greatest Liberals, along with William Gladstone and Thomas Babington Macaulay. Lord Macaulay recorded in his diary: \\"I have now finished reading again most of Burke's works. Admirable! The greatest man since Milton\\". The Gladstonian Liberal MP John Morley published two books on Burke (including a biography) and was influenced by Burke, including his views on prejudice. The Cobdenite Radical Francis Hirst thought Burke deserved \\"a place among English libertarians, even though of all lovers of liberty and of all reformers he was the most conservative, the least abstract, always anxious to preserve and renovate rather than to innovate. In politics he resembled the modern architect who would restore an old house instead of pulling it down to construct a new one on the site\\". Burke's Reflections on the Revolution in France was controversial at the time of its publication, but after his death, it was to become his best known and most influential work, and a manifesto for Conservative thinking.\\" Answer:","response":"Based on the given context, it can be inferred that the person who is not considered a great liberal among Edmund Burke, Thomas Babington Macaulay, and Francis Hirst would be Hirst. Edmund Burke, an Irish statesman and philosopher, was regarded by a number of 19th-century liberal thinkers, such as Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone and the Radical MP Richard Cobden, as a source of wisdom, particularly on matters concerning Ireland and America. Lord Acton even counted him as one of the three greatest liberals alongside Gladstone and Thomas Babington Macaulay. Burke's work, specifically his 'Reflections on the Revolution in France', was seen as a conservative manifesto and gained considerable influence after his death. Thomas Babington Macaulay, a British historian and Whig politician, is also counted among the greatest liberals by Lord Acton. Lord Macaulay himself was an admirer of Burke, referring to him as the \\"greatest man since Milton.\\" Macaulay's involvement in politics and his contributions as a historian made him an influential figure in 19th-century liberalism. Francis Hirst, however, was a Cobdenite Radical who did recognize the value of Burke's contributions, despite acknowledging that he was \\"the most conservative\\" of all reformers and libertarians. In Hirst's view, Burke was more focused on preserving and renovating existing systems, rather than embracing innovation or creating new ones. This indicates that, although Hirst appreciated some aspects of Burke's thinking, he did not fully align with the liberal values espoused by Burke, Macaulay, and others. In conclusion, the individual who is not considered a great liberal among Edmund Burke, Thomas Babington Macaulay, and Francis Hirst is Francis Hirst. While Hirst recognized some merits in Burke's works, his own stance as a radical, rather than a liberal, sets him apart from the other two figures, who enjoyed a significantly greater reputation and influence within the liberal movement."},{"question":"Q:I know that the answer to the question \\"What is provided at Eli Whitney's old factory now?\\" is in \\"The city struck fortune in the late 18th century with the inventions and industrial activity of Eli Whitney, a Yale graduate who remained in New Haven to develop the cotton gin and establish a gun-manufacturing factory in the northern part of the city near the Hamden town line.

The factory is now the Eli Whitney Museum, which has a particular emphasis on activities for children and exhibits pertaining to the A. C. Gilbert Company. His factory, along with that of Simeon North, and the lively clock-making and brass hardware sectors, contributed to making early Connecticut a powerful manufacturing economy; so many arms manufacturers sprang up that the state became known as \\"The Arsenal of America\\". It was in Whitney's gun-manufacturing plant that Samuel Colt invented the automatic revolver in 1836.

The New York police have 170 horses working in certain parts of the city. The horses are expensive to feed, but it is even more expensive to look after them. Because the horses must walk on the streets, they need special horseshoes. In fact , they need more than 8,000 of them each year. Every police horse in New York gets new shoes every month. Keeping these shoes in good repair is the job of six blacksmiths. There are only about thirty-five of these blacksmiths in the whole United States. The cost of shoing a horse is between twenty dollars and thirty-five dollars, and it takes a good blacksmith two or three hours to do the job. A blacksmith's job is not an easy one. He must be able to shape a shoe from a piece of metal and then fit it to the horse's foot. The blacksmith must bend over all the time when he is fitting the shoe and must hold the weight of the horse's leg while he works. Clearly, a blacksmith must be very storng. But even more important, he must be able to deal with horses---for before the blacksmith can begin his work, he has to get the horse to lift its leg. One of the blacksmiths in New York is James Corbin. He came to the country from Ireland in 1948. He not only makes horseshoes for the police but also works for a group of horse owners near the city.

Finally, she persuaded a little girl, only six years old, to take her dusky face out of the long flowing veil of the nun, and show how quickly she could read a sentence that Sister Winifred wrote on the blackboard. Then others were called on, and gave examples of their accomplishments in easy arithmetic and spelling. The children must have been very much bored with themselves that stormy Sunday, for they entered into the examination with a quite unnatural zest.

To do this, move all the y terms to one side of the equation. We have -391*y and 398*y on the right of the equation. Since they have the same variable, we can combine them. -28 = -391*y + 398*y Step 2: Add the y terms. -391*y and 398*y have different signs, so we'll find the difference between their coefficients and keep the sign of the larger. The difference between 391 and 398 is 7, and since 398 is larger, the combined term has a positive coefficient. -28 = 7*y Step 3: Solve for y.

Total shocker on \\"The Voice's\\" live quarterfinals Monday night, on which Teams Blake and Christina performed. And I'm not talking about when Christina Aguilera appeared without pants to sing \\"Fighter\\" with her team and a high school choir. The last time Jesse Campbell performed on \\"The Voice,\\" he was \\"the one to beat,\\" according to Adam Levine, who, alas, was not his coach. And the time before that he was the one who made us love him by stutter-singing the word \\"b-b-b-baby\\" with such style in the B-b-b-battle Rounds.This time, he was the one his coach, Aguilera, sent home. And I, for one, totally didn't see his insta-ouster coming. Campbell, who had overcome homelessness and had a lovely young daughter and a fluidly expressive voice, was one of my early favorites. Now – without the audience weighing in on his performance of \\"Halo,\\" a song picked by Aguilera that was not a good fit -- he's gone, and to quote Jordis Unga, who was also sent home in a flash, \\"I'm sad.\\"Actually, what Unga said was \\"I'm sad, but I understand,\\" because her coach, Blake Shelton, explained why he'd made the choice he'd made. It wasn't personal or even really much of a judgment call. Faced with making a decision he didn't want to and apparently hadn't expected to have to make, he decided to \\"revert to America's vote,\\" and send home the person he'd saved from elimination two weeks before. That was a rationale we could probably all understand. His team – sassy, boot-stompin' country girl RaeLynn; soulful belter Erin Willett; Alicia Keys' spotlight-worthy former backup singer Jermaine Paul; and vulnerable rocker Unga – had all given more or less top-notch performances Monday night, though Willett had unfortunately been saddled with an Adele song, \\"Set Fire to the Rain,\\" and no one really shines like Adele when singing Adele. \\"You had big shoes to fill,\\" Aguilera told her. But Willett did manage to use the song to highlight her own strengths. RaeLynn growled and shimmied winningly on \\"She’s Country,\\" which was a perfect song for her. Paul showed off his supple voice and commanding stage presence on \\"Against All Odds.\\" Shelton predicted Paul would look back on the performance as a turning point in his career. And Unga – in a glamorous, form-fitting white evening gown that showed off her impressive arm tats – got vulnerable and a little bit weepy with \\"A Little Bit Stronger.\\" So what was Shelton to do? Someone had to go, and for some reason, after he had let himself bond and become a big brother figure to these four starry-eyed hopefuls (their group performance of \\"Heartache Tonight\\" was like a bunch of old pals sitting around a campfire), it turned out that he, unexpectedly, it seems, had to decide who that person would be. \\"I didn't see this coming tonight,\\" he said of the judge eliminations at the outset of Monday's performance show. \\"This instant elimination thing has caught us all off tonight,\\" adding that if he knew \\"who to kick\\" he \\"would kick 'em.\\" I might kick the producers for the \\"instant elimination\\" idea. At this point in the competition, \\"Voice\\" voters feel like we should have a chance to weigh in with our favorites. We should be consulted. And this immediate response on the judges' part fails to factor in our preferences. Adam Levine, who with Maroon 5 and Wiz Khalifa debuted the song \\"Payphone\\" during the show, said at the outset he felt the judge-weighted elimination format was a \\"good\\" one. \\"Wouldn't you rather control it than everyone else?\\" he asked the other judges. \\"Maybe I'm just a control freak, but I think it's OK.\\" It was hard to read Levine's or the other judges' reactions when Aguilera's decided to eliminate Campbell, though they had responded more favorably to his performance Monday than Aguilera had herself. (\\"It really surprised me,\\" Green later he was \\"shocked\\" by both choices.) She complimented the emotion Campbell, who had seemed to struggle with pitch in parts, he'd brought to the Beyonce song. Later, she praised Paul's flexibility in a way that seemed, even at the time, possibly pointed, as did, particularly in retrospect, her contention that the other three of her contestants had shown \\"growth\\" over the weeks. Team Christina's fresh-faced Ashley De La Rosa, whom Aguilera had saved from elimination during the first live rounds and who was celebrating her 18th birthday, had moments both good and bad with \\"Foolish Games.\\" But she'd wept when Aguilera had sung to her during rehearsals, called Aguilera her idol and inspiration, and apparently reminded Aguilera of herself, which is likely the highest sort of Aguilera praise. Coffee-shop curiosity Lindsey Pavao, who sort of looks like Katy Perry, sang a Katy Perry song she had selected that Cee Lo Green said he hadn't ever heard before, \\"Part of Me,\\" and showed us a fiery part of her we may not have heard before. And classically trained opera singer Chris Mann was compelled by coach Aguilera to \\"branch out\\" of his \\"comfort zone\\" with Coldplay's \\"Viva La Vida.\\" \\"I have an excited nervousness,\\" he said, anticipating his risk-taking performance. \\"It's like I'm stripping onstage … a little bit naked, but I'm pretty excited about it.\\" Note perfect, it was nevertheless … odd. But ultimately Aguilera, who had been persuaded into a song switch by Pavao, felt it was Campbell, whom she had pressed into singing the song she had chosen, despite his expressed discomfort, felt it was Campbell who had to go.

By Tara Brady Rachel Burke, 28, was scheduled to spend three weeks in Nepal on the hiking holiday which had been branded as ¿high risk¿ A super fit Naval worker who died on an adventure trip through a notorious ‘Valley of Death’ in the Himalayas was so sick she was unable to tie her own shoelaces, an inquest heard today. Rachel Burke, 28, was scheduled to spend three weeks in Nepal on the hiking holiday which had been branded as ‘high risk’ by the UK based The Adventure Company. She flew into Kathmandu with two friends on 15 April, 2011 and began to travel on foot to base camp Mount Everest, Southwark Coroner’s Court was told. ‘I had a cough, I felt tired but","response":"nothing too serious,’ Rachel wrote in her diary during the early days of the trip. However, as the journey progressed, her condition began to rapidly deteriorate. The expedition would take the group through the Khumbu valley - a treacherous stretch of land known as the ‘Valley of Death’ due to the high number of fatalities recorded among hikers in the area. This nickname has been earned primarily due to the extreme altitude, harsh weather conditions, and challenging terrain. The inquest heard that Rachel had been quite fit and active, as part of her job at the Royal Navy involved regular physical training. It was clear that she did not expect the trouble she faced during the trek. As the group reached higher altitudes, Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS) became a real threat. AMS is a potentially fatal condition caused by the decrease in oxygen levels at high altitudes, leading to headaches, nausea, and exhaustion, among other symptoms. Despite her initial enthusiasm and determination, Rachel's condition continued to worsen. By the time the group reached Dingboche, a small village at an altitude of over 14,000 feet, Rachel was unable to tie her own shoelaces and had developed a severe cough. Concerns among the group grew as some noticed her lips had turned blue, an unmistakable sign of oxygen deprivation. The group's doctor, who was responsible for assessing the hiker's health, had given Rachel permission to continue with the trek. However, as her condition did not improve, they ultimately decided that she should be evacuated from the site. In her diary, Rachel expressed her frustration and disappointment, stating, ‘I cannot believe I am going home due to a cough.’ Unfortunately, Rachel's case had been much more severe than initially thought. On April 27, 2011, just twelve days after the start of the fateful expedition, Rachel Burke passed away due to High Altitude Pulmonary Edema (HAPE). HAPE is a severe form of AMS, which occurs when fluid accumulates within the lungs due to the increase in altitude. The condition often remains undiagnosed until it is too late, making it particularly dangerous for hikers. The Adventure Company, which organized the trek, was grilled about its procedures regarding the safety and assessment of its hikers at the inquest. The company emphasized their commitment to safety and highlighted their extensive briefing and training processes prior to the trip. However, this tragic incident has raised questions about how thoroughly the potential risks and dangers of such expeditions are assessed and communicated to participants. In hindsight, Rachel's untimely death serves as a stark reminder of the perils that can arise during adventure trips, especially in high-altitude environments. It also underscores the importance of proper health monitoring, early detection of AMS, and efficient emergency response systems in preventing such tragedies from occurring in the future. In conclusion, the inquest into Rachel Burke's death is a reminder to adventure seekers and organizers alike of the inherent risks involved in high-altitude treks and the crucial importance of effective measures to assess and manage these risks. Her passing highlights the responsibility that organizers have in ensuring participants' safety, as well as the need for individuals to be candid about their health and promptly report any signs of illness during such excursions."},{"question":"Title: SIGH...

Born in Jamaica, she moved when she was 13, along with her siblings, to live with her parents in Syracuse, New York. Jones began her modelling career in New York state, then in Paris, working for fashion houses such as Yves St. Laurent and Kenzo, and appearing on the covers of Elle and Vogue. She worked with photographers such as Jean-Paul Goude, Helmut Newton, Guy Bourdin, and Hans Feurer, and became known for her distinctive androgynous appearance and bold features. Jones was signed by Island Records, who put her in the studio with disco record producer, Tom Moulton. Moulton worked at Sigma Sound Studios in Philadelphia, and Portfolio, was released in 1977. The album featured three songs from Broadway musicals, \\"Send in the Clowns\\" by Stephen Sondheim from A Little Night Music, \\"What I Did for Love\\" from A Chorus Line and \\"Tomorrow\\" from Annie. The second side of the album opens up with a seven-minute reinterpretation of Edith Piaf's \\"La Vie en rose\\" followed by three new recordings, two of which were co-written by Jones, \\"Sorry\\", and \\"That's the Trouble\\". The album finished with \\"I Need a Man\\", Jones' first club hit. The artwork to the album was designed by Richard Bernstein, an artist for Interview. In 1978, Jones and Moulton made Fame, an immediate follow-up to Portfolio, also recorded at Sigma Sound Studios. The album featured another reinterpretation of a French classic, \\"Autumn Leaves\\" by Jacques Prevert. The Canadian edition of the vinyl album included another French language track, \\"Comme un oiseau qui s'envole\\", which replaced \\"All on a Summers Night\\"; in most locations this song served as the B-side of the single \\"Do or Die\\". In the North American club scene, Fame was a hit album and the \\"Do or Die\\"/\\"Pride\\"/\\"Fame\\" side reached top 10 on both the US Hot Dance Club Play and Canadian Dance/Urban charts. The album was released on compact disc in the early 1990s, but soon went out of print. In 2011, it was released and remastered by Gold Legion, a record company that specialises in reissuing classic disco albums on CD. Jones' live shows were highly sexualized and flamboyant, leading her to be called \\"Queen of the Gay Discos.\\" Muse was the last of Jones' disco albums. The album features a re-recorded version \\"I'll Find My Way to You\\", which Jones released three years prior to Muse. Originally appearing in the 1976 Italian film, Colt 38 Special Squad in which Jones had a role as a club singer, Jones also recorded a song called \\"Again and Again\\" that was featured in the film. Both songs were produced by composer Stelvio Cipriani. Icelandic keyboardist Thor Baldursson arranged most of the album and also sang duet with Jones on the track \\"Suffer\\". Like the last two albums, the cover art is by Richard Bernstein. Like Fame, Muse was later released by Gold Legion.

This surprise appearance amid crowds in Moscow honouring ordinary people who served in World War Two seems to be part of a change of image for the Russian president - portraying him more as a down-to-Earth man of the people, rather than the all-action hero TV viewers have become used to seeing. For over 30 seconds, TV commentators made no reference to his surprise appearance. But then anchor Vladimir Solovyev supplied the meaning of what was undoubtedly a carefully choreographed media event. \\"There were no loud announcements and no commotion. Why?\\" said Mr Solovyev. \\"Because this is an amazing event at which politics moves into the background. It is a day when all are equal.\\" Brand Putin still in fashion In pictures: Russian WW2 Victory Day Not everything went completely smoothly. As the president paused for a short interview surrounded by his security entourage, an old man button-holed him to ask about the benefits he was due as someone affected by the 1986 nuclear disaster in Chernobyl. The cameras quickly moved away. But Solovyev continued in the same lyrical vein. \\"Victory Day - everyone is equal. People just come up to the president of the Russian Federation and talk to him.\\" The message of the people's president was reinforced in other parts of the media. \\"Putin acted like an ordinary man,\\" proclaimed a headline on the popular news website Gazeta.ru. Commentator Aleksey Malashenko described it as a political masterstroke. \\"I would not be surprised if at that moment the president's rating had reached 100%. Yes, it was populism, but sincere populism,\\" he blogged on the Ekho Moskvy radio station website. Putin as man of the people was also one of the key themes of Prezident, a 150-minute film recently shown on official channel Rossiya 1 to mark the 15th anniversary of the beginning of his rule in 2000. The film dwelt on the Russian leader's humble origins and his attachment to his late parents. \\"He comes from a working family in the suburbs, just like millions of others, millions of his compatriots, same as me, same as you,\\" popular singer Nikolay Rastorguyev said over footage of Putin discussing people's problems in the street. In the film, President Putin himself stressed that he was not from an \\"elite background\\". \\"This connection with the people and sense of closeness to them, to ordinary people, are hugely important and a great help to me in my work,\\" he said. Prezident also featured an episode from 2006 in which Putin visited a coffee shop in Dresden and stood in the corner with his coffee and cake, apparently unnoticed by other customers. The sequence was shown without commentary as if its only purpose was to reinforce the idea of Putin as the \\"ordinary man\\". This portrayal of Putin is in marked contrast to the image of the derring-do hero of the TV stunts for which he has become famous - the bare-chested hunting expeditions, the dive for Greek wine vats in the Black Sea and saving journalists by shooting a Siberian tiger with a tranquilizer, to name but a few. But it has been some time since Russian TV viewers were treated to Putin in full-blown action-man mode and is a far cry from the image given by a film aired three years ago to mark his 60th birthday. That NTV film showed the president working late at night, alone in his office, breakfasting on health foods and swimming and exercising in his private gym, watched over by his beloved black labrador Koni. Media academic Anna Kachkayeva believes it portrayed a person who \\"for a long time has been living in the special dimension of power and has, of course, lost touch with reality\\". The wish to show President Putin as an \\"ordinary man\\" may be related to the political imperatives of Russia's current economic difficulties. But there may also be a more personal element. At the end of \\"Prezident\\", Vladimir Solovyev asks Mr Putin what he has had to give up as leader of his country. The president sighs deeply, frowns and answers: \\"A normal, everyday life.\\" One journalist, Oleg Kashin, suggested the film may have been less about propaganda than psychotherapy. BBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world. You can follow BBC Monitoring on Twitter and Facebook.","response":"During a surprise appearance in Moscow, where President Vladimir Putin participated in a ceremony that honored ordinary people who served in WWII, his image was portrayed more as a down-to-Earth man of the people, rather than the all-action hero that television viewers have become accustomed to seeing. The media played a significant role in helping highlight Putin's humble roots and connections with the common people. This recent trend in portraying Putin's image contrasts with the past, where he was famously known for his daring adventures, such as bare-chested hunting expeditions, diving for Greek wine vats in the Black Sea, and saving journalists by shooting a Siberian tiger with a tranquilizer. The shift in portrayal appears to be a calculated move to make Putin appear more relatable and sympathetic in light of Russia's current economic difficulties."},{"question":"Translate to French: • radiation-emitting devices","response":"To translate \\"radiation-emitting devices\\" to French, I will follow these steps: 1.

A:","response":"Ireland's journey to becoming a republic has a complex history that can be traced back to various events, leading up to the official declaration of the Republic of Ireland in 1949. The roots of the Irish republican movement date back to the late 18th century when organizations such as the Society of United Irishmen sought to break free from British rule. However, the decisive moment began with the 1916 Easter Rising, a week-long rebellion against British occupation. Although the uprising was suppressed in just a few days, it played a pivotal role in igniting the Irish War of Independence (1919-1921). Following the war, the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921 led to the formation of the Irish Free State, a 26-county dominion within the British Commonwealth that exercised its powers between 1922 and 1937. This arrangement, however, did not satisfy the demands of Irish republicans, as the Free State still maintained some allegiance to the British Crown. Subsequently, in 1937, the new constitution, known as Bunreacht na hÉireann, introduced the term \\"Éire\\" and redefined the state's internal and external relations. Although it did not explicitly declare Ireland as a republic, it removed most links to the British monarchy, increasing its political autonomy. Finally, on April 18, 1949, the Republic of Ireland Act of 1948 came into effect, and Ireland was officially declared a republic, cutting all remaining ties with the British monarchy. This marked the formal end of Ireland's status as a British dominion and laid the foundation for its present-day status as a sovereign, democratic republic. As for your suggested sentence, it is worth noting that the implications of the Republic of Ireland's entry into the European Economic Community (EEC) in 1973 are unrelated to the declaration of the republic in 1949. The entry into the EEC was indeed an expansion and further integration of Ireland into the European economy and political landscape. However, it would not be considered a direct continuation of the process of becoming a republic that occurred several decades earlier. Instead, Ireland's EEC membership might be better framed as a milestone in its economic and political development post-republic status."},{"question":"Write a \\"b.\\" movie review (Available choices: a. negative b. positive).","response":"Title: \\"Invasion of the Cosmic Avocados\\" Review: A Breathtaking Journey Through Space and Absurdity B-movies have a long-standing tradition of campiness, hyperbolized drama, and borderline ridiculous storylines. Among the pantheon of these cult classics, few stand out as genuinely extraordinary – but the largely overlooked \\"Invasion of the Cosmic Avocados\\" is one exception. \\"Invasion of the Cosmic Avocados\\" is a delightful interstellar romp that pays homage to the golden age of cheesy science fiction. It explores an improbable universe where gigantic avocados from space threaten to destroy planet Earth, and a group of quirky, misfit heroes must band together to fend off the extraterrestrial menace. The film opens with stunning shots of outer space, boasting surprisingly impressive special effects that instantly capture the viewer's attention. The looming celestial bodies, coupled with the intoxicating synthesized score, paints a vivid and otherworldly picture that sets the stage for the adventure to come. As the malicious avocados descend from the heavens, the audience can't help but be drawn into the absurd but endearing narrative. Our heroes, united by fate and their shared love of intergalactic danger, represent a colorful cast of characters that bring life and levity to the film. The group is led by the fearless Captain Max Rocketman (played with great charisma by Jack McFlash), a square-jawed hero with delusions of grandeur as large as his actual heroics. Accidentally roping in the brilliant but bumbling scientist, Dr. Melvin Theorist (played with delightful neurotic energy by Buddy Crimson), Captain Rocketman's plan to thwart the cosmic invasion quickly spirals into a wild and unpredictable farce. Rounding out the eclectic crew, we have Max's long-suffering yet capable girlfriend, Sally Teaspoon (played by the charming Mandy Mystery) and a wisecracking extraterrestrial pilot, Zippo XJ-3 (voiced by the talented Norman Nerve, whose hilarious quips and one-liners provide ample comic relief). Together, this team of unlikely heroes embarks on a journey filled with unexpected challenges, twists, and turns. While the overall plot can certainly be described as ludicrous – enormous space avocados bent on world domination is certainly no everyday fare – it is the unapologetic embrace of this silliness that makes \\"Invasion of the Cosmic Avocados\\" so utterly enjoyable. The sheer dedication of the cast and crew to fully exploring this bizarre premise is nothing short of inspiring. The cinematography, which seamlessly blends practical effects with CGI, allows the movie to maintain a visual flair that is as captivating as it is campy. Meanwhile, the witty and well-paced script keeps the action flowing, and the tongue-in-cheek humor ensures that no opportunity for comedic excess is missed. The climax of \\"Invasion of the Cosmic Avocados\\" is a satisfying and exhilarating spectacle that perfectly encapsulates what makes the B-movie subgenre so endearing to fans: earnest performances, absurd storylines, and an unwavering commitment to reveling in the strange and imaginative. In conclusion, \\"Invasion of the Cosmic Avocados\\" is a delightful and entertaining gem of B-movie cinema. Embracing its absurd premise with gusto and unabashed enthusiasm, the film serves up a unique, engaging, and adventurous experience that begs to be watched with a group of friends and a hearty sense of humor. While it may not conform to the standards of traditional filmmaking, \\"Invasion of the Cosmic Avocados\\" is an undeniably joyous experience that harks back to a time when imagination knew no bounds. Highly recommended for those who enjoy the peculiar, the outlandish, and the wonderfully campy."},{"question":"Final verdict expected Friday: Humans caused global warming A file photo presents a view of a coal-burning power plant during daybreak in Xiangfan, central China's Hubei province. Human activity such as burning fossil fuels is causing the climate to change, a major report is expected to say Friday. An international panel of scientists is expected to issue a report Friday that dismisses nearly every doubt that human activity has caused temperatures to warm, glaciers to melt, and seas to bulge since the middle of last century. If greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise precipitously, the report will warn, there will be catastrophic consequences. Whether these strong words will be met with meaningful response is another matter. The scientists with the Nobel Prize-winning Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have been working behind closed doors in Stockholm, Sweden, this week to hammer out the exact wording of the report, though experts anticipate little departure from the main messages contained in a draft that was leaked to the media in August. The report is a synthesis of climate research written by more than 800 scientists. It is expected to say a human influence on the global climate is \\"extremely likely,\\" language that corresponds to odds of 95 percent. That's up from the \\"very likely\\" language used in the 2007 assessment, which corresponds to 90 percent odds. This is the fifth assessment from the group, issued about once every five years. The degree of confidence that human activity is the main driver of the changing climate has risen with each report. \\"Another five years of observation and further research just strengthens the conclusion\\" that human activity is causing the climate to change, John Reilly, the co-director of the MIT Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change in Cambridge, Mass., told NBC News. None of this, he added, will come as a surprise. Nevertheless, the report is coming out in a different climate context than six years ago, noted Alden Meyer, director of strategy and policy for the Union of Concerned Scientists in Washington, D.C. In the U.S., he noted, more people are linking climate change to extreme weather events such as last year's Hurricane Sandy and the recent flooding in Boulder, Colo., which puts the issue \\"on a more visceral level,\\" he told NBC News. What to expectOther anticipated highlights from the report include a projection that sea levels could rise nearly three feet by the end of the century if greenhouse gas emissions remain unchecked, which would pose significant adaptation challenges for some of the world's major cities, including New York, New Orleans, Miami, London and Shanghai. Joe Raedle / Getty Images In this file photo from July, the village of Ilulissat, Greenland, is seen near the icebergs that broke off from the Jakobshavn Glacier. As the sea levels around the globe rise, researchers affiliated with the National Science Foundation and other organizations are studying the phenomena of the melting glaciers and its long-term ramifications. That's an aggressive upward revision of the 2007 assessment, which put the sea level rise between 7 and 23 inches by the end of the century. Several scientists criticized that previous projection as too conservative given the pace of melting in Greenland and other parts of the globe. Another widely anticipated change to the report reflects increased uncertainty on how much the Earth's surface will warm if concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere double. Five years ago, the climate panel put the best guess range between 3.2 and 7.1 degrees Fahrenheit. The leaked draft suggested that the final figures this time around could represent a much wider range: a lower possible low, a higher possible high. This possible downward revision in the rise of Earth's surface temperature, along with what's termed a \\"hiatus\\" in surface warming since the unusually strong El Nino year of 1998, have been pounced upon as reason to doubt the alarm over global climate change. The climate panel is expected to dismiss these claims, explaining the slow-down in surface warming as a blip in the long-term warming trend. \\"The hiatus is a denier-manufactured diversion,\\" Kevin Trenberth, a climate scientist with the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., told NBC News via email. \\"The 2000s are the warmest decade on record by far,\\" he explained, adding that, though the temperature readings are accurate, their use as evidence against global warming amounts to nothing more than an accounting trick: \\"By choosing a start year, it appears that the recent years are not increasing quite as fast as earlier ones after 1970, in terms of global mean surface temperature.\\" The most compelling explanation for the so-called hiatus, in fact, is that the oceans have been warming at a faster clip over the past 15 years, according to MIT's Reilly. \\"Greenhouse gases are still trapping heat but instead of staying in the atmosphere\\" — where it would be measured in a rise in surface temperature — \\"it has been mixed into the ocean,\\" he explained. \\"The hiatus, if anything, may just fool us because while the ocean is taking up more heat this past decade sometime in the future it may take up relatively less heat, and then we'll see the atmosphere warming just that much more,\\" Reilly said. Though there has been speculation that the temperature adjustments and discussion of hiatus show that the panel is getting more conservative in its approach, in order to convince a skeptical world of the issue, Meyer dismisses that as nonsense. \\"It has always been conservative,\\" he said, explaining that the summary document most people will read is subjected to a line-by-line approval by everyone in the room. This time around, the panel certainly has given the process more rigor, however, in order to avoid errors such as a high-profile gaffe in the 2007 report suggesting that the Himalayan glaciers would melt by the year 2035. \\"But I think to say that before this time around they were wild-eyed and radical would be totally wrong. They've always been cautious and conservative,\\" Meyer said. Muted policy responseFriday's report — as well as subsequent assessments on expected climate impacts and how to manage climate change that are slated for release next year — may help inform ongoing negotiations for an agreement to combat global climate change to be adopted at a summit in Paris in late 2015, Meyer noted. U.S. President Barack Obama pauses and wipes his forehead as he speaks about his vision to reduce carbon pollution while preparing the country for the impacts of climate change, at Georgetown University in Washington, June 25, 2013. Trenberth is less optimistic that the report from the climate panel will carry much weight in altering policy, at least in the U.S. \\"The administration is already well informed,\\" he noted. \\"The Congress is the problem and the deniers are not open to evidence or rational discussion.\\" Another reason the report is unlikely to sway policy is \\"simply because it summarizes already published literature which is already well known,\\" Roger Pielke, Jr., a climate policy analyst and professor of environmental studies at the Center for Science and Technology Policy Research at the University of Colorado at Boulder, told NBC News in an email. The panel \\"could, however, get itself into trouble if it gets too much into advocacy mode, as it has tended to do in the past,\\" Pielke added. \\"(It) should serve up its assessment straight up and leave the spin to others.\\" And what do these \\"others\\" — independent voices in the science community — want to see from the panel? For starters, instead of continuing to blame humans for climate change, it should shift its focus, and provide guidance on how society can respond to the inevitable changes of the coming decades. \\"The climate is changing underneath our feet and over our heads,\\" noted Reilly. \\"We really need to move on and say 'How are we going to adapt?'\\" John Roach is a contributing writer for NBC News.

This article aims to provide a comprehensive explanation of the chronological order of events surrounding the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) and the attacks on September 11, 2001. By examining these events that shaped modern international relations and policies, readers will receive a clear understanding of which event preceded the other. The Attacks on September 11, 2001 On the fateful morning of September 11, 2001, the United States experienced unprecedented terror attacks, as a series of four coordinated suicide strikes targeted significant landmarks across the nation. This deadly act of terrorism was orchestrated by the Islamist extremist group Al-Qaeda, under the leadership of Osama bin Laden. The attacks began with the hijacking of four passenger airlines: American Airlines Flight 11, United Airlines Flight 175, American Airlines Flight 77, and United Airlines Flight 93. At precisely 8:46 AM (EDT), American Airlines Flight 11 crashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center in New York City. Shortly after, at 9:03 AM, United Airlines Flight 175 flew into the South Tower, creating a massive explosion upon impact. The ensuing destruction and eventual collapse of the two towers resulted in the tragic loss of nearly 3,000 lives. Simultaneously, American Airlines Flight 77 was flown into the Pentagon, causing significant damage and claiming the lives of 189 people. The last hijacked plane, United Airlines Flight 93, targeted Washington, D.C.; however, the heroic efforts of passengers on board led to the plane crashing into a field in Pennsylvania, preventing further devastation. The aftermath of the September 11 attacks had profound implications for the United States, as it marked the beginning of the War on Terror, a comprehensive response to terrorism globally. Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) The Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) is a joint resolution passed by the United States Congress on September 14, 2001, and signed into law by President George W. Bush on September 18, 2001. The AUMF granted the President the authority to use all necessary and appropriate force against those determined to have planned, authorized, committed, or aided the September 11th attacks on the United States, or harbored such organizations or persons. The AUMF has been the legal foundation for military actions against terrorist groups involved in the 9/11 attacks, as well as their affiliates. Notably, the AUMF has provided the authorization for the invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, resulting in the toppling of the Taliban regime and the beginning of the long-term conflict in the country. Furthermore, the AUMF has often been cited as the legal basis for drone strikes, surveillance programs, and prolonged detention of enemy combatants in locations such as Guantanamo Bay. Critics argue that the vagueness and lack of expiration date for the AUMF have led to an overreach of executive power and a persistent state of global conflict. Conclusion In conclusion, it is evident that the attacks on September 11, 2001, occurred first, followed by the enactment of the Authorization for Use of Military Force. The attacks, which resulted in the tragic loss of thousands of lives and caused significant destruction across the United States, marked a turning point in the country's political and military landscape. The AUMF was enacted as a direct response to the attacks, granting the President the power to wage a war against terrorism and pursue justice for the victims. The post-9/11 period has been characterized by the expansion of military activities under the AUMF, leaving a lasting impact on international relations and security policies."},{"question":"Do these questions have the same meaning? What can we learn from German education system? What's the difference between the French and German education system?","response":"These two questions have different meanings. Let me break down each question to explain their individual meanings: 1. \\"What can we learn from the German education system?\\" This question seeks to understand the positive aspects, strengths, or unique features of the German education system that could potentially be helpful or enlightening for other countries or individuals. Here, the emphasis is on learning from the German education system and identifying the specific elements that contribute to its success or effectiveness. 2. \\"What's the difference between the French and German education system?\\" This question asks for a comparison between the French and German education systems. The focus is on identifying the similarities and differences in the way both countries structure their education systems, such as curriculum, teaching methods, and organization. Instead of emphasizing learning from one specific system (as in the previous question), this question aims to draw distinctions and better understand how each system works individually. In conclusion, the first question focuses on learning from the German education system, while the second question draws comparisons between the French and German education systems. Thus, these questions do not have the same meaning."},{"question":"Give the step-by-step reasoning process and then the final answer. A 20 person classroom is filled with 40% girls. If 5 new boys join the classroom, what is the new percentage of girls in the class?","response":"Step 1: Find the number of girls in the initial 20-person classroom. - You know the classroom has 40% girls, so to find the number of girls, multiply the total number of students (20) by the percentage of girls (40%). Number of girls = (20 students) x (40%) Number of girls = 20 x 0.4 Number of girls = 8 The initial classroom has 8 girls. Step 2: Find the number of boys in the initial 20-person classroom. - You know there are 20 people in total and 8 of them are girls, so you can subtract the number of girls from the total number of students to find the number of boys. Number of boys = (Total number of students) - (Number of girls) Number of boys = 20 - 8 Number of boys = 12 The initial classroom has 12 boys. Step 3: Add the 5 new boys to the classroom. - You know there are 12 boys in the initial classroom, and 5 new boys are joining. So, to find the new total number of boys, add the initial number of boys with the 5 new boys. New number of boys = (Initial number of boys) + (5 new boys) New number of boys = 12 + 5 New number of boys = 17 There are now 17 boys in the classroom. Step 4: Calculate the new total number of students in the classroom. - You know there are 8 girls and 17 boys in the classroom now. So, to find the new total number of students, add the number of girls and the number of boys together. New total number of students = (Number of girls) + (New number of boys) New total number of students = 8 + 17 New total number of students = 25 There are now 25 students in the classroom. Step 5: Calculate the new percentage of girls in the classroom. - You know there are 8 girls and 25 students in total. To find the new percentage of girls, divide the number of girls by the total number of students and then multiply by 100%. New percentage of girls = (Number of girls / New total number of students) x 100% New percentage of girls = (8 / 25) x 100% New percentage of girls = 0.32 x 100% New percentage of girls = 32% The new percentage of girls in the class is 32%."},{"question":"Generate a question that has the following answer: Island in Fiji for the following movie plot: This film is the story of a group of unruly teenagers whose parents send them to a rehabilitation boot camp to turn them around.

The term originated in the 19th century but is often applied to music that is older than that. Some types of folk music are also called world music. \\"Traditional folk music\\" has been defined in several ways: as music transmitted orally, music with unknown composers, or music performed by custom over a long period of time. It has been contrasted with commercial and classical styles. - The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) is a British public service broadcaster. It is headquartered at Broadcasting House in London, is the world's oldest national broadcasting organisation, and is the largest broadcaster in the world by number of employees, with over 20,950 staff in total, of whom 16,672 are in public sector broadcasting; including part-time, flexible as well as fixed contract staff, the total number is 35,402. - Progressive rock (shortened as \\"prog\\"; sometimes \\"art rock\\", \\"classical rock\\" or \\"symphonic rock\\") is a broad subgenre of rock music that developed in the United Kingdom and United States throughout the mid to late 1960s. Initially termed \\"progressive pop\\", the style was an outgrowth of psychedelic bands who abandoned standard pop traditions in favour of instrumentation and compositional techniques more frequently associated with jazz, folk or classical music. Additional elements contributed to its \\"progressive\\" label: lyrics were more poetic, technology was harnessed for new sounds, music approached the condition of \\"art\\", and the studio, rather than the stage, became the focus of musical activity, which often involved creating music for listening, not dancing. - The V Shows is a live album/DVD recorded at the London Astoria by rock band Mostly Autumn. It was recorded on the tour supporting their 2003 release \\"Passengers\\". The DVD for this show was also included in their 2005 DVD release \\"Pink Floyd Revisited\\".

They achieved international acclaim with their progressive and psychedelic music.

It is typified by a heavy use of aggressive vocals, distorted electric guitars, bass guitar, drums, and often accompanied with pianos and keyboards. - Psychedelic music (sometimes psychedelia) covers a range of popular music styles and genres influenced by the 1960s psychedelic culture, a subculture of people who used psychedelic drugs such as LSD, psilocybin mushrooms, mescaline and DMT to experience visual and auditory hallucinations, synesthesia and altered states of consciousness. Psychedelic music attempted to replicate the hallucinogenic experience of using these drugs or enhance the experience of using them. Psychedelic music emerged during the mid-1960s among folk rock and blues rock bands in the United States and Britain. - The London Astoria was a music venue, located at 157 Charing Cross Road, in London, England. It had been leased and run by Festival Republic since 2000. It was closed on 15 January 2009 and has since been demolished.

The ozone layer is responsible for absorbing harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun, particularly UV-B rays, which can cause skin cancer, cataracts, and damage to the environment, such as reduced crop yield and aquatic life. From the given options, the most accurate answer in terms of when radiation levels are highest due to ozone depletion is (A) middle of the day. This is because the intensity of UV radiation at the Earth's surface is primarily determined by the altitude of the sun. During midday, the sun is at its highest point in the sky, and its rays pass through the least amount of atmosphere to reach the Earth's surface. As a result, the UV radiation is most concentrated at this time. Options (B) through (H) are not directly related to ozone depletion and radiation levels. While factors like deforestation, temperature change, and plant growth can have indirect effects on the ozone layer or climate system, they don't directly result in higher radiation levels. Furthermore, early morning, late evening, and middle of the night are times of day when the sun is lower in the sky or absent, meaning less UV radiation reaches the Earth's surface during those periods."},{"question":"Read this and answer the question.

The tax firm helps people who have disputes with the IRS. It spends some 9 million a year on radio advertising, according to ratings firm Nielsen, and its website carries endorsement from conservative talk radio personalities Glenn Beck, Sean Hannity, as well as Limbaugh himself. \\"You don't need to fight this fight alone,\\" Limbaugh is quoted as saying on the Tax Resolution site. His endorsement was still up on Tax Resolution's site on Monday afternoon. CEO Michael Rozbruch said the statement about dropping Limbaugh was easily issued _ but changing the website will require a meeting later in the week. Limbaugh apologized over the weekend for his comments about Georgetown law student Sandra Fluke after she testified to congressional Democrats that her Jesuit college's health plan should cover her birth control. KPUA, an AM station in Hilo, Hawaii, said it is dropping Limbaugh's show immediately. The statement by station owner New West said the Limbaugh incident \\"crossed a line of decency\\" and didn't live up to the station's standards. \\"We are strong believers in the First Amendment and have recognized Mr. Limbaugh's right to express opinions that often times differ from our own, but it has never been our goal to allow our station to be used for personal attacks and intolerance,\\" station owner New West said. Limbaugh joked on Monday that he got a busy signal when he called his show because of the advertisers who are abandoning it. Clear Channel's Premiere Radio Networks Inc. hosts Limbaugh's show. His on-air contract runs through 2016. Premiere Radio said in a statement Monday that it respects Limbaugh's right to express his opinions. It said that, \\"in an attempt at absurdist humor to illustrate his political point, Mr. Limbaugh used words that unfortunately distracted from the message he was trying to convey.\\" The company said Limbaugh did the right thing by \\"expressing regret for his choice of words and offering his sincere and heartfelt apology to Ms. Fluke.\\" Fluke said Monday that Limbaugh's apology changes nothing and that Americans have to decide whether to support companies that continue to advertise on his program. The advertisers that have backed away from Limbaugh's program represent a broad range of industries, from technology to financial services to retailers. AOL, an Internet portal that runs the TechCrunch blog and the Huffington Post, said Monday that Limbaugh's comments \\"are not in line with our values.\\" Other companies that say they have left the show include flower delivery service ProFlowers, mortgage lender Quicken Loans, the maker of Sleep Number beds, mattress retailer Sleep Train, software maker Citrix Systems Inc., online data backup service provider Carbonite and online legal document services company LegalZoom. Allstate Corp. said it bought ads on Limbaugh's show by accident. The insurer at first told people who asked on Monday that it didn't buy ads on Limbaugh's show. But it said on Facebook that it learned during the day that its ads actually were running with the program. It said an advertising vendor had bought the ads in error and its advertising strategy never included ads on Limbaugh's show. Allstate said on Facebook that it regretted \\"providing mistaken information\\" about its ads and has asked the media buying firm to stop advertising on Limbaugh's show \\"in keeping with our original advertising plans and strategies.\\" Clear Channel Media and Entertainment operates more than 850 radio stations in the U.S., and Premiere says it's the largest radio content provider in the country, syndicating programs to more than 5,000 affiliate stations. Clear Channel has declined to say how much revenue it stands to lose from advertiser defections. Its parent company was taken private in 2008. ___ Freed reported from Minneapolis.

No more districts have been taken over since then, but there are currently three under state leadership: Lawrence, Holyoke and the most recent, Southbridge, a town of about 16,000 people in the central part of the state, on the border with Connecticut. ||||| Following the nationwide uproar over Rush Limbaugh‘s controversial comments about Georgetown University law student Sandra Fluke, Hilo, Hawaii’s KPUA-AM 670 has decided to drop his program. “It may be the first radio station nationally to cancel airings of the program,” the Honolulu Star-Advertiser’s Erika Engle reports. “Regardless of the political views being discussed, New West Broadcasting Corp. President and General Manger Chris Leonard felt the initially degrading comments about Georgetown University student Sandra Fluke, and the escalating comments that followed, were ‘egregious,’ and that ‘decency and responsibility’ dictated the show’s cancellation.” “I spent a good part of the weekend deliberating this issue,” Leonard said. “Had this been one of my disc jockeys that had made this comment, they would have been terminated.” Leonard explained further why he felt the show had to be taken off the air: “We have always encouraged spirited discussion about national and local issues on KPUA and from time to time those discussions may be deemed by some to be objectionable. We are strong believers in the first amendment and have recognized Mr. Limbaugh’s right to express opinions that often times differ from our own, but it has never been our goal to allow our station to be used for personal attacks and intolerance. The most recent incident has crossed a line of decency and a standard that we expect of programming on KPUA whether it is locally produced or a syndicated program like the Rush Limbaugh show. While much of the national debate regarding this issue is now being framed in political terms, the decision for us is one of decency and responsibility. Regardless of one’s political views on the issue being discussed, we feel the delivery was degrading and the continued comments over several days to be egregious. As a result, we are discontinuing the Rush Limbaugh program on KPUA effective immediately.” UPDATE: Another radio station in Pittsfield, Massachusetts– WBEC– also says it is dropping the Rush Limbaugh show. WBEC’s General Manager Peter Barry says his station hadn’t yet lost any advertisers as a result of Rush’s comments, and no more than a handful of callers had voiced complaints. But he says over the years he and station staff have grown increasingly uncomfortable with Limbaugh’s rhetoric. “The nature of Rush’s programming has always presented challenges for us and he’s always pushed the envelope. But this time he’s taken it too far.” (h/t HSA) Editor’s note: This post has been edited since its original posting – Jon Nicosia ||||| By Erika Engle and Associated Press The nationally syndicated Rush Limbaugh radio show has been pulled from Hilo radio station KPUA-AM 670 in the aftermath of his offensive remarks about a woman who spoke in favor of health plan coverage for contraception.

Options: A. accomplishment B. injuries C. enemies D. rivalry E. death Answer:","response":"A. Accomplishment People compete in sports primarily for a sense of accomplishment and numerous other reasons that offer both physical and psychological benefits. Sports offer a platform for individuals to challenge themselves, improve their skills, and showcase their talents. Participation in sports provides opportunities for personal growth, building character, and developing social skills. Here is an in-depth analysis of why people compete in sports: 1. Personal achievement: Sports enable people to set goals, work hard, and achieve their objectives. The feeling of accomplishment that comes with breaking one's own records or surpassing rivals can be highly gratifying and fulfilling. 2. Physical fitness: Engaging in sports promotes physical fitness and overall health. The rigorous training and conditioning regimens help to develop strength, flexibility, and stamina. Consequently, people who compete in sports tend to have improved cardiovascular and immune systems, reduced body fat, and increased muscle mass. 3. Stress relief: The physical exertion and mental focus required during sports competition can help relieve stress and serve as an emotional outlet. Engaging in sports helps clear one's mind, release tension, and reduce anxiety. As a result, people who participate in sports often experience overall improvements in their mental health. 4. Skill development: Sports encourage the development of physical techniques and strategic thinking, making people more proficient in their chosen disciplines. Athletes gain self-confidence from successfully executing difficult moves or overcoming challenges, which can translate into success in other areas of life. 5. Social connections: Sports provide endless opportunities for people to build relationships and establish social networks. Team sports encourage camaraderie, friendship, and a sense of community among participants, as they work together towards a common goal. Even individual sports offer a platform for connections, as rivals can forge friendships through mutual respect and admiration. 6. Discipline and time-management: Sports demand regular training, focus, and commitment. Over time, these requirements help athletes build self-discipline, organization, and time-management skills. These traits not only contribute to athletes' success in sports but also benefit them in other aspects of life, such as school or work. 7. Recognition and rewards: Successful athletes often receive recognition and accolades, which can boost their self-esteem and standing among their peers. Additionally, many sports offer valuable prizes for top performers, which can motivate athletes to strive for excellence. 8. Academic and career prospects: Many colleges and universities scout promising athletes and provide scholarships for those who excel in sports. These opportunities can pave the way for successful academic pursuits and future careers, in and outside of the field of athletics. In conclusion, people compete in sports to achieve a sense of accomplishment, improve their physical and mental health, develop skills, and cultivate social connections. Sports foster discipline, teamwork, and focus, providing an avenue for personal growth and opportunities that extend beyond the playing field. Consequently, the desire to compete in sports is not only fueled by the innate drive to excel but also by the plethora of benefits athletes garner in their personal, social, and professional lives."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Information: - A short film is any film not long enough to be considered a feature film.

I don't know if there have been different releases and updates, but the disks we rented had a 2000 copyright on them, if that means anything. Anyway, the sound mixing on these DVD's was absolutely horrible. The levels often yo-yo-ed up and down; when the scene cut to a battlefield panorama, the orchestral track would thunder so loudly that I didn't know which would blow out first -- my eardrums or my speakers. When it was time for dialog, the volume would usually drop to something barely audible. Occasionally, the orchestra and Foley-work would stay loud while the dialog was superimposed at a much lesser level. My wife and I found that the only way we could watch this movie at all from these DVD's was if one of us kept a hand on the remote to continuously modulate the volume. And, like another user has already commented, when we selected English audio the dialog kept switching back and forth between Russian and English; and occasionally when the characters spoke in French on the native track the dubbing was in Russian, so you're SOL if you understand neither. Ultimately, we gave up watching after the first disk. Before you fork out 50+ for this movie on DVD for your own library, I'd heartily recommend getting your hands on a rental copy to see whether you can really enjoy this epic flick when burdened by such bad sound, particularly if you've never read the book and really want to understand the storyline.

That's the DNA report my sister got from Ancestry.com. Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","response":"No, these two questions are not paraphrases of each other, as they focus on different subjects. The first question revolves around the \\"European Jewish\\" component of your sister's DNA results on AncestryDNA.com, while the second question inquires about the possibility of having zero Native American blood if your great grandfather was full Cherokee. To address the first question, the \\"European Jewish\\" component found in your sister's DNA results on AncestryDNA.com refers to the genetic lineage tied to Jewish populations primarily from Central and Eastern Europe. These populations, known as Ashkenazi Jews, have a long history that spans over a thousand years. Their origin traces back to the ancient Israelites in the Levant (the geographical region that includes present-day Israel, Palestine, Lebanon, Jordan, and parts of Syria). The Jewish diaspora, a series of migrations and dispersals throughout various regions in Europe, Asia, and Africa, has led to different groups of Jewish populations forming distinct genetic markers. The Ashkenazi Jewish population, in particular, experienced a significant growth in Central and Eastern Europe during the late Middle Ages. Over time, the Ashkenazim have developed unique genetic characteristics due to a combination of endogamy (marrying within their own communities), founder effects (a small number of initial settlers contributing to the gene pool), and population bottlenecks (a temporary reduction in population size, limiting genetic diversity). As a result, the \\"European Jewish\\" designation in your sister's DNA results points to her having a genetic connection, albeit potentially distant, to this specific Jewish population. As for the second question, regarding the possibility of having zero Native American blood despite having a great-grandfather who was full Cherokee, the answer is not straightforward. DNA inheritance is complex due to the nature of the recombination process that occurs when genetic material is passed down from one generation to another. During the formation of an individual's chromosomes, a random reshuffling of genetic information happens, resulting in children receiving a combination of DNA from both of their parents in an unpredictable manner. While it might seem surprising, it is possible for an individual to inherit little or no DNA from their great-grandparents. Generally, the further back in the family tree, the higher the chances of an ancestor's DNA \\"washing out\\" or becoming undetectable. In the case of your sister's AncestryDNA.com report showing zero Native American ancestry, it is plausible that due to the random and complex nature of DNA inheritance, she did not inherit a detectable amount of Cherokee DNA from her great-grandfather. However, it is important to note that DNA tests offered by various companies have varying levels of accuracy and depend on the size and diversity of their reference populations. Different companies may yield slightly different results for the same individual. It might be helpful to test with another reputable company or confirm your family's historical records to have a more comprehensive understanding of your sister's ancestry."},{"question":"Due to Hurricane Sandy's aftermath, the Steelers flew to New Jersey on game day because the team was unable to find a hotel in New York.

The venture, financed by John Quiller Rowett, is sometimes referred to as the Quest Expedition after its ship Quest, a converted Norwegian sealer. Shackleton had originally intended to go to the Arctic and explore the Beaufort Sea, but this plan was abandoned when the Canadian government withheld financial support; Shackleton thereupon switched his attention to the Antarctic. Quest, smaller than any recent Antarctic exploration vessel, soon proved inadequate for its task, and progress south was delayed by its poor sailing performance and by frequent engine problems. Before the expedition's work could properly begin, Shackleton died on board the ship, just after its arrival at the sub-Antarctic island of South Georgia. The major part of the subsequent attenuated expedition was a three-month cruise to the eastern Antarctic, under the leadership of the party's second-in-command, Frank Wild. The shortcomings of Quest were soon in evidence: slow speed, heavy fuel consumption, a tendency to roll in heavy seas, and a steady leak. The ship was unable to proceed further than longitude 20°E, well short of its easterly target, and its engine's low power coupled with its unsuitable bows was insufficient for it to penetrate southward through the pack ice. Following several fruitless attempts, Wild returned the ship to South Georgia, on the way visiting Elephant Island where he and 21 others had been stranded after the sinking of the ship Endurance, during Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition six years earlier. answer the following question: What is the full name of the person that had to change plans when money was withheld?

Mix a strong capful of regular super dish dish soap into the water and you're ready to work.","response":"B). Coir netting can be purchased online or from specialty landscaping and yardwork stores. Depending on the climate conditions in your area, coir netting can last from 24 to 48 months. The use of coir netting is an effective method to control erosion on river banks. This biodegradable and environmentally friendly solution helps to stabilize the soil, allow vegetation growth, and prevent soil from being washed away by the water flow. Additionally, coir netting acts as a barrier against water, reducing the impact of waves and currents on the river banks. To stop erosion on a river bank using coir netting, follow these steps: 1. Assess the erosional problem: Take note of the size of the area experiencing erosion, the slope of the land, the type of soil, and the severity of the erosion. This information will help you determine the appropriate coir netting weight (700-900 gsm) to be used, as well as whether normal or heavy-duty netting is required. 2. Prepare the site: Remove any debris or large rocks from the eroded area. This will ensure that the coir netting will make proper contact with the soil. You may also need to grade the land or install a drainage system to manage water flow effectively. 3. Purchase the coir netting: Choose the appropriate coir netting for your project based on the size of the area, the type of soil, and the severity of the erosion. As mentioned earlier, coir netting can be purchased online or from specialty landscaping and yardwork stores. 4. Install the coir netting: Unroll the coir netting perpendicular to the water flow, starting from the upper portion of the river bank and moving towards the water. Make sure to anchor the netting firmly into the ground using landscape staples or stakes, maintaining a tight and even tension along the surface of the soil. Overlap the edges of the netting to create a more robust barrier against erosion. 5. Plant vegetation: To further reinforce the stability of the river bank, consider planting native plants or grasses. The roots of these plants will help to bind the soil together and create a more solid structure, reducing the chances of erosion. Make sure to choose plants that can thrive in wet conditions and are compatible with the local ecosystem. 6. Monitor and maintain: Periodically check the coir netting to ensure that it remains effectively anchored and is not damaged by any external factors. Repair or replace any sections of netting that show signs of wear. Additionally, monitor the growth of the vegetation planted earlier and remove any invasive species that may hinder the growth of native plants. By following these steps and using coir netting as a solution, you can successfully stop erosion on river banks and promote stability, ultimately protecting the surrounding environment and preventing further damage to the river ecosystem."},{"question":"Leo: Premise: \\"A child in a standing in a stream dumps a bucket of water on his or her head.\\" Based on this premise, can we conclude that the hypothesis \\"An adult is standing in a stream dumping a bucket of ice on his or her pants.\\" is true?

East of Amsterdam, Seminary Row bends south along Morningside Park and is resigned as Morningside Drive (Ninth Avenue). Seminary row runs in Morningside Heights, the district surrounding Columbia University, and crosses portions of Broadway and Claremont Avenue.\\" Answer: A:","response":"Crucifixion utilizes a contraption called a crucifix or cross for the act of crucifying. However, the context you provided does not pertain to the topic of crucifixion, but rather offers a detailed description of the geographical position and surrounding areas of W 122nd Street Seminary Row in Morningside Heights, which is connected to Columbia University. Nonetheless, to answer your question about crucifixion, we can explore the contraption used in more detail. Crucifixion was an ancient form of execution practiced by various civilizations, most notably the Romans. It involved nailing or tying the person's hands and feet to a wooden structure, typically a cross, and leaving them to hang until they died. This was an agonizing process that could take hours or even days, and was designed to inflict the maximum amount of pain and suffering as a deterrent for others. The crucifix used in crucifixion was generally made of wood and consisted of two parts: an upright post (referred to as the stipes) and a horizontal beam (known as the patibulum). The stipes was usually fixed permanently in the ground, while the patibulum was carried by the condemned person to the site where the crucifixion took place. When they arrived, the person's hands were either nailed or tied to the patibulum, which was then raised and secured to the stipes. Sometimes, a small support called a sedile or a suppedaneum was provided for the feet, which would allow the individual to lift their body, providing temporary relief from the pain and pressure of hanging by their hands. However, this small mercy ultimately prolonged their suffering. Crucifixion was a slow and torturous death, as the victim's muscles, joints, and limbs were subjected to immense strain, all while their body weight caused their bones and tendons to tear and dislocate. Death was often the result of asphyxiation, as the victim's body slumped and it became increasingly difficult to breathe. Other contributing factors leading to death included heart failure, dehydration, blood loss, and shock. It's important to note that the context provided in your message, describing the location of W 122nd Street Seminary Row in relation to Morningside Heights and Columbia University, does not bear any relation to the question on crucifixion. However, understanding the geography and neighborhood dynamics of the mentioned area may be helpful for other reasons and is unrelated to the topic of crucifixion."},{"question":"Generate a context and a hypothesis.","response":"Step 1: Determine a topic of interest To create a context and hypothesis, I will first select a topic of interest. In this case, I choose \\"the influence of social media on communication.\\" Step 2: Research the topic Next, I will research the topic to gather information and understand the various aspects of the subject. This helps to create a well-informed context and to propose a plausible hypothesis. Step 3: Establish context After researching, I can establish the context for our topic: Context: Social media has become an integral part of modern society, providing a platform for individuals to create, share, and exchange information and ideas. The use of social media has transformed the way people communicate, as traditional face-to-face interactions are often replaced with text messages, likes, shares, and comments. Key aspects of communication, such as body language, tone, and context, have become less visible or even absent in these new forms of communication. Step 4: Develop a hypothesis Based on the established context, I can create a hypothesis related to the topic: Hypothesis: Increased exposure to and usage of social media platforms can lead to a decline in the quality of interpersonal communication skills, as individuals may become more reliant on brief and indirect forms of messaging in place of in-depth, face-to-face conversations. The hypothesis presents an idea that can be tested and analyzed through empirical research, making it a valuable statement for further inquiry."},{"question":"Reconstruct a question, answer pair from this explanation: One is not running if the person bends down and pets a dog.","response":"Question: Can a person be considered running if they bend down and pet a dog?

The findings of this report showcase the stark reality of the risks that budget constraints can impose on the safety and well-being of workers, businesses, and the general public. The adverse impact on infrastructure maintenance, employee training, and overall operational efficiency has led to lowered safety standards and increased mishaps in several sectors. Budget Cuts and Their Implications: Over the past decade, both private and public organizations have been forced to reassess their finances and implement cost-cutting measures. Despite the potential economic benefits of these cost-saving strategies, a considerable downside has become clear from the NSAAI's research: reduced funding is leading to inadequate maintenance, poor training, and a lack of accountability, ultimately leading to a growing number of accidents and errors. Inadequate Maintenance: One of the most significant findings of the report is the decline in infrastructure maintenance due to budget cuts. In the transportation sector, for instance, roads, bridges, and railways have faced diminished maintenance budgets, leaving them increasingly susceptible to accidents. Structural issues, such as corroding bridges and potholes on roads, have not only put the lives of commuters at risk but also contributed to long-term wear and tear on vehicles, increasing the likelihood of accidents and injuries. Similarly, industrial sectors have seen a surge in equipment malfunctions and breakdowns due to a lack of necessary maintenance. In power plants, oil refineries, and manufacturing facilities, reduced investment in safety checks and proactive maintenance has led to increased potential for catastrophic failures, putting both workers and local communities at risk. Insufficient Training: The report also highlights the negative impact of budget cuts on employee training. Companies and government organizations that reduce their investment in training have left staff inadequately equipped to handle problems and emergencies. This skill gap often accounts for errors in judgment and actions, which can lead to accidents or dangerous situations. For instance, a lack of proper training in the construction industry can result in workers failing to follow essential safety protocols, while in the medical sector, it can lead to an increase in medical errors and patient injuries. Public service organizations, such as firefighting and law enforcement agencies, can also suffer from poor training - a risk factor that can pose serious harm not only to these professionals but also to the communities they serve. Lack of Accountability: The NSAAI report emphasizes that the repercussions of budget cuts extend beyond material resources and training; they also harm organizational accountability and oversight. When financial limitations force staff reductions or stretch the responsibilities of remaining employees too thin, little to no room is left for effective supervision or the proper enforcement of safety standards. Numerous overlooked errors, non-adherence to best practices, and undocumented safety violations can culminate in accidents that could have been avoided with sufficient resources and active monitoring of procedures. Conclusion: The Comprehensive Report on Errors and Accidents underscores the dangers associated with budget cuts, which negatively impact infrastructure maintenance, employee training, and organizational accountability. In order to mitigate the risk of errors and accidents, both private businesses and public organizations must reconsider their cost-saving measures and prioritize investments that support safer working conditions and a stronger infrastructure. This renewed focus on safety will not only help reduce the potential for accidents but also contribute to a healthier economy and improved public welfare for everyone."},{"question":"Please write a short summary for the following article: Govt cut bobbies on the beat Members of the Home Affairs Committee said there will be “significantly fewer” officers.

In 1964 Shostakovich composed the music for the Russian film Hamlet, which was favourably reviewed by The New York Times: \\"But the lack of this aural stimulation – of Shakespeare's eloquent words – is recompensed in some measure by a splendid and stirring musical score by Dmitri Shostakovich. This has great dignity and depth, and at times an appropriate wildness or becoming levity\\".In later life, Shostakovich suffered from chronic ill health, but he resisted giving up cigarettes and vodka. Beginning in 1958 he suffered from a debilitating condition that particularly affected his right hand, eventually forcing him to give up piano playing; in 1965 it was diagnosed as poliomyelitis. He also suffered heart attacks the following year and again in 1971, and several falls in which he broke both his legs; in 1967 he wrote in a letter: \\"Target achieved so far: 75% (right leg broken, left leg broken, right hand defective). All I need to do now is wreck the left hand and then 100% of my extremities will be out of order.\\"A preoccupation with his own mortality permeates Shostakovich's later works, among them the later quartets and the Fourteenth Symphony of 1969 (a song cycle based on a number of poems on the theme of death). This piece also finds Shostakovich at his most extreme with musical language, with twelve-tone themes and dense polyphony throughout. He dedicated the piece to his close friend Benjamin Britten, who conducted its Western premiere at the 1970 Aldeburgh Festival. The Fifteenth Symphony of 1971 is, by contrast, melodic and retrospective in nature, quoting Wagner, Rossini and the composer's own Fourth Symphony. Shostakovich died of lung cancer on 9 August 1975. A civic funeral was held; he was interred in Novodevichy Cemetery, Moscow. Even before his death he had been commemorated with the naming of the Shostakovich Peninsula on Alexander Island, Antarctica., Despite suffering from Motor Neurone Disease (or ALS) from as early as the 1960s, Shostakovich insisted upon writing all his own correspondence...

Catherine informs Jane that their coworker, Denise, is leaving her job. Jane is curious about the reason for Denise's departure, and Catherine explains that Denise has found a new job closer to her home. Although the pay for the new job may not be significantly better, Denise will save money on commuting expenses, which justifies her decision. Both Catherine and Jane express that they will miss Denise since she is a valuable, friendly, and hard-working team member, unlike some other coworkers who are perceived as being consistently late and not very friendly. They acknowledge that they will have a few more weeks to spend time with Denise before she moves on to her new job at the end of December. The conversation ends with Catherine and Jane agreeing to see each other later that day. The primary focus of this conversation was discussing a coworker's decision to switch jobs and the implications of her departure on their workplace environment."},{"question":"The deportation was given the code name Operation Ulusy. In it, a total of 93,139 Kalmyks were uprooted. They were packed into Cattle wagon and dispatched in some 46 trains. One witness recalled that they traveled for two weeks. Many Kalmyks were dirty and unwashed upon arrival; upon exiting, the snow became black from their dirt. The deportation was completed on 31 December. A majority of them (91,919) were deported by the end of the year, though an additional 1,014 people were also evicted in January 1944. Resolution no. 1432 425 of the Soviet of Peoples Commissars, which determined that this ethnic group should be resettled, was adopted on 28 December 1943 and signed by Vyacheslav Molotov, but not made public. The entire operation was guided by the NKVD chief Lavrentiy Beria and his Deputy Commissar Ivan Serov. Other officials who participated in it included Victor Grigorievich Nasedkin, Head of the Gulag and Commissar of the State Security of the 3rd degree, and Dmitri Vasilevich Arkadiev, the Head of the Transport Department of the USSR NKVD. The Kalmyks were sent to various locations in Siberia—by January 1944, 24,352 were sent to the Omsk Oblast, 21,164 to Krasnoyarsk Krai, 20,858 to Altai Krai, and 18,333 to Novosibirsk Oblast. Alternative sources indicate that, beginning in 1944, 6,167 Kalmyk families were in the Altai, 7,525 in the Krasnoyarsk, 5,435 in Novosibirsk and 8,353 in the Omsk Region. 660 families were also located in the Tomsk Region, 648 in the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic, 522 in Tobolsk, 2,796 in the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug and 1,760 in the Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug.

Your job is to generate the answer to the question by using the information provided. If there is no clear answer obtainable, output 'none'. Q: Passage: In 1760 the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the hook-billed vanga in his Ornithologie based on a specimen collected on the island of Madagascar. He used the French name L'écorcheur de Madagascar and the Latin Collurio Madagascariensis. Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his Systema Naturae for the twelfth edition, he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson. One of these was the hook-billed vanga. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name Lanius curvirostris and cited Brisson's work. It is now the only species placed in the genus Vanga that was introduced by the French ornithologist Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot in 1816. The specific name curvirostris is from Latin curvus \\"curved\\" and -rostrum \\"billed\\". The word \\"vanga\\" is the Malagasy name for the species. Two subspecies are recognised.

The US whistleblower’s comments, made in an interview with the Guardian, came as supporters, including his US lawyer, stepped up a campaign for a presidential pardon. Snowden is wanted in the US, where he is accused of violating the Espionage Act and faces at least 30 years in jail. Speaking on Monday via a video link from Moscow, where he is in exile, Snowden said any evaluation of the consequences of his leak of tens of thousands of National Security Agency and GCHQ documents in 2013 would show clearly that people had benefited. “Yes, there are laws on the books that say one thing, but that is perhaps why the pardon power exists – for the exceptions, for the things that may seem unlawful in letters on a page but when we look at them morally, when we look at them ethically, when we look at the results, it seems these were necessary things, these were vital things,” he said. “I think when people look at the calculations of benefit, it is clear that in the wake of 2013 the laws of our nation changed. The [US] Congress, the courts and the president all changed their policies as a result of these disclosures. At the same time there has never been any public evidence that any individual came to harm as a result.” Although US presidents have granted some surprising pardons when leaving office, the chances of Obama doing so seem remote, even though before he entered the White House he was a constitutional lawyer who often made the case for privacy and had warned about the dangers of mass surveillance. Obama’s former attorney general Eric Holder, however, gave an unexpected boost to the campaign for a pardon in May when he said Snowden had performed a public service. The campaign could receive a further lift from Oliver Stone’s film, Snowden, scheduled for release in the US on Friday. Over the weekend the director said he hoped the film would help shift opinion behind the whistleblower, and added his voice to the plea for a pardon. Ahead of general release, the film will be shown in 700 cinemas across the US on Wednesday, with plans for Stone and Snowden to join in a discussion afterwards via a video link. In his wide-ranging interview, Snowden insisted the net public benefit of the NSA leak was clear. “If not for these disclosures, if not for these revelations, we would be worse off,” he said. In Hong Kong in June 2013, when he had passed his documents to journalists, Snowden displayed an almost unnatural calm, as if resigned to his fate. On Monday he said that at that time he expected a “dark end” in which he was either killed or jailed in the US. More than three years on, he appears cheerful and relaxed. He has avoided the fate of fellow whistleblower Chelsea Manning, who is in solitary confinement in the US. Snowden is free to communicate with supporters and chats online late into the night. His 2.3 million followers on Twitter give him a huge platform to express his views. He works on tools to try to help journalists. He is not restricted to Moscow and has travelled around Russia, and his family in the US have been to visit him. But Snowden still wants to return to the US and seems confident, in spite of all the evidence to the contrary, that it will happen. “In the fullness of time, I think I will end up back home,” he said. “Once the officials, who felt like they had to protect the programmes, their positions, their careers, have left government and we start looking at things from a more historical perspective, it will be pretty clear that this war on whistleblowers does not serve the interests of the United States; rather it harms them.” Snowden attracts lots of conspiracy theories. Early on, he was accused of being a spy for China and then a Russian spy. In August a cryptic tweet followed by an unusual absence prompted speculation that he was dead. He said he had simply gone on holiday. The reports of my death are greatly exaggerated. pic.twitter.com/ZgIkapmcOC There had also been rumours that his partner, Lindsay Mills, had left him, which would have been embarrassing as their romance occupies a large part of the Stone film. Snowden said “she is with me and we are very happy”. His revelations resulted in a global debate and modest legislative changes. More significant, perhaps, is that surveillance and the impact of technological change has seeped into popular culture, in films such as the latest Jason Bourne and television series’, such as the Good Wife. Snowden also welcomed “a renaissance of scepticism” on the part of at least some journalists when confronted by anonymous briefings by officials not backed by evidence. He warned three years ago of the danger that one day there might be a president who abused the system. The warning failed to gain much traction, given that Obama’s presidency seemed relatively benign. But it resonates more today, in the wake of Donald Trump’s response to the Russian hacking of the Democratic party: that he wished he had the power to hack into Hillary Clinton’s emails. If Obama, as seems likely, declines to pardon Snowden, his chances under either Clinton or Trump would seem to be even slimmer. He described the 2016 presidential race as unprecedented “in terms of the sort of authoritarian policies that are being put forward”. “Unfortunately, many candidates in the political mainstream today, even pundits and commentators who aren’t running for office, believe we have to be able to do anything, no matter what, as long as there is some benefit to be had in doing so. But that is the logic of a police state.” He is even less impressed by the British prime minister, referring to Theresa May as a “a sort of Darth Vader in the United Kingdom”, whose surveillance bill is “an egregious violation of human rights, that goes far further than any law proposed in the western world”. Snowden was initially berated by opponents for failing to criticise the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, but he has become increasingly vocal. It is a potentially risky move, given his application for an extension of asylum is up for renewal next year, so why do it? “Well, it would not be the first time I have taken a risk for something I believe in,” he said. “This is a complex situation. Russia is not my area of focus. It is not my area of expertise. I don’t speak Russian in a fluent manner that I could really participate in and influence policy. But when something happens that I believe is clearly a violation of the right thing, I believe we should stand up and say something about it. “My priority always has to be my own country rather than Russia. I would like to help reform the human rights situation in Russia but I will never be well placed to do so relative to actual Russian activists themselves.” Might he end up as part of a US-Russian prisoner exchange, with Putin possibly more amenable to the idea if Trump was in power? “There has always been the possibility that any government could say, ‘Well, it does not really matter whether it is a violation of human rights, it does not really matter whether it is a violation of law, it will be beneficial to use this individual as a bargaining chip’. This is not exclusive to me. This happens to activists around the world every day.” He said he saw the Stone film as a mechanism for getting people to talk about surveillance, though he felt uncomfortable with other people telling his story. Snowden has toyed with writing his memoirs but has not made much progress. There are at least three books about him on the way; an extensively researched one by the Washington Post’s Bart Gellman and two others thought to be hostile. Asked if he was the source for the Panama Papers – the comments by the source sound like Snowden – he laughed. He praised the biggest data leak in history, adding that he would normally be happy to cloak other whistleblowers by neither denying nor confirming he was a source. But he would make an exception in the case of the Panama Papers. “I would not claim any credit for that.” For someone who has spent his life trying to keep out of the public eye, he has now appeared in a Hollywood movie and an Oscar-winning documentary, and several plays, including Privacy, which just ended a run in New York and in which he has a part alongside Daniel Radcliffe. “It was an alarming experience for me. I am not an actor. I have been told I am not very good at it. But you know if I can, I can try and maybe it will help, I will give it my best shot.” For Snowden, his campaign for a pardon, even if forlorn, offers a chance to highlight his plight, and he expressed thanks to all those who were backing it. He also said he hoped that after the fuss of the movie he could finally fade into the background. “I really hope it is over,” he said. “That would be the greatest gift anyone could give me.” What are the most important parts of this news article?","response":"This news article primarily focuses on the plea made by Edward Snowden, who leaked classified information from the National Security Agency (NSA), for a presidential pardon from Barack Obama before he leaves office in January. Snowden argues that his disclosure of mass surveillance by the US and British intelligence agencies was not only legally defensible but has also benefitted the wider public. Snowden is sought in the US on charges of violating the Espionage Act, which could lead to a 30+ year prison sentence. He has been living in exile in Russia, which is where he made his recent comments via a video interview with The Guardian. He claimed that an assessment of the effects of his leak would clearly demonstrate that the public has gained from the exposure of thousands of confidential NSA and GCHQ documents in 2013. He presented his actions as morally and ethically necessary, despite their departure from existing laws. Snowden highlighted the subsequent changes in national policies and laws brought about by his disclosures, stressing that there's no tangible proof that his actions caused harm to any individual. The likelihood of Obama granting Snowden a pardon seems slim, but former Attorney General Eric Holder did express that Snowden had performed a public service. The campaign for Snowden's pardon might gain some momentum from the release of Oliver Stone’s film, Snowden, as Stone hopes the film would shift public opinion in Snowden's favor. Snowden revealed his desire to return to the US and his belief that he eventually will, despite the obstacles in his path. He also expressed his confidence that the 'war on whistleblowers' would eventually be recognized as harmful to US interests. Throughout the article, Snowden appeared at ease and in high spirits despite his circumstances. The article concluded with Snowden thanking his supporters and expressing his hope for the future. Despite his plea for a pardon seeming unlikely to succeed, he believes it raises awareness about his situation and hopes that he could fade into the background once the popularity surrounding the movie ends."},{"question":"Generate an approximately fifteen-word sentence that describes all this data: Wildwood eatType pub; Wildwood priceRange less than £20; Wildwood customer rating 5 out of 5","response":"At Wildwood pub, you can enjoy tasty food for under £20, and people love it, giving it 5 stars!"},{"question":"Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: A sunflower is a sunflower.

Translate to English English:","response":"According to Erdogan and other leaders of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), the current system, which is 75 years old, represents an inefficient and bureaucratic oligarchy that must be abandoned. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and other leaders from the AKP assert that the existing system has devolved into a non-productive and overly bureaucratic oligarchy. They argue that this oligarchy, which has been in place for seventy-five years, undermines the democratic principle and hinders the growth and progress of the nation. They contend that this system concentrates too much power in the hands of a few, resulting in political inertia, corruption, and a lack of structural flexibility to institute needed changes. The operational efficiency of such a system is compromised, they maintain, because decision-making is slowed by the convoluted processes, causing a stifling of creativity, stagnation of political will, and a lack of responsiveness to the needs and demands of the citizenry. The accusation of inefficiency also extends to the way public resources are used in such a system. According to them, an oligarchy is prone to misallocate resources because decisions are often driven by the vested interests of the powerful few rather than the collective good. This, coupled with a high degree of bureaucracy, they argue, leads to systemic inefficiencies and wastages that drag down the overall performance and development of the country. They further believe that in addition to being inefficient, such a system is undemocratic. They argue that the power vested in few hands restricts citizen involvement and engagement in decision making, diminishing their democratic rights. President Erdogan and the AKP leaders propose to abandon this system and replace it with a more democratic and efficient one that will place the power and decision-making in the hands of the many. They believe this will spur development, progress, and greater democratisation, reaffirming the principle that power belongs to the people. In summary, Erdogan and his team want to transition away from the 75-year-old system, seeing it as a stifling, inefficient, and bureaucratic oligarchy, towards a new system that is more democratic, efficient, and responsive to the needs of the people.

There are locks at each end to lift ships up to Gatun Lake, an artificial lake created to reduce the amount of excavation work required for the canal, above sea level, and then lower the ships at the other end. The original locks are wide. A third, wider lane of locks was constructed between September 2007 and May 2016. The expanded canal began commercial operation on June 26, 2016. The new locks allow transit of larger, Post-Panamax ships, capable of handling more cargo. - Alaska is a U.S. state located in the northwest extremity of North America.

It will be the 44th consecutive yearly record since 1971, when 339 people were 100 years old or older, according to ministry statistics released on Sept. 12. Women account for about 87 percent of the centenarians. At 116 years old, Osaka’s Misao Okawa is not only the oldest person in Japan but also the oldest person on the planet, according to Guinness World Records. Okawa, who lives in a nursing home, is known for her strong appetite, with one of her favorite dishes being sashimi. She uses her wheelchair several times a month. Sakari Momoi, 111, a resident of Saitama, is the oldest man in Japan. He was recognized as the world’s oldest man in August by Guinness World Records. He currently resides in a hospital but eats regular food and takes part in hospital events. Momoi communicates with others, sometimes through written messages. The welfare ministry compiled the number of people expected to be 100 or older as of Sept. 15 based on resident registries. ||||| The government is finding it costly furnishing Japan’s growing number of centenarians with a token of congratulation in the form of an expensive sake dish. Since fiscal 1963, the prime minister has traditionally presented new centenarians with a commemorative silver sakazuki, a flat saucer-like cup. As their numbers have increased, the costs have soared, tarnishing the government’s goodwill. It now plans to cease distributing the ¥8,000 silver cups and will instead select something cheaper. The presentations are made every year on Seniors’ Day, Sept. 15. The gesture is one few could quibble with: It praises the centenarians’ contributions to society. Officials admit that the program has become a significant budgetary burden. It cost ¥260 million in 2014. Japanese people have one of world’s greatest life expectancies. Last fiscal year, 29,357 people — 25,000 of whom were women — were inducted into the ranks of centenarians, compared with only 153 when the silver cup program began half a century ago, according to the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare. The government knows it needs to act fast, as the ministry predicts the number of newcomers will reach 39,000 in 2018. The ministry is looking at options for cutting costs, such as fabricating the cup from a cheaper material, adopting a different gift entirely or just sending a letter of congratulations, the officials said. Average longevity in 2014 was 86.83 years for women and 80.50 for men, both a record high. Women had the longest life expectancy in the world for the third consecutive year, with men ranking third, up from fourth the previous year. ||||| Image caption Japan's elderly population continues to grow, with more than a quarter of the population now of retirement age Japan's government plans to end the tradition of giving centenarians a silver commemorative gift, because the growing elderly population has made it too expensive, it's reported. Since 1963, a silver sake cup - or sakazuki - has been presented to everyone who reaches 100 years old. The cups, worth 8,000 yen (65; £40) each, are a thank you for centenarians' contribution to society. But as Japan's elderly population has expanded, so too has the gift bill, Kyodo news agency reports. Last year, the government shelled out 260 million yen (2.1m; £1.3m) on the items, a figure officials say isn't sustainable. As a result, they want to replace the gift with something less pricey. Options being considered include using cheaper materials or choosing something completely different to mark the occasion - possibly just a letter of congratulations, officials tell Kyodo. There were more than 29,000 new centenarians in Japan last year, compared to 153 when the scheme began, the report says. Life expectancy in Japan is among the highest in the world, and the number of people seeing their 100th birthday has grown every year since 1971.

The average life expectancy for Japanese men is 80.5 years of age, while for women, life expectancy was calculated at 86.83 years of age, Fuji TV reported Friday. Both groups increased by 0.29 and 0.22 years respectively over 2013. For male life expectancy, Japan ranked third after Hong Kong and Iceland, but remained No. 1 for female life expectancy for the third year in a row, ahead of Hong Kong and Spain. As reasons for the extended life expectancy in Japan, the ministry cited lower numbers of deaths from cancer and heart disease due to advances in medical treatment, Fuji reported. Japan Today ||||| Every year for more than 50 years, Japan’s new centenarians have been honoured with a silver sake cup and a congratulatory letter from the prime minister. But as the country prepares to mark Respect for the Aged Day next month, the latest crop of citizens who turned 100 in the past 12 months face disappointment, as the soaring number of centenarians puts a new strain on the government’s coffers. The saucer-like sakazuki, a gift from the government since 1963, could be replaced by a cheaper version or be scrapped altogether this year after the health and welfare ministry complained it could not afford to keep up with the number of new recipients. In 1963 Japan had just 153 centenarians, and as recently as 1998 the number stood at just 10,000. At the last count Japan’s 100-plus age group numbered almost 59,000, and that figure is expected to rise when the government releases new population data before Seniors’ Day on 15 September. Last year the ministry spent 260 million yen (£1.3m) on giving the cups – each worth about 8,000 yen – to almost 30,000 people, including 25,000 women. Local media pointed out that some people die before the gifts can be distributed, forcing them to be scrapped. Several years ago the cup’s diameter was slightly reduced amid concern over rising production costs, but the strain on the ministry’s finances could see the sakazuki replaced with a cup made from a cheaper metal, according to Japanese media reports. Other options being mulled are a different – and cheaper – commemorative gift, or restricting the official offering to the prime minister’s letter. “We are reviewing it, but we have not made any firm decisions,” a health ministry official told AFP. Demographers predict that Japan’s centenarian population will continue to grow as the general population ages – the result of regular medical examinations, universal healthcare and, among Japanese over a certain age, a fastidious attachment to the traditional low-fat diet of fish, tofu, vegetables and rice. Japanese women live an average of 86.3 years, putting them at the top of the global longevity table last year, while Japanese men were in fourth place with an average lifespan of 80.5 years. Just over a quarter of Japan’s 126 million people are 65 or over, according to the most recent census, and the proportion is expected to grow to about 40% by the middle of the century. It remains to be seen how most Japanese senior citizens will react to any decision to scale back official recognition of their accomplishment. Until recently the titles of world’s oldest man and woman were held by Japanese. Sakari Momoi, who cited healthy eating and a good night’s sleep as the secrets to his very long life, died in July aged 112. Misao Okawa, formerly the world’s oldest person, died in April this year, weeks after her 117th birthday. Last year the number of Japanese centenarians reached a record 58,820 on Respect for the Aged Day, an increase of 4,423 from the previous year. Japan’s oldest citizens were at the centre of a scandal in 2010 when it emerged that at least 200 centenarians had gone missing from local government records. In some cases, people who had died were still listed as alive, including a woman mistakenly recorded as having reached 125, whose registered home had been turned into a park in 1981. ||||| The third Monday of September is Respect for the Aged Day, a national holiday in Japan. The Japanese call national holidays “red days” because they appear in red print on the calendar. As this will make September 12–14 a long weekend, be prepared for heavier than usual traffic and crowded trains if you are traveling. Japanese people traditionally wear red on their 60th birthday because 60 years is one cycle on the Chinese calendar and after 60, it is said that you become a baby again. Babies in Japan are called “aka-chan” or “red one.” Respect for the Aged Day, called keiro no hi, is not quite like “Grandparent’s Day” in the U.S. It is far more serious. Neighborhoods will have volunteers distribute free “obento” boxed lunches to elderly people in the neighborhood and smaller villages will hold keirokai shows where the younger people and school children prepare dances and songs for a special keirokai ceremony. The elderly attendees are also treated to lunch, tea, and sweets after the performance. As Japan’s nation grays and people get older and older, some of these traditions may change, however. On the small island of 700 people where I live, the keirokai ceremony used to be held for those 60 years old and over. But with so many people over the age of 60 now, the qualifying age to attend the keirokai has steadily increased, and is now 65. As Japan’s society ages and nursing homes become more popular, being old may not be so special anymore—but rather the norm. Respect for the Aged Day is also a way to honor longevity, and Japanese people have always been some of the longest living in the world. But this is also changing as more and more Japanese people add meat and other western foods to their diets. In addition, city living is seen to cut lifespan due to pollution and stress.

How to communicate with autistic people Find out what you have in common. Sharing interests can be a powerful communication tool. See if you have interests in common, especially special interests.","response":"When communicating with autistic people, it is essential to consider that individuals with autism experience the world differently and may have varying communication styles. Building on common interests can serve as a bridge to foster connections, understanding, and mutual respect. With that in mind, here's a detailed explanation of what most naturally follows: 1. Be patient and open-minded: Communicating with autistic individuals may take more time and effort, but patience and open-mindedness can lead to productive and meaningful interactions. Always approach any conversation with kindness and an eagerness to learn about the other person's perspective and experiences. 2. Use clear and direct language: Autistic individuals often struggle with figurative language and may have difficulty interpreting verbal cues and non-verbal gestures. When speaking with someone on the autism spectrum, use clear and concise language, avoid sarcasm, and provide additional context when necessary, to ensure that your intended message is fully understood. 3. Provide multiple avenues of communication: Some autistic individuals may be more comfortable communicating through written or visual mediums. Offering various communication options, such as writing, drawing, or using electronic messaging apps, can create a more inclusive and accommodating conversational environment. 4. Allow them to lead the conversation: Autistic individuals may have a topic they are particularly interested or skilled in discussing. Allowing them to lead the conversation on their area of interest or expertise not only demonstrates respect and validation, but it can also provide you with valuable insights and connections. 5. Listen actively and empathetically: To establish a deep connection, actively listen to the person you are speaking with and try to understand their point of view. This includes maintaining eye contact if they are comfortable with it, asking open-ended questions, and summarizing or reflecting on what they have said to ensure you have understood them correctly. 6. Respect and accommodate sensory sensitivities: Autistic individuals may have heightened sensitivities to specific sensory experiences, such as loud noises, bright lights, or strong smells. To create a comfortable communication environment, be mindful of these sensitivities and make adjustments, such as lowering voices or moving to a quieter location when needed. 7. Offer reassurance and support: Autistic individuals may struggle with self-esteem and confidence due to societal misunderstandings and misconceptions about autism. Offer reassurance and support to validate their emotions and needs. Acknowledgment of their feelings and experiences can go a long way in fostering an environment of trust and safety. 8. Educate yourself about autism: To better understand and communicate with autistic individuals, it is essential to educate oneself about the disorder. Read articles, watch documentaries, and listen to autistic voices to gain a comprehensive understanding of the autism spectrum and its associated challenges. In conclusion, the most natural steps to follow when communicating with autistic people involve being patient, using clear language, offering various communication methods, engaging in topics of mutual interest, listening empathetically, and accommodating sensory sensitivities.

He has split the water into two containers, container A and container B. Container A has been heating up for a long amount time, while container B has only been heating up for a short amount of time. Which container has particles with lower average kinetic energy? Hint: As a liquid is heated, the average kinetic energy of its particles increases. The rate of evaporation increases as more and more molecules are able to escape the liquid’s surface into the vapor phase. Eventually a point is reached when the molecules all throughout the liquid have enough kinetic energy to vaporize . At this point the liquid begins to boil. The boiling point is the temperature at which the vapor pressure of a liquid is equal to the external pressure. The Figure below illustrates the boiling of liquid. A:","response":"Based on the given information, we can infer that container B has particles with lower average kinetic energy. To understand this, we need to dive a bit deeper into the basic concepts of temperature, kinetic energy, and particle motion in liquids. Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance. Kinetic energy, in turn, is a form of energy related to the motion of the particles. In a liquid like water, the particles are in constant motion, colliding with each other and the walls of the container. As the temperature of the liquid increases, so does the average kinetic energy of the particles. Now let's consider the heating process of the water in containers A and B. As mentioned, container A has been heating up for a longer time, which means that its temperature has increased more as compared to container B, which has been heating up for only a short time. With the increased temperature in container A, the average kinetic energy of its particles will also be higher. This increased kinetic energy allows more particles to obtain the necessary energy to escape the liquid's surface and transition to the vapor phase, resulting in higher rates of evaporation. In contrast, container B has been heating up for a shorter time period, so its temperature and average kinetic energy of the particles are relatively lower. As a result, fewer particles in container B have enough energy to escape the liquid's surface and vaporize. This leads to a lower rate of evaporation as compared to container A. At boiling point, as hinted in the question, the vapor pressure of the liquid becomes equal to the external pressure, and the liquid begins to boil. Since container A has been heating up for a longer time, it is more probable that it will reach boiling point before container B. This means that the average kinetic energy of the particles in container A will be higher, and those in container B will be lower. In conclusion, considering the relationship between heating time, temperature, and average kinetic energy, container B has particles with a lower average kinetic energy. This is mainly due to the fact that it has been heated for a shorter period compared to container A."},{"question":"What concepts are described in the following sentence? \\"There for the episode whose Production code is 3T7051 are 5.55.\\" Return the answer as pairs of triples.","response":"Alright, let me explain this for you like I'm talking to a five-year-old.

Step-by-step reasoning process: 1. The sentence mentions \\"salt,\\" which typically refers to table salt or sodium chloride (NaCl). 2. Sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3), also known as baking soda, is a different compound from sodium chloride. 3. While sodium bicarbonate has some health benefits, such as relief from heartburn and acid indigestion, it should not be mistaken for table salt. 4. Both sodium bicarbonate and sodium chloride can have negative effects on human health when consumed in large quantities. 5. The sentence implies that salt contains a rich constituent of sodium bicarbonate, which is incorrect. In conclusion, the sentence is not factually correct because it incorrectly connects table salt with sodium bicarbonate and suggests the latter as a primary constituent. It is essential to differentiate between sodium chloride (table salt) and sodium bicarbonate (baking soda), as they are distinct chemical compounds with different health effects."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Combine facts and answer this: Which small village in the North Kesteven district of Lincolnshire, England that has a monastery called Haverholme Priory?

There are four regular compact honeycombs in the hyperbolic 3D space : There are four hyperbolic honeycombs in regular 3D space .","response":"While both statements refer to honeycombs in three-dimensional spaces and use similar terms, they do not mean the same thing. In order to understand why, we need to unpack the terminology and concepts in each sentence. 1. \\"There are four regular compact honeycombs in the hyperbolic 3D space.\\" In this statement, \\"regular compact honeycombs\\" refer to honeycomb structures in which every cell is a regular polyhedron and the honeycomb is compact, meaning it is finite in size, not extending infinitely in any direction. The term \\"hyperbolic 3D space\\" denotes a three-dimensional geometry with constant negative curvature (a hyperbolic space), as opposed to the flat space of traditional Euclidean geometry. So, this statement is talking about four distinct types of evenly shaped structures that fit together perfectly without gaps and without extending infinitely, all within a hyperbolic geometry context. 2. \\"There are four hyperbolic honeycombs in regular 3D space.\\" In this case, the statement refers to \\"hyperbolic honeycombs,\\" which are honeycomb structures with constant negative curvature embedded within their cells. The term \\"regular 3D space\\" most likely refers to the familiar three-dimensional Euclidean geometry and not specifically to the regularity of the polyhedra forming the honeycombs. This statement is talking about honeycombs with characteristics of hyperbolic geometry that exist in a traditional three-dimensional flat space (Euclidean). However, it is important to note that hyperbolic honeycombs cannot truly be embedded in a regular flat 3D space without distortions, as they originate from a space with negative curvature. Alternatively, the term \\"regular 3D space\\" in this context might simply be a misinterpretation or an error, and the author intended to target a hyperbolic 3D space instead. To summarize, the first statement discusses regular compact honeycombs in a hyperbolic 3D space, while the second statement attempts to describe hyperbolic honeycombs within a regular 3D space. Although both touch upon hyperbolic honeycombs and 3D spaces, the ordering and meaning attributed to each element differ, making them distinct statements."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Question: what is the prognosis of stomach cancer I found the following answer on Google: Stomach cancer, or gastric cancer, refers to cancer arising from any part of the stomach .

Can we retrain the workforce as knowledge workers?\\"\\" At the heart of his question is an interesting observation. As automation and artificial intelligence replaces manual jobs, how do we retrain people in the new knowledge economy where information handling and management is in high demand? I thought I would share some experiences, observations, and recommendations based upon when I did this previously in my career. Back in 2004 I was peddling my wares as a journalist, writing for the tech press. I was living in the West Midlands in England and heard about a new organization in nearby Birmingham called OpenAdvantage. The premise was neat: open source was becoming a powerful force in technology and OpenAdvantage was set up to provide free consultancy for companies wanting to harness open source, as well as individuals who wanted to upskill in these new technologies. At the time in the West Midlands lots of industry was being automated and moved out to Asia, so lots of Midlanders were out of jobs and looking to retrain. This required, by definition, retaining the workforce as knowledge workers. OpenAdvantage was funded by the UK government and the University of Central England, had a decent war chest, and was founded by Scott Thompon and Paul Cooper (the latter of which I met when he heckled me at a talk I gave at a Linux User Group once. 🙂 ) So, I went along to their launch event and wrote a piece about them. Shortly after, Paul and Scott invited me back over to the office and offered me a job there as an open source consultant. I took the role, and this is where I cut my teeth on a lot of open source, community, and working with businesses. We had crazy targets to hit each month, so we ended up working with and training hundreds of organizations and individuals across a wide range of areas, and covering a wide berth of open source... Who did the author meet at the talk he gave at a Linux Group? - Scott Thompon - co-founder of AngelList - Paul Cooper - not enough information Answer:","response":"The author met Paul Cooper at the talk he gave at a Linux User Group. Paul Cooper, along with Scott Thompson, founded OpenAdvantage, an organization in Birmingham providing free consultancy for companies wishing to harness open source technologies and for individuals looking to enhance their skills in these areas.

Select from: 1. negative. 2. positive.","response":"To accurately predict the sentiment of this tweet, it is essential to analyze the content to interpret the emotions that may be conveyed through it. The tweet has the following elements: 1. Mentioning two Twitter accounts: @BDdotCOM and @Kristin_Bell. 2. Mention of going away for a weekend. 3. Use of the phrase \\"I am Texas sick\\" followed by \\"lol.\\" Breaking down the tweet, the user is indicating that they will be away for the weekend and tags two individuals or entities, potentially implying that the user would like to share this information with them, or it could be related to a conversation they had earlier. The term \\"Texas sick\\" is not a common phrase and may have unique connotations depending on context, personal experience, or local slang. It is unclear whether \\"Texas sick\\" is intended positively (e.g., feeling eager to visit Texas, feeling nostalgic about Texas, etc.) or negatively (e.g., feeling tired of being in Texas). However, the use of \\"lol\\" (laugh out loud) might suggest that the user finds humor in their current situation or is using a light-hearted tone when mentioning their \\"Texas sick\\" status. Considering the information available within the tweet, it is difficult to determine the tweet's sentiment with absolute certainty. However, the use of \\"lol\\" and sharing their weekend plans could potentially suggest a more positive sentiment. Therefore, I would lean towards option 2, a positive sentiment, for this tweet. However, it is essential to note that the tweet's interpretation could change depending on the context of prior conversations or the specific meaning of \\"Texas sick.\\""},{"question":"Choose your answer.

Choices: - make money - go somewhere - design software - find truth - use television The rationale to choose \\"find truth\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","response":"The primary motivation of an archaeologist would typically be their zeal to uncover historical facts and truth. They indulge in their exploration to discover the details of the past, unveiling truths that have been hidden for centuries. The options \\"make money\\", \\"go somewhere\\", \\"design software\\", and \\"use television\\" don't precisely align with the classic motivations for archaeology. Making money might be a side effect of their job but it's normally not the primary drive. Going somewhere can be part of the process but not the goal.

Here are my step-by-step justifications: 1. The reviewer makes a positive statement by calling the app \\"Super Indian app,\\" which shows enthusiasm and that they like the app. This is a good indicator for a favorable rating. 2. The reviewer claims that \\"all INDIANS should download this app,\\" which shows they believe it is suited for and beneficial to the target audience. This suggests a favorable rating as well. 3. The comparison of the app being \\"super den whatsapp\\" could be interpreted as the reviewer claiming it is better than WhatsApp, a popular messaging app. This implies that the reviewer strongly favors the app. However, there are a few reasons I cannot give it a full 5: 4. The review lacks detail about the app's features, functionality, or how it stands out from competitors. A more informative review would provide more insight into what makes the app special, making it a stronger recommendation. 5. There are grammatical errors in the review (e.g., \\"super den whatsapp\\" should be \\"better than WhatsApp\\"). These errors diminish the credibility of the review. Overall, while the review shows enthusiasm and favorable opinions, it could be more informative and better-written. Therefore, I rate it a 3."},{"question":"1.

Negotiations had started there on December 31, 1762. Frederick, who had considered ceding East Prussia to Russia if Peter III helped him secure Saxony, finally insisted on excluding Russia (in fact, no longer a belligerent) from the negotiations. At the same time, he refused to evacuate Saxony until its elector had renounced any claim to reparation. The Austrians wanted at least to retain Glatz, which they had in fact reconquered, but Frederick would not allow it. The treaty simply restored the status quo of 1748, with Silesia and Glatz reverting to Frederick and Saxony to its own elector. The only concession that Prussia made to Austria was to consent to the election of Archduke Joseph as Holy Roman emperor.\\" Answer: Answer:","response":"Glatz, also known as Kłodzko in Polish, originally belonged to the Kingdom of Bohemia, which later became part of the Habsburg Monarchy under the Austrian rule. The region had a complex history full of territorial conflicts and shifting borders due to its strategic location in Central Europe. The Kingdom of Bohemia, including Glatz, was a significant territorial unit in the Holy Roman Empire from the 11th to the early 20th century. In 1526, Bohemia came under the control of the Habsburg Monarchy, a vast empire ruled by the Habsburgs, which included a number of territories in Central and Eastern Europe. During the War of the Austrian Succession (1740-1748), Silesia, including Glatz, was invaded by Frederick the Great, the King of Prussia. This war marked the beginning of a series of disputes between the Habsburg Monarchy and the emerging Prussian power in the region. In 1748, the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle concluded the war, with most of Silesia, including Glatz, ceded to Frederick's Prussia. The territorial disputes continued in the Seven Years' War (1756-1763), where Austria attempted to regain the lost territories in Silesia. In 1760, during the war, Austrian forces reconquered Glatz. However, the Treaty of Hubertusburg in 1763 ultimately restored the status quo of 1748. Silesia and Glatz were returned to Frederick's Prussia, while Saxony was given back to its elector. In summary, Glatz originally belonged to the Kingdom of Bohemia and later became part of the Habsburg Monarchy under the Austrian rule. The area was then claimed by Prussia during the War of the Austrian Succession and was finally confirmed as part of Prussia in the Treaty of Hubertusburg in 1763, despite the temporary reconquest by Austria during the Seven Years' War."},{"question":"Article: When used properly, a menstrual cup may be the best option for exercising during your period. These cups are reusable, and they can stay in place for up to twelve hours. Menstrual cups are ideal if you are doing endurance training, running a marathon, or hiking. Menstrual cups may move around during yoga, however. Once a menstrual cup is in, you should feel no discomfort, but some people may struggle with placing the cup. If you don’t have a menstrual cup, buy a box of tampons instead. Tampons are not comfortable for everyone during exercise, however. If you find that you can’t exercise with a tampon in, try another method instead. \\"Sport\\" tampons are designed for workouts. You can try using these if normal tampons are uncomfortable while you exercise. If you have a heavy flow, you may need more protection. Use a pantyliner in addition to a menstrual cup or tampon. Put a new one in your undies just before exercising. Pads may cause uncomfortable chafing as you exercise. They can also scrunch up as you exercise, giving you less protection than you may need. If tampons and menstrual cups don't work for you, however, pads may be your only option. The underwear should be made out of a breathable fabric such as cotton. Underwear with more coverage will be more comfortable and prevent more leaks than a thinner type, such as a thong. You can even invest in a pair of period-proof underwear, such as Thinx. These can be worn in addition to or instead of a tampon or menstrual cup. Pants and shirts that are too tight might cause discomfort, especially if you’re experiencing cramps, constipation, or bloating. Instead, choose looser clothing. Make sure that your pants are dark, just in case there’s a leak! For example, instead of tight leggings, wear loose sweatpants to the gym. A cotton t-shirt or tank top is perfect, especially if you don’t tolerate heat well on your period.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","response":"Yes, the supposed perturbation does have an effect (both direct and indirect) on the process. When some of the trees are felled, it directly impacts the number of seeds produced because there are fewer trees to produce those seeds. This can then lead to a decrease in the overall tree population, as there are fewer seeds available for dispersal and germination. Indirectly, the removal of trees can affect the surrounding ecosystem, which in turn can influence the success of seed dispersal and growth. For instance, the felled trees can cause changes in the soil composition, light availability, and the overall forest structure. These changes can either positively or negatively impact the survival and growth of the remaining trees, as well as those seeds that have been dispersed. Additionally, the disruption of the habitat can affect the animals that play a role in seed dispersal, either by eating the seeds and spreading them through their droppings or by carrying seeds on their fur or feathers. If the animal population is negatively impacted by the removal of trees, this can result in fewer seeds being dispersed effectively, thus further reducing the rate at which new trees can grow.

Dazu zählen beispielsweise die rechtlichen, finanziellen und organisatorischen Aspekte, die im Zuge der Umwandlung berücksichtigt werden müssen. Ein wichtiger Schritt in diesem Prozess ist die Einholung der Zustimmung unserer Mitglieder bzw. Kunden zu den geplanten Veränderungen. Hierzu haben wir bereits eine umfassende Kommunikationsstrategie entwickelt und führen Informationsveranstaltungen, Webinare und individuelle Beratungsgespräche durch. Unser Ziel ist es, alle Beteiligten von der Notwendigkeit und den Vorteilen dieser Umwandlung zu überzeugen und zugleich für Transparenz und Klarheit im gesamten Prozess zu sorgen. Parallel dazu haben wir bereits die notwendigen Veränderungen in unserer Organisationsstruktur begonnen, um den Übergang zur Aktiengesellschaft effizient und reibungslos zu gestalten. Dies umfasst die Neuausrichtung von Abteilungen, die Schaffung neuer Prozesse sowie die Anpassung von IT-Systemen, um den Anforderungen der neuen Struktur gerecht zu werden. Dabei arbeiten wir eng mit externen Beratern und Experten zusammen, um sicherzustellen, dass alle Details korrekt umgesetzt werden und Gesetze und Vorschriften eingehalten werden. Im Hinblick auf die zukünftige Rolle unserer Mitglieder bzw. Kunden in der demutualisierten Struktur wird eine Umstellung auf eine Aktionärsstruktur vorgesehen, bei der die bisherigen Mitglieder automatisch Anteilseigner am Unternehmen werden. Auf diese Weise können sie weiterhin von den unternehmerischen Entscheidungen und Erfolgen betroffen sein und ihr Engagement im Unternehmen aufrechterhalten. Im nächsten Schritt werden wir uns darauf konzentrieren, die Demutualisierung abzuschließen und uns auf eine erfolgreiche Börsennotierung vorzubereiten. Dies kann weitere Anpassungen der Unternehmensstruktur sowie eine umfangreiche Roadshow zur Präsentation unseres Unternehmens bei potenziellen Investoren beinhalten. Insgesamt verfolgen wir mit der Demutualisierung das Ziel, unser Unternehmen zukunftsfähig und noch erfolgreicher zu gestalten. Durch die Umwandlung in eine Aktiengesellschaft können wir unsere Kapitalbasis erhöhen, zusätzliches Wachstum fördern und unseren Einfluss in der Branche stärken.

Today, he is seeing two patients, patient A and patient B. Patient A is infected with HIV, but patient B is not infected with HIV. Mike is trying to figure out how HIV-infected patient is different from the patient who is not infected with HIV. Would patient A have more or less T cells than patient B? Answer:","response":"Patient A, who is infected with HIV, would have less T cells than patient B, who is not infected with HIV. Here's the reasoning: 1. HIV, or Human Immunodeficiency Virus, primarily attacks CD4 T cells, which is a type of white blood cell that is a critical part of the human immune system. 2. Once inside the CD4 T cell, HIV replicates and destroys the cell, releasing more virus to infect more cells. This leads to the decline of CD4 T cells in the body. 3. As the number of CD4 T cells decreases, the body becomes more and more vulnerable to infections and diseases, even ones the body could typically fight off. 4. It's important to note that an HIV-positive individual (Patient A) may still have a normal or near-normal CD4 count in the early stages of HIV. But without treatment, the HIV infection will eventually result in a substantially lower CD4 count. So if we are comparing an HIV positive patient in the later stages of infection without treatment, they will likely have less T cells than an individual who is not infected (Patient B). 5. Thus, patient A, who is infected with HIV, is likely to have less T cells than patient B, who is not infected with HIV."},{"question":"Если значок OneNote был удален из области уведомлений панели задач, теперь он там появится.

Hemophilia is caused by a lack of clotting factors in the blood. Clotting factors are normally released by platelets. Since people with hemophilia cannot produce clots, any cut can put a person at risk of bleeding to death. The risk of internal bleeding is also increased in hemophilia, especially into muscles and joints. This disease affected the royal families of Europe. I am facing a new situation today: Two women go into a doctor's office for a routine physical. As is usual for a physical, the doctor takes a blood sample from both women to analyze for any issues. Upon looking at the blood, the doctor notices that Jan's platelet count is low, but other than that her blood is fine. Marcia's platelet count is not low and she has no other issues.

Here's the step-by-step justification for this answer: 1. The premise states that \\"An elderly woman gets her blood pressure checked.\\" 2. This statement informs us that the elderly woman is having her blood pressure measured, but it does not provide any context as to why or when this is happening. 3. The hypothesis suggests that \\"An elderly woman has her annual checkup.\\" 4. This statement implies that the elderly woman undergoes a regular checkup, usually encompassing various aspects of her health, including blood pressure. 5.

The premise could also refer to other scenarios not related to an annual checkup, such as a one-time visit to the doctor due to a specific health concern.

The Saudi couple, who have two children, split for the second time in May. Mrs Abuchian wants to keep their penthouse flat in London's Regents Park. But her ex-husband says the flat's his, not hers, and he wants to sell it. The pair are arguing over how much time they spent there before the split. Mr Justice Mostyn said the wife was entitled to continue her fight in England. Article:","response":"Title: Saudi Couple's Divorce Battle Over London Penthouse Continues in England Introduction: The divorce battle between Sheikh Abdul Maksoud Khoja, 89, and his ex-wife Melina Abuchian, 63, continues as they fight over the ownership of their penthouse flat in London's prestigious Regents Park. The Saudi couple, who have two children together, ended their union for the second time in May. Now, the legal dispute moves to England. Step 1: Detailing the couple's marital history and their respective claims Sheikh Abdul Maksoud Khoja and Melina Abuchian's relationship has been marred by separation, with the couple divorcing twice in the past. Mrs. Abuchian asserts that she is entitled to keep the luxurious penthouse, while her ex-husband claims it is his property and wants to put it up for sale. Step 2: Discussing the arguments and justification from both parties A significant aspect of the dispute centers around the time the couple spent in the London flat prior to their split. This factor is crucial in establishing which party has a stronger claim to the property. Both Sheikh Khoja and Mrs. Abuchian are expected to present evidence to support their cases and potentially persuade the presiding judge in their favor. Step 3: Mentioning the involvement of the English courts Despite the couple's Saudi origin, England's legal system is now involved in the resolution of this intensely personal matter. The involvement of the English courts indicates that the outcome of this case could potentially have international implications and set a precedent for similar disputes between high-net-worth individuals from different countries. Step 4: Quoting Mr. Justice Mostyn's statement As the case progresses in England, Mr. Justice Mostyn has given his verdict on the matter. He stated that Mrs. Abuchian is entitled to continue her fight for the London penthouse in the English courts. This decision gives hope to Mrs. Abuchian, who seeks to secure the contested property for herself. Conclusion: As the high-stakes divorce battle between Sheikh Abdul Maksoud Khoja and his ex-wife Melina Abuchian unfolds, the focus remains on the contested London penthouse in Regents Park. With both parties adamant about their claims to the luxurious asset, the English courts will play a crucial role in determining the fate of this opulent property. The outcome of this case could potentially serve as a benchmark for future disputes between wealthy international couples. Mrs. Abuchian's battle continues, awaiting the final decision on the ownership of the coveted London penthouse."},{"question":"If I tell you that Snapping a rubber band can cause noise, and ask you the question \\"what can snapping a rubber band cause?\\", is the correct answer \\"waves\\"?

New to the city, she rides to the end of the line, where Orfeu introduces her to the station guard, Hermes (Alexandro Constantino), who gives her directions to the home of her cousin Serafina (LÃ©a Garcia). Although engaged to Mira (Lourdes de Oliveira), Orfeu is not very enthusiastic about the upcoming marriage. The couple go to get a marriage license. When the clerk at the courthouse hears Orfeu's name, he jokingly asks if Mira is Eurydice, annoying her. Afterward, Mira insists on getting an engagement ring. Though Orfeu has just been paid, he would rather use his money to get his guitar out of the pawn shop for the carnival. Mira finally offers to loan Orfeu the money to buy her ring. When Orfeu goes home, he is pleased to find Eurydice staying next door with Serafina. Eurydice has run away to Rio to hide from a strange man who she believes wants to kill her. The man â Death dressed in a stylized skeleton costume â finds her, but Orfeu gallantly chases him away. Orfeu and Eurydice fall in love, yet are constantly on the run from both Mira and Death.

Orfeu, Mira, and Serafina are the principal members of a samba school, one of many parading during Carnival. Serafina decides to have Eurydice dress in her costume so that she can spend more time with her sailor. A veil conceals Eurydice's face; only Orfeu is told of the deception.

It tells us when the information about its path around the sun was recorded. 2. Escape velocity of 0: Escape velocity helps us know how fast something needs to go to leave the space rock. In this case, it's saying the speed is 0, which is a bit strange - so maybe they made a mistake or left out some information. 3.

So think first.","response":"To determine which of the two sentences is against common sense, let's consider what people usually do in their daily routines: - Sentence A: \\"My father reads the newspaper in the morning.\\" Reading the newspaper in the morning is a common activity for many people. They do this to catch up on news, weather, sports, and other topics of interest. Therefore, this sentence aligns with common sense. - Sentence B: \\"My father reads the radio in the morning.\\" Reading a radio is not a typical way to interact with it. Radios are used for listening, not reading. People usually listen to the radio for news, music, or talk shows.

Those who openly disagree with official teachings are condemned as \\"apostates\\" who are \\"mentally diseased\\". Answer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What religion encourages its adherents to think critically?","response":"Buddhism is a religion that encourages its adherents to think critically. This approach is in line with the teachings of its founder, Siddhartha Gautama, also known as the Buddha. Unlike many other religious beliefs that rely on a strict set of doctrines and require unwavering faith, Buddhism encourages followers to question, investigate, and analyze the teachings to arrive at a deeper understanding of reality. One of the core principles in Buddhism is the Kalama Sutta, which emphasizes the importance of critical thinking and personal experience in the search for truth. In this text, the Buddha advises the Kalamas, a group of people seeking spiritual guidance, not to accept any teaching or doctrine based on tradition, authority, or personal belief alone. Instead, he instructs them to analyze teachings for themselves and accept them only if they find them to be true through personal experience and logical reasoning. Buddhism places a strong emphasis on self-discovery and personal growth through meditation and mindfulness practices. By cultivating awareness and understanding of one's own thoughts, emotions, and actions, an individual can recognize the patterns of suffering and overcome them. This process of introspection and self-examination drives Buddhists to be critical thinkers who are encouraged to question their own experiences and beliefs. There are various schools of Buddhism, such as Theravada, Mahayana, and Vajrayana, which offer different perspectives and practices, but all share the fundamental teachings of the Buddha. These schools also encourage their followers to engage in critical thinking and evaluate the teachings rationally. Moreover, Buddhism is open to the incorporation of modern scientific findings and knowledge, which is seen as another way to enhance and deepen one's understanding of its principles. In conclusion, Buddhism is a religion that encourages its adherents to think critically and question the teachings. Through introspection, personal experience, and logical reasoning, individuals can arrive at a deeper understanding of the path to enlightenment and the nature of reality. The open-minded and inquisitive nature of Buddhism leaves room for personal growth, exploration, and the pursuit of wisdom."},{"question":"Complete: nanny ogg rushed forward and stared over the edge , just in time to see a dim figure vanish in the mists . all three figures left on the tower took a deep breath . \` it 's a trick , ' said lily , \` to get me off guard .

India's coastline measures 7,517 kilometres (4,700 mi) in length; of this distance, 5,423 kilometres (3,400 mi) belong to peninsular India and 2,094 kilometres (1,300 mi) to the Andaman, Nicobar, and Lakshadweep island chains. According to the Indian naval hydrographic charts, the mainland coastline consists of the following: 43% sandy beaches; 11% rocky shores, including cliffs; and 46% mudflats or marshy shores.Major Himalayan-origin rivers that substantially flow through India include the Ganges and the Brahmaputra, both of which drain into the Bay of Bengal. Important tributaries of the Ganges include the Yamuna and the Kosi; the latter's extremely low gradient often leads to severe floods and course changes. Major peninsular rivers, whose steeper gradients prevent their waters from flooding, include the Godavari, the Mahanadi, the Kaveri, and the Krishna, which also drain into the Bay of Bengal; and the Narmada and the Tapti, which drain into the Arabian Sea. Coastal features include the marshy Rann of Kutch of western India and the alluvial Sundarbans delta of eastern India; the latter is shared with Bangladesh. India has two archipelagos: the Lakshadweep, coral atolls off India's south-western coast; and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, a volcanic chain in the Andaman Sea.The Indian climate is strongly influenced by the Himalayas and the Thar Desert, both of which drive the economically and culturally pivotal summer and winter monsoons. The Himalayas prevent cold Central Asian katabatic winds from blowing in, keeping the bulk of the Indian subcontinent warmer than most locations at similar latitudes. The Thar Desert plays a crucial role in attracting the moisture-laden south-west summer monsoon winds that, between June and October, provide the majority of India's rainfall. Four major climatic groupings predominate in India: tropical wet, tropical dry, subtropical humid, and montane.

Inside the theater the movie echoed him: \\"Because all of you of Earth are idiots!\\" Tom sighed, not for the first time that evening. The Manager, who paid in cash every Sunday, had decided to take advantage of the bizarre tastes of his Generation X clients and offer an Ed Wood film festival. Bride of the Monster, Plan 9 From Outer Space, and Night of the Ghouls ran on the second, smaller screen on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, two bucks a head. The Manager was making a killing. Tom, who needed the job in order to move out of his parents' trailer home, found little about the Ed Wood canon amusing, although it was light-years beyond anything by Coleman Francis. Even so, Tom had been forced to hear the dialog of each film, on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday... He only had to watch them once, having filled in for the Manager's weasel-featured nephew/projectionist Neoldner, who had called in sick to buy grass in Beloit. But he would have been able to forget the experience had it not been for the penetrating soundtrack which bled into the lobby. The ordeal, for tonight, was almost over - the concession stand closed after Plan 9.

But even as Trump and his Republican allies close in on the goal of passing tax reform, the Russia investigation continues to be a major distraction. The recent plea deal between Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and the office of special counsel Robert Mueller sent shockwaves around Washington and at the very least seemed to indicate the Russia probe is a long way from being completed. Trump is banking on a tax cut victory to shore up his political base and show supporters and detractors alike that he is a man of his word when it comes to delivering on his campaign promises. House and Senate negotiators are now working to resolve differences in the two versions with hopes of final votes in the coming weeks. But even if the tax plan is enacted into law, its impact is not likely to be felt for at least a year. And polls show the plan has less than majority support. Trump insists the tax cuts will lead to economic growth and more jobs. “I will tell you this is in a nonbraggadocio way,” Trump told supporters in Missouri recently. “There has never been a 10-month president that has accomplished what we have accomplished. That I can tell you.” Democrats oppose the tax plan but lack the votes to stop it. “It rewards the rich in terms of individuals and corporations at the expense of tens of millions of working middle class families in our country,” warned House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. Despite his poor standing in national polls, just less than 40 percent approval in most surveys, Trump’s base is largely sticking with him. The latest American Values Survey by the Public Religion Research Institute found that 84 percent of Republicans continue to back the president. Question: Why is Trump trying to pass this tax plan?

Its simple unison violin accompaniment and its consoling rhythms apparently brought tears to Burney's eyes. It is followed by a quiet chorus that leads to the bass's declamation in D major: \\"Behold, I tell you a mystery\\", then the long aria \\"The trumpet shall sound\\", marked pomposo ma non-allegro (\\"dignified but not fast\\"). Handel originally wrote this in da capo form, but shortened it to dal segno, probably before the first performance. The extended, characteristic trumpet tune that precedes and accompanies the voice is the only significant instrumental solo in the entire oratorio. Handel's awkward, repeated stressing of the fourth syllable of \\"incorruptible\\" may have been the source of the 18th-century poet William Shenstone's comment that he \\"could observe some parts in Messiah wherein Handel's judgements failed him; where the music was not equal, or was even opposite, to what the words required\\". After a brief solo recitative, the alto is joined by the tenor for the only duet in Handel's final version of the music, \\"O death, where is thy sting?\\" The melody is adapted from Handel's 1722 cantata Se tu non-lasci amore, and is in Luckett's view the most successful of the Italian borrowings. The duet runs straight into the chorus \\"But thanks be to God\\".The reflective soprano solo \\"If God be for us\\" (originally written for alto) quotes Luther's chorale Aus tiefer Not. It ushers in the D major choral finale: \\"Worthy is the Lamb\\", leading to the apocalyptic \\"Amen\\" in which, says Hogwood, \\"the entry of the trumpets marks the final storming of heaven\\". Handel's first biographer, John Mainwaring, wrote in 1760 that this conclusion revealed the composer \\"rising still higher\\" than in \\"that vast effort of genius, the Hallelujah chorus\\". Young writes that the \\"Amen\\" should, in the manner of Palestrina, \\"be delivered as though through the aisles and..., what would be the answer ?

I will consider choosing a topic relevant to current issues or trends. In this case, I'll choose \\"remote work during the COVID-19 pandemic\\" as my topic. Step 2: Researching the topic Now that I have my topic, I will gather information and data about remote work and the COVID-19 pandemic. I will consult reputable sources such as research articles, surveys, and news articles to understand the challenges and benefits of remote work during this period. Step 3: Identifying a specific question or problem After gaining knowledge about the topic, I will identify a specific question or problem within the context of remote work during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this case, my question will be: \\"How does remote work during the COVID-19 pandemic impact employee productivity?\\" Step 4: Generating the context The context will be a summary of the topic and its relevance in the current scenario. My context is as follows: \\"Remote work has become increasingly prevalent during the COVID-19 pandemic, with a significant percentage of the global workforce transitioning to working from home. This sudden change has led to a myriad of challenges and benefits associated with remote work, including its impact on employee productivity. Various factors like technological tools, time management, and communication play a crucial role in either improving or hindering productivity.\\" Step 5: Formulating a hypothesis Based on the context and the question identified, I will now generate a hypothesis by making an educated prediction about the relationship between the variables involved. My hypothesis will be: \\"Remote work during the COVID-19 pandemic will have a positive impact on employee productivity when appropriate technological tools, time management strategies, and effective communication channels are in place.\\" This hypothesis suggests that if the necessary tools and strategies are implemented, remote work during the pandemic might lead to improved productivity.

The text highlights that Knight is an American actor and musician, known for playing roles in \\"17 Again\\", \\"Sonny with a Chance\\", \\"So Random!\\", \\"Melissa & Joey\\", and \\"Starstruck\\". These productions are popular, especially within the Disney Channel audience, but there is no concrete evidence or statistics provided to support the claim that he has been seen by billions of people. Typically, television series and movies, even those associated with popular networks like Disney Channel, do not accumulate billions of viewers. Popularity in terms of television viewership is often measured in millions, rather than billions. For example, global hits such as \\"Game of Thrones\\" had around 44 million viewers per episode during its peak. Only a few major global events have been known to reach the billion-viewer mark, such as the FIFA World Cup or the Olympics. Given that the projects Sterling Knight has been involved in primarily cater to specific demographics and are limited by the reach of the Disney Channel, it is unlikely that he has been seen by billions of viewers. The claim might be an exaggeration of his popularity, and to accurately determine the truth behind it, we would need to obtain more precise data on the viewership for each project he participated in and their potential reach internationally."},{"question":"Objective: What's a shake that can be made with fruit? Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning? Choices: * You can make a watermelon lemonade shake with watermelon, vanilla ice cream and lemons. * You can make a watermelon lemonade shake with corn, vanilla ice cream and lemons.","response":"The more sound solution in terms of naive physics reasoning for making a fruit shake is: You can make a watermelon lemonade shake with watermelon, vanilla ice cream, and lemons. This choice is more sound because it includes ingredients that are primarily fruits and complements the primary objective of creating a fruit-based shake. The combination of watermelon and lemons provides a refreshing and fruity base for the shake, while the vanilla ice cream adds creaminess and sweetness to the mixture. Watermelon is a fruit that is well-known for its high water content, making it a perfect ingredient for a shake. It is also an excellent source of vitamins and minerals such as vitamin C, vitamin A, potassium, and lycopene, a powerful antioxidant, all of which have a range of health benefits. Combining watermelon with lemons creates a delicious blend of flavors that can be both sweet and tangy. Lemons are also a rich source of vitamin C, which makes this shake a healthy choice. Vanilla ice cream, while not providing the same level of nutrients as fruits, adds a creamy and delicious texture to the shake. It also helps balance the acidity of the lemons and sweetness of the watermelon, creating a well-rounded flavor profile. It is essential to choose a good quality, natural vanilla ice cream that doesn't contain artificial flavors and additives, to maximize the taste and overall enjoyment of the shake. On the other hand, creating a watermelon lemonade shake with corn, vanilla ice cream, and lemons is not consistent with the main objective of making a fruit shake, as corn is not considered a fruit but a grain. Corn's natural sweetness might not adequately complement the flavors of the lemons and ice cream, and the texture of the corn may make the shake less appealing. Additionally, corn lacks the hydrating properties and fruity flavor found in watermelon, making it unsuitable for this recipe. In conclusion, making a watermelon lemonade shake with watermelon, vanilla ice cream, and lemons is the more sound solution in terms of naive physics reasoning since it uses fruit as the primary ingredient for the shake, resulting in a refreshing, flavorful, and nutritionally balanced beverage. Additionally, it aligns better with the goal of creating a fruit-based shake, making it an excellent choice."},{"question":"Generate a sentence that includes all the following words: architect, build, design, founder","response":"The founder of the company, a talented architect, was known for his ability to skillfully design and efficiently build creative structures."},{"question":"Given the question: One day in summer, little Jack was playing on the beach with his father. Suddenly, he saw a little tortoise moving slowly on the sand. He started to look at it carefully and began to touch it with his hand. To his surprise, the tortoise stopped moving. It pulled in its head and legs, and closed its shell tightly. He touched it again but the tortoise didn't move at all. Jack became angry. He used a stick and tried to make it open. When his father saw this, he stopped him and said, \\"No, son, you mustn't do that! You will kill the tortoise. You won't get it open with a stick.\\" Jack asked, \\"Why?\\" \\"Just wait and see,\\" his father answered. Then he picked up the tortoise and put it in a bag. After they came back home, the father took the tortoise out of the bag. He put it near the fireplace . After a few minutes, the tortoise began to move a little. Then the tortoise stretched out its head and legs. At last, the tortoise began to move across the room. How excited Jack was when he saw this! \\"Son, now you see,\\" said his father, \\"sometimes, you can't make someone do things he doesn't like. But if you get him warm first, he will do what you want him to do.\\" The writer may want to tell us that _ . A) people will do things we want them to do B) people won't do things we want them to do C) we can make people do things they don't like D) we can't make people do things they don't like The answer is:","response":"D) we can't make people do things they don't like The story of little Jack and the tortoise demonstrates a valuable lesson about understanding and respecting the wishes and desires of others. When Jack tried to force the tortoise to open its shell by poking it with a stick, his father stopped him and explained that this was not the right way to get the tortoise to do what he wanted. Instead, his father showed Jack that by creating a more favorable environment (in this case, warming the tortoise near the fireplace), the tortoise would naturally do what Jack wanted it to do – in this case, move and come out of its shell. The moral of the story is that we cannot force people to do things they don't like or do not feel comfortable doing. Trying to force someone to act in a certain way or do something against their will often results in resistance and reluctance. Instead, the best approach is to create an environment or situation where people feel comfortable, safe, and encouraged to take action on their own accord. This can involve providing support, understanding, and empathy, while respecting their feelings and desires. As demonstrated by the father's wise words and actions, one cannot simply coerce or force someone into compliance or cooperation when they are not willing to do so. True cooperation and understanding come from a place of respect, empathy, and consideration for the other person's desires and motivations. By creating an environment in which people feel understood and encouraged to share their true thoughts and feelings, we can foster positive and productive communication and relationships. Thus, the writer wants to convey the message that we cannot make people do things they don't like, but rather we should try to understand and respect their desires and preferences, and work together in a more supportive and cooperative manner."},{"question":"Consider the question.

Select from: [a]. yes [b]. it is not possible to tell [c]. no","response":"[c]. no The premise does not entail the hypothesis. Let's break down both the premise and the hypothesis to better understand why they are not connected. Premise: The given premise argues that blaming evil leaders instead of the institution of government is an insufficient and weak argument. It compares this mindset to a slogan that suggests only criminal leaders are responsible for killing people, rather than acknowledging a larger systemic issue with governments. Essentially, this statement dismisses the idea that only evil leaders are to blame, implying that there are inherent problems in the institution of government that can lead to detrimental outcomes. Hypothesis: The hypothesis claims that it is considered courageous to believe that evil leaders, rather than the government itself, are responsible for causing harm. This statement appears to be promoting the argument that blaming individual leaders for problems is a brave stance. Contradiction between the premise and the hypothesis: The main contradiction lies in the attitudes towards the argument that evil leaders, not the government, are responsible. The premise strongly criticizes this argument as an evasion and being reminiscent of an NRA bumper sticker, pointing to underlying issues within the institution of government. On the other hand, the hypothesis suggests that holding this belief is considered courageous. As a result, the premise does not entail the hypothesis, as the two statements contrast in their evaluation of whether attributing blame to evil leaders or the government itself is valid or courageous.

Hypothesis: The men that did this to her are animals. Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Options: - yes - it is not possible to tell - no","response":"In order to discuss whether the premise entails the hypothesis, it is important to analyze the provided information and the context of the statements. The statement given as a premise describes a horrific and brutal act of violence against a woman. The hypothesis is a figurative statement that implies the men who committed this act behave like animals and lack human empathy, moral values, or civilized behavior. The question is if the premise, entailing the brutal act, logically leads to or supports the hypothesis, which is a judgment on the men's nature. Option 1: Yes One might argue that the premise does entail the hypothesis because the gang-rape and the subsequent butchering of the woman are such savage and inhumane acts that the men responsible cannot be considered as part of normal human society. The use of the word \\"animals\\" is a way of distancing them from the general human population, emphasizing their deviation from ordinary human morals and values. The fact that the men went beyond just sexually assaulting the woman and mutilated her shows that they have a disregard for human life and suffering, which some may argue, is a characteristic of animals or the basest behavior of a human being. This horrendous act seems to imply a lack of empathy and understanding of the consequences of their actions, lending support to the hypothesis that the men are \\"animals.\\" Option 2: It is not possible to tell On the other hand, some might argue that it is not possible to tell if the premise entails the hypothesis because the comparison to animals is a metaphor and depends on personal interpretation. Additionally, the information given only provides a brief description of the incident and does not provide any insights into the mental state, past experiences, or motivations of the men involved. Furthermore, it could be argued that labeling the perpetrators as \\"animals\\" is unfair to actual animals, as many animals show instances of empathy and cooperation within their species, and even across different species. What the men did was horrific and despicable, but attributing their actions to just being \\"animals\\" may oversimplify the complex reasons for their transgressions. Option 3: No One could argue that the premise does not entail the hypothesis because people are responsible for their choices and actions, and attributing such heinous crimes to being \\"animalistic\\" does not encompass the entire scope of the issue. Moreover, humans are rational beings and are fully aware of the consequences of their decisions, thereby making them responsible for their actions. The argument of labeling the men as animals does not adequately address the underlying factors behind their actions, such as the influence of social environment, upbringing, or possible psychological disorders.

(Adam Saleh via Twitter) An Arab American vlogger known for his YouTube pranks claimed he was kicked off a Delta Air Lines plane Wednesday morning because other passengers felt uncomfortable that he spoke to his mother on the phone in Arabic — an account that the airline company and at least one passenger have contradicted. Adam Saleh, a 23-year-old Internet personality, tweeted a video showing him and a friend, Slim Albaher, about to be removed from the plane. “Guys, we spoke a different language on the plane and now we’re getting kicked out,” a visibly upset Saleh said to the camera. “This is 2016. 2016. Look, Delta Air Lines are kicking us out because we spoke a different language. You guys are racist. I cannot believe my eyes.” As his video and subsequent tweets went viral, Saleh’s account was questioned by many on social media — even as his agent insisted to The Washington Post that the incident was not a prank. In the video, as Saleh panned the camera around the plane cabin, a few passengers waved. Several could be heard shouting: “Bye!” At least one passenger could be seen coming to Saleh’s defense, telling flight attendants that he thought what was happening was “insane.” “I am upset that that’s happening, really upset,” the passenger said. “Is there freedom of speech? They can speak in whatever language they want to on the plane.” Early Wednesday, Delta officials confirmed that two people were removed from the flight from London Heathrow International Airport to New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport. At first, the airline did not elaborate further, only saying that “a disturbance in the cabin resulted in more than 20 customers expressing their discomfort” and that it would conduct a full review after the plane landed. Wednesday evening, the airline released a new statement saying that Saleh and Albaher had been “provocative.” “Upon landing the crew was debriefed and multiple passenger statements collected,” the statement read. “Based on the information collected to date, it appears the customers who were removed sought to disrupt the cabin with provocative behavior, including shouting. This type of conduct is not welcome on any Delta flight. While one, according to media reports, is a known prankster who was video recorded and encouraged by his traveling companion, what is paramount to Delta is the safety and comfort of our passengers and employees. It is clear these individuals sought to violate that priority.” Anthony Ellis, a passenger on the flight, told The Post that he was seated a row ahead of Saleh and Albaher, and had heard one of them shouting something while the other filmed people’s reactions. Ellis, who speaks some Arabic, didn’t understand the word — and thought “maybe it was a goof that he was shouting to his friend.” The two were not acting maliciously, he said, but almost like some students heading to Cancun for spring break would be, Ellis said. When other passengers told them to stop shouting, however, it escalated. But Ellis said he did not hear Saleh speaking on the phone in Arabic. “He was never any part on the phone — I would have heard the whole conversation,” Ellis said. “If someone’s being racist, I would stand up right away. In this day in age, you defend each other. It wasn’t like that. I mean, this guy was trying to antagonize people. I think because they made it into such a big scenario, [Saleh] then kind of panicked a little bit.” Flight-tracking records showed the plane departed Heathrow at 11:03 a.m. local time, about an hour after its scheduled departure. It was scheduled to land at JFK around 2:45 p.m. [Muslim couple says they were kicked off Delta flight for using phone, saying ‘Allah’] Saleh’s tweets were shared tens of thousands of times. Within a few hours, the original video depicting him on the plane had been retweeted more than 300,000 times and #BoycottDelta had become the top trending topic worldwide on Twitter. On Wednesday, skeptics noted Saleh’s history and cast doubt on his account of getting kicked off a Delta flight. Saleh started making YouTube videos as a teenager and has since achieved some level of fame as a YouTube star and vlogger. He is known for playing pranks on people, and often those recorded pranks center on the different treatment of Muslims in everyday life. Some took place on airplanes, such as one Saleh posted in February titled “COUNTING DOWN IN ARABIC ON A PLANE EXPERIMENT!!” @seanmdavAesop wrote a fable on this:\\"The boy who brought vital attention to the seriousness of wolf attacks\\" — Bert Difig (@BertDifig1) December 21, 2016 Saleh and his friend later admitted at least one of their most popular videos, showing alleged discrimination by a New York City police officer, was staged. “It wasn’t [real], it was a dramatization [of] a reenactment of what happened to us whilst filming in our traditional clothing,” Saleh wrote in a subsequent video apology. “We just wanted to bring awareness to the world that we weren’t going to be treated unjustly.” Just last week, an Australian news site used airport security footage to debunk one of Saleh’s most recent video claims — that he stowed away in a suitcase to fly from Melbourne to Sydney. Saleh seemed aware of his reputation in a live-streamed video he took at the gate after he deplaned. “And on my mother’s life. . . . I’ll say it for the eighth time, this is not even over-exaggeration, this is literally exactly what happened,” Saleh said into the camera. “I cannot believe my eyes. I cannot believe what the heck just happened.” [British Muslim woman detained after flight attendant reports her for ‘suspicious behavior.’ She was reading a book.] His agent, Naz Rahman, said in a phone call from London that what happened on the plane was not staged. “This isn’t a prank; this is not a prank,” Rahman told The Post. “We wouldn’t go to this extent to do a prank. I know he’s a prankster, but you can see it clearly on video what’s happened there.” A call to Saleh went straight to voice mail, and he did not immediately respond to a text message Wednesday. But the New York Times said that it reached Saleh at Heathrow and that he insisted he wasn’t pulling a stunt. “The only thing I can say is, I would never film a phone video,” he told the Times. “That’s when it’s really serious, and I must film.” The Times noted that Saleh’s video camera “was in his luggage.” Rahman said Saleh had stopped over in London to spend a day there on the way back to New York after wrapping up an international trip that started Nov. 14. On Wednesday morning, Rahman said, he dropped Saleh off at the airport and was later told he had gotten onto the plane fine. “He always calls his parents every time he flies, just gets their blessing before he goes,” Rahman said. “Somebody shouted, ‘We don’t understand what you’re saying. You’re making us feel uncomfortable.’ It kind of erupted from there.” Please help us get back to NYC https://t.co/DPBoQ6MN8z — Adam Saleh (@omgAdamSaleh) December 21, 2016 In his interview with the New York Times, Saleh said another passenger swore at him and Albaher and suggested they be “chucked” off the plane. “At this point, me and Slim looked at each other,” Saleh told the Times. “We didn’t know what to do. We felt like we were terrorists.” Rahman said Saleh called him immediately after he was made to leave the plane. A subsequent tweet from Saleh — simply titled “Please help us get back to New York” — linked to a Periscope video that live-streamed their phone conversation, Rahman said. “I swear on my mother’s life they just kicked us out,” Saleh is seen telling Rahman. “This was their reason. They were like, ‘Oh, um, you spoke loud.’ And I’m like, what the hell? That’s your reason? That’s your excuse? Saying that we spoke loud? Then give us a warning if we spoke loud. We’ll say sorry, that’s it.” Delta airlines just kicked Adam and i off the plane because we were speaking Arabic… — Slim Albaher (@SlimmySlim94) December 21, 2016 Saleh told his agent that, despite protests from some other passengers on their side, they were made to deplane. “Everyone in there knew that what me and Slim did was just speak a different language,” Saleh said. “All the racist people in there, they were like, we feel uncomfortable. But since there were like 20 of those racist people, the captain came and he kicked us out.” On Twitter, Saleh said he had spoken to police at Heathrow airport and been made to go through security screening once more after the incident. A few hours after his initial video post, Saleh tweeted that he had been rebooked on another flight to New York City — on a different airline. Metropolitan Police Service spokesman Jack Griffith told The Post in an email police were called to Heathrow airport around 11 a.m. local time Wednesday after two passengers were removed from a plane. Officers escorted the two passengers to the terminal and helped them make alternate travel arrangements, he said. “They were not arrested and no offenses were disclosed,” Griffith said. When reached by phone, a Heathrow airport spokeswoman referred all questions to Delta and did not provide further details. “It’s not an airport issue,” she said. “It’s an airline issue.” [Advocates say complaints of ‘flying while Muslim’ often go nowhere] The Council on American-Islamic Relations released a statement Wednesday afternoon saying it was still trying to gather facts about the incident. “CAIR is concerned about any allegation that a passenger has been removed from a flight for speaking Arabic,” the statement read. “Racial and religious profiling of Muslims, and those perceived to be Muslim, is a real and continuing problem. We don’t yet know whether this case fits that troubling pattern, and are currently trying to determine the facts based on input from all parties involved in the incident.” The group has reported a growing number of incidents in which a Muslim person is removed from a flight because he or she posed an imaginary threat, dubbing the phenomenon “flying while Muslim.” The U.S. Department of Transportation announced last month that it would begin highlighting data on the number of discrimination complaints the agency receives, noting that such complaints against airlines had risen 37 percent in the first nine months of 2016 from the same period last year. Saleh’s purported encounter Wednesday is the latest in a string of tense, high-profile incidents that have taken place on Delta Air Lines flights in recent months. Last week, video emerged showing an officer dragging a woman from a Delta flight from Detroit after she refused to follow boarding rules, according to airline and airport officials. In November, not long after the presidential election, a Delta passenger recorded a man standing in the aisle of the plane, shouting about politics. “We got some Hillary b—— here?” he screamed. “Come on, baby! Trump! That’s what I’m talking about. Hey, baby! Donald Trump! He’s your president, every g—— one of [you]. If you don’t like it, too bad.” The man was allowed to remain on the Nov. 22 flight from Atlanta to Allentown, Pa. But Delta later apologized for the disruption, saying that the man shouldn’t have been able to stay in the plane. The airline told employees that the man “will never again be allowed on a Delta plane.” In October, Tamika Cross, a black physician, tried to come to the aid of a passenger who had fallen ill on their Delta flight — but was dismissed by a flight attendant who doubted that she was a medical professional, Cross said. Her experience triggered a change in Delta policy. During a Delta flight on Nov. 22 from Atlanta to Allentown, Pa., a passenger went on an pro-Trump rant that was caught on video.

Smith, still under contract with record label Atlantic Records, recruited the band's original lineup of Jasin Todd as guitarist, Brad Stewart on bass, and Barry Kerch on drums. Consistent for the first two album cycles, a few lineup changes followed in the late 2000s, eventually stabilizing with Smith and Kerch alongside Zach Myers on guitar and Eric Bass on bass. The group has released five studio albums: The band didn't start work on a follow up album until 2005, with the band finding the touring lifestyle too hectic to start writing or recording material. This however, left the band with limited time to record new music, with their record label pressuring the band to get the album out in a six-month time period. Despite the time restrictions, the label did not pressure the band on the album's musical direction after the commercial success of Leave a Whisper. The band worked with music producer Tony Battaglia, and chose to go in a more \\"mature\\" and \\"stripped down\\" direction for the album's sound, Kerch describing it as just \\"pure rock\\". During the same time, the band was also approached by Hollywood Records to record a song for a tribute album for the band Queen, something the band agreed to out of their respect for the band. They recorded a cover of the track \\"Tie Your Mother Down\\", which was released on Killer Queen: A Tribute to Queen, released in August 2005. The band released their second studio album, Us and Them, on October 4, 2005. The album debuted higher than Leave a Whisper on the Billboard 200 chart, peaking at number 23 versus Leave a Whisper's number 53 peak, but the album ultimately sold less than its predecessor. Despite this, the band's three singles from the album, \\"Save Me,\\" \\"I Dare You,\\" and \\"Heroes\\", ended up being more successful than their prior album's singles. The lead single, \\"Save Me\\" was the band's first to reach the number one spot on the Mainstream Rock Charts, and held the position for twelve weeks in a row. The second single, \\"I Dare You\\", also peaked at number 2 on the same chart. Notably, both songs were also the band's first to have crossover success on the Billboard Hot 100 charts, hitting 72 and 88 respectively. The band again toured heavily in support of the album, including the 2006 iteration of the SnoCore Tour with Seether, Flyleaf, and Halestorm, and later opening for the Godsmack and Rob Zombie co-headlining tour of North America. Promotional support came from other areas as well; then-American Idol contestant Chris Daughtry performed \\"I Dare You\\" live on the show, helping its crossover appeal, and was used as a theme song for WrestleMania 22. The success of the singles helped propel sales of the album in the long run, ultimately being certified gold by the RIAA on November 13, 2006. and as of 2013, Smith had estimated that sales sat at approximately 990,000 copies sold.

Paragraph : Bigger waves have more energy. Question: Compared to a 350 foot tall ocean tsunami, would a one inch ripple in a pond have more energy or less energy?? Answer:","response":"A one-inch ripple in a pond would have significantly less energy compared to a 350-foot tall ocean tsunami. The information provided in the paragraph states that bigger waves have more energy. Since a 350-foot tall tsunami is much bigger than a one-inch ripple, it implies that the ocean tsunami would contain much more energy. To further understand the difference, let's provide some additional insights into the energy associated with waves. In both cases, the energy is related to the height, size, and speed of the wave. For ocean tsunamis and pond ripples, their energy can be characterized as potential and kinetic energy. Potential energy refers to the stored energy in waves due to their size and height, while kinetic energy refers to the energy possessed by the wave as it moves and propagates. In the case of the 350-foot tsunami, its sheer size results in a tremendous amount of potential energy. When the tsunami travels across the ocean, its energy gets converted to kinetic energy, which is dependent on the wave's speed. Tsunamis are known for their fast speeds, sometimes reaching up to several hundred miles per hour, further increasing their energy. On the other hand, a one-inch ripple in a pond has minimal potential energy due to its small size. As the ripple spreads across the pond, the kinetic energy is also limited due to the slow speed at which it propagates. The interaction of this tiny ripple with the surrounding water has little to no significant impact, further highlighting its low energy. In conclusion, a 350-foot tall ocean tsunami possesses significantly more energy than a one-inch ripple in a pond. This difference in energy is attributed to the size, height, and speed of the waves. The larger and faster the wave, the more energy it carries."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Information: - Ajaccio is a French commune, prefecture of the department of Corse-du-Sud, and head office of the \\"Collectivité territoriale de Corse\\" (capital city of Corsica).

An army of men and elves battle Sauronâs forces in Mordor, where Prince Isildur of Gondor cuts the One Ring off of Sauron's finger, thereby temporarily destroying his physical shape, and decides to take care of the Ring himself, but the evil influence of the Ring corrupts Isildur, preventing him from destroying it in Mount Doom. Isildur is later killed by Orcs, and the Ring is lost for 2,500 years, found and owned by Gollum for five centuries. The Ring is then found by a Hobbit named Bilbo Baggins. Sixty years on, Bilbo celebrates his 111th birthday in the Shire, reuniting with his old friend Gandalf the Grey. Bilbo reveals he intends on leaving the Shire for one last adventure and leaves his inheritance to his nephew Frodo, including the Ring. Gandalf investigates the Ring, discovering its true identity and warns Frodo.

His invention was designed to sew leather and canvas materials, which were typically used for making shoes, saddlery, and other heavy-duty items. Thomas Saint's sewing machine utilized a hand crank to operate the needle's movement and create a chain stitch to join the various pieces of fabric together. Although Saint patented his invention, there is no evidence that his machine was ever successfully produced or used widely for sewing. Due to the lack of practical application, his design lay dormant for decades, and a working model of his machine had to be reconstructed from the original drawings, much later in the 20th century. In the years that followed Thomas Saint's invention, progress towards a more functional and practical sewing machine accelerated. French tailor Barthelemy Thimonnier patented a sewing machine that used a hooked needle and one thread in 1830. His machine, which created a chain stitch, was used to produce military uniforms for the French army. Thimonnier's sewing machine paved the way to create an awareness of the exciting potential of these mechanized tools. Then, in 1844, the English inventor John Fisher designed a machine that combined elements of Thimonnier's and Saint's designs and is thought to resemble the modern sewing machine more closely. However, due to the supposed loss of his patent paperwork, he did not gain recognition for his invention. American inventor Elias Howe also made significant strides in sewing machine development in the 1840s. Howe's invention, patented in 1846, utilized a lockstitch mechanism, which was more durable and reliable than the chain stitch produced by earlier machines. Howe's sewing machine used two threads – one passed through the eye of the needle, and the other came from a shuttle that moved through a small loop created by the needle's action. In 1851, Isaac Merritt Singer, another American inventor, revolutionized the sewing machine industry by introducing a model with significant improvements. Singer's sewing machine featured a foot treadle for easier operation, a shuttle mechanism that moved continuously in a straight line, and adjustable feed to control the movement of the fabric. Singer's design remains one of the most recognizable and successful sewing machines in history. Despite the fascinating history of sewing machine development, Thomas Saint can still be credited with inventing the very first sewing machine in 1790. However, it must be acknowledged that the combined efforts of inventors like Thimonnier, Fisher, Howe, and Singer contributed to the practical and widely used sewing machines we have today."},{"question":"Sunt de părere că, în acest caz, Comisia pentru petiţii a luat în considerare cererile cetăţenilor îngrijoraţi de distrugerea peisajului natural, de nerespectarea regulilor privind contractele şi protecţia mediului şi de activitatea semnificativă în domeniul construcţiilor.

Suarez praised the team's mentality, highlighting the lack of egos in the dressing room and the close-knit environment at Melwood as the factors that make performing together on the pitch seamless and enjoyable. At the age of 27, Luis Suarez has been attracting interest from Real Madrid but has made it clear that he is committed to Liverpool and cherishes his experiences with the club. He appreciates the recognition he received as the PFA Player of the Year and the camaraderie between teammates, reinforcing his desire to stay with the team in the long run."},{"question":"Q:Read the article and select the best answer. Article: One day, a train was approaching the small town of Cheekyville. On the train was a young man with a big suitcase. He was called William Warbler, and he looked very common indeed. What made him most unusual, though, was the fact that whenever he needed to communicate he did it by singing opera . It didn't matter to William whether it was simply a matter of answering a brief greeting, like \\"good day\\". He would clear his voice and respond, \\"Gooood dayyy to youuuuuuuu... toooooo!\\" No one could get a normal spoken word out of him and no one knew how he made his living. As he lived quite simply, always wearing his same old second-hand suit, people often looked down on him. William had been in Cheekyville for some years, when, one day, word spread round town like wildfire: William had played a role in a very important opera in the nation's capital. Everyone in the capital went to see it, and it was a great success. Everyone in Cheekyville felt it was a surprise. But something more surprising was, when William was being interviewed by reporters, he answered their questions by speaking rather than singing. And he did it with great manners, and with a clear and pleasant voice. From that day, William gave up singing at all hours. Now he did it only during his stage appearances and world tours. Some people suspected why he had changed, but others continued believing him to be somewhat mad. They wouldn't have thought so if they had seen what William kept in his big suitcase. It was a large stone, with a hand-carved message on it. The message said: \\"Practice, my boy. Practice every second, for you never know when your chance will come.\\" Little did people realize that he only got the role in the opera because the director had heard William singing while out buying a newspaper. Question: According to the text, William _ .

During her first night in town, The Lady saves Cort's life by shooting the rope Herod's men had hanged Cort from. She also meets \\"The Kid\\", a brash young man who runs the general store and who hopes to impress Herod. The Kid believes Herod is his father and that he can earn his father's respect by entering and winning the contest. In the first round of duels The Kid defeats a Swedish quick-draw champion while Herod kills a braggart named Ace Hanlon, who had taken credit for some of Herod's own accomplishments. The Lady defeats an enemy she had previously left shackled to a wagon. Cort, who has renounced violence and doesn't have a weapon, is taken to the general store. Herod buys Cort a gun and decrees that Cort (an exceptionally skilled gunfighter) can only have one bullet at a time so that he doesn't shoot his way out of town. Despite telling everyone he wouldn't fight, Cort winds up drawing his gun and winning his first round fight.

A previous reviwer wondered why Madame Tu is no longer sought by the HK press - the reason is that her views are predictable, largely irrelevant, and not news worthy.

Charles Spotswoode's son Jimmy became involved with \\"the Canary\\", a conniving showgirl. The Canary, determined to force Jimmy to marry her so she can join the social elite, threatens to reveal that Jimmy was embezzling from his father. She turns down the elder Spotswoode's bribe to leave Jimmy alone. She telephones two men she has been blackmailing, Cleaver and Mannix, and demands one final generous gift from each of them by the next day. She makes the same request of \\"creepy\\" admirer Dr. Lindquist. Her ex-husband Tony Sheel eavesdrops and wants half, but she refuses to give him anything, even after he hits her. Cleaver, Mannix and Lindquist are all shown lurking about her apartment building late that night. Spotswoode visits her at her apartment around midnight, but cannot get her to change her mind. After he reaches the lobby of her building, he and another person hear screams from her place. They knock on the door, but she assures them that she is fine. The Canary is found strangled the next day. The coroner places the time of death around midnight. District Attorney Markham investigates, aided by Philo Vance (a close friend of Charles Spotswoode) and Police Sergeant Heath. After all the suspects are brought in for questioning, Vance asks Markham to keep them waiting for a few hours. Markham agrees. Vance subtly maneuvers Cleaver, Mannix, Lindquist and the two Spotswoodes into playing poker to pass the time so he can observe their personality traits. Only one shows the daring, imagination and discipline required for the crime; that man bluffs Vance, betting everything with just a pair of deuces. The suspects are then released. Sheel, who witnessed the murder while hiding in the closet, sends the killer several blackmail letters. He too is strangled. A pen found at the scene has Jimmy's name on it, so Heath arrests him for the murder. Jimmy then confesses to both murders, but Vance knows better.

But one item may prove key: the national unemployment rate, which hit a 26-year high last month at 9.8%. On that front, economists and political pundits say, the majority party looks increasingly wobbly. \\"Unemployment is the leading economic indicator when it comes to politics,\\" said Democratic pollster Peter Hart. \\"Anytime unemployment hits double digits, it's hard to see the party in control having a good election year.\\" Economists generally predict that the number of people out of work will continue to inch up next year, even if the economy begins to rebound. Most see the jobless rate peaking at around 10.5% in the summer. Former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan said Sunday that his own hunch was that the economy would turn around over coming months, but that unemployment would \\"penetrate the 10% barrier and stay there for a while before we start down.\\" See how the unemployment rate and representation in the House has changed, going back to 1980. Voters generally turn against a newly elected president and his party in the midterm elections. Even with a booming economy, President Bill Clinton and the Democrats lost 52 House seats in 1994. The Republicans under President Ronald Reagan in 1982 are the only party since World War II to have gone into a midterm election with unemployment over 10%. They lost 26 House seats. Republicans are already harnessing voter unease over deficit spending and proposed changes to the health-care system. But they see the economy as the Democrats' main vulnerability. \\"The biggest threat to the president's party is not health care, a climate-change bill, or Afghanistan. It's jobs,\\" said John Feehery, a Republican strategist. Officials at the National Republican Campaign Committee said they planned to use the weak employment numbers to hammer at 54 Democratic House members that Republicans deem the most vulnerable in 2010. Republicans are particularly targeting the 49 House lawmakers in districts carried last November by Sen. John McCain, the Republican presidential nominee. People line up outside a job fair in Baltimore in September. \\"We'll continue to remind Democrats of their failed promises that led to what is now, at best, a jobless recovery,\\" said NRCC spokesman Paul Lindsay. Rep. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, who heads the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said he remained confident that the unemployment picture would improve by next fall. At the same time, he said, \\"the Republicans run a real risk of being seen as the party rooting for economic failure.\\" President Barack Obama and the Democrats are all the more exposed on the jobs front because they touted the 787 billion economic-stimulus bill as a way to curb job losses. The Obama team asserted in January that the recovery plan would keep unemployment below 8% and push it down to nearly 7% by the end of 2010. Obama aides have since said that they didn't grasp how sour the economy was at the time. Economists now generally believe that the stimulus package has cushioned the economic fall. But Republicans argue that it was a waste of money, and it isn't clear whether the Democratic argument -- that things would be worse without the stimulus -- will sway many voters. \\"The challenge for Democrats is it's just not that compelling to say, 'Things would be a lot worse if we didn't do X, Y and Z,' \\" said Stuart Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst. Demonstrators in 1982 protest high unemployment. The Obama administration and Democratic lawmakers are now scouring for ways to boost job creation and help the jobless, without proposing a second stimulus bill. One idea is to extend for another year the enhanced unemployment-insurance benefits set to expire in December, a move that could cost another 100 billion, by one estimate. A White House official cautioned, however, that such talk remained preliminary. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said Tuesday that Democrats may move ahead on extending some jobless benefits, such as a special subsidy for health insurance, but that any larger stimulus package was off the table for now. Turning the jobless rate around will require a more robust economic expansion than most predict will happen next year. The U.S. has lost 7.2 million jobs since the recession began at the end of 2007. Economists say U.S. output would have to grow by about 4.5% in 2010 to whittle away just 1% from the unemployment rate. That compares with the 3% to 4% growth many economists predict for next year. Yale University economist Ray Fair, who has built a fairly reliable economic model to predict presidential and House election outcomes, said that Democrats could still get lucky. If the economy turns around enough to start driving the jobless rate down by the fall of 2010, he said, \\"then the Democrats won't necessarily do as badly as people think now.\\" Write to Neil King Jr. at neil.king@wsj.com Title:","response":"Facing the Fallout: High Unemployment Threatens Democrats' 2010 Election Prospects Amid Rising Deficits and Public Concerns"},{"question":"This removable card stores the full contents of ECTACO Partner 13MT900 Multilingual Talking Electronic Dictionary and Audio PhraseBook and is one of many that can increase the functionality of your device and expand its capabilities.

On August 3, 1981, the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization union—which had supported Reagan—rejected the government's pay raise offer and sent its 16,000 members out on strike to shut down the nation's commercial airlines. They demanded a reduction in the workweek to 32 from 40 hours, a 10,000 bonus, pay raises up to 40%, and early retirement. Federal law forbade such a strike, and the Transportation department implemented a backup plan to keep the system running. The strikers were given 48 hours to return to work, else they would be fired and banned from ever again working in a federal capacity. A fourth of the strikers came back to work, but 13,000 did not. The strike collapsed, PATCO vanished, and the union movement as a whole suffered a major reversal, which accelerated the decline of membership across the board in the private sector. Schulman and Zelizer argue that the breaking of PATCO, \\"sent shock waves through the entire U.S. labor relations regime.... strike rates plummeted, and union power sharply declined.\\" Unions suffered a continual decline of power during the Reagan administration, with a concomitant effect on wages. The average first-year raise fell from 9.8% to 1.2%; in manufacturing, raises fell from 7.2% to negative 1.2%. Salaries of unionized workers also fell relative to non-union workers. Women and blacks suffered more from these trends. How many years after Reagan's election did the strike occur?","response":"The strike occurred in 1981, and Reagan was elected president in the 1980 presidential election. Therefore, the strike took place 1 year after Reagan's election."},{"question":"Week 11 saw the Lions trying to win their first game in Pittsburgh since 1955. The Steelers jumped out to an early 14-0 lead, when Ben Roethlisberger hit Antonio Brown with TD passes of 34 and 47 yards on consecutive drives. Detroit got on the board in the second quarter with a 35-yard David Akers field goal, but Pittsburgh went up by 14 again when Shaun Suisham connected on a 25-yard field goal. The Lions made the score 17-10 on the first play of their next possession, when Matthew Stafford found Calvin Johnson for a 79-yard TD pass play. After a 34-yard Suisham field goal, the Lions drew within 3 points when Stafford and Johnson connected again, this time for a 19-yard TD. The Lions took their first lead, 24-20, on a Joique Bell 2-yard run late in the quarter. Detroit had a chance to go up by 11 in the closing seconds of the first half, but after three incomplete passes from the Steelers' 1-yard line, they settled for a 19-yard Akers field goal to make the score 27-20. As the weather turned bad and the field got sloppy in the second half, so did the Lions offense. A 21-yard Suisham field goal was the only score of the third quarter, drawing the Steelers within 4 points at 27-23. The Lions got inside the Pittsburgh 10-yard line on their next possession, but failed to score on three straight plays before calling in the field goal unit. The Lions attempted a fake that failed, and following a Sam Martin fumble, the Steelers took over on their own 3-yard line. Roethlisberger engineered a game-winning 97-yard drive, culminating in a 1-yard TD pass to Will Johnson. The Steelers iced it on their next possession, going up 37-27 after Roethlisberger hit Jerricho Cotchery with a 20-yard TD pass. Matthew Stafford was 19-of-46 passing in the game for 362 yards, including just 3-for-16 in the second half, with many of his passes being dropped by Lions receivers. Ben Roethlisberger, meanwhile, went 29-of-45 for 367 yards and four touchdowns. Calvin Johnson led all players with 179 receiving yards and two touchdowns, but he was shut out in the second half. Despite the loss, Stafford (16,005 yards) passed Bobby Layne's Lion record of 15,710 career passing yards, while Johnson tied Herman Moore's team mark of four consecutive 1,000 yard receiving seasons.

It was established in 1336 by Harihara I and his brother Bukka Raya I of Sangama Dynasty. The empire rose to prominence as a culmination of attempts by the southern powers to ward off Islamic invasions by the end of the 13th century. It lasted until 1646, although its power declined after a major military defeat in the Battle of Talikota in 1565 by the combined armies of the Deccan sultanates. The empire is named after its capital city of Vijayanagara, whose ruins surround present day Hampi, now a World Heritage Site in Karnataka, India. The writings of medieval European travelers such as Domingo Paes, Fernão Nunes, and Niccolò Da Conti, and the literature in local languages provide crucial information about its history. Archaeological excavations at Vijayanagara have revealed the empire's power and wealth. The empire's legacy includes many monuments spread over South India, the best known of which is the group at Hampi. Different temple building traditions in South and Central India came together in the Vijayanagara Architecture style. This synthesis inspired architectural innovation in Hindu temples' construction. Efficient administration and vigorous overseas trade brought new technologies such as water management systems for irrigation. The empire's patronage enabled fine arts and literature to reach new heights in Kannada, Telugu, Tamil, and Sanskrit, while Carnatic music evolved into its current form.

London's former Mayor, Boris Johnson, has recently expressed his support for Ministers to actively campaign in favor of leaving the EU. This article will explore Johnson's stance on this controversial issue and discuss the possible impact of his endorsement on the Brexit referendum results. Johnson's Argument: Boris Johnson, known for his strong views on Brexit, opines that Ministers should not be barred from campaigning for the UK to leave the EU. According to him, Ministers have the right to express their opinions and represent the voice of those who are unsatisfied with the EU membership. He believes that Ministers should be allowed to advocate for leaving the EU, in order to foster a healthy democratic debate on the future relationship between the UK and Europe. Significance of Johnson's Support: As a prominent figure in UK politics, Boris Johnson's endorsement holds considerable weight and could potentially influence political and public opinion on the Brexit issue. His argument that Ministers should be allowed to campaign for leaving the EU introduces a new dimension to the debate, emphasizing the importance of politicians taking proactive stances to represent their constituents' interests. Critics' Reactions: Johnson's comments have been met with mixed reactions from colleagues and critics alike. Some argue that his support for Ministers campaigning to leave the EU may lead to a divided government and potential conflicts of interest. These critics contend that Ministers should remain neutral in order to effectively serve the people and maintain political stability. On the other hand, there are those that agree with Johnson's view, stating that those in power should be free to express their opinions and participate actively in important political conversations. They argue that political figures advocating for an EU exit demonstrates a vital part of democracy by allowing for diverse perspectives and encouraging constructive discourse. Potentially Influencing the Upcoming Referendum: With the Brexit referendum approaching, Boris Johnson's support for Ministers campaigning to leave the EU could serve to further polarize political opinion. The impact of his statements might help bolster the pro-Brexit campaign, swaying undecided voters and strengthening the determination of those already in favor of leaving the EU. Conclusion: Boris Johnson's assertion that Ministers should be allowed to campaign for the UK's exit from the EU has added fuel to the ongoing Brexit debate. His support for this controversial issue highlights the need for political leaders to engage in constructive discussions surrounding the country's future relationship with Europe. While it remains to be seen how this will ultimately affect the result of the forthcoming referendum, Johnson's endorsement has certainly generated a more nuanced and diverse dialogue on the topic."},{"question":"This is a correct answer to the following question about Susan Smith.

During her trial, the prosecution sought the death penalty; however, the jury ultimately decided against it, and Smith was instead sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole. Under South Carolina law, individuals sentenced to life in prison are eligible for parole after serving a minimum of 30 years. Consequently, Susan Smith will become eligible for parole in 2025, given that she was convicted in 1995. It is important to note that being eligible for parole does not necessarily guarantee that Susan Smith will be granted parole. The South Carolina Department of Probation, Parole, and Pardon Services (SCDPPPS) will take several factors into account in their decision-making process, such as Susan's behavior in prison, her level of remorse, the severity of the crime, and public sentiment. Ultimately, while Susan Smith is set to become eligible for parole in 2025, it remains to be seen whether the parole board will grant her release at that time or if she will continue to serve her sentence in prison."},{"question":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

Premise: \\"A multiple pointed.\\" Terms: multiple, pointed Hypothesis: \\"Large cathedral or church like building.\\" Terms: large, cathedral, church, building Step 2: Determine the relationship between the terms in the premise and hypothesis. There is no clear relationship between the terms in the premise and hypothesis. The premise refers to a vague description of something being \\"multiple pointed,\\" while the hypothesis refers to a specific type of building, a large church or cathedral. Step 3: Check if the premise gives enough information to support the hypothesis. As the premise refers to a general and non-specific description, it is not sufficient to support the hypothesis, which is more specific and focused on a particular type of structure. Step 4: Evaluate if the hypothesis can be entailed by the premise. The hypothesis cannot be entailed by the premise because the premise does not provide enough specific information to support the hypothesis. There is no clear link between something being \\"multiple pointed\\" and the building in question being a large cathedral or church. Conclusion: We cannot confirm that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise due to the lack of a clear relationship and the insufficient information provided by the premise."},{"question":"Write down the solution for this math problem: Solve 7*f = 177 + 184 - 389 for f.","response":"Step 1: Simplify the right side of equation first 177 + 184 - 389 = -28 Step 2: Substitute the simplified result back to the left side of the equation 7*f = -28 Step 3: To solve for 'f', divide both sides of the equation by 7 f = -28 / 7 Step 4: Calculate the value on the right side f = -4 So the solution for this equation is f = -4."},{"question":"I just took a test in school today.

We want to explore deep into the sea. However, we are not fish. We must breathe, so we can't stay underwater for long. To explore deep water, we face even more dangers and problems. A diver trying to stay underwater for a long time must breathe air or a special mixture of gases. He can wear a diving suit and have air pumped to him from above. He can carry a tank of air on his back and breathe through a special pipe. Water weighs 800 times as much as air. Tons of water pushes against a diver deep in the sea, so his body is under great pressure. When a diver is under great pressure, his blood takes in some of the gases he breathes. As he rises to the surface, the water pressure becomes less. If the diver rises too quickly, the gases in his blood form bubbles . The diver is then suffering from a kind of illness. This kind of illness can cause a diver great pains and even kill him. Question: The text is mainly about _ .

Lennon met Cynthia Powell (1939–2015) in 1957, when they were fellow students at the Liverpool College of Art. Although Powell was intimidated by Lennon's attitude and appearance, she heard that he was obsessed with the French actress Brigitte Bardot, so she dyed her hair blonde. Lennon asked her out, but when she said that she was engaged, he screamed out, \\"I didn't ask you to fuckin' marry me, did I?\\" She often accompanied him to Quarrymen gigs and travelled to Hamburg with McCartney's girlfriend to visit him. Lennon was jealous by nature and eventually grew possessive, often terrifying Powell with his anger and physical violence. Lennon later said that until he met Ono, he had never questioned his chauvinistic attitude toward women. He said that the Beatles song \\"Getting Better\\" told his own story, \\"I used to be cruel to my woman, and physically – any woman. I was a hitter. I couldn't express myself and I hit. I fought men and I hit women. That is why I am always on about peace.\\"Recalling his July 1962 reaction when he learned that Cynthia was pregnant, Lennon said, \\"There's only one thing for it Cyn. We'll have to get married.\\" The couple wed on 23 August at the Mount Pleasant Register Office in Liverpool, with Brian Epstein serving as best man. His marriage began just as Beatlemania was taking off across the UK. He performed on the evening of his wedding day and would continue to do so almost daily from then on. Epstein feared that fans would be alienated by the idea of a married Beatle, and he asked the Lennons to keep their marriage secret. Julian was born on 8 April 1963; Lennon was on tour at the time and did not see his infant son until three days later.Cynthia attributed the start of the marriage breakdown to Lennon's use of LSD, and she felt that he slowly lost interest in her as a result of his use of the drug. When the group travelled by train to Bangor, Wales in 1967 for the Maharishi Yogi's Transcendental Meditation seminar, a policeman did not recognise her and stopped her from boarding. She... The answer is:","response":"Julian. In the text, it states \\"Julian was born on 8 April 1963\\", referring to the son of the couple, John Lennon and Cynthia Powell.

To better understand the relationship between these two statements, let's break each one down. The first statement describes the following elements: 1. There are two people involved. 2. They are riding along the side of the road. 3. They are using bicycles as their mode of transportation. 4. The person in front is wearing a helmet for safety. The second statement, on the other hand, includes the following elements: 1. There are two people involved. 2. They are riding along the side of the road. 3. Their mode of transportation is scooters. 4. The person in front is wearing a straw hat, presumably for sun protection or style purposes. Between the two statements, there are three common elements: 1. Both scenarios involve two people. 2. In both cases, the individuals are riding along the side of the road. 3. Both stories emphasize on the headgear worn by the person in front. However, each statement also contains a unique aspect, which differentiates one scenario from the other. In the first statement, they are riding bicycles and wearing helmets—this detail highlights the focus on safety. In contrast, the second statement involves scooters and straw hats, shifting the focus more toward leisure or casual transportation. It is important to keep in mind that these two scenarios can stand separately, and one does not imply the occurrence of the other. They share some similarities in terms of structure and components, but they illustrate distinct situations. Consequently, one cannot infer that the first statement means the occurrence of the second statement."},{"question":"thursday, november 8th. day broke on a city in the wildest excitement and confusion, a whole nation having up in long hissing swells of storm.

All we remember of our first encounter was that we were quickly smitten. With your advice (yes to backcombed hair, no to sensible shoes), celebrity gossip and knowledge of all things boy-shaped, you were like the most popular girl at school… except you actually wanted to hang out with us. Every Wednesday we would hot-foot it to the newsagent and hand over 70p and revel in your company. The shop shelves were filled with other teen mags, but they were never as cool as you.

Does the Electoral College have the power to reject Trump, or any candidate for that matter, if enough electors decided to change their vote? Multi-choice problem: Are these two questions inquiring about the same information? Possible answers: a). no. b). yes.","response":"b). yes. Both questions are essentially asking whether electors in the Electoral College can change their vote and potentially impact the outcome of the presidential election. I will provide a detailed and long answer for this inquiry. The Electoral College is the process used in the United States for electing the president and vice-president. It consists of 538 electors chosen by the political parties across the states and the District of Columbia, who meet in their respective states and cast their votes for the president and vice president. While the electors are expected to vote for the candidate who has won the popular vote in their state, in some cases, they may decide to change their vote, and these individuals are called \\"faithless electors.\\" Over the history of the United States, there have been a few instances of faithless electors, but their actions have never significantly impacted the outcome of a presidential election. If Trump were to win enough votes to secure the Electoral College but faced a significant number of faithless electors voting for Hillary, the outcome of the election would depend on the number of electors who changed their votes and the specific laws in the elector's state. There are some states with laws that bind their electors to vote for the candidate who won the popular vote in the state, and electors who change their votes may face repercussions like fines or may be replaced. In other states, electors are not legally bound, and they can vote for any candidate of their choice. In a hypothetical scenario where a large number of electors jump ship and vote for the other candidate, and the total number of electoral votes changed is large enough to impact the election result, it would likely spark intense debate and controversy. This could lead to legal challenges and perhaps necessitate the intervention of the courts to determine the legitimacy of the faithless electors' actions. Technically, the Electoral College does have the power to reject a candidate if enough electors decide to change their vote. However, as mentioned earlier, there are state laws and potential consequences that discourage electors from going against the popular vote. If such a situation were to occur, the political and legal ramifications would be significant and could potentially challenge the legitimacy of the Electoral College system. It would also likely trigger calls for electoral reform to avoid similar situations in the future. In summary, while it is possible for electors in the Electoral College to change their votes and potentially impact the outcome of the presidential election, the overall likelihood of this happening is low due to existing state laws and the historical precedent of faithless electors having a minimal effect on election outcomes. However, if a situation like this were to occur, it would almost certainly lead to political and legal challenges and could potentially raise concerns about the legitimacy of the Electoral College system."},{"question":"How do you say \\"Only compliance with the laws and the ethical awakening of the profession can end this situation.\\" in Spanish?","response":"Para decir \\"Only compliance with the laws and the ethical awakening of the profession can end this situation.\\" en español, puedes decir: \\"Sólo el cumplimiento de las leyes y el despertar ético de la profesión pueden poner fin a esta situación.\\" Aquí, estamos hablando de seguir las reglas (leyes) y ser buenos y justos (despertar ético) en nuestro trabajo (profesión) para solucionar un problema (situación)."},{"question":"What is an example of a tweet?","response":"An example of a tweet could be one that conveys information, opinion, or is a response to another user's tweet, while adhering to the 280-character limit imposed by Twitter.

Sentence 2: There settlement was self dependent and relied on ships. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","response":"Yes, the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence. In the given context, entailment refers to the idea that a sentence logically follows from another sentence due to the information conveyed. In the first sentence, we are provided with the following information: 1. The settlement was fiercely independent. 2. The settlement had its own fishing fleet. 3. The settlement had its own shipbuilding industry. Based on this information, we observe that the settlement had its own resources and infrastructure (i.e., a fishing fleet and a shipbuilding industry) which directly enabled it to maintain a certain level of self-sufficiency and independence. When analyzing the second sentence, \\"The settlement was self-dependent and relied on ships,\\" we note that it presents two main pieces of information: 1. The settlement was self-dependent. 2. The settlement relied on ships. Given the context of the first sentence, we can deduce that since the settlement had its own fishing fleet and shipbuilding industry, it could support its own needs. This fact correlates with the idea of self-dependence in the second sentence. Furthermore, since fishing and shipbuilding industries inherently involve the use of ships, it's reasonable to infer that the settlement relied on ships in some capacity. This information is also congruent with the second sentence. In conclusion, the second sentence is indeed entailed by the first sentence, as both sentences emphasize the settlement's self-dependence nature and reliance on ships in their unique capacities."},{"question":"Используйте размер шрифта и стиль, поддерживаемые на компьютерах пользователей.

The Secret Service initiated a number of security enhancements around the White House complex. The officials who issued these orders did not know that there were additional hijacked aircraft, or that one such aircraft was en route to Washington. These measures were precautionary steps taken because of the strikes in New York. The FAA and White House Teleconferences. The FAA, the White House, and the Defense Department each initiated a multiagency teleconference before 9:30. Because none of these teleconferences-at least before 10:00- included the right officials from both the FAA and Defense Department, none succeeded in meaningfully coordinating the military and FAA response to the hijackings. At about 9:20, security personnel at FAA headquarters set up a hijacking teleconference with several agencies, including the Defense Department. The NMCC officer who participated told us that the call was monitored only periodically because the information was sporadic, it was of little value, and there were other important tasks. The FAA manager of the teleconference also remembered that the military participated only briefly before the Pentagon was hit. Both individuals agreed that the teleconference played no role in coordinating a response to the attacks of 9/11. Acting Deputy Administrator Belger was frustrated to learn later in the morning that the military had not been on the call. At the White House, the video teleconference was conducted from the Situation Room by Richard Clarke, a special assistant to the president long involved in counterterrorism. Logs indicate that it began at 9:25 and included the CIA; the FBI; the departments of State, Justice, and Defense; the FAA; and the White House shelter. The FAA and CIA joined at 9:40. The first topic addressed in the White House video teleconference-at about 9:40-was the physical security of the President, the White House, and federal agencies. Immediately thereafter it was reported that a plane had hit the Pentagon. We found no evidence that video teleconference participants had any prior information that American 77 had been hijacked and was heading directly toward Washington.

Is cell Y moving up or down the concentration gradient? Gary is a high school student examining two cells under a microscope for his biology class. In a petri dish, marked Cell X, Gary sees that substances inside the cell are spreading apart from each other making it less concentrated. In the dish marked Cell Y, Gary sees substances coming together and moving into close proximity to one another. Hint: Active transport occurs when a substance passes through the cell membrane with the help of extra energy. This happens when a substance moves from an area where it is less concentrated to an area where it is more concentrated. This is the opposite of diffusion. The substance moves up, instead of down, the concentration gradient. Like rolling a ball uphill, this requires an input of energy. The energy comes from the molecule named ATP (adenosine triphosphate). The energy allows special transport proteins called pumps to move substances to areas of higher concentration. An example is the sodium-potassium pump. The answer to this question is:","response":"Cell Y is moving up the concentration gradient. Step 1: Understanding the situation described in the paragraph - Cell X: Substances inside the cell are getting less concentrated (spreading apart) - Cell Y: Substances are coming together and becoming more concentrated (closer proximity) Step 2: Considering the hint provided - Active transport occurs when a substance moves from an area of lower concentration to an area of higher concentration, which requires additional energy (ATP) Step 3: Analyzing Cell Y's behavior - Substances in Cell Y are coming together and becoming more concentrated, indicating that they are moving from an area of lower concentration to an area of higher concentration. Step 4: Conclusion - Based on the hint and Cell Y's behavior, it can be concluded that Cell Y is moving up the concentration gradient, as it requires additional energy for the substances to move towards a higher concentration area."},{"question":"Read this: Constantius, ordered Liberius into exile in 356 giving him, then, three days to comply.

Article: Off the coast of Hawaii's Big Island swim masses of colorful tropical fish. Some of these fish will be caught and sold, ending up in aquariums around the world. Is the industry putting populations of the fish at risk? Scientists who have studied the Big Island fishery say it is well managed. Rules put in place more than 15 years ago have helped to protect the fish. Along 35% of the coastline, for example, fish collecting is banned. Two years ago, the state cut the number of fish species for the aquarium trade from hundreds to just 40. Conservationist Robert Wintner objects to the findings. Wintner, who owns snorkel shops across Hawaii, started the Snorkel Bob Foundation to protect the island's coral reefs . He says he simply doesn't see yellow tang in the protected areas. \\"There should be millions of them,\\" he says. \\"Where are they?\\" Wintner says people believe the numbers in reports. But few people have actually dived into the coral reefs to see for themselves how many fish can be found there.

To do this, add 429*r to both sides of the equation. 31*r + 429*r - 745 = -429*r + 429*r - 4885 (31*r + 429*r) - 745 = 0 - 4885 Combine the r terms: 460*r - 745 = -4885 Step 2: Isolate the constant term on the other side of the equation. To do this, add 745 to both sides of the equation. 460*r - 745 + 745 = -4885 + 745 460*r = -4140 Step 3: Solve for r. To do this, divide both sides of the equation by 460. 460*r / 460 = -4140 / 460 r = -9 So, the solution to the equation 31*r - 745 = -429*r - 4885 is r = -9."},{"question":"Q: Test for natural language inference.

When we think of a tiger, we think of danger. We think of the big teeth and large feet of it. We also think of beauty. The tiger is a hunter that hunts alone. In fact , tigers are probably better than any other land mammal at catching large animals without help. Even so, the life of this big-game hunter isn't easy. Finding food can be difficult, especially for a tiger that is old or weak. Most of the animals it tries to attack get away. A tiger sometimes goes weeks without eating. When that happens, it may hunt animals that can be dangerous even for a tiger. When they are in a bad situation, some tigers may even attack humans. But in fact, tigers kill very few people each year. Most tigers run away when they see people. What tigers have done to people can't compare to what people have done to tigers. Over the last 200 years, we have almost killed tigers in the wild . Today, the tiger is one of the most endangered animals on Earth. A tiger may live 20 years or more, if it is not disturbed by humans. Female tigers usually live longer than male tigers, because the males live more dangerously. It isn't easy for people to tell a male from a female unless the female happens to be with her babies.Only females take care of the young. The big difference between males and females is size. Male tigers are much bigger. Tigers are big eaters. In a single year, one tiger must eat about 70 deer or other large animals. That is one reason why tigers hunt alone. If they lived in big groups, they could never find enough animals to feed them all. Question: According to the passage, why do tigers hunt alone? Yes or no, is the answer \\"They can't find enough animals to share with other tigers.\\"? Answer:","response":"Yes, the answer \\"They can't find enough animals to share with other tigers\\" is consistent with the information provided in the passage. As mentioned in the article, tigers are exceptional hunters, adept at catching large animals without assistance. One of the reasons they hunt alone is the significant amount of food required to sustain them. In a single year, a tiger must consume approximately 70 deer or other large animals. If tigers were to live and hunt in large groups, they would struggle to find adequate food sources to support their entire population. Consequently, hunting alone allows them to secure the necessary amount of food to ensure their survival."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Skylar was my best friend up until High School when we slowly went our separate ways and met other people.

Traditional timber framing is the method of creating structures using heavy squared-off and carefully fitted and joined timbers with joints secured by large wooden pegs (larger versions of the mortise and tenon joints in furniture). It is commonplace in wooden buildings from the 19th century and earlier. The method comes from making things out of logs and tree trunks without modern high tech saws to cut lumber from the starting material stock. Using axes, adzes, and draw knives, hand-powered auger drill bits (brace and bit), and laborious woodworking, artisans or farmers could gradually assemble a building capable of bearing heavy weight without excessive use of interior space given over to vertical support posts. Since this building method has been used for thousands of years in many parts of the world, many styles of historic framing have developed. These styles are often categorized by the type of foundation, walls, how and where the beams intersect, the use of curved timbers, and the roof framing details. Three basic types of timber frames in English-speaking countries are the box frame, cruck frame, and aisled frame. - Halmstad is a port, university, industrial and recreational city at the mouth of Nissan in the province of Halland on the Swedish west coast.

What is the solution?","response":"Alright, let's look at the math problem step by step. The equation we have is: -1222 * a = -3765 * a - 73 + 73 First, we see there is a -73 (minus 73) and then a +73 (plus 73) on the right side of the equation. These two numbers cancel each other out (think of taking away 73 apples and then adding them back), so we can simplify the equation to: -1222 * a = -3765 * a Now, we want to find the value of 'a'. We will start by getting all the 'a' terms on one side of the equation. To do this, let's add (not subtract) 1222 * a to both sides of the equation. Imagine if we had 1222 blue balls representing -1222 * a, and 3765 red balls representing 3765 * a, we are moving 1222 blue balls to the red ball side: -1222 * a + 1222 * a = -3765 * a + 1222 * a This change will cancel out the -1222 * a on the left side of the equation, and we get: 0 = -2543 * a Now, we need to find 'a'. To do this, we will divide both sides of the equation by -2543 (think of splitting -2543 black balls into equal groups). So the new equation will look like: 0 / -2543 = -2543 * a / -2543 Dividing the left side by any number still gives us 0, and on the right side, the -2543 cancels out in the division: 0 = a So the solution is a = 0. This means that when you replace 'a' with 0 in the original equation, both sides are equal."},{"question":"What type of alien is the Doctor from Doctor Who?

In the present day, Pym's estranged daughter, Hope van Dyne, and former protégé, Darren Cross, have forced him out of his company, Pym Technologies. Cross is close to perfecting a shrinking suit of his own, the Yellowjacket, which horrifies Pym. Upon his release from prison, well-meaning thief Scott Lang moves in with his old cellmate, Luis. Lang visits his daughter Cassie unannounced and is chastised by his former wife Maggie and her police-detective fiancé, Paxton, for not providing child support. Unable to hold down a job because of his criminal record, Lang agrees to join Luis' crew and commit a burglary. Lang breaks into a house and cracks its safe, but only finds what he believes to be an old motorcycle suit, which he takes home. After trying the suit on, Lang accidentally shrinks himself to the size of an insect. Terrified by the experience, he returns the suit to the house, but is arrested on the way out. Pym, the homeowner, visits Lang in jail and smuggles the suit into his cell to help him break out. Pym, who manipulated Lang through an unknowing Luis into stealing the suit as a test, wants Lang to become the new Ant-Man to steal the Yellowjacket from Cross.

Let's solve this step by step so it's easy to understand. First, I'll write down the equation again: 691*f + 7138 + 10369 = 404*f Now, we want to get all the f's on one side and numbers on the other side. To do that, let's move the 404*f to the left side by subtracting 404*f from both sides. Remember, if you do something to one side, you need to do the same to the other side to keep the equation balanced. (691*f - 404*f) + 7138 + 10369 = 0 Now, we subtract: 287*f + 7138 + 10369 = 0 Next, we want to move all the numbers to the other side of the equation. Let's subtract 7138 and 10369 from both sides: 287*f = -7138 - 10369 Now let's subtract: 287*f = -17507 Lastly, we need to find out what number f is. To do that, we divide both sides of the equation by 287: f = -17507 / 287 When you do the division, you will get: f = -61 So, the answer is f = -61.

Waste Management devised a strategy to save money on diesel-fuel costs: it is buying trucks that will run on cheaper natural gas. Leslie Eaton has details on The News Hub. Photo: Alison Yin for the Wall Street Journal. Rising diesel costs last year forced Waste Management Inc. to charge customers an extra 169 million, just to keep its garbage trucks fueled. This year, the nation's biggest trash hauler has a new defensive strategy: it is buying trucks that will run on cheaper natural gas. In fact, the company says 80% of the trucks it purchases during the next five years will be fueled by natural gas. Though the vehicles cost about 30,000 more than conventional diesel models, each will save 27,000-a-year or more in fuel, says Eric Woods, head of fleet logistics for Waste Management. By 2017, the company expects to burn more natural gas than diesel. \\"The economics favoring natural gas are overwhelming,\\" says Scott Perry, a vice president at Ryder Systems Inc., one of the nation's largest truck-leasing companies and a transporter for the grocery, automotive, electronics and retail industries. The shale gas revolution, which cut the price of natural gas by about 45% over the past year, already has triggered a shift by the utility industry to natural gas from coal. Vast amounts of natural gas in shale rock formations have been unlocked by improved drilling techniques, making the fuel cheap and plentiful across the U.S. Darrold Withrow, 41, is a certified fueler and mechanic at Waste Management, and he fills up a truck with liquefied natural gas in Oakland, Calif. Now the shale-gas boom is rippling through transportation. Never before has the price gap between natural gas and diesel been so large, suddenly making natural-gas-powered trucks an alluring option for company fleets, rather than an impractical idea pushed mainly by natural-gas boosters like T. Boone Pickens, the Texas oilman. Railroad operators also are being affected as coal shipments decline. Many fleet operators, particularly long-haul truckers, remain concerned about a scarcity of refueling stations. Other challenges include the bulky tanks for compressed gas and the hazards of handling liquefied gas. In the past, the volatility of natural-gas prices also hampered wider use. But today, truck manufacturers are embracing natural gas for everything from bi-fuel pickup trucks like the Chevy Silverado HD to eighteen-wheelers that can burn natural gas either compressed, called CNG, or super-chilled, called LNG. Navistar International Corp., Cummins Inc. and General Motors Co. all are courting the market with new natural-gas powered trucks or engines. Navistar's goal is to \\"expand to a full range of products using natural gas in the next 18 months,\\" says Eric Tech, president of Navistar's engine business. This year, the Illinois company is introducing delivery trucks burning natural gas. Next year, it is adding long-haul trucks with its biggest engines. Mr. Tech says in a couple of years, one in three Navistar trucks sold will burn natural gas. \\"This is not a subsidy-driven market,\\" Mr. Tech says. \\"It's developing on its own because the economics are compelling.\\" Companies like United Parcel Service Inc. and AT&T Inc. are buying the vehicles. AT&T recently ordered 1,200 Chevrolet Express cargo vans equipped to run on compressed natural gas, which GM said was its largest CNG vehicle order ever. Ryder Systems began renting out natural gas trucks in California last yea. The response has been so strong Ryder is expanding the program to Michigan and Arizona. And it is introducing them in truck clusters it operates for big box retailers like Staples Inc. and manufacturers including carpet-maker Mohawk Industries Inc. For years, a barrel of oil cost about as much as six units of natural gas and their prices moved in tandem, notes Don Mason, a gas-industry consultant in Ohio. Today, a barrel of West Texas Intermediate crude costs more than 33 times as much as a unit of natural gas in the U.S. At the pump, a gallon of diesel often costs more than twice as much as CNG, on a diesel-gallon-equivalent basis. \\"I think we're at a turning point, even if it's a slow, wide turn,\\" Mr. Mason says. Refueling a Waste Management truck in Oakland, Calif., with LNG. Although the U.S. has loads of natural gas, adoption of natural gas vehicles has been spotty. Less than 0.1% of vehicles on American roads burn the fuel today and the percentage sagged slightly from 2005 to 2010, when federal policies encouraging their use waned. The number began edging up last year, lifted by market forces. Meanwhile, in the Asia-Pacific region, natural gas vehicle sales have grown at an average annual clip of 42% during the past decade, according to NGV Global, a trade group formed in 1986 to promote gas-friendly policies. Pakistan led the list in 2010 with 2.7 million natural gas vehicles, though many are tiny tuk-tuks, out of a total of 13 million natural gas vehicles worldwide. The U.S. came in 14th with 112,000 natural gas vehicles. Many people are trying to figure out whether natural gas really has legs as a transportation fuel. Greg Burns, chairman and chief executive of PLS Logistics Services Inc. in Pittsburgh decided this year to ask 100 trucking company executives. The result: eight in 10 respondents said natural gas in its densest form, as LNG, has potential for highway use. Nearly a third said they were actively researching it for their own companies. But 54% said current infrastructure is inadequate and 23% worried about the higher cost of the trucks. Mr. Burns' conclusion: \\"If you have a long-enough time frame, it's a pretty bullish picture.\\" Some truckers soon will have the ability to hedge their bets. That is because the Environmental Protection Agency recently approved retrofit technology for big rigs that lets them burn LNG and diesel.Kathryn Clay, executive director of the Drive Natural Gas initiative of the American Gas Association, says \\"the new technology is really game changing because the trucker can run on either fuel, eliminating refueling anxiety.\\" The potential market is enormous. The 3.2 million big rigs on U.S. roads today burn some 25 billion gallons of diesel annually. Almost 7 million single-unit trucks, such as UPS or FedEx Corp. trucks, consume another 10 billion gallons of diesel. Converting even a modest number of these trucks, which often get 5 to 8 miles a gallon, to natural gas could save significant amounts of money. Tailpipe emissions also would drop, since natural gas burns cleaner than diesel or gasoline. If large numbers of fleet operators decided to embrace natural gas, it could rev up truck manufacturing, which slowed dramatically during the recession. North American heavy duty truck sales peaked in 2006 with 360,000 units, just ahead of tighter emission standards, and plunged to 110,000 units in 2009. Noel Perry, principal at Transport Fundamentals Inc., a trucking research company in Lebanon, Penn., says one disadvantage of natural gas is that it isn't as dense as diesel. CNG is only 25% as dense and LNG is 60% as dense. That means trucks need more tanks or bigger tanks to go as far, or they must refuel more often. That's not a big deal for city buses or delivery trucks that go back to home base each night, where they can refuel. But it's a problem for trucks that drive unpredictable routes or venture out into the hinterland. Ann Duignan, managing director at J.P. Morgan Equity Research, says \\"there's huge excitement\\" about natural gas but infrastructure immaturity will depress truck sales. She expects fastest adoption among fleets that can run on CNG and return home each night but is skeptical about long-haul trucking. \\"It will be slow, steady, one-fleet-at-a-time type growth,\\" she says. Write to Rebecca Smith at rebecca.smith@wsj.com A version of this article appeared May 24, 2012, on page B1 in the U.S. edition of The Wall Street Journal, with the headline: Will Truckers Ditch Diesel?. What is a short summary of the above article?","response":"The increasing cost of diesel fuel has led Waste Management Inc. to devise a strategy to save expenses by investing in trucks that run on cheaper natural gas. By 2017, the company expects to burn more natural gas than diesel and aims for 80% of the trucks it purchases over the next five years to be fueled by natural gas. Although natural gas vehicles cost approximately 30,000 more than conventional diesel models, the fuel savings amount to 27,000 per year or more. The shale gas revolution has reduced the price of natural gas by about 45% over the past year, prompting the utility industry to shift from coal to natural gas. The transportation sector is also experiencing a natural gas boom, as the large price gap between natural gas and diesel makes natural gas-powered trucks an attractive option. Major truck manufacturers are now producing natural gas-fueled trucks, contributing to the market growth. Challenges to natural gas adoption include concerns about a scarcity of refueling stations and the volatility of natural gas prices. However, the economics of switching to natural gas are becoming increasingly compelling, and converting even a fraction of diesel-consuming trucks to natural gas could lead to significant cost savings and reduced emissions."},{"question":"How is \\"Saint-Appolinard, Isère\\" said in Russian?","response":"In Russian, \\"Saint-Appolinard, Isère\\" would be said as \\"Сен-Аполлинар, Изер\\" (S'en-Apollinar, Izer).

Social upheaval and unrest were commonplace as people spoke-out about their views. Racial tensions, politics, the Vietnam War, sexual promiscuity, and drug use were all part of the daily fabric, and the daily news. This film attempted to encapsulate these historical aspects into an entertaining movie, and largely succeeded. In this film, two families are followed: one white, one black. During the first half of the film, the story follows each family on a equal basis through social and family struggles. Unfortunately, the second half of the movie is nearly dedicated to the white family. Admittedly, there are more characters in this family, and the story lines are intermingled, but equal consideration is not given to the racial aspects of this century. On the whole, the acting is well done and historical footage is mixed with color and black and white original footage to give a documentary feel to the movie. The movie is a work of fiction, but clips of well-known historical figures are used to set the time-line. I enjoyed the movie but the situations were predictable and the storyline was one-sided.

The user acknowledges certain strengths of the movie, like its historical representation, documentary feel, good acting and its success in encapsulating the 1960s era. This adds a positive sentiment to the review. However, the user also expresses dissatisfaction about certain aspects of the movie, such as the narrative's focus leaning towards the white family and the predictable situations in the movie which indicates a negative sentiment.

Imagine eating ice cream but without any of the tasty flavors, just plain and boring. That's how this movie felt. The story was like trying to put together a puzzle with the wrong pieces - it just didn't make sense. The characters were like toys that were broken, and we couldn't really understand their feelings. The music was like listening to the same nursery rhyme over and over again, which got really annoying after a while. The colors in the movie were like a box of crayons, but only with the dull ones left. Overall, this movie was not a fun time, and I think it's better to play outside or watch happier films instead."},{"question":"Given the question: Information: - The Tanakh (or ; also \\"Tenakh\\", \\"Tenak\\", \\"Tanach\\") or Mikra or Hebrew Bible is the canonical collection of Jewish texts, which is also a textual source for the Christian Old Testament. These texts are composed mainly in Biblical Hebrew, with some passages in Biblical Aramaic (in the books of Daniel, Ezra and a few others). The traditional Hebrew text is known as the Masoretic Text. The Tanakh consists of twenty-four books. - Hagar ( of uncertain origin Hjar) is a biblical person in the Book of Genesis. She was an Egyptian handmaid of Sarai (Sarah), who gave her to Abraham to bear a child. The product of the union was Abraham's firstborn, Ishmael, the progenitor of the Ishmaelites. According to Theodor Nöldeke, she is the biblical personification of the nomadic Hagrites. - The New Testament (Koine Greek: , \\"H Kain Diathk\\") is the second major part of the Christian biblical canon, the first part being the Old Testament, based on the Hebrew Bible. The New Testament discusses the teachings and person of Jesus, as well as events in first-century Christianity. Christians regard both the Old and New Testaments together as sacred scripture. The New Testament (in whole or in part) has frequently accompanied the spread of Christianity around the world. It reflects and serves as a source for Christian theology and morality. Both extended readings and phrases directly from the New Testament are also incorporated (along with readings from the Old Testament) into the various Christian liturgies. The New Testament has influenced religious, philosophical, and political movements in Christendom and left an indelible mark on literature, art, and music. - Abrahamic religions, emphasizing and tracing their common origin to the tribal patriarch Abraham or recognizing a spiritual tradition identified with him, are one of the major divisions in comparative religion (along with Indian, Iranian, and East Asian religions). Judaism, Christianity and Islam are the largest Abrahamic religions in terms of numbers of adherents. - Leah (\\"Lea\\"; \\"La'ya;\\" from ), as described in the Hebrew Bible, is the first of the two concurrent wives of the Hebrew patriarch Jacob and mother of six sons whose descendants became some of the Twelve Tribes of Israel, along with one daughter, Dinah.

He is mentioned in the Book of Genesis, and by the prophets, Obadiah and Malachi. The New Testament of the Christian Bible alludes to him in the Epistle to the Romans and in the Epistle to the Hebrews. - Ishmael (, \\"Yišmael\\"; \\"Ismal\\"; Classical/ Qur'anic Arabic: ; Modern Arabic: \\"Isml\\") is a figure in the Tanakh and the Qur'an and was Abraham's first son according to Jews, Christians, and Muslims. Ishmael was born to Abraham's and Sarah's handmaiden Hagar.. According to the Genesis account, he died at the age of 137. - Bilhah ( \\"unworried\\", Standard Hebrew \\"Bilha\\", Tiberian Hebrew \\"Bilhâ\\") is a person mentioned in the Book of Genesis. describes her as Laban's handmaid, who was given to Rachel to be her handmaid on Rachel's marriage to Jacob. When Rachel failed to have children, Rachel gave Bilhah to Jacob \\"to wife\\" to bear him children. Bilhah gave birth to two sons, who Rachel claimed as her own and named Dan and Naphtali. expressly calls Bilhah Jacob's concubine, a \\"pilegesh\\". - Sarah or Sara (; \\"arra\\" Arabic: \\"Sra\\";) was the wife and also the halfsister of Abraham and the mother of Isaac as described in the Hebrew Bible and the Quran. Her name was originally Sarai. According to Genesis 17:15, God changed her name to Sarah as part of a covenant after Hagar bore Abraham his first son, Ishmael. - The Old Testament is the first section of the Christian Bible, based primarily upon the Hebrew Bible (or Tanakh), a collection of religious writings by ancient Israelites believed by most Christians and religious Jews to be the sacred Word of God. It is the counterpart to the New Testament, the second portion of the Christian Bible. The Old Testament canon varies between Christian Churches. Protestants have a version with 39 books. Catholics have a version with 46 books, and Eastern Orthodox, and Oriental Orthodox Churches choose the Old Testament version with 49 books. - Abraham (Avraham), originally Abram, is the first of the three patriarchs of Judaism. His story features in the holy texts of all the Abrahamic religions and Abraham plays a prominent role as an example of faith in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. - In the Book of Genesis, Zilpah ( \\"meaning uncertain,\\" Standard Hebrew \\"Zilpa\\", Tiberian Hebrew \\"Zilpâ\\") was Leah's handmaid, whom Leah gave to Jacob \\"to wife\\" to bear him children. Zilpah gave birth to two sons, whom Leah claimed as her own and named Gad and Asher. - Rachel was the favorite of Biblical patriarch Jacob's two wives as well as the mother of Joseph and Benjamin, two of the twelve progenitors of the tribes of Israel. The name \\"Rachel\\" means ewe. Rachel was the daughter of Laban and the younger sister of Leah, Jacob's first wife. Rachel was a niece of Rebekah (Jacob's mother), Laban being Rebekah's brother, making Jacob her first cousin. - The Book of Genesis (from the Latin Vulgate, in turn borrowed or transliterated from Greek , meaning \\"origin\\" \\"Brš\\", \\"In [the] beginning\\") is the first book of the Hebrew Bible (the Tanakh) and the Christian Old Testament. - Islam (' ;) is a religion articulated by the Quran, a text considered by its adherents to be the verbatim word of God ('), and, for the vast majority of adherents, the teachings and normative example (called the \\"sunnah\\", composed of accounts called \\"hadith\\") of Muhammad (5708 June 632 CE). It is the world's second-largest religion and the fastest-growing major religion in the world, with over 1.7 billion followers or 23% of the global population, known as Muslims. Islam is an Abrahamic monotheistic religion that upholds that God is one and incomparable and that the purpose of existence is to worship God. Muslims consider Muhammad to be the last prophet of God. - Bethuel (\\"Bêl\\", house of God), in the Hebrew Bible, was an Aramean man, the youngest son of Nahor and Milcah, the nephew of Abraham, and the father of Laban and Rebecca. - Malachi, Malachias, Malache or Mal'achi was the writer of the Book of Malachi, the last book of the Neviim (prophets) section in the Hebrew Bible. No allusion is made to him by Ezra, however, and he does not directly mention the restoration of the temple. The editors of the 1906 Jewish Encyclopedia implied that he prophesied after Haggai and Zechariah and speculated that he delivered his prophecies about 420 BCE, after the second return of Nehemiah from Persia (Book of Nehemiah), or possibly before his return, comparing with (with ). - Jacob, later given the name Israel, is regarded as a Patriarch of the Israelites.

Possible A: dedication, surprised, solutions, confidence, compliments Why is \\"solutions\\" an answer aligned with human common sense?","response":"\\"Solutions\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it directly addresses the core aspect of the question, which is figuring out information or resolving doubts that arise when a person has questions. Human common sense is a cognitive capability that allows individuals to recognize and address practical, everyday, real-world issues. People use common sense to navigate their lives by understanding complex situations, making informed decisions, and troubleshooting unforeseen problems. In the context of the given question, the primary concern is to determine what a person needs when they have questions or need answers. Analyzing the possible answers provided: 1. Dedication: Although dedication is essential for pursuing knowledge and solving problems, it is not explicitly tied to finding answers to questions. Dedication can indirectly influence the person's drive to overcome question-related obstacles, but ultimately, the person still needs solutions—accurate and practical answers to their questions. 2. Surprised: Being surprised is an emotional state or reaction that is unrelated to figuring out information when someone has questions. It does not specifically address the need for solutions or answers for a given situation or problem. 3. Solutions: Solutions directly fulfill the need inherent in the question by providing answers or methods to resolve the uncertainties or problems faced by a person. Solutions are the primary outcomes sought when a person faces questions and require a practical response based on human common sense. 4. Confidence: While confidence is essential for problem-solving, it is, similar to dedication, indirectly related to the core issue at hand. Confidence can positively impact a person's ability to search for answers or attempt to solve problems. However, it does not necessarily guarantee the person will find the correct solutions. 5. Compliments: Compliments are positive remarks or feedback about a person or their actions, and they do not directly address the need for answers or solutions when someone has questions. In summary, \\"solutions\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it directly addresses the main concern of the question – resolving uncertainties and finding answers to questions. Solutions are the most fitting response, as they help a person overcome their doubts and move forward in understanding and effectively managing the real-world situation or problem. The other provided answers, while possibly relevant in some way, do not directly resolve the primary needs highlighted by the question."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: In this task you will be given a text passage from a trivia quiz.

He hardly even wears a necktie. \\"I'm working harder than ever,\\" David says, \\"and I need to feel fortable.\\" More and more panies are allowing their office workers to wear casual clothes to work. In the United States, the change from formal to casual office wear has been gradual. In the early 1990s, many panies allowed their employees to wear casual clothes on Friday (but only on Friday). This became known as \\"dress-down Friday\\" or \\"casual Friday\\" . \\"What started out as an extra one-day-a-week benefit for employees has really bee an everyday thing.\\" Said business consultant Maisly Jones. Why have so many panies started allowing their employees to wear casual clothes? One reason is that it's easier for a pany to attract new employees if it has a casual dress code . \\"A lot of young people don't want to dress up for work,\\" says the owner of a software pany, \\"so it's hard to hire people if you have a conservative dress code.\\" Another reason is that people seem happier and more productive when they are wearing fortable clothes. In a study conducted by Levi Strauss and pany ,85% of employers said that they believe that casual dress improves employee morale. Only 4% of employers said that casual dress code has a negative impact on productivity .Supporters of casual office wear also argue that a casual dress code helps them save money . \\"Suits are expensive ,if you have to wear one every day,\\" one person said. \\"For the same amount of money ,you can buy a lot more casual clothes.\\" David wears casual clothes now ,because_. A) he looks handsome in casual clothes B) he no longer works for any pany C) he can't afford to buy any expensive clothes D) they make him feel at ease when he is working Answer:","response":"David wears casual clothes now because they make him feel at ease when he is working (option D). The shift from formal to casual office wear has been a gradual process in the United States, largely due to companies realizing that more relaxed dress codes can attract new employees, improve morale, and boost productivity. A study conducted by Levi Strauss & Company showed that 85% of employers believed that casual dress improved employee morale, with only 4% feeling it had a negative impact on productivity. Younger workers, in particular, are often less keen on dressing up for work, which has led to companies adapting their dress codes to suit their preferences. When employees are comfortable in their attire, they are more likely to be relaxed and focused on their work. This could be the reason behind David's statement, \\"I'm working harder than ever, and I need to feel comfortable.\\" Additionally, casual clothes are more affordable than expensive suits, which has a financial benefit to employees. In conclusion, the major reason David wears casual clothes now is that they provide him with a sense of comfort and ease while working. The change in workplace dress codes has made this possible, ensuring that employees are more content and productive in their casual attire."},{"question":"Premise: \\"A little boy is smiling as he splashes in some water and sits inside a couple of red and blue floating devices.\\" Hypothesis: \\"A boy is sitting inside a green and pink floating device.\\" Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?

Ben enjoyed the visit and planned to return. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which state had more people inhaling carbon dioxide from the wildfire smoke? Hint: Wildfire smoke contains particulate matter that may have adverse effects upon the human respiratory system. Evidence of the health effects of wildfire smoke should be relayed to the public so that exposure may be limited. Evidence of health effects can also be used to influence policy to promote positive health outcomes.Inhalation of smoke from a wildfire can be a health hazard. Wildfire smoke is composed of combustion products i.e. carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, water vapor, particulate matter, organic chemicals, nitrogen oxides and other compounds. The principal health concern is the inhalation of particulate matter and carbon monoxide.Particulate matter (PM) is a type of air pollution made up of particles of dust and liquid droplets. They are characterized into three categories based on the diameter of the particle: coarse PM, fine PM, and ultrafine PM. Coarse particles are between 2.5 micrometers and 10 micrometers, fine particles measure 0.1 to 2.5 micrometers, and ultrafine particle are less than 0.1 micrometer. Each size can enter the body through inhalation, but the PM impact on the body varies by size. Coarse particles are filtered by the upper airways and these particles can accumulate and cause pulmonary inflammation. This can result in eye and sinus irritation as well as sore throat and coughing. Coarse PM is often composed of materials that are heavier and more toxic that lead to short-term effects with stronger impact.Smaller particulate moves further into the respiratory system creating issues deep into the lungs and the bloodstream. In asthma patients, PM2.5 causes inflammation but also increases oxidative stress in the epithelial cells. These particulates also cause apoptosis and autophagy in lung epithelial cells. Both processes cause the cells to be damaged and impacts the cell function. This damage impacts those with respiratory conditions such as asthma where the lung tissues and function are already compromised. The third PM type is ultra-fine PM (UFP). UFP can enter the bloodstream... Answer:","response":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, Washington state had more people inhaling carbon dioxide from the wildfire smoke. This is because Washington state experienced many wildfires year-round, whereas Oregon had almost no wildfires. Wildfire smoke, containing particulate matter and carbon monoxide, can have adverse effects on the human respiratory system. As a result, individuals in Washington state would be more exposed to these harmful elements due to the higher frequency of wildfires compared to Oregon."},{"question":"Answer this question: when did six flags over georgia first open??","response":"In order to answer this question, I need to search the internet for relevant information about Six Flags Over Georgia's opening date.
