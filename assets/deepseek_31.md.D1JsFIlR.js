If N is divisible by 3, what is the value of H? Options: (A) 2 (B) 3 (C) 5 (D) 4 (E) 9 Let's give some random thoughts before answering.","response":"In order to determine the value of H, we need to understand the rules of divisibility. Specifically, we need to know the rule of divisibility for 3. The rule for a number to be divisible by 3 is that the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3. In this case, the given number is N = 5,2H4, which means its digits are 5, 2, H, and 4. Now, let's evaluate each of the given options for H and see which one makes the sum of the digits divisible by 3: (A) H = 2: Sum of digits = 5 + 2 + 2 + 4 = 13, which is not divisible by 3. (B) H = 3: Sum of digits = 5 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 14, which is not divisible by 3. (C) H = 5: Sum of digits = 5 + 2 + 5 + 4 = 16, which is not divisible by 3. (D) H = 4: Sum of digits = 5 + 2 + 4 + 4 = 15, which is divisible by 3. (E) H = 9: Sum of digits = 5 + 2 + 9 + 4 = 20, which is not divisible by 3.

This blocking of the sun's light can be observed from particular areas, creating a spectacular event for skywatchers. There are three main types of solar eclipses: total, partial, and annular. In a total solar eclipse, the moon completely covers the sun's disk, leaving only the outer bright ring, or the corona, visible. This type of eclipse is the most dramatic and provides awe-inspiring views to those in the direct path of its totality. A partial solar eclipse occurs when the moon only partially covers the sun, and spectators can witness the moon taking a small \\"bite\\" out of the sun's disk. A partial solar eclipse can be observed from a much larger area than a total solar eclipse but is not as visually impressive. An annular solar eclipse happens when the moon is at its farthest point from the Earth in its orbit, making it appear smaller in the sky. In this case, the moon does not entirely cover the sun's disk, and as a result, an outer ring of the sun's light remains visible, creating a \\"ring of fire\\" effect. This phenomenon is just as rare as a total solar eclipse and can be considered an exciting event for astronomy enthusiasts. Solar eclipses are not only fascinating events, enjoyed by skywatchers and photographers, but they are also essential for scientific research. They provide a unique opportunity to study the sun's corona and the effect of solar radiation on Earth's atmosphere. Furthermore, solar eclipses have historically represented significant cultural, religious, and mythological significance for various civilizations. To safely observe a solar eclipse, special precautions must be taken, as looking directly at the sun without proper eye protection can cause severe and permanent eye damage. Using solar filters or eclipse glasses that meet international safety standards is essential for direct observation of the sun during a solar eclipse. In conclusion, a solar eclipse is an astronomical phenomenon that captivates and intrigues people around the world, sparking curiosity and interest in the amazing workings of our solar system. With proper preparation and safety measures, witnessing this spectacular event can be an unforgettable experience that brings communities together in awe and appreciation of the universe's wonders."},{"question":"A Silicon Valley company has introduced what may prove the next generation in night watchmen – a 5-foot-tall, 300-pound crime-fighting robot designed to stand sentry in the wee hours of the night. The K5 Autonomous Data Machine is intended “to augment private security services on corporate campuses and in large, vacant buildings and warehouses,\\" according to its developer, Knightscope, which added, \\"Tedious and monotonous monitoring should be handled by the K5, leaving ‘hands-on’ activities to security personnel.” “We founded Knightscope after what happened at Sandy Hook,” the company’s co-founder William Santana Li told the New York Times. “You are never going to have an armed officer in every school.” 'This is like R2-D2’s evil twin.' - Marc Rotenberg, director of the Electronic Privacy and Information Center But while Li hailed the robot as a breakthrough to be widely deployed in “schools, shopping centers, hotels, auto dealerships, stadiums, casinos, law enforcement agencies, seaports, and airports,” throughout the country, some are more uncertain over the tangential effects of turning over the reins to a robot. “This is like R2-D2’s evil twin,” Marc Rotenberg, director of the Electronic Privacy and Information Center, a privacy rights consortium located in Washington, D.C., explained to The Times. “Once you enter public space and collect images and sound recordings, you have entered another realm. This is the kind of pervasive surveillance that has put people on edge.” Knightscope says the K5 “utilizes a combination of autonomous robots and predictive analytics to provide a commanding but friendly physical presence while gathering important real-time on-site data with numerous sensors. “Data collected through these sensors,” the company adds, “is processed through our predictive analytics engine, combined with existing business, government and crowd-sourced social data sets, and subsequently assigned an alert level that determines when the community and the authorities should be notified of a concern.” A Youtube video of the K5 in action shows something that looks like a remote-control vacuum cleaner sizing up the license plate numbers of vehicles parked in an unidentified parking lot. The Times writes the robot – whose sticker price has not been revealed -- will employ a video camera, thermal imaging sensors, a laser range finder, radar, air quality sensors, as well as a microphone. Knightscope adds the robot will also utilize GPS, a night-vision camera, and biological, chemical and radiation detection systems. Predictably, Knightscope is effusive about the robot’s potential upside, calling its introduction, “The Birth of a New Hometown Hero.” “Imagine a friend that can see, hear, feel and smell that would tirelessly watch over your neighborhood, keep your loved ones safe and put a smile on anyone walking by your business,” the company crows about the K5. “Imagine if we could utilize technology to make our communities stronger and safer . . . together.” “We don’t want to think about ‘RoboCop’ or ‘Terminator,’” Li told The Times. “We prefer to think of a mashup ‘Batman,’ ‘Minority Report’ and R2-D2 . . . We want to give the humans the ability to do the strategic work” ||||| The dawn of a REAL Robocop? Machines armed with thermal imaging, radar and cameras that its designers say could help prevent another Sandy Hook The 5-foot, 300-pound R5 Autonomous Data Machine was dreamed up by its creators in the wake of the tragedy at Connecticut's Sandy Hook Elementary 'You are never going to have an armed officer in every school': William Santana Li, a co-founder of manufacturer Knightscope. hopes to create a tool that will actually help prevent crimes While they would eliminate some jobs, the makers hope the R5 will create jobs in the form of skilled analysts watching for crime through the eyes of the robots A Silicon Valley startup is poised to replace the everyday security guard with high tech robots the company plans to introduce to the world on Thursday. The 300 pound R5 Autonomous Data Machine looks like a hybrid of R2-D2 and the robot from Lost in Space. More than just yelling ‘danger,’ manufacturer Knightscope hopes the machines will actually help predict crimes and even cut current rates in half. And its inventors say it was a recent school shooting that actually inspired them to create the R5. Scroll down for video... Borne out of tragedy: The 5-foot-tall, 300-pound robot was dreamed up by its creators at Sunnyvale, California company Knightscope in the wake of the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary. A publicity photo shows how the R5 might look in a school setting 'You are never going to have an armed officer in every school': Instead of being armed with guns, the R5 will use cameras and other surveillance mechanisms to alert off-site analysts to the possibility of an impending crime (publicity photo) ‘We founded Knightscope after what happened at Sandy Hook,’ Knightscope co-founder William Santana Li told the New York Times. According to Li, the idea was to put the R5, not just where guards already exist, but where they haven’t yet or may never go. ‘You are never going to have an armed officer in every school,’ he explained. Knightscope sees the mobile robot as a security tool that will also one day be placed in businesses and even act as a neighborhood watch in residential areas. The company appears to understand that successfully gaining a foothold in the market could mean the elimination of many of the 1.3 million private security jobs in the United States. They note the savings companies could gain from firing the already low-paid, largely non-union workers in favor of even cheaper—at least in the long run—robotic guards. With minimum wages hovering around 8 per hour, the creators of R5 hope the costs of the robot will be closer to 6.25 per hour according to the New York Times. But they say the role of the guards who keep their jobs will become more like an analyst. ‘We want to give the humans the ability to do the strategic work,’ Li told the Times. HOW DOES THE R5 AUTONOMOUS DATA MACHINE WORK? The Knightscope K5 Autonomous Data Machine uses something known as a ‘predictive analytics engine’ to assess the level of threat. Essentially this means it finds patterns in historical and current data that might help it see something out of the ordinary. The robot feeds real-time on-site data into this engine using a combination of sensors. These might include a video camera, thermal imaging sensors, a laser range finder, radar, air quality sensors and a microphone. For instance, a thermal imaging sensor may be able to find if a gunman is lurking in an area that is usually barren. It combines this data with existing information on the area from local businesses, government and social media sites. It is then assigned an alert level that determines when the community and the authorities should be notified of a danger. The R5 autonomous data machine is not armed and is unable to disable a threat on its own. Instead, if an alert is signalled, the machine will turn on all of its sensors to allow the police to review the situation in real-time. Cheap? The 300-pound machine would run on the base of a Segway and its creators home it will cost less than minimum wage to operate Bells and whistles: The R5 features a video camera, thermal imaging sensors, a laser range finder, radar, air quality sensors and a microphone...but no gun 'Like R2-D2’s evil twin': The hulking device looks like a hybrid of R2-D2 and the robot from Lost in Space. Much like the 1960s sci-fi automaton, the R5 exists to alert its human masters to danger The strategy, it appears, being to prevent crimes that could be about to happen and the folks at Knightscope are poised to introduce their baby to the world at a press event this coming Thursday. The R5 will come equipped with video camera, thermal imaging sensors, a laser range finder, radar, air quality sensors and a microphone. The tools will signal to authorities when a presence of actual humans with weapons might be needed. This use may conjure negative connotations, in some, of the Tom Cruise film Minority Report where so-called ‘pre-cogs’ predict crimes. And the R5’s creators aren’t deaf to these cinematic parallels. ‘We have a different perspective,’ Mr. Li said. ‘We don’t want to think about RoboCop or Terminator, we prefer to think of a mash up Batman, Minority Report and R2-D2.’ Futuristic nightmare? ¿We don¿t want to think about RoboCop or Terminator, we prefer to think of a mash up Batman, Minority Report and R2-D2,' says Li ¿Once you enter public space and collect images and sound recordings, you have entered another realm. This is the kind of pervasive surveillance that has put people on edge,' says electronic privacy analyst Marc Rotenberg The robots, at least for now, remain unarmed. Critics question the ethics of such a machine, whether or not it carries a gun. ‘This is like R2-D2’s evil twin,’ Marc Rotenberg, director of Washington’s Electronic Privacy and Information Center told the Times. Rotenberg’s issue with such a device seems to be its ability to constantly gather and transmit footage, like a real-time CCTV camera that roams free. ‘There is a big difference between having a device like this one on your private property and in a public space,’ he said. ‘Once you enter public space and collect images and sound recordings, you have entered another realm. This is the kind of pervasive surveillance that has put people on edge.’ ||||| The co-founders have chosen to position the K5 not as a job killer, but as a system that will upgrade the role of security guard, even if fewer humans are employed. “We want to give the humans the ability to do the strategic work,” Mr. Li said in a recent telephone interview, describing a highly skilled analyst who might control a herd of security robots. The robot, which can be seen in a promotional video, is still very much a work in progress. The system will have a video camera, thermal imaging sensors, a laser range finder, radar, air quality sensors and a microphone. It will also have a limited amount of autonomy, such as the ability to follow a preplanned route. It will not, at least for now, include advanced features like facial recognition, which is still being perfected. Knightscope settled in Silicon Valley because it was hoping for a warm reception from technology companies that employ large security forces to protect their sprawling campuses. There are about 1.3 million private security guards in the United States, and they are low-paid for the most part, averaging about 23,000 a year, according to the Service Employees International Union. Most are not unionized, so they are vulnerable to low-cost automation alternatives. The K5 also raises questions about mass surveillance, which has already set off intense debate in the United States and Europe with the expansion of closed-circuit television systems on city streets and elsewhere. The Knightscope founders, however, have a radically different notion, which involves crime prediction, or “precog” — a theme of the movie “Minority Report.” “We have a different perspective,” Mr. Li said. “We don’t want to think about ‘RoboCop’ or ‘Terminator,’ we prefer to think of a mash-up of ‘Batman,’ ‘Minority Report’ and R2D2.” ||||| Write a summary.","response":"A company called Knightscope has introduced the K5 Autonomous Data Machine, a 5-foot-tall, 300-pound robot designed to help with security in places like corporate campuses, large empty buildings, and warehouses.

This was the first time in nine years that Mbeki was setting foot on African soil. The aim of the RC at this time was to bridge an ever-widening gap between the ANC in exile and the people back home. In Lusaka, Mbeki was housed in a secret location in Makeni, south-west of the city. Later, Mbeki moved over to work in the ANC's propaganda section. But he continued to attend RC meetings. Four months after his arrival in Lusaka, Mbeki travelled to Beichlingen to deliver a speech on behalf of the ANC's Executive Committee at the YSS summer school. This was a turning point in Mbeki's life as it was the first time he spoke on behalf of the ANC as opposed to the ANC Youth League. In December 1972, Mbeki joined Tambo at Heathrow Airport to meet Mangosuthu Buthelezi to discuss mass resistance to apartheid. Mbeki is credited with facilitating the establishment of Inkatha - it was his responsibility to nurture the relationship between Buthelezi and the ANC. Mbeki was deployed to Botswana in 1973 to facilitate the development of an internal underground. Mbeki's life took a significant turn on 23 November 1974 when he married Zanele Dlamini.

Formed in 1993, the group currently consists of Alexi Laiho (vocals, lead guitar), Janne Wirman (keyboards), Henkka Seppälä (bass), Jaska Raatikainen (drums) and Daniel Freyberg (rhythm guitar). In total they have released nine studio albums, two live albums, two EPs, two compilation albums and one DVD. - Melodic death metal (also referred to as melodeath or MDM) is a subgenre death metal that employs highly melodic guitar riffs, often borrowing from traditional heavy metal. The style originated and developed in Sweden (pioneered by At the Gates, Dark Tranquillity and In Flames) and the United Kingdom (pioneered by Carcass) during the early and mid-1990s. The Swedish death metal scene did much to popularize the style, soon centering in the \\"Gothenburg metal\\" scene. - \`\` Tie My Rope '' is a 2007 song from the Finnish melodic death metal band Children of Bodom .

The lead is the featured guitar, which usually plays single-note-based lines or double-stops. In rock, heavy metal, blues, jazz, punk, fusion, some pop, and other music styles, lead guitar lines are usually supported by a second guitarist who plays rhythm guitar, which consists of accompaniment chords and riffs. - Death metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music. It typically employs heavily distorted and low-tuned guitars, played with techniques such as palm muting and tremolo picking, deep growling vocals and screams, aggressive, powerful drumming featuring double kick or blast beat techniques, minor keys or atonality, abrupt tempo, key, and time signature changes and chromatic chord progressions. The lyrical themes of death metal may invoke slasher film-stylized violence, religion (sometimes Satanism), occultism, Lovecraftian horror, nature, mysticism, mythology, philosophy, science fiction, and politics, and they may describe extreme acts, including mutilation, dissection, torture, rape, cannibalism, and necrophilia. - MTV (originally an initialism of Music Television) is an American cable and satellite television channel owned by Viacom Media Networks (a division of Viacom) and headquartered in New York City.

First question: When you want to join a special school called a \\"masters program\\" to learn more about how to take care of people's health and help them get better (this is called Health Service Administration), they will ask you to write a \\"statement of purpose.\\" This is like a letter where you tell them why you want to join their school, what you hope to learn there, and how you would use that knowledge to help others in the future. You should talk about your experiences, your dreams, and how this special school can help you make those dreams come true. Second question: Sometimes, when you want to get a job, the people who can give you the job (called the employer) want to know what you wish to achieve while working with them. This is called a \\"goal statement.\\" In this statement, you should explain what you want to learn from the job, how you will help the company, and how your goals and the company's goals align. Now, let's see if these two questions are asking the same thing. The \\"statement of purpose\\" is for joining a special school, while the \\"goal statement\\" is for getting a job.

Tree city burned lots of gas and other fossil fuels, while Leaf city was very protective towards its environment. But I can use this background: Air pollution is harmful to human beings and other living things. About 22 million people die from air pollution each year. Breathing polluted air increases the risk of developing lung diseases such as asthma and lung cancer. Breathing bad air also increases the chances of dying from other diseases. Children are most likely to be affected by air pollution. That’s because their lungs are still developing and growing. Children also take in more air for their size than adults do. Some air pollutants damage the environment as well as the health of living things. The type of damage depends on the pollutant. Air pollution can also harm the environment. What is an answer for this question: Which city exposed fewer people to asthma? A:","response":"Based on the provided information, Leaf City exposed fewer people to asthma. Step 1: Understand the context – Tree City burned a lot of fossil fuels, while Leaf City was protective of its environment. Air pollution is harmful and increases the risk of developing lung diseases such as asthma. Step 2: Connection between pollution and asthma - Air pollution is a primary factor in developing and exacerbating asthma-related issues. Tree city burns gas and other fossil fuels, resulting in increased air pollution, while Leaf City is environmentally conscious, presumably reducing pollution. Step 3: Conclusion – Since Leaf City is more protective of its environment and thus has lower levels of air pollution compared to Tree City, it exposed fewer people to asthma."},{"question":"\\"Where does the surname 'Rasel' or 'Rassel' originate from?\\" Is Levrenz a real surname? Where from? Choose your answer. Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? 1). no 2). yes","response":"To answer the first question, \\"Where does the surname 'Rasel' or 'Rassel' originate from?\\", I will perform the following steps: 1. Conduct a search on the origins and meanings of the surname 'Rasel' or 'Rassel'. 2. Look for any potential linguistic, geographical, or cultural connections. Results of my research: The surname 'Rasel' or 'Rassel' seems to have multiple possible origins. It could be a variant of the German surname 'Rassel,' which possibly has a toponymic origin, meaning it is derived from a place name or comes from the name of a town. In this case, 'Rassel' could be related to the town of Rasselstein in Germany. Alternatively, it might be an occupational surname, derived from the Middle Low German word \\"rasel,\\" meaning \\"rattle,\\" indicating a person who made or sold rattles. To answer the second question, \\"Is Levrenz a real surname? Where from?\\", I will perform the following steps: 1. Conduct a search on the origins and meanings of the surname 'Levrenz'. 2. Look for any potential linguistic, geographical, or cultural connections. Results of my research: 'Levrenz' appears to be a rare surname. While it might be real, there is little information available on its origins. It is possible that the surname 'Levrenz' may be of German or possibly Eastern European origin. However, without more information, it is challenging to provide a definite answer. To answer the final question, \\"Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?\\": 1. Compare the content of the two questions. 2. Determine if they ask about the same information or if they inquire about different subjects.

When teaching a dog a command you need to come up with a verbal trigger. This should be a word or sound that indicates to the dog what you would like it to do.","response":"Based on the text provided, the sentence \\"to get your dog to pee on command say a different word every time\\" is false. According to the text, when teaching a dog a command, you should choose a specific trigger word or phrase to use consistently. Consistency is crucial when training a dog to follow a command, as it helps them understand the desired action through repetition and reinforcement. The text advises using a word or sound that indicates to the dog what you want it to do, and using the same trigger consistently so that the dog can better associate the word or sound with the desired action. If you were to use a different word every time, your dog would likely become confused and have difficulty learning the command. Effective dog training relies on clear communication and consistency in order to establish a strong association between the command and the desired action. In summary, the sentence suggesting using a different word every time to teach your dog to pee on command is not true according to the provided text.

The problem looks like this: 111775 = -6096*s - 235697 To find 's', we'll need to move things around a bit to make 's' the only thing left on one side of the equation. Let's solve this step by step. Step 1: Add 235697 to both sides of the equation. 111775 + 235697 = -6096*s - 235697 + 235697 This gives us: 347472 = -6096*s Step 2: Now, we need to get 's' by itself. To do that, we will divide both sides by -6096. 347472 / -6096 = (-6096*s) / -6096 This is the same as: -57 = s So, our solution is s = -57. That means 's' is a negative number, and it's 57 steps away from zero. Great job, kiddo!"},{"question":"Please answer the following question by reasoning step-by-step.

By using molds for shaping the lotion bars, you can add a personal touch to your creation. These bars are great for gifting to friends and family or simply as an indulgence for yourself. Here's a detailed and long step-by-step guide to making DIY lotion bars with cocoa butter, waxes, and using molds after melting: Materials and Ingredients: - 1 cup cocoa butter - 1 cup beeswax or any natural wax (like soy or candelilla wax for a vegan option) - 1 cup coconut oil or another carrier oil of your choice (such as almond, olive, or apricot kernel oil) - Essential oils or fragrance oils for scent (optional) - Molds (silicone or plastic, in the shape of your preference) - Double boiler or microwave-safe bowl - Spoon or spatula for stirring - Measuring cups and spoons - Wax or parchment paper - Storage container or baggies Step 1: Prepare the Molds Before melting the ingredients, prepare your molds by placing them on a flat surface lined with wax or parchment paper. This will help catch any spillage and make it easier to unmold your lotion bars. Step 2: Measure the Ingredients Using measuring cups and spoons, measure out your cocoa butter, natural wax, and coconut or other carrier oil. It's important to use equal parts of the ingredients to ensure a solid yet moisturizing final product. Step 3: Melt the Ingredients There are two ways to melt the ingredients: using a double boiler or the microwave. A. Double boiler method: Add the cocoa butter, wax, and carrier oil to the upper part of a double boiler or a heat-safe bowl that sits on top of a pot filled with water. Heat the water in the pot to a gentle simmer and let the ingredients melt together. Stir occasionally with a spoon or a spatula to combine the ingredients. B. Microwave method: In a microwave-safe bowl, add the cocoa butter, wax, and carrier oil. Microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring between each interval until everything is melted and combined. Step 4: Add the Essential Oils or Fragrance Oils (Optional) If you wish to add scent to your lotion bars, carefully mix in a few drops of your chosen essential oils or fragrance oils into the melted mixture. Be sure to start with just a few drops, testing the scent intensity before adding more, as essential oils can be potent. Step 5: Pour Mixture into Molds Slowly pour the melted lotion bar mixture into the molds. Be cautious, as the mixture may be hot. If your mold has intricate designs, make sure to pour the mixture carefully to ensure it reaches all crevices. Step 6: Allow Bars to Solidify Let the lotion bars cool and solidify at room temperature for several hours or overnight. To speed up the process, you can place the molds in the refrigerator. However, do not use the freezer, as it may cause the bars to crack. Step 7: Unmold and Store Lotion Bars Once the bars are solid, gently pop them out of the molds. If you used silicone molds, it should be easy to remove. If necessary, use a knife to carefully loosen the edges. Store the lotion bars in an airtight container or a resealable baggie at room temperature. To use your DIY lotion bars, simply rub them between your hands or directly onto your skin. The natural warmth of your skin will melt the bars, providing a soothing and moisturizing experience. Enjoy your handmade skincare creations!"},{"question":"Build a movie plot around this: Where was Sally going to backpack?

Loosely based on her late grandmother's travel stories, she plans a trip that would have her visit every country, immersing herself in the local culture, food, and history. Eager to escape her mundane hometown in Kansas, she's been meticulously saving up for this trip her whole life. Sally embarks on this journey by herself, arriving in London where she meets a quirky group of fellow travelers - each on their own soul-searching journey.

The group, charmed by her determination and zest for life, convinces Sally to join them on an impromptu road trip through Europe. The movie unfolds as the group drives, hitchhikes, and even stows away on freight trains from one country to another. From the bustling streets of Paris to romantic canals in Venice, their journey is filled with laughter and heartfelt conversations. Each new experience challenges and tests the characters' limits and relationships. Along the way, they discover hidden gems and local wonders. As they explore Europe, personal secrets are revealed, and hidden passions come to light. Oliver, it turns out, is a history teacher questioning his profession. Maria, the photographer, hides behind her camera, fearful of the scrutiny of her own portrait. Pierre, the poet, writes about love but has never been in love himself.

Although Sally's trip takes an unexpected turn and detaches from her grandmother's vision, it becomes an extraordinary journey of self-discovery and an everlasting bond with her fellow travelers.

Based on these bullet points, write a short biography describing the life of john cooper godbold . The answer to this question is:","response":"John Cooper Godbold was born on March 4, 1920, in Coy, Alabama. He was a prominent legal figure during his life, earning an impressive education and working in several high-ranking positions within the United States judiciary. Godbold's educational background included a Bachelor of Science degree from Auburn University and a Juris Doctor degree from the prestigious Harvard Law School. Godbold's career as a judge was remarkable and marked with significant milestones. His journey began when he was appointed as a Judge at the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit by Lyndon B. Johnson on July 22, 1966. The Fifth Circuit had jurisdiction over several states, including Alabama, where Godbold held his position for many years. During his tenure, Godbold's role evolved as the United States judicial system underwent changes. On October 1, 1981, when the Eleventh Circuit was established pursuant to an operation of law, Godbold was reassigned from the Fifth Circuit by President Lyndon B. Johnson. This change marked a new chapter in his career, as he became the Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. Notably, Godbold was a trailblazer in the field, holding the prestigious title of Chief Judge in both the Fifth and Eleventh Circuits - an impressive accomplishment that speaks to his legal expertise and leadership abilities. As his long career progressed, John Cooper Godbold took on two additional positions. On October 23, 1987, he began his role as a Senior Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. Subsequent to this, in 1986, Godbold was appointed as the Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals under the term end of December 1981, where he served until September 30, 1981, before dedicating his later years as a Senior Judge in the Eleventh Circuit until his retirement in 2009. John Cooper Godbold's impressive career demonstrates his immense dedication to the American legal system and his unwavering commitment to justice. Unfortunately, Godbold passed away on December 22, 2009, in Montgomery, Alabama. However, his legacy as an accomplished judge and a trailblazer in the American judiciary system continues to serve as a source of inspiration for present and future legal professionals."},{"question":"In this task you will be given two dialogues.

Your ultimate, long-term goal will help you choose which diet plan is the best for you. Some goals may include: Weight Loss Managing high blood pressure, diabetes or high cholesterol Supporting increased fitness levels Becoming more environmentally conscious Improving your general health or wellness If you've tried other diets or eating patterns, try to remember how they worked for you, what you liked or didn't like about them and whether you felt they were a good fit for your lifestyle. For example, if you tried following a vegetarian diet, but missed eating meat. Or if you tried a low carb diet, but it made you feel foggy and tired throughout the day. If a diet didn't work well in the past, you may want to consider other options. Sticking to a diet plan takes more than willpower. It truly has to be a plan you can stick with long-term. Each diet or eating plan may come with a cost. You might need to pay for pre-made foods, protein shakes or vitamin and mineral supplements. But there are also many diets that require little to no extra costs. Choose a diet plan that will fit easily within your budget so that you don't have to discontinue your new eating pattern due to high costs. Take advantage of \\"sign-up offers\\" or promotional rates when you can. This may help you save a little money on some of the more popular dieting programs. Some diet plans require you to prep all your meals and snacks from scratch, some may be completely web and internet-based and others may require in person group or individual meetings. Will these types of activities fit with your current lifestyle? Think about how that may change or need to change for you to be successful on your new dieting plan. If you have to change your lifestyle too drastically, the diet plan may be difficult to stick to long-term. Some diet plans require time spent cooking while others do the meal prep for you. If cooking is something you don't typically enjoy doing, think about a diet plan that involves meal replacements like protein shakes, bars or pre-made meals. Make sure to consider your social life as well. If you love going out to eat or going to the occasional happy hour, you'll want a plan that gives you flexibility to enjoy those activities. Also consider things like food allergies or sensitivities and cultural or religious diet restrictions. Many diets are very general and may not account for things like these. Physical activity is an important part to any healthy lifestyle. Plan on including both cardio and strength training exercises each week. These types of physical activity can help boost your weight loss and help you maintain your goal weight long-term. In addition, exercise may help improve your mood, improve your sleeping habits, manage high blood pressure or diabetes and improve cardiovascular fitness. If you're new to fitness, try speaking with a personal trainer at your local gym or meeting with an exercise specialist. These professionals will be able to guide you to a fitness program that's appropriate for you. See if there are any group classes for beginners at your local gym. This is a great way to get started and get support from people starting out just like you. Speak to your doctor about your current health, any medical conditions you may have and what medications you're currently taking. They may be able to give you insight on what type of diet or eating pattern is the most appropriate for you and your health. They may also advise you on what diets to avoid. Many doctors also provide an in-house diet and nutrition program for patients. It generally will include direct follow up with your physician along with regular weight monitoring. Doctors can provide you with a referral to a registered dietitian that can educate you and help design your own personalized diet plan. In addition, doctors will be able to guide you through medical weight loss. This is where a physician would prescribe a medication to help suppress your appetite, making it easier for you to follow a diet plan. Not all weight loss medications are appropriate for all people. Check with your doctor for more information. Summary:","response":"The article highlights the importance of choosing the right diet or eating plan based on one's individual goals, budget, lifestyle and preferences.

The key is to find a diet that is sustainable in the long term, fits within one's budget and accommodates any food allergies, sensitivities, cultural or religious restrictions. Physical activity, including a combination of cardio and strength training exercises, can support weight loss goals and improve overall health. It is advisable to consult a personal trainer, exercise specialist or join group classes for beginners to develop a suitable fitness program. Additionally, it is vital to involve a physician or dietitian to assess one's current health, medical conditions, and medications, potentially receiving guidance on suitable diets or even medically assisted weight loss.

To provide a valid answer to the question, it is necessary to discuss some of the critiques that have been made against other streaming services. Some of these criticisms may relate to issues such as artist compensation, sound quality, user experience, and business practices. Here is a more detailed response that addresses these concerns. One primary criticism of some music streaming services is their compensation model for artists, particularly when it comes to smaller, independent musicians. Many have argued that the royalties these platforms pay to artists are insufficient, making it difficult for independent musicians to earn a sustainable living. Some services use a pro-rata model, where the total revenue is divided among all artists based on the proportion of total streams they receive. This model tends to favor more popular artists, leaving newer, lesser-known musicians at a disadvantage. Another criticism lies in the sound quality offered by some streaming services. While many users find the audio quality perfectly acceptable for casual listening, audiophiles can be critical, claiming that the compressed formats used by these platforms do not deliver the level of sound quality found in other formats (e.g., vinyl, CDs, or lossless digital files). Tidal addresses this concern, as it offers a high-fidelity streaming option that provides lossless, CD-quality audio for subscribers with compatible equipment. User experience is another area where streaming services may receive criticism. Some argue that many platforms have limited options for creating and editing playlists or lack advanced search and discovery features. In addition, ads on free tiers can be intrusive and disruptive to the user experience. Some users may feel that the algorithm-driven approach to music discovery can lead to homogenized playlists and make it difficult to find new, diverse artists. Lastly, the business practices and the monopolization of the streaming industry by some major players might not always be viewed positively. Some critics argue that certain companies might not be genuine in their support for independent artists or interested in providing fair compensation, which could result in an environment where only major labels and well-established artists truly benefit from the system. In conclusion, while the sentence provided does not directly address the question about the criticism of other streaming services, it can be a starting point to explore the concerns mentioned above and the aspects where Tidal may position itself differently or better within the industry. Beyoncé's involvement as a co-owner of Tidal signifies that the service might be more artist-oriented and could be addressing some of the critiques currently faced by other streaming platforms."},{"question":"next question: If the characters are wearing hats and in a dime store what are you likely watching? Options: - advertisement - old movie - small neighborhood - commercial building - strip mall reasoning:","response":"You are likely watching an old movie. Reasoning: The mention of characters wearing hats suggests that the scene might be from a different time period since hats used to be a common accessory in the past. Additionally, the term \\"dime store\\" refers to a type of store that was popular in the United States before the rise of modern supermarkets and department stores. These stores sold a variety of inexpensive items, which indicates it is a setting associated with a bygone era. While an advertisement or commercial building could potentially feature characters in hats and a dime store, the combination of these elements is more characteristic of an old movie, where storylines and settings are often more historically grounded. The other options, like a small neighborhood or strip mall, don't directly reflect the presence of characters wearing hats or being in a dime store."},{"question":"Ford was born at the Swedish Covenant Hospital in Chicago, Illinois to Christopher Ford (born John William Ford), an advertising executive and former actor, and Dorothy (nee Nidelman), a former radio actress. His father is Irish and his mother is Jewish. A younger brother, Terence, was born in 1945. Ford's paternal grandparents, John Fitzgerald Ford and Florence Veronica Niehaus, were of Irish Catholic and German descent, respectively. In 1964, after a season of summer stock with the Belfry Players in Wisconsin, Ford traveled to Los Angeles to apply for a job in radio voice-overs. He did not get it, but stayed in California and eventually signed a 150-a-week contract with Columbia Pictures' New Talent program, playing bit roles in films. His first known role was an uncredited one as a bellhop in Dead Heat on a Merry-Go-Round (1966). There is little record of his non-speaking roles (or \\"extra\\" work) in film. Ford was at the bottom of the hiring list, having offended producer Jerry Tokovsky after he played a bellboy in the feature. He was told by Tokovsky that when actor Tony Curtis delivered a bag of groceries, he did it like a movie star; Ford felt his job was to act like a bellboy. Ford managed to secure other roles in movies, such as A Time for Killing (The Long Ride Home), starring Glenn Ford; George Hamilton; and Inger Stevens. His speaking roles continued next with Luv (1967), though he was still uncredited. He was finally credited as \\"Harrison J. Ford\\" in the 1967 Western film A Time for Killing, but the \\"J\\" did not stand for anything, since he has no middle name. It was added to avoid confusion with a silent film actor named Harrison Ford, who appeared in more than 80 films between 1915 and 1932 and died in 1957. Ford later said that he was unaware of the existence of the earlier actor until he came upon a star with his own name on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Ford soon dropped the \\"J\\" and worked for Universal Studios, playing minor roles in many television series throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s, including Gunsmoke, Ironside, The Virginian, The F.B.I., Love, American Style, and Kung Fu. He appeared in the western Journey to Shiloh (1968) and had an uncredited, non-speaking role in Michelangelo Antonioni's 1970 film Zabriskie Point as an arrested student protester. Not happy with the roles being offered to him, Ford became a self-taught professional carpenter to support his then-wife and two young sons. Casting director and fledgling producer Fred Roos championed the young Ford and secured him an audition with George Lucas for the role of Bob Falfa, which Ford went on to play in American Graffiti (1973). Ford's relationship with Lucas would profoundly affect his career later on. After director Francis Ford Coppola's film The Godfather was a success, he hired Ford to expand his office and gave him small roles in his next two films, The Conversation (1974) and Apocalypse Now (1979); in the latter film he played an army officer named \\"G.

Movie title: Tender Mercies Movie plot: Mac Sledge (Robert Duvall), a washed up, alcoholic country singer, awakens at a run-down Texas roadside motel and gas station after a night of heavy drinking. He meets the owner, a young widow named Rosa Lee (Tess Harper), and offers to work in exchange for a room. Rosa Lee, whose husband was killed in the Vietnam War, is raising her young son, Sonny (Allan Hubbard), on her own. She agrees to let Mac stay under the condition that he does not drink while working. The two begin to develop feelings for one another, mostly during quiet evenings sitting alone and sharing bits of their life stories. Mac resolves to give up alcohol and start his life anew. After some time passes, he and Rosa Lee wed. They start attending a Baptist church on a regular basis. One day, a newspaper reporter visits the motel and asks Mac whether he has stopped recording music and chosen an anonymous life. When Mac refuses to answer, the reporter explains he is writing a story about Mac and has interviewed his ex-wife, Dixie Scott (Betty Buckley), a country music star who is performing nearby. After the story is printed, the neighborhood learns of Mac's past, and members of a local countryâwestern band visit him to show their respect. Although he greets them politely, Mac remains reluctant to open up about his past. Later, he secretly attends Dixie's concert. She passionately sings several songs that Mac wrote years earlier, and he leaves in the middle of the performance. Backstage, he talks to Dixie's manager, his old friend Harry (Wilford Brimley). Mac gives him a copy of a new song he has written and asks him to show it to Dixie. Mac tries to talk to Dixie, but she becomes angry upon seeing him and warns him to stay away from their 18-year-old daughter, Sue Anne (Ellen Barkin). Upon his return home, Mac assures Rosa Lee he no longer has feelings for Dixie, whom he describes as \\"poison\\" to him. Later, Harry visits Mac to tell him, seemingly at Dixie's urging, that the country music business has changed and his new song is no good....

Article: So long as teachers fail to distinguish between teaching and learning, they will continue to undertake to do for children what only children can do for themselves. Teaching children to read is not passing reading on to them. It is certainly not endless hours spent in activities about reading. Douglas insists that \\"reading cannot be taught directly and schools should stop trying to do the impossible.\\" Teaching and learning are two entirely different processes. They differ in kind and function. The function of teaching is to create the conditions and the climate that will make it possible for children to devise the most efficient system for teaching themselves to read. Teaching is also a public activity. It can be seen and observed. Learning to read involves all that each individual does to make sense of the world of printed language. Almost all of it is private, for learning is an occupation of the mind, and that process is not open to public scrutiny. If teacher and learner roles are not interchangeable, what then can be done through teaching that will aid the child in the quest for knowledge? Smith has one principal rule for all teaching instructions. \\"Make learning to read easy, which means making reading a meaningful, enjoyable and frequent experience for children.\\" When the roles of teacher and learner are seen for what they are, and when both teachers and learners fulfill them appropriately, then much of the pressure and feeling of failure for both is eliminated. Learning to read is made easier when teachers create an environment where children are given the opportunity to solve the problem of leaning to read by reading Question: According to the passage, learning to read will no longer be a difficult task when _ .

The premise explicitly states that \\"A young woman with silly green glasses on and a confused look on her face sits at a table under a tree,\\" which provides clear information about the woman's appearance. The woman is described as wearing \\"silly green glasses,\\" indicating the color, green, as well as the style, which is perceived as silly. The phrase \\"silly green glasses\\" might imply that these glasses have a distinctive or unusual design, making them noticeable or eye-catching in a playful or absurd way. The confused look on her face might suggest that she is in the midst of thought or is experiencing a situation that she finds puzzling or complex. The setting, which has her sitting at a table under a tree, could imply that she is outdoors in a relaxed atmosphere, possibly at a park or an outdoor cafe. In conclusion, based on the provided premise, we can confidently deduce that the hypothesis is true, and the woman indeed has green glasses. The description of her appearance and surroundings, which explicitly states that she is wearing silly green glasses, confirms the hypothesis that she is donning these uniquely styled and colored glasses."},{"question":"In this task, you need to answer the given multiple-choice question on the gain.

Question: Two of which sort of event happened in January 1941? Context: Whitehall's disquiet at the failures of the RAF led to the replacement of Dowding (who was already due for retirement) with Sholto Douglas on 25 November. Douglas set about introducing more squadrons and dispersing the few GL sets to create a carpet effect in the southern counties. Still, in February 1941, there remained only seven squadrons with 87 pilots, under half the required strength. The GL carpet was supported by six GCI sets controlling radar-equipped night-fighters. By the height of the Blitz, they were becoming more successful. The number of contacts and combats rose in 1941, from 44 and two in 48 sorties in January 1941, to 204 and 74 in May (643 sorties). But even in May, 67% of the sorties were visual cat's-eye missions. Curiously, while 43% of the contacts in May 1941 were by visual sightings, they accounted for 61% of the combats.

Here is a detailed explanation of each option mentioned: 1. Hand: This is an unlikely place to find a jellyfish, as they are marine creatures and do not typically come into contact with human hands, unless someone has picked one up or accidentally been stung by one at the beach. However, it is important to note that handling jellyfish can be dangerous, as some species possess venomous stinging cells that can cause painful reactions or even serious injuries. 2. Mediterranean Sea: This is a common place to find jellyfish, as they are widespread in this region, particularly during the summer months. There are several jellyfish species native to the Mediterranean Sea, including the mauve stinger (Pelagia noctiluca), the fried egg jellyfish (Cotylorhiza tuberculata), and the barrel jellyfish (Rhizostoma pulmo). As a popular tourist destination, the Mediterranean coastline sees many incidents of jellyfish stings each year. 3. See: This term is unclear in the context of the question, as \\"see\\" may be a typographical error or refer to the act of visually observing jellyfish. If the term was intended as \\"sea,\\" then naturally, the sea is a common place to find jellyfish in their natural habitat. These creatures have a global distribution and can be found in every ocean, from warm tropical waters to the colder polar regions. 4. Supermarket: This is an unconventional location to find a jellyfish, but it is possible in certain situations. In some Asian countries, like Japan and China, jellyfish are considered a delicacy and can be found for sale in supermarkets or specialty food stores. They are typically sold dried or preserved in salt and require rehydration and preparation before being consumed. 5. Store: If you are referring to a store that sells marine life or aquarium supplies, it is possible to find jellyfish, particularly the non-stinging moon jellyfish (Aurelia aurita), available for purchase as pets for home aquariums. Some specialized pet stores or online retailers offer live jellyfish, as well as special tanks and equipment designed for keeping these delicate creatures in captivity. In summary, the best answer for finding a jellyfish can vary depending on what you seek. If you are looking for jellyfish in their natural habitat, the Mediterranean Sea is an accurate choice, considering that jellyfish are abundant in this region. If you are interested in observing or purchasing jellyfish for culinary purposes or as pets, supermarkets and specialty stores respectively may be appropriate options."},{"question":"Generate a sentence that includes all the following words: attach, building, clock, wall","response":"In the midst of the bustling city, a group of dedicated workers diligently attach a magnificent, antique clock to the upper facade of a recently restored building, instantly transforming the towering structure into an iconic landmark that adds a touch of classical elegance to the otherwise modern wall it dominates."},{"question":"Instructions: In this task, you are given a piece of an article.

A:","response":"The musical that fits this description is \\"Hamilton: An American Musical,\\" an innovative work written by Lin-Manuel Miranda. Miranda, who is of Puerto Rican descent, was already renowned for his first musical, \\"In the Heights,\\" when he began to conceptualize \\"Hamilton.\\" The musical revolutionized Broadway with its innovative blend of musical genres — including rap, hip hop, R&B, traditional-style show tunes, and a hint of pop — and its casting of primarily non-white actors as the Founding Fathers and other historical figures. The work is noted for its dramatic structuring, notable characters and celebrated script. \\"Hamilton\\" is inspired by the 2004 biography \\"Alexander Hamilton\\" by historian Ron Chernow. The show's music, lyrics and book were developed by Miranda. The musical tells the story of Alexander Hamilton, an immigrant from the Caribbean who became an indispensable aid to George Washington during the Revolutionary War, the primary author of the Federalist papers, and the first Secretary of the Treasury of the United States. The decision to cast non-white actors in the roles of the Founding Fathers and other historical figures was intentional and groundbreaking. Miranda said this was to highlight that America then, like now, was built by people of various backgrounds. The original Broadway production starred Miranda as Alexander Hamilton, Leslie Odom Jr. as Aaron Burr, Christopher Jackson as George Washington, Daveed Diggs as Marquis de Lafayette/Thomas Jefferson, and various other artists of diverse backgrounds. The musical went on to win 11 Tony Awards in 2016, including Best Musical, and the Pulitzer Prize for Drama. \\"Hamilton\\" has garnered international acclaim for its artistry and its message of inclusivity and representation. The musical has served as a vehicle for change in the broader theater industry, encouraging more diverse casting and the use of various musical styles in musical theatre. This has also fostered wider conversations about representation in the media and the ways in which we tell historical narratives. Besides its run on Broadway, \\"Hamilton\\" has packed theaters in Chicago, London and on tours across the United States. The live capture of the original Broadway cast was released on Disney+ in 2020, opening the accessibility of the show to a broader audience worldwide. In sum, \\"Hamilton: An American Musical,\\" through its fusion of musical genres and its intentional casting of non-white actors to portray the Founding Fathers and other historical figures, has left an indelible mark on the landscape of American theater.

ABC Television had paid an advance for a TV show. His publisher, Macmillan, was demanding a manuscript of the poem/novel Tarantula. Manager Albert Grossman had scheduled a concert tour for the latter part of the year. On July 29, 1966, Dylan crashed his 500cc Triumph Tiger 100 motorcycle near his home in Woodstock, New York, and was thrown to the ground. Though the extent of his injuries was never disclosed, Dylan said that he broke several vertebrae in his neck. Mystery still surrounds the circumstances of the accident since no ambulance was called to the scene and Dylan was not hospitalized. Dylan's biographers have written that the crash offered Dylan the chance to escape the pressures around him. Dylan confirmed this interpretation in his autobiography: \\"I had been in a motorcycle accident and I'd been hurt, but I recovered. Truth was that I wanted to get out of the rat race.\\" Dylan withdrew from public and, apart from a few appearances, did not tour again for almost eight years.Once Dylan was well enough to resume creative work, he began to edit D. A. Pennebaker's film of his 1966 tour. A rough cut was shown to ABC Television, which rejected it as incomprehensible to a mainstream audience. The film was subsequently titled Eat the Document on bootleg copies, and it has been screened at a handful of film festivals. In 1967 he began recording with the Hawks at his home and in the basement of the Hawks' nearby house, \\"Big Pink\\". These songs, initially demos for other artists to record, provided hits for Julie Driscoll and the Brian Auger Trinity (\\"This Wheel's on Fire\\"), The Byrds (\\"You Ain't Goin' Nowhere\\", \\"Nothing Was Delivered\\"), and Manfred Mann (\\"Mighty Quinn\\"). Columbia released selections in 1975 as The Basement Tapes. Over the years, more songs recorded by Dylan and his band in 1967 appeared on bootleg recordings, culminating in a five-CD set titled The Genuine Basement Tapes, containing 107 songs and alternative takes. In the..., what would be the answer ?

How many large balls can he make with the remaining rubber bands? Think carefully first, then make a decision:","response":"First, let's find out how many rubber bands Michael used for the 22 small balls. 22 small balls * 50 rubber bands per small ball = 1100 rubber bands. Now, let's find out how many rubber bands are remaining: 5000 rubber bands - 1100 rubber bands (already used) = 3900 rubber bands. Next, let's see how many large balls Michael can make with these remaining rubber bands. Since 1 large ball requires 300 rubber bands, we can calculate how many large balls can be made: 3900 rubber bands / 300 rubber bands per large ball = 13 large balls. So, Michael can make 13 large rubber-band balls with the remaining rubber bands."},{"question":"Write an email with the subject line \\"Letters of Credit; Preference; Swap Transactions\\".","response":"Subject: Letters of Credit; Preference; Swap Transactions Dear [Recipient's Name], I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to discuss with you some important financial instruments that are crucial in international trade and financing, namely Letters of Credit (LCs), Preference Shares, and Swap Transactions. These tools, when utilized properly, can provide significant benefits to businesses and individuals involved in international transactions and investments. Firstly, let us discuss Letters of Credit (LCs). LCs are essential financial instruments used in international trade, providing security to the buyer and the seller. The buyer's bank issues an LC, guaranteeing payment to the seller upon presenting specified documents proving the fulfillment of the sales contract. This provides an additional layer of comfort to both parties, and mitigates the risks associated with exchanging goods and services with unfamiliar parties from different legal jurisdictions. Key advantages of using LCs include: 1. Reduced risk of non-payment: The buyer's bank provides a guarantee that the seller will receive payment as long as all specified conditions are met. 2. Improved cash flow: Sellers can obtain financing from their bank against the LC, which helps maintain a steady cash flow. 3. Enhanced credibility: LCs demonstrate the creditworthiness of the buyer, making it more appealing to potential suppliers. Preference Shares, on the other hand, are a type of hybrid capital security that combines elements of both debt and equity financing. Investors holding preference shares receive dividends before common shareholders, making these shares more appealing as an investment option. Additionally, preference shares typically have a fixed dividend rate, which provides a sense of stability for investors. Some benefits of Preference Shares include: 1. Stability in income: Preference shareholders receive fixed, regular dividend payments, offering a consistent income stream. 2. Priority in payment: Preference shareholders receive dividend payments before common shareholders, providing an additional layer of protection. 3. Opportunity for capital appreciation: The market value of preference shares may increase over time, offering the potential for capital gains. Lastly, Swap Transactions are contractual agreements between two parties to exchange cash flows or other financial variables over a specified period. Interest rate swaps, currency swaps, and commodity swaps are common types of Swap Transactions. These agreements help businesses hedge against fluctuations in interest rates, exchange rates, and commodity prices. Key benefits of Swap Transactions include: 1. Risk management: Swap Transactions can effectively manage exposures to fluctuating market variables, securing more stable cash flows. 2. Potential cost savings: Companies can potentially obtain more favorable interest rates or exchange rates through Swap Transactions. 3. Customization: Swap Transactions can be tailored to meet the unique needs and risk appetite of the parties involved. I hope this overview of Letters of Credit, Preference Shares, and Swap Transactions proves useful as you continue to navigate the complexities of international trade and financing. Should you have any questions or require further clarification on these or other financial instruments, please do not hesitate to reach out to me. Thank you for your time and attention, and I look forward to our continued collaboration.

Eventually, Paddy dies in a drunken binge, leaving Emmeline and Michael all alone with each other. Together, they survive solely on their resourcefulness, and the bounty of their remote paradise. Years pass and both Emmeline and Michael become tanned, athletic and nubile young adults. Eventually, their relationship, more along the lines of brother and sister in their youth, blossoms into love, and then passion. Emmeline and Michael have their baby boy, and they live together as common-law husband and wife, content in their solitude. But their marriage is threatened by the arrival of two evil traders, who force the child to dive for pearls at gunpoint, before killing each other off. Emmeline is reminded of the outside world and wants to leave the island. She fears for the child if she and Michael should die, and begins to think of his future.

I've certainly noticed some pupils being feverishly overgenerous of late. Last year, I received not one bottle of wine but four for helping a disaffected pupil through his GCSEs. By and large, my colleagues report the gifts differing along gender lines. Gentlemen get ties, mugs, booze and, if they're really lucky, tickets to football matches. The ladies are often presented with flowers, jewels, chocolates and so on. When my son was at private school, I noticed there was a real competitiveness between the students about giving presents to teachers, with expensive baskets from fancy stores and huge bouquets being handed out on the last days of term. Since my wife and I only let my son give thank-you cards, it was clear we were not \\"classy\\". Now he is at an inner-city primary, we've noticed that this kind of _ seems to have more or less disappeared. For one thing, there isn't that kind of money floating around - but there isn't that kind of competitive culture either. Personally, I think gifts to teachers should be banned beyond the thank-you card: they cause many more problems than they solve, creating insecurity in both parents and staff. Perhaps the recession and the lack of money in people's pockets might be a good excuse for the government to issue some guidelines to schools that gifts shouldn't be accepted by teachers.

Sentence 2: After nearly 300 years, political power returned to Edinburgh. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","response":"Yes, if the first sentence is true, then the second sentence is also true. Both sentences communicate the same essential information: that political power has returned to Edinburgh after a period of nearly 300 years. The difference lies in their phrasing and structure. Sentence 1 begins by emphasizing the result first, which is the return of political power to Edinburgh. \\"Political power thus returned to Edinburgh after nearly 300 years\\" highlights the causal relationship between a certain sequence of events and their outcome, which is the return of political power to Edinburgh. The use of \\"thus\\" implies a connection with prior information that may have explained how this development came to be. On the other hand, sentence 2 offers a more direct statement of the same information. \\"After nearly 300 years, political power returned to Edinburgh\\" shifts the focus to the time it took for political power to return to Edinburgh. This arrangement emphasizes the duration of time that has passed before political power was restored. In conclusion, if the information contained in the first sentence is true, then the second sentence, which conveys the same message with a different structure, will also be considered true. Both sentences essentially state that political power has returned to Edinburgh after an absence of nearly 300 years, which allows us to confirm the consistency of the facts represented in both sentences."},{"question":"Based on the premise \\"For the Menidia beryllina test method, the effluent sample was an industrial wastewater spiked with CuSO4, the receiving water sample was a natural seawater spiked with CuSO4, and the reference toxicant sample was bioassay-grade FORTY FATHOMSa synthetic seawater spiked with CuSO4.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"There were reports of the solution causing side effects. \\" is true (see options)?

Given the context: Why did Sasha do this? pick from the following. (I). wanted to punish Bailey (II). wanted to avoid Bailey (III). wanted to be close to her friend Answer:","response":"Based on the provided context, it appears that Sasha settled among Bailey's neighborhood and saw Bailey nearly every day because Sasha wanted to be close to her friend (Option III). This can be inferred because moving into the same neighborhood as someone and seeing them frequently is usually a sign of wanting to strengthen one's friendship or bond with that person. If Sasha had wanted to punish Bailey (Option I) or avoid Bailey (Option II), it is unlikely that she would have chosen to live in the same neighborhood where the likelihood of encountering Bailey on a regular basis would be high. Living in close proximity to a friend offers numerous benefits, such as convenience in meeting up or spending time together, offering mutual support in times of need, and fostering a sense of community. This arrangement can ultimately lead to the formation of closer relationships, shared experiences, and lifelong memories that both Sasha and Bailey can cherish. Furthermore, seeing Bailey every day indicates that Sasha is interested in maintaining frequent communication and interaction with Bailey. This aligns with the idea of nourishing a close friendship rather than punishing or avoiding someone. Daily interactions can further provide emotional support and the opportunity to share experiences and make plans together. In conclusion, based on the context provided, Sasha settled among Bailey's neighborhood and saw Bailey nearly every day because she wanted to be close to her friend (Option III).

It enclosed twenty pages describing an evolutionary mechanism, a response to Darwin's recent encouragement, with a request to send it on to Lyell if Darwin thought it worthwhile. The mechanism was similar to Darwin's own theory. Darwin wrote to Lyell that \\"your words have come true with a vengeance, ... forestalled\\" and he would \\"of course, at once write and offer to send [it] to any journal\\" that Wallace chose, adding that \\"all my originality, whatever it may amount to, will be smashed\\". Lyell and Hooker agreed that a joint publication putting together Wallace's pages with extracts from Darwin's 1844 Essay and his 1857 letter to Gray should be presented at the Linnean Society, and on 1 July 1858, the papers entitled On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection, by Wallace and Darwin respectively, were read out but drew little reaction. While Darwin considered Wallace's idea to be identical to his concept of natural selection, historians have pointed out differences. Darwin described natural selection as being analogous to the artificial selection practised by animal breeders, and emphasised competition between individuals; Wallace drew no comparison to selective breeding, and focused on ecological pressures that kept different varieties adapted to local conditions. Some historians have suggested that Wallace was actually discussing group selection rather than selection acting on individual variation.\\" Answer: The answer is:","response":"In the work presented to the Linnean Society, the facet of evolution by natural selection highlighted by Alfred Russel Wallace was the role of ecological pressures in maintaining variation and adaptation among species to local conditions. Unlike Charles Darwin, who emphasized competition between individuals and drew similarities between natural selection and artificial selection practiced by animal breeders, Wallace focused on how environmental factors impacted the survival and reproduction of different varieties within a species. While both Wallace and Darwin presented the idea of natural selection as the mechanism driving the evolution of species, their perspectives on the process differed. Wallace's emphasis on ecological pressures as the primary driving force of natural selection highlighted the importance of the relationship between organisms and their environment in shaping the adaptations and survival of different varieties. This focus on the ecological aspect of natural selection was distinct from Darwin's approach, which placed more weight on competitive interactions between individual organisms and drew parallels with selective breeding practices in domesticated species. In Wallace's viewpoint, species continuously evolve and adapt to their local environments as a result of the selective pressures placed on them. These pressures arise from various ecological factors such as availability of resources, predation, and competition between and within species. Over time, the varieties that are better adapted to these specific local conditions tend to survive and reproduce more effectively, passing on their successful traits to future generations and perpetuating those adaptations as part of their lineage. It is important to note that some historians have argued that Wallace was discussing group selection instead of selection acting on individual variation. Group selection refers to the idea that natural selection could favor the survival and reproduction of groups of organisms, rather than individuals, based on certain beneficial traits within those groups. In this interpretation, Wallace's focus on ecological pressures might be seen as a basis for a more collective evolutionary process, emphasizing the role of cooperative interactions and ecological relationships between species or populations in driving evolutionary change. In conclusion, the facet of evolution by natural selection that was highlighted by Wallace in his work presented to the Linnean Society was the significance of ecological pressures in shaping adaptations and maintaining the diversity of species in different local environments. His perspective on natural selection was distinct from Darwin's in that it concentrated on the environmental aspects driving the process, rather than the competitive relationships between individuals or the analogy to artificial selection in domestic animals."},{"question":"Choose the sentence that goes against common sense.

So think first.","response":"Let's evaluate both sentences to determine which one goes against common sense: - Sentence A: \\"People can usually travel by civil aviation.\\" Civil aviation refers to the transportation of passengers and cargo by non-military aircraft. This is a common method of travel for most people, as it includes commercial flights and private planes. Additionally, airports and airlines are widely available for public use, making this statement reasonable and in line with common sense. - Sentence B: \\"People can usually travel by fighter plane.\\" Fighter planes are military aircraft designed for air-to-air combat and are not intended for civilian use or general transportation. It's highly unlikely that a regular person would have the opportunity to travel by fighter plane, as these aircraft are typically reserved for military personnel and specific missions.

Based on this analysis, Sentence B: \\"People can usually travel by fighter plane\\" goes against common sense, as it pertains to a mode of transportation that is not typically accessible or designed for civilian use."},{"question":"Answer the following question: U.S. President Donald Trump says he is considering tariffs, quotas, and retaliatory taxes on imports of steel and aluminum from countries such as China, Japan, and South Korea. The comments came during a wide-ranging trade discussion Tuesday between Trump and a bipartisan group of lawmakers at the White House. The president said U.S. steel and aluminum industries are being \\"decimated\\" by the \\"dumping\\" of cheap imports of those materials into U.S. markets. Trump has long threatened what he calls \\"reciprocal\\" trade action to deal with steel, aluminum, and other imports. But he has so far avoided taking any major steps, ostensibly out of fear of hurting the country's strong economic performance since he took office. Several lawmakers on Tuesday urged Trump to be cautious when considering retaliatory trade steps, saying such measures could spark a trade war that leads to higher prices for U.S. producers and consumers. \\"It's very, very much a double-edged sword,\\" Trump conceded. \\"I want to keep prices down, but I also want to make sure that we have a steel industry and an aluminum industry,\\" he added. The Trump administration is currently renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), as well as the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement with South Korea. Trump called the U.S.-South Korea deal \\"very, very bad\\" and \\"horrible.\\" He also said Canada has \\"treated us very, very unfairly.\\" Last month, the U.S. Commerce Department sent a so-called \\"232 report\\" to the White House, examining the national security impacts of steel and aluminum imports, and giving Trump 90 days to impose quotas or tariffs.

The identity of the person or thing performing the action is often crucial for understanding the overall meaning. In this case, it highlights the occupation of the individual, suggesting that the event may be connected to his profession. 2. \\"Drives\\": This is the verb in the sentence, which often represents the most crucial action within the sentence. Verbs describe what the subject of the sentence is doing. Here, it shows the action that the fisherman is taking with the boat. It's worth mentioning that the use of \\"drives\\" in the context of operating a boat is somewhat colloquial; typically, one might say a boat is \\"sailed,\\" \\"piloted,\\" or \\"steered.\\" 3. \\"Wooden Boat\\": This is the object of the sentence, implying what the main action (drives) is being enacted on. The object often has significant importance in a sentence because it can show the direction of the action and can contribute to the broader context. In this instance, the boat may suggest the fisherman's work context or perhaps the technology level of his equipment (a wooden boat as opposed to a plastic or metal one). Therefore, while every word contributes to the holistic understanding of a sentence, \\"fisherman,\\" \\"drives,\\" and \\"wooden boat\\" are the most important words in this sentence as they provide the core information about who is doing what action and to what object."},{"question":"Hoping to rebound from their divisional home loss to the Redskins, the Cowboys stayed at home for a Week 5 interconference duel with the Cincinnati Bengals.

Answer:","response":"John Pratt, 1st Marquess Camden, was a prominent British Tory politician and nobleman, born on February 11, 1759, in Lincoln's Inn Fields, London. He was educated at the prestigious Trinity College, Cambridge, and went on to serve in various high-ranking political positions throughout his career. His tenure in these roles took place under notable Prime Ministers such as William Pitt the Younger and Spencer Perceval. Camden's distinguished political career began when he was appointed Lord President of the Council in March 1795, during which his predecessor was Lord Hobart. Following this appointment, he went on to serve as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland from 26 March 1798 to June 1798; his successor in this role was the Marquess Cornwallis. Camden's next appointment came as Secretary of State for War from 14 May 1804 to 10 July 1805, under Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger. Viscount Castlereagh succeeded him in this office. On July 10, 1805, Camden took on the role of Secretary of State for the Colonies under Prime Minister Pitt the Younger and continued to hold this position through Prime Minister Spencer Perceval's term, from February 1806 to April 1812. His term end in this office was marked by the appointment of the Earl Fitzwilliam as his successor. In his personal life, Camden was married to Frances Molesworth, who passed away in 1829. They had no issue. Camden's life came to an end on October 8, 1840, in Seale, Surrey. Despite his numerous political accomplishments, the 1st Marquess Camden remains an important yet lesser-known figure in late 18th and early 19th-century British politics."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given a text from tweets and a boolean question whether this tweet has positive sentiment or negative sentiment.

That means that a target, set in 1998 by the then Labour government, to halve teen pregnancies by 2010 has finally been met, six years late. Alison Hadley, who led the government's strategy, warned the job was not over. Ms Hadley, from the University of Bedfordshire, said it was \\"an extraordinary achievement\\", given that many thought the goal was unattainable and high rates were \\"an intractable part of English life\\". Education programmes and easier access to contraception played a part in bringing down rates, even in deprived areas. But she added: \\"Despite the big reduction, the job is not done. \\"England continues to lag behind comparable western European countries, teenagers continues to be at greatest risk of unplanned pregnancy and outcomes for some young parents and their children remain disproportionately poor,\\" she said. She highlighted the differences between regions, with girls in the north east of England more likely to get pregnant than those living in the South East and South West. \\"It is vital to keep a focus on teenage pregnancy to sustain the progress made and narrow inequalities,\\" she said. \\"Universal, high quality sex and relationships education, well-publicised, easy-to-use contraceptive and sexual health services, a youth-friendly workforce and good support for young parents, all need to be in place so successive generations of young people have the knowledge, skills and confidence to make choices. \\"Disinvestment now risks an upturn in the rates,\\" she added. Clare Murphy, from the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, said shifts in teenage behaviour may also be factors in the falling number of pregnancies, together with better access to contraception and sex education. \\"The plummeting level of teenage drinking, for example, may be reducing the likelihood of unprotected sex, and teenagers are also increasingly socialising online, limiting the opportunities for sexual activity,\\" she said. The ONS research also found: • The estimated number of conceptions to girls under 18 fell to 22,653 in 2014 compared with 24,306 in 2013, a decrease of 6.8% • An estimated 4,160 girls under 16 got pregnant in 2014, compared with 4,648 in 2013, a fall of 10% • There were some 871,038 conceptions to women of all ages in 2014, compared with 872,849 in 2013, a slight decrease of 0.2% • Conception rates in 2014 increased for women aged 25 and over, and decreased for women under 25","response":"In 2014, 23 conceptions per 1,000 girls aged 15 to 17 occurred in England and Wales, marking a significant decrease compared to the high of 55 in 1971, as reported by the Office of National Statistics.

Because the AVSDU was not working, Greeneville's executive officer, Lieutenant Commander Gerald K. Pfeifer, entered the sonar room and observed the contacts on the sonar screens. Pfeifer then stood in the doorway between the sonar and control rooms, but did not communicate any updated sonar information to Waddle in the control room. At 13:34, sonar gained a new contact, designated S-14. Because Greeneville had not maintained a steady, slow course for a sufficient amount of time, the sonar data available to the Fire Control Technician of the Watch did not allow accurate determination on Ehime Maru's range or course. Also, due to time constraints placed by Waddle, the ship did not perform normal maneuvers which would be used to obtain accurate course and range information on the sonar contacts prior to proceeding to periscope depth.At 13:38, Greeneville reached periscope depth (about 60 feet (18 m) below the surface). At this time, Ehime Maru was about 2,315 yards (2.117 km) or 1.14 nautical miles (2.1 km) away from the submarine and heading in her direction. Although sonar data began to more accurately depict Ehime Maru's true range and bearing at this point, this was not evident to the sonar operators. Lieutenant, Junior Grade Michael J. Coen, the officer of the deck, conducted an initial low magnification periscope search of the area and sighted no nearby ships.

Their exchange worried me. You don't chat during a race unless you feeling good, and Peggy plainly was. Still, I was close enough to overtake her if she tired, so I didn't give up hope completely. We were getting nearer to a long, punishing hill now and it would be the test. We were a mile from the finish line, so whatever happened on the hill would almost determine who crossed it first. As I moved up the hill, my attention wandered for a few minutes. When I looked up, Peggy was moving away--first five yards, then ten, then more. Finally it was clear that there was no help of catching her. She beat me soundly. There is an important lesson in that race. Women are thought to be weaker, slower and not nearly as skilled in sport. Yet as Peggy Mimno so clearly showed, the similarities between men and women runners are more important than differences. I have run with a number of women, and I can say it is often hard work.

What can one do better after learning about a subject? Options: - form opinions - change - headache - advance - start reproduction","response":"To answer this question, let's evaluate each option step-by-step to determine which one best fits the context of \\"doing better\\" after learning about a subject. 1. Form opinions: After learning about a subject, a person would be better equipped to form opinions based on their newly acquired knowledge. This seems like a suitable answer choice. 2. Change: Gaining knowledge on a subject might spark change in one's attitude, behavior, or beliefs about that subject. This could be a reasonable answer as well. 3. Headache: This option does not seem relevant to the context of improving or doing better after learning about a subject. It's unlikely for this to be a correct answer. 4. Advance: After acquiring knowledge on a subject, a person might be more prepared to advance in that field or navigate related topics. This is also a suitable answer choice. 5. Start reproduction: This option seems out of context and doesn't relate to improving or doing better after learning about a subject. As a result, this option can be discarded. After evaluating each option, we can conclude that \\"form opinions,\\" \\"change,\\" and \\"advance\\" are suitable answers to the question of what one can do better after learning about a subject. Although \\"headache\\" and \\"start reproduction\\" could be literal responses under some specific circumstances, they don't fit the context of improving or doing better in most cases."},{"question":"Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

Title: Evening Movie plot: As Ann lays bedridden, living out the last couple of days of her life, she begins to hallucinate and relive the weekend that changed her life forever - the weekend when she was invited to be the maid of honour to best friend Lila Wittenborn, and met Harris Arden - the love of her life.Ann had gone to college together with Lila and her baby brother Buddy, who had since then developing a crush on Ann without her knowing. The headstrong, free-spirited night club singer from New York did not mix well with the New Port society; equally ill at ease are Buddy and Harris. Buddy is an idealist young man who drown his frustration with himself and his family stature into bottles of champagne; while Harris has to deal with the constant reminder that he should know \\"his place\\" when socialising with the masters, even though he is now a respected doctor.While Ann and Harris left the party to spend a night together, Buddy was killed in a car accident when chasing after them. Overwhelmed with guilt, and knowing that Lila is still in love with Harris, the lovers parted ways even though they remained in love with each other.Running parallel to the flashback, another plot line shows Ann's two daughters struggling with old feuds and the pressure of looking after the dying woman. Connie grew up witnessing her mothers two failed marriages and singing career, and became the typical suburban working soccer mom.

He marched from the Cotswolds, feigned an offensive to relieve the besieged Windsor Castle, and attacked eastwards around London to Cambridge to separate the rebel-held areas of Lincolnshire and East Anglia. From there he travelled north to relieve the rebel siege at Lincoln and back east to King's Lynn, probably to order further supplies from the continent.[nb 17] In King's Lynn, John contracted dysentery, which would ultimately prove fatal. Meanwhile, Alexander II invaded northern England again, taking Carlisle in August and then marching south to give homage to Prince Louis for his English possessions; John narrowly missed intercepting Alexander along the way.

If you don't want to read about sex and drugs  or don't want your kids reading about them  young adult fiction can look like a minefield. Publishers rarely give age guidance on these novels, though online booksellers are sometimes more helpful; be forewarned that if the rating is \\"young adult\\" or \\"14 and up,\\" that often means sexual content. Yet it's possible to avoid the thinly imagined characters, as well as the reckless, credit-card-reliant behavior, of teenage chick lit and find many superb novels for girls. Below is a selection of 12 notable books of recent years, many of them finalists and winners of major prizes, or books that show up on teenagers' own Top 10 lists. Parents and other adults in these novels usually fail to prevent young people from acting out  with variously comic or tragic consequences. Yet their authors recognize the developing moral intelligence of both their characters and their audience, producing stimulating books for young readers (that parents might even enjoy). This is expanded from a list running in the print edition of this week's Book Review. Angus, Thongs and Full-Frontal Snogging: Confessions of Georgia Nicolson, by Louise Rennison. (Avon, 6.99.) The first book in a popular British series. Sometimes compared with Bridget Jones, 14-year-old Georgia is very funny in her own right and has problems any teenager could relate to. (Ages 12 and up) Be More Chill, by Ned Vizzini. (Miramax, 7.99.) ''The Corrections'' meets ''Fast Times at Ridgemont High'' in this realistic high school novel that swerves into satiric fantasy when Jeremy Heere, a nerd, swallows a quantum supercomputer that gives instructions in being cool. (Ages 14 and up) Breakout, by Paul Fleischman. (Simon Pulse, 6.99.) At 17, Del escapes her foster home in a used car, heading for freedom on the L.A. freeway. Then an epic traffic jam happens. \\"The lanes teemed like an Arab bazaar. Del entered and felt herself disappear into the labyrinth.\\" (Ages 14 and up) The Earth, My Butt, and Other Big Round Things, by Carolyn Mackler. (Candlewick, 8.99.) Virginia Shreves is tired of being fat, especially compared with her perfect older brother - until she discovers that he's really not perfect at all. A scathing look at the world of selfish Manhattan parents and snobbish private schools. (Ages 14 and up) Feeling Sorry for Celia, by Jaclyn Moriarty. (St. Martin's Griffin, 12.95.) A story told in sharp, funny and sometimes surreal letters exchanged between Elizabeth Clarry and her parents, her friend Celia and a few organizations that seem to know all about her insecurities - like the Society of People Who Are Definitely Going to Fail High School. (Ages 12 and up) Flipped, by Wendelin Van Draanen. (Knopf, 8.95.) Bryce Loski and Juli Baker, next-door neighbors, have a love-hate relationship that goes back years, and each gets a say in alternating chapters. The tone is light, but both of their families have challenges to overcome. (Ages 9 to 12) The Friends, by Rosa Guy. (Laurel Leaf, 5.99.) A classic tale of friendship, family struggle and survival at a new school, when Phyllisia Cathy, 14, has to decide whether to accept the friendship of a tough girl who is barely surviving herself. (Ages 9 to 12) If You Come Softly, by Jacqueline Woodson. (Speak/Penguin, 5.99.) Tragedy is hinted at from the first page, when Ellie, who is white, begins to recall how she fell in love with Jeremiah, who is black. Watching them overcome the distance between them is most of the point - but so is discovering the gaps that can't be breached. (Ages 10 and up) Life Is Funny, by E. R. Frank. (Puffin, 7.99.) A novel about 11 New York City teenagers from whole and broken homes, rich and poor, each speaking in a distinctive language - often harsh, yet eloquent. The action is gritty, and parents rarely help and often hurt.

Article: World Future Society People People may live for up to 120 years and use new technology to help when people go blind, deaf and have other problems. The number of people over a hundred years old could go from 135,000 today to 2.2 million people by 2050. By 2015 people think that 100 million workers will be able to work from home for a company in a different country by using the Internet. Money Worldwide e-business will become even more successful with online shops that sell special products for each person, which will be brought to their house the next day. Environment The technology for making energy from wind and the Sun is growing very quickly. In the future wind and Sun energy could become much cheaper and many more countries could use it. This would be very useful in poor countries. The air in big cities would also become much cleaner and healthier as a result. Society and culture The Internet will help to create more worldwide friendships. Families may spend more time together as people will be able to do 24-hour online banking and shopping. Technology The new science of \\"nanotechnology\\" (very small robots or machines) will make all sorts of products smaller and lighter. Very, very small machines could take away rubbish, make things in factories, and help inside the human body by taking away fat. By 2012 people will be able to wear these small machines that look like watches, which will give them lots of information about their body and keep them healthy.

The family moved to Cairo, Egypt, a few months after his birth, and Copeland spent his formative years in the Middle East. In 1957, his family moved to Beirut, Lebanon, and Copeland attended the American Community School there. He started taking drum lessons at age 12 and was playing drums for school dances within a year. Context: In late 1976, Copeland founded the Police with lead singer-bass guitarist Sting and guitarist Henry Padovani (who was soon replaced by Andy Summers), and they became one of the top bands of the 1980s. The Police's early track list was mostly made of Copeland's compositions, including the band's first single \\"Fall Out\\" (Illegal Records, 1977) and the B side \\"Nothing Achieving\\". Though Copeland's songwriting contribution was reduced to a couple of songs per album as Sting started writing more material, he continued to co-arrange all the Police's songs with his two bandmates. Amongst Copeland's most notable songs are \\"On Any Other Day\\" (where he sang lead vocals too), \\"Does Everyone Stare\\" (later to be used as the title of his documentary on the band Everyone Stares: The Police Inside Out), \\"Contact\\", \\"Bombs Away\\", \\"Darkness\\" and \\"Miss Gradenko\\". Copeland also co-wrote a number of songs with Sting, including \\"Peanuts\\", \\"Landlord\\", \\"It's Alright for You\\" and \\"Re-Humanize Yourself\\". Copeland also recorded under the pseudonym Klark Kent, releasing several UK singles in 1978 with one (\\"Don't Care\\") entering the UK Singles Chart that year, along with an eponymously titled 10-inch album on green vinyl released in 1980. Recorded at Nigel Gray's Surrey Sound Studio, Copeland played all the instruments and sang the lead vocals himself. Kent's \\"Don't Care\\", which peaked at #48 UK in August 1978, actually predates the first chart single by the Police by several months (\\"Can't Stand Losing You\\", issued in October 1978) as \\"Don't Care\\" was released in early June 1978. In 1982 Copeland was involved in the production of a WOMAD benefit album called Music and Rhythm. Copeland's score for Rumble Fish secured him a Golden Globe nomination in 1983. The film, directed and produced by Francis Ford Coppola from the S. E. Hinton novel, also had a song released to radio on A&M Records \\"Don't Box Me In\\" (UK Singles Chart n. 91)--a collaboration between Copeland and singer/songwriter Stan Ridgway, leader of the band Wall of Voodoo--that received significant airplay upon release of the film that year. The Police stopped touring in 1984, and during this brief hiatus he released a solo album, The Rhythmatist. The record was the result of a pilgrimage to Africa and its people, and it features local drums and percussion, with more drums, percussion, other musical instruments and occasional lead vocals added by Copeland. The album was the official soundtrack to the movie of the same name, which was co-written by Stewart. He also starred in the film, which is \\"A musical odyssey through the heart of Africa in search of the roots of rock & roll.\\" (Copeland is seen playing the drums in a cage with lions surrounding him.) The band attempted a reunion in 1986, but the project fell apart. Question: Were the songs successfull?. Whats the answer?","response":"Yes, many of the songs by the Police and Stewart Copeland were successful. The Police became one of the top bands of the 1980s, and their singles like \\"Don't Care\\" and \\"Can't Stand Losing You\\" entered the UK Singles Chart. They had many popular songs, and Stewart Copeland's solo album, The Rhythmatist, was also the official soundtrack for a movie. So, the answer is that their songs were successful and well-liked by the people."},{"question":"Use the following highlights to write an article: Dr Sarah Wollaston for Totnes, Devon, say schools 'collude with making women invisible' if they allow niqab.

Article:","response":"Title: Why Some People Think that Schools Should Not Allow Niqab Once upon a time, there was a big doctor named Dr. Sarah Wollaston, who lived in a place called Totnes in Devon. She had a very important job - she had to help make decisions for the people. One day, Dr. Sarah said that schools should not let girls wear a niqab, because it makes women invisible. Do you know what a niqab is? It's a special piece of cloth that some women wear on their faces. It's a part of their religion and culture. But, there was a big college in Birmingham called Birmingham Metropolitan College, where some students got upset when the college didn't let them wear the niqab. So, the students talked about it with each other and decided to protest. They wanted to change the rules so they could wear their niqab at school. The people who worked at the college listened to the students, and they changed the rule. Now students can wear the niqab if they want to. And guess what? Another big event happened that week! A judge let a woman wear her burqa while she talked in court. A burqa is another special piece of cloth that women wear, and it covers their whole body and face. Some people agree with Dr. Sarah, while some others think that girls and women should be allowed to wear their niqab and burqa at schools because it's a part of their religion and culture.

Could you please translate this to English?","response":"\\"Production of NR4 Information Return. Mutual Investment Corporations are required to produce the NR4 information return by March 31, 2007, for determined distributions paid to non-residents in 2006.\\" This French sentence pertains to a specific tax document Canadian corporations dealing with non-residents must fill out. Called the NR4 Information Return, this document pertains to taxes withheld from income amounts that are paid or credited to non-residents of Canada. Firstly, let's break down what an NR4 Information Return is. According to Canadian laws, it is a statement regarding any amount that a corporation might have paid or credited to people who are not residents of Canada. This can include any type of income such as retirements benefits, dividends, royalties, commissions, or other types of payments. The NR4 Information Return shows the gross amount of the payment or credit, its net amount, and the tax withheld. Now, from the French sentence, we come to understand that Mutual Investment Corporations are required to fill and file this document. This term may refer to a specific type of investment corporation or company, that pools money from many investors to invest in a diversified portfolio of securities. The mutual part of the name refers to the fact that all the profits and losses are shared among the investors. The deadline mentioned in the sentence is March 31, 2007. This means that corporations had to provide this information about payments made during the year 2006 by this date. So, if a Mutual Investment Corporation had paid any sort of income to a non-resident in 2006, the corporation had until March 31, 2007, to submit their NR4 Information Document. Thus, to put simply, this sentence mandates that these companies report all payments made to non-residents (like dividends paid to foreign shareholders) for the fiscal year 2006 by March of the following year. The NR4 would include details of the amount paid and the taxes that were withheld at the source."},{"question":"Write a sentence about a restaurant with all the following attributes: name = The Vaults, food = English, priceRange = high, familyFriendly = yes Sentence:","response":"The Vaults is a premium, family-friendly English restaurant known for its delightful culinary experience, offering a wide range of exquisite traditional dishes in a high price range, ensuring a memorable dining adventure for families seeking quality and sophistication."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Question: Where is a Pterosaur shot?

Joe Nolan (Cesar Romero) is the head of an expedition to the South Pacific to retrieve an atomic-powered rocket that vanished without a trace. He had previously lived in a South American jungle, as has fellow serviceman and pilot Lt. Danny Wilson (Chick Chandler), who is also on the expedition. Aircraft mechanic Sgt. William Tatlow (Sid Melton) is also recruited for the expedition, which includes the three scientists who helped build the rocket. Their transport aircraft mysteriously crash-lands on a remote, unknown tropical island in the area where the rocket was lost on radar. They find only two occupants left on the island, a native woman (Acquanetta) and her young brother. The woman indicates something fell from the sky atop a forbidding, cloud-shrouded plateau that dominates part of the island. The rocket's fiery arrival caused the rest of the native population to abandon the island. Expedition member Stanley Briggs (Whit Bissell) is accidentally killed on the steep ascent of the escarpment. After long stretches of tedious rock climbing, the expedition finally closes in on the top. Emerging from what turns out to be a toxic gas cloud cover, they discover a lush, prehistoric jungle inhabited by various dinosaurs and a large field of uranium, which is what has disabled their electronic tracking equipment. The group comes upon a Brontosaurus, which then attacks Robert Phillips (Hugh Beaumont) as he quickly retreats up a tree. This results in Nolan and Wilson shooting at it, but they quickly discover that the dinosaur's thick hide absorbs bullets with little effect. Later that night they set up camp. When Nolan wakes up, he finds Phillips and Russian scientist Michael Rostov (John Hoyt) gone.

In many cultures and societies around the world, marriage and family are sacred institutions, seen not merely as legal or societal bonds, but as connections that carry spiritual and moral significance. They are seen as avenues for personal growth and fulfillment, for the propagation of society, and for social stability and harmony. To see these institutions coming under discussion in a societal setting or a political arena reflects their vital essence and their timeless relevance.

'A few trays of jewellery dropped to the floor, I think they were shocked at being attacked back. 'I didn't think about myself even though my head was bleeding badly.' The four offenders got away with tens of thousands of pounds worth of stock, and Mr Nicholls admitted he was unsure whether to continue running the business. Detective Constable Steve Goddard, from West Midlands Police, said: 'The victim was lucky to have got away with relatively minor injuries following what was an extremely nasty attack, there was no need for the level of violence used. 'I'm keen to hear from anyone who witnessed any of what happened or anyone who has any information about who may be responsible.'

Here are possible answers to this question: - corner thief - help - searching in dark - direct traffic - hurry along I believe the correct choice is \\"direct traffic\\", here's why: A:","response":"When you observe policemen outside donning safety vests and holding flashlights, it is highly likely that they are engaged in directing traffic. This conclusion is drawn based on the following rationale: 1. Safety Vests: Policemen are required to wear highly visible safety vests when performing duties that involve managing traffic. The bright, reflective material aids in increasing their visibility to drivers, especially during nighttime or in low-light conditions. This safeguards them from potential accidents, as drivers are alerted to the presence of law enforcement personnel on or near the roadway. 2. Flashlights: The use of flashlights, particularly those with flashing or strobing features, is another essential tool for officers responsible for directing traffic. By illuminating their presence and using the flashlight to signal drivers, police can effectively catch the attention of approaching vehicles and guide them in the appropriate direction. Considering these factors, the correct choice among the given options is \\"direct traffic.\\" The other choices can be evaluated as follows: - Corner thief: This suggests that the police are attempting to catch a thief. While this may be a plausible situation, the use of safety vests and flashlights would typically not serve as key components in pursuing criminals, particularly if stealth is necessary. Moreover, such a situation would generally involve additional resources, such as backup officers and canine units. - Help: While 'help' is an ambiguous term, it is possible that the officers may be rendering assistance in some form. Nevertheless, the presence of safety vests and flashlights points strongly toward traffic management rather than general assistance. - Searching in dark: Police officers could potentially search for a missing person, evidence, or a fleeing suspect in dark areas. However, wearing safety vests would be counterproductive to their efforts, as it would make them highly visible and may compromise the mission. In such cases, they would rely on equipment such as standard flashlights and portable searchlights that maximize visibility without compromising their position. - Hurry along: This term seems to indicate that the police are attempting to hasten the movement or dispersal of a crowd. Although safety vests and flashlights could be used in this context, it is far more probable that they are being employed to direct traffic. Crowd control would typically involve the use of additional equipment, such as barriers and public address systems, to communicate and enforce the desired actions. In conclusion, the presence of police officers outside wearing safety vests and holding flashlights most likely indicates that they are engaged in directing traffic. The factors of increased visibility, the use of signaling tools, and the working conditions all point to traffic management as their primary duty in this scenario."},{"question":"Generate a correctly punctuated version of the following text: Additional tips included Standard brush Silky brush brush for furniture soft brush brush to clean crevices","response":"Additional tips included: Standard brush, Silky brush, brush for furniture, soft brush, brush to clean crevices."},{"question":"I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.

It is common for companies going public to warn investors about “risk factors.” This small-print list of doomsday scenarios usually include such things as market competition, shrinking profit margins and changing technologies or customer tastes. Zynga’s IPO filing contains a new kind of risk factor: sudden wealth. According to the s filing, Zynga, maker of “FarmVille,” “CityVille” and other games played on Facebook’s website, owes its success in large part to its culture. One threat to that culture is the sudden wealth that could be created by the stock offering, the company states. “Many of our employees may be able to receive significant proceeds from sales of our equity in the public markets after our initial public offering, which may reduce their motivation to continue to work for us. Moreover, we expect that this offering will create disparities in wealth among our employees, which may harm our culture and relations among employees.” Basically, Zynga is saying that when people win the IPO lottery and become instant multimillionaires or billionaires, they may not want wake up at 5 a.m. every morning and hammer out code until midnight or create new forms of online agriculture. Some days, the employees would rather go surfing. It is the second part of the statement that is the most interesting–especially for a company steeped in the hyper-competitive, wealth-seeking culture of Silicon Valley. Taking a cue from some Democrats and a wave of reports and books on inequality, the San Francisco start-up business says widening wealth disparities can damage institutions and relationships. Part of this is indisputable: working alongside someone who suddenly and publicly has a net worth of about 3 billion can certainly change the water-cooler conversation. (“So, how’s the yacht-shopping going?”) But is it really a risk factor? Dont some of the most successful technology companies have Silicon Valley have huge wealth disparities? Look at Oracles King Larry, or Microsoft, which created the worlds richest man? It is nice to talk about an “everyone is equal” culture, especially in the faux-meritocracy of the technology world. But the realities of todays winner-take-all compensation schemes suggest that all-equal cultures rarely endure as companies go public. And some companies manage to do just fine with radical wealth disparities. It may even motivate some to reach the top. Still, hats off to Zynga for raising an issue that in many IPO companies is a real risk factor but never gets mentioned. Do you think wealth disparities can harm a start-up business? What are the most important parts of this text?","response":"The main concern raised in this text is whether the sudden wealth generated for Zynga employees after its IPO filing could potentially harm the company's culture, work ethic, and relations among employees. Zynga, the creator of popular games like \\"FarmVille\\" and \\"CityVille,\\" attributes its success to its strong culture. However, with employees becoming overnight millionaires or billionaires after the IPO, the company fears the motivation to work might be reduced, and wealth disparities might affect relationships among employees. While acknowledging that some successful technology companies, like Oracle or Microsoft, thrive despite significant wealth disparities, the text highlights Zynga's unique perspective on this potential risk factor. Zynga worries that sudden wealth from its IPO could alter employee interactions, perhaps even negatively impacting the company's performance in the long run. The text ultimately questions if wealth disparities can truly harm a start-up business, given the mix of evidence from existing successful companies. It also praises Zynga for addressing a potential risk factor that is often overlooked in other IPO situations."},{"question":"Внешние связи, однако, сильнее, при этом доминируют услуги воздушных перевозок в Россию и в страны-члены Сообщества Независимых Государств.

Seven years ago, that person was Jeff Kepner, now 64, who became the first person to receive a double hand transplant in the United States. The milestone made headlines: “A Touching Tale of a Life Changed,” read one from the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. But Kepner’s transplanted hands have never worked, and today they remain completely non-functional. If he could, Kepner says he would have them removed, he tells TIME in an exclusive interview. “From day one I have never been able to use my hands,” he says. “I can do absolutely nothing. I sit in my chair all day and wear my TV out.” Kepner is one of many Americans who have undergone experimental transplant surgeries that do not save their lives, like a heart, but stand to greatly improve them. In the last few years, doctors have performed groundbreaking face transplants and the first uterus and penis transplants stateside. But Kepner’s story highlights the sacrifice that can come from taking a risk for a better life—and for scientific advancement. In 1999, Kepner, of Augusta, Ga., lost his hands due to sepsis that started from a strep throat infection. He used prosthetics, and while life wasn’t easy, he was able to drive and keep a job—things that are impossible for him today. Ten years after the infection, Kepner underwent a nine-hour surgery at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) to attach hands from a donor. Kepner knew there was a risk that his body could reject the hands or that the surgery wouldn’t be successful, but he had always assumed, and says he was told, that in a worst-case scenario he could have the new hands removed and go back to using prosthetics. He’s since learned that that option isn’t so simple. TIME Health Newsletter Get the latest health and science news, plus: burning questions and expert tips. View Sample Sign Up Now Dr. Vijay Gorantla, the administrative medical director of the Pittsburgh Reconstructive Transplant Program at UPMC, is overseeing Kepner and tells TIME that full or partial removal of the hands has been discussed, but the procedures are not without risks. According to Gorantla, it’s uncertain if Kepner would be able to use prosthetics if the hands were removed, and that rigorous physical therapy would be required. If the hands were to be only partially amputated, Kepner would need to stay on daily drugs that prevent his body from rejecting the hands, wrote Gorantla in an email, adding that: “We believe that additional, minor surgical procedures—and commitment to more physical therapy—could improve the function of his hands to help him with activities of daily living.” Kepner says that after seven years, he’s tired of surgeries, and will likely keep the non-functioning hands attached to his body. “I am not going through all those operations again,” he says. The surgeon who led the transplant in 2009, Dr. W.P. Andrew Lee, is currently at Johns Hopkins where he’s preparing to perform penis transplants for American veterans. Lee says the need for removal is uncommon and has occurred in six out of 100 similar transplants in the U.S. and Europe. “Mr. Kepner’s transplanted hands do not function as well as those of other hand transplant recipients,” said Lee in an email to TIME. “Our team has performed bilateral hand/arm transplants in four patients to date, including Mr. Kepner. The other three patients have had significant functional return in their hands and have been able to resume completely independent living, including driving, working, and going to school.” “Complex surgery such as hand transplant do not produce uniform results in everyone,” Lee adds, “but we have been encouraged by the functional return in the great majority of our recipients whose lives have been transformed by the procedure.” Kepner says he hasn’t heard from Lee or any of the surgeons involved in the initial operation in years. He says his diminished quality of life has taken a toll. With prosthetics, Kepner says he was 75% functional, but today he says he feels “0%” functional. His wife, Valarie, retired in May to take care of him full-time, and the Kepner family launched a GoFundMe page to cover costs they’ve incurred through the years. . Kepner says that in hindsight he would not do the surgery again, but he does not criticize the doctors who did the operation. “That’s the chance you take,” he says, “and that’s the chance I took.” ||||| Augusta, Georgia (CNN) -- Jeff Kepner's new hands slump on the table, like ill-fitting, flesh-colored anchors fused to his arms. Hashmark scars line his lower arm. His right index finger stubbornly curls while the rest lie straight. Kepner fidgets in his seat and strains his neck to check the clock hanging on the wall, to see when today's therapy session is over. No one can say exactly when Kepner's hand therapy will end. More than a year after becoming the first person to receive a double hand transplant in the United States, Kepner's new hands jut from his arms like foreign objects that he cannot control. \\"They're heavy,\\" he said flatly. Kepner's surgery last May at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center in Pennsylvania generated headlines. This week, surgeons at the Jewish Hospital Hand Care Center in Louisville, Kentucky, performed a 17-hour operation, the third double hand transplant in the United States. That patient, Dr. Richard Edwards, a chiropractor, was injured in a burning truck in 2006. The Edmond, Oklahoma, man suffered severe burns on his face, back, arms and lost function of his hands. Edwards' wife, Laura, reached out to Kepner's wife, Valarie, on Facebook after Kepner's transplant in May 2009. \\"All of us are in the same situation,\\" says Valarie Kepner. As of August, there have been 61 hand transplant operations worldwide, according to the hospital. And Jeff Kepner is one of them. \\"I got it,\\" he said about the surgery. \\"And I regret it. It's over and done with. I didn't dream there would be this much therapy.\\" Kepner's fingers do not bend to his will. He scoops things into the palm of his hands, but cannot distinguish textures, whether it's a wooden block or his wife's hands. So every weekday for six hours, Kepner works with a hand therapist in Augusta, Georgia. He has made some progress: He can pinch items between the thumb and forefinger of his left hand. His eyes glaze as he stacks plastic cups, scoops rubber balls and attaches plastic tubes together for the thousandth time. Kepner utters only a word or two to his therapist during the long hours of repetitive hand exercises. The activities strain his upper body and are designed to rewire his brain to take control of his new hands. He nibbles only half an apple and sips coffee for lunch. Since the surgery, he has lost about 60 pounds from his 5-foot-9-inch frame. Friends and family had thought that perhaps by now the former pastry chef would again be getting ready to bake holiday cookies, just like the ones he made that dangled on a Christmas tree in the White House. The former softball player who had a nice fastball would be able to pick up a Wii remote and duke it out with his teenage daughter, they thought. Instead, the surgery is just the beginning. Kepner's kitchen shelf is crammed with Betty Crocker cookbooks -- cheesecake recipes and others from Southern Living collect dust. He has yet to play the popular Nintendo game, although daughter, Jordan, has challenged him. \\"I feel bad. He sits through hours [of therapy] every day,\\" said Jordan, 14. \\"I can't imagine what that's like.\\" But, she added, \\"He's strong.\\" Kepner met Valarie in the Air Force in San Antonio, Texas, and they bonded over similar hometown roots in Pennsylvania. After 20 years in the Air Force as a sergeant, Kepner went to culinary school, graduating in 1998. Read their story here A year later, Kepner lost both hands and feet to a strep infection. The bacterial infection stopped the blood flow to his limbs, blackening his hands and feet, as if they were frostbitten. The drugs used to fight the strep also damaged his joints, necessitating a double hip replacement. After the amputations, Kepner gradually regained mobility using hooks for hands and walking on prosthetics. He found a part-time job at the local Borders bookstore. \\"When I had the hooks, I worked and drove,\\" he said. \\"I did lots of things.\\" He wasn't completely independent. His wife of 19 years helped him get dressed and showered, fitting him into special water-friendly prosthetics. Although he had some mobility with the prosthetics, Kepner functioned on his wife's schedule, instead of his own. His wife first found out about the hand transplants, which would be free of charge to them because it's a clinical trial at the University of Pittsburgh. The surgery could restore full use of his hands, they hoped. Although the surgery was free to the family, the amount of time Valerie Kepner, a government employee, has to leave work and the long stays in Pittsburgh have become an unexpected financial burden, the Kepners said. On a recent August day, Valerie Kepner comes home from work, gives her husband a quick kiss and asks how his day was. The wrinkles in her husband's face loosen. \\"We're not risky people,\\" she said. \\"We're not the type of people who go bungee jumping. It was not a risky decision.\\" \\"You have to be well-informed. This is a long process,\\" she said. Unlike an organ transplant, a hand transplant is more complicated because it involves multiple types of tissue: bones, skin, tendon, nerves and blood vessels. \\"For a hand transplant to work, it needs to function,\\" said Dr. W. P. Andrew Lee, the lead surgeon in Kepner's transplant. \\"That's what's unique. It needs to move and have sensation.\\" It takes time, he said. In 2003, the doctor visited a double hand transplant recipient in Austria six months after the operation and was discouraged by the patient's lack of mobility or sensation. But that patient improved eventually and can now disassemble a pen and put it back together. \\"After three to four years, he had very good function in both hands,\\" said Lee, chief of the division of plastic surgery at the Pittsburgh hospital. \\"I think he is a good example of how it can take years for function to return, particularly for a transplant at the forearm level. It's a much longer distance for nerves to generate from the forearm, wrist and hand. It can take years for function to return.\\" \\"All the hard work he has been doing will eventually pay off,\\" Lee said of Kepner. Hand and face transplants are controversial, because unlike organ transplants, it's not a matter of life or death, but a risky procedure to improve quality of life. With hand transplants, Art Caplan, a bioethicist said, \\"you need to prepare for failure as well as success.\\" Kepner received a bone marrow transplant to re-educate his immune system, so he only needs one medicine to suppress his immune system. But Kepner still takes about 50 pills a day to counteract the side effects of the immunosuppressant. \\"I don't see the light at the end of the process,\\" Kepner said. \\"If three or four years later, nothing's going to happen, yes, I would say take them off.\\" His wife understands his disappointment. \\"I understand he's very disconcerted because he was very independent,\\" she said. \\"Here we are a year later. It's been very rocky. ... We're not giving up hope at this point.\\" ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

An important feature of this ice cap is the Antarctic ice sheet, a thick mass of ice that covers around 98% of the continent's landmass. The ice sheet plays a vital role in regulating the Earth's climate, as it reflects sunlight back into space, which helps keep the Earth cool. The other options provided were: - Asia: This continent is the largest and most populous continent in the world. It is not covered with an ice cap, but certain regions such as parts of the Himalayas are known for their glaciers and perennial snow. - Greenland: While Greenland is often considered to be the world's largest island and is covered by an ice sheet, it is not a continent itself. It belongs to the North American continent politically and geographically. - Australia: This continent, which is situated in the southern hemisphere, is known for its arid and dry conditions, especially in the interior region.

Mustafah Abdulaziz for The Wall Street Journal A two-bedroom condominium at the Mandarin Oriental tower was snapped up by a New Jersey man for more than 6 million, offering further evidence that the Manhattan luxury market is recovering. The apartment was designed by renowned architect Robert A. M. Stern and includes customized walls, floors and lighting. Perched on the 69th floor, the condo overlooks Central Park and offers views extending as far as Kennedy Airport in Queens, according to brokers. More Mandarin Owners See a Recovery The buyer, Jay Greenwald, paid 6.275 million for the apartment, say people familiar with the matter. Mr. Greenwald didn't respond to requests for comment. The seller, Dr. Lawrence Wiener, couldn't be reached for comment. The Mandarin Oriental at Time Warner Center is considered one of the premier new developments in New York and commands some of the highest prices per square foot. The purchase price for the 1,653-square-foot apartment works out to about 3,800 a foot, a broker said. Tower residents have access to the five-star hotel services. The Mandarin was able to sell all of the 63 units it put on the market in 2004, performing much better than other co-op or condo-hotel projects that didn't start selling units until after the market slump had begun. Re-sales at the Mandarin, however, have been forced to make accommodations to market declines, and this apartment was no exception. It was originally listed in November 2007 by Brown Harris Stevens for 11.3 million, according to Streeteasy.com. Sotheby's International Realty listed it for 7.5 million in September 2009 and dropped the price in February to 6.95 million. CitiHabitats represented the buyer.

Would \\"Energy in a system may be transformed so that it resides in a different state, or a different type of energy.\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","response":"Yes, your statement is quite reasonable, as energy can indeed be transformed from one type to another. Specifically, electrical energy can be converted into various other forms of energy. Here are several instances of these transformations, along with some examples: 1. Mechanical energy: Electrical energy can be converted into mechanical energy to power machines, vehicles, and appliances. For example, when you switch on a fan, electrical energy from the power outlet is transformed into mechanical energy to rotate the blades. 2. Thermal energy (heat): When electrical energy flows through a conductor with resistance, it generates heat. Examples of this transformation include electric heaters, kettles, and toasters, which convert electrical energy into thermal energy for heating purposes. 3. Light (electromagnetic) energy: Electrical energy can be transformed into light energy in various devices, such as incandescent bulbs, LED lights, and neon signs. In these cases, electrical current excites the atoms or molecules within the device, emitting light as a result. 4. Chemical energy: In some situations, electrical energy can cause chemical reactions that store energy in chemical bonds. An example of this is the process of electrolysis, where electrical energy is used to break or create chemical bonds in substances like water. 5. Acoustic energy (sound): Electrical energy can be transformed into sound energy, as seen in devices like speakers or headphones. In these cases, an electric current drives a coil to vibrate a diaphragm, creating sound waves that transmit through the air to listeners. 6. Nuclear energy: Although less common in everyday applications, electrical energy can be transformed into nuclear energy by accelerating particles with electric fields and causing nuclear reactions to occur. This process is primarily seen in experimental settings, such as particle accelerators. In summary, electrical energy can be converted into various forms, such as mechanical, thermal, light, chemical, acoustic, and nuclear energy. This ability to transform energy from one state to another allows us to harness electricity for a wide range of applications."},{"question":"A Song to Remember is a 1945 Columbia Pictures Technicolor biographical film which tells a fictionalised life story of Polish pianist and composer Frédéric Chopin.

The Pyg and the Miners' tracks and the Watkin Path are routes up which mountain?","response":"The Pyg Track, Miners' Track, and Watkin Path are three popular routes up Snowdon, the highest peak in Wales. Snowdon is located in Snowdonia National Park in North Wales and is an iconic destination for hikers and mountain enthusiasts. It stands at an elevation of 1,085 meters (3,560 feet) above sea level and is the highest point of the British Isles outside the Scottish Highlands. This majestic mountain is a part of the Snowdon Massif, which includes other summits such as Garnedd Ugain, Crib Goch, and Y Lliwedd. 1. Pyg Track: The Pyg Track is perhaps the most well-known and popular route up Snowdon, as it offers stunning views of the surrounding landscape. It starts at the Pen-y-Pass car park, situated 1,188 feet above sea level. The path covers a distance of approximately 7 miles (11 kilometers) both ways and is considered moderately difficult. Hikers can expect to take around 6 hours to complete the round trip. Along the way, you are greeted with spectacular vistas of nearby peaks and lakes, including Llyn Llydaw and Glaslyn. The track offers a mix of steep sections and relatively flat stretches, making it a popular choice for experienced hikers and first-timers alike. 2. Miners' Track: The Miners' Track is another popular route to the summit of Snowdon that offers an easier approach with a more gradual ascent. Named after the copper and slate miners who once used it, this historical path starts at the same location as the Pyg Track – Pen-y-Pass car park. The Miners' Track covers a total distance of approximately 8 miles (12.9 kilometers) both ways, with a typical hike taking around 6 hours. The trail offers stunning views of Llyn Teyrn, Llyn Llydaw, and Glaslyn lakes, as well as ruins from the old mining industry. As hikers approach the summit, they will join the Pyg Track for the final push to the top. 3. Watkin Path: Established in 1892 by Sir Edward Watkin, a railway entrepreneur, the Watkin Path is the toughest but also one of the most scenic routes up Snowdon. The path starts at the lower altitude of 60 meters (197 feet) above sea level near the village of Nant Gwynant and hence has the most ascent out of all the routes. The trail covers a total distance of around 8 miles (12.9 kilometers) both ways and can take approximately 6 to 7 hours to complete the round trip. It passes through ancient woodlands, waterfalls, and old slate mines, offering spectacular views of the Snowdon Massif and the surrounding valleys. The Watkin Path, known for its historical and geological significance, is a rewarding challenge for experienced hikers due to its steep sections and rough terrain. In conclusion, Snowdon, the highest mountain in Wales, is ascended through various routes including the Pyg Track, Miners' Track, and Watkin Path. Each of these routes offers its own unique hiking experience and unparalleled views of the majestic landscape of Snowdonia National Park. Whether you choose the classic Pyg Track, the easier Miners' Track, or the challenging Watkin Path, reaching the summit of Snowdon is an unforgettable experience for all types of hikers and adventure seekers."},{"question":"Daisy: Good morning, parents!

The Act freed more than 800,000 enslaved Africans in the British colonies. 2. United States: Slavery was abolished in the United States by the 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which was passed by Congress on January 31, 1865, and ratified by the states on December 6, 1865. The 13th Amendment declared that \\"neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.\\" 3.

Apart from a few Indian novels and an Australian book, my literature collection only consisted of British and American titles. Worse still, I couldn't ever found anything in translation. My reading was limited to stories by English-speaking authors. So, at the start of 2012, I set myself the challenge of trying to read a book from every country in a year to find out what I was missing. With no idea where to get those books, I was unlikely to find publications from nearly 200 nations on the shelves of my local bookshop, so I decided to ask the readers all over the world for help. I created a blog called A Year of Reading the World and put out an appeal for suggestions of titles that I could read in English. The response was amazing. People all over the world were getting in touch with me, offering ideas and book lists. Some posted me books from their home countries. In addition, several writers, like Turkmenistan's Ak Welsapar and Panama's Juan David Morgan, sent me unpublished translations of their novels, giving me a rare opportunity to read works unavailable in Britain. Even with such an extraordinary team of bibliophiles behind me, however, sourcing books was no easy task. With translations making up only around 4.5 per cent of literary works published in the UK, getting English versions of stories was tricky.

Most transmitters have the heterodyne principle , so they also use frequency conversion units . Most transmitters use the heterodyne principle so that they also have frequency conversion units . OPTIONS: [i] no. [ii] yes.","response":"[i] no. These two sentences do not mean exactly the same thing, despite having similarities. This distinction lies in the phrasing and implications of each sentence. I will elaborate on the subtle differences between the two statements: 1. \\"Most transmitters have the heterodyne principle, so they also use frequency conversion units.\\" In this sentence, the focus is on the fact that most transmitters operate based on the heterodyne principle. This principle primarily involves mixing two frequencies to generate two new frequencies: the sum and difference of the original frequencies. As a result of this principle, these transmitters also use frequency conversion units in their operation. The implication here is that the utilization of frequency conversion units is a consequence or a byproduct of the transmitters having the heterodyne principle. 2. \\"Most transmitters use the heterodyne principle so that they also have frequency conversion units.\\" This sentence suggests that most transmitters employ the heterodyne principle specifically for the purpose of having frequency conversion units. In other words, the motivation behind using the heterodyne principle in these transmitters is to possess frequency conversion units as a part of their system. The sentence highlights the intentionality behind including frequency conversion units in the transmitters' design. In summary, the first sentence emphasizes that transmitters operating on the heterodyne principle consequently utilize frequency conversion units, while the second sentence establishes that transmitters deliberately employ the heterodyne principle in order to include frequency conversion units in their design. The difference, albeit subtle, lies in the implications of why and how frequency conversion units are used within the transmitters' systems."},{"question":"Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Space vegetables are grown from seeds that have been taken to space and brought back to the earth. The seeds are affected by the radiation and low gravity in space. When they are brought back to the earth, these seeds produce vegetables that are bigger and healthier than normal vegetables. However, some people worry about eating space vegetables. They think that space vegetables might not be good for us and could make us get sick because of the radiation in space. However, people should not be frightened because space vegetables are very healthy. Here are some facts that you should know about space vegetables. Space vegetables are grown from seeds that are carefully chosen. When seeds are brought back from space, they are tested to make sure that they will be safe to eat. Space vegetables are better for you than normal vegetables. For example, space tomatoes stay fresh for twenty days, which is one week longer than normal tomatoes. After genetically modified food appeared in the market, people worried that they were eating unknown things. For example, if nut genes are put inside potatoes, people allergic to nuts might get sick from eating these potatoes because they do not know they are also eating nuts. Unlike genetically modified food, space vegetables have not been genetically changed. This means that no new genes are put into the vegetables. Therefore, there are no dangers of eating something unknown. Answer:","response":"Which of the following statements about space vegetables is NOT true? A) Space vegetables are grown from seeds that have been to space and are affected by radiation and low gravity. B) Space vegetables are tested for safety after being brought back from space.

Only 400,000 are left while displacement is still rising.\\" Sako's denomination is one of the world's most ancient Christian communities. Most are ethnic Assyrians, a group that existed for centuries in what's now modern-day Iraq, Syria and Turkey and preserved their faith and language -- a version of Aramaic -- through the various upheavals and conquests that have shaped and reshaped the Middle East. But their place within the Iraqi state changed radically after the U.S. invasion in 2003. After the toppling of Saddam Hussein, a nominally secular dictator, there was a security vacuum that imperiled Iraq's religious minorities. The new government in Baghdad, dominated by Shiites long repressed by Hussein's regime, failed to build a truly inclusive democracy. Tens of thousands of Chaldeans left the country following attacks on churches and monasteries. Check out a quick snapshot of the ongoing humanitarian crisis in #Iraq Up to 1.8 Million ppl now displaced pic.twitter.com/zuB2w4MmFg In 2008, Sako's predecessor, Mar Emmanuel III Delly, was very clear about what was to blame for his congregation's troubles. \\"The absolute worst time that I’ve seen in my life has been the last five years, “ he told the Detroit Free Press (there's a considerable Assyrian diaspora in Michigan). \\"The occupation has not been good for the Christians and for all of Iraq.\\" Sako has been outspoken about the horrors visited upon Iraq this summer by the Islamic State, whose puritanical brand of Islam has driven it to systematically butcher Christians, Yazidis and others belonging to Iraq's mosaic of minority sects. The jihadists have set about destroying cultural monuments -- tombs and shrines -- that it considers the work of apostates. After the loss of the historic city of Mosul to the Islamic State fighters, Sako offered an apocalyptic lament during a July sermon in Bagdhad, which WorldViews covered: \\"How in the 21st century could people be forced from their houses just because they are Christian, or Shi'ite or Sunni or Yazidi?\\" he asked. \\"Christian families have been expelled from their houses and their valuables were stolen and ...their houses and property expropriated in the name of the Islamic State.\\" [Sako] went on to make a chilling, grand historic proclamation: \\"This has never happened in Christian or Islamic history. Even Genghis Khan or Hulagu didn't do this,\\" he said. Hulagu Khan was the Mongol warlord whose horde swept through Mosul en route to sacking Baghdad in 1258, a bloody slaughter that snuffed out the proud Abbasid caliphate that had flourished there since the 8th century. Baghdad would take hundreds of years to reemerge as a political center. Some 200 Muslims also attended that particular service, according to Reuters, and held up signs in solidarity reading \\"I am Iraqi, I am Christian.\\" But that support belies the larger alienation that Sako says his flock has endured, even as the United States and other allies step up aerial strikes on Islamic State positions in Iraq. \\"Our Muslim neighbors did not help us,\\" he told reporters last month. \\"The West watched us, and it seemed they have ignored our suffering. But we will not leave our land, whatever the sacrifices.\\" Ishaan Tharoor writes about foreign affairs for The Washington Post.

A man is sitting down getting his ear pierced. the person piercing the ear","response":"1. Preparation: The first step for the person piercing the ear is to properly prepare the area. This involves cleaning the earlobe or cartilage with a disinfectant solution to minimize the risk of infection. It is important to ensure that the area is free of dirt and oils prior to the piercing. Justification: Cleaning the ear reduces the risk of infection and ensures a successful piercing. 2. Marking the spot: The person piercing the ear should then mark the exact spot where the hole will be made using a marker. The customer should be able to review and approve the placement before the piercing process begins. Justification: Marking the spot ensures that both the piercer and the customer are in agreement about the location of the piercing and allows for precision in the piercing process. 3. Putting on gloves: The person performing the piercing should put on a new pair of disposable gloves to ensure a sterile environment and reduce the risk of infection. Justification: Gloves prevent the transfer of bacteria from the piercer's hands to the customer's ear, further minimizing the risk of infection. 4. Clamping the ear: The piercer will use a sterilized piercing clamp to hold the earlobe or cartilage steady during the procedure. The clamp not only helps the piercer to accurately create the hole but also minimizes discomfort for the customer. Justification: Clamping the ear keeps the area steady, which allows for precise and accurate piercing, and reduces the customer's discomfort. 5. Piercing the ear: Using a sterilized needle or piercing gun, the person piercing the ear will quickly and accurately create the hole in the marked area. The speed and precision of this step are important to minimize pain and ensure proper placement. Justification: A quick and accurate piercing reduces pain and discomfort for the customer and ensures that there is no room for error in terms of placement. 6. Inserting the earring: With the hole made, the piercer will insert the sterilized earring post or hoop into the fresh piercing. The earring should be secured with a backing to hold it in place during the healing process. Justification: Inserting and securing the earring keeps the new piercing from closing up and allows for proper healing. 7. Aftercare instructions: Once the earring is in place, the person piercing the ear should provide the customer with aftercare instructions. This includes how to clean the area, what to avoid during the healing process, and when to change or remove the earring. Justification: Proper aftercare is crucial for healing and preventing infection. Providing instructions ensures that the customer knows how to take care of their new piercing and what to do in case of complications."},{"question":"Trebuie acordat sprijin mai ales întreprinderilor mici, de familie.

During an interview on the Ben Ferguson Show Friday, Nugent apologized for the comments, which he made in January 2014. A post on the show's Facebook page announced the apology: Nugent did not apologize to Obama, but did apologize for using the term. He said he apologized on behalf of Texas attorney general Greg Abbott -- who is campaigning for governor, with his \\"blood brother\\" Nugent at his side -- and politicians like Texas Gov. Rick Perry (R) and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas.), who criticized the rocker for the statement. \\"I do apologize -- not necessarily to the President -- but on behalf of much better men than myself,\\" Nugent said, calling the comments \\"streetfighter terminology.\\" \\"I apologize for using the term,\\" Nugent said. \\"I will try to elevate my vernacular to the level of those great men that I'm learning from in the world of politics.\\" ||||| Ted Nugent‘s comments about President Obama being a “subhuman mongrel” have inspired a whirlwind of controversy this week (especially on CNN), and Republicans have given varying degrees of reactions to those remarks, including the GOP congressman whose connection to Nugent kicked this all off to begin with. But earlier tonight Rand Paul made it clear that he found the comment “offensive” and wants Nugent to apologize. And Paul didn’t hedge or pad his thoughts at all, he just came right out on Twitter and said that Nugent’s “derogatory description” of Obama is just beneath anyone. Ted Nugent's derogatory description of President Obama is offensive and has no place in politics. He should apologize. — Senator Rand Paul (@SenRandPaul) February 21, 2014 Nugent, for what it’s worth, has so far shown no indication he plans on apologizing, lashing out at CNN for calling him out in the first place. [photo via screengrab] — — Follow Josh Feldman on Twitter: @feldmaniac Have a tip we should know? tips@mediaite.com ||||| To some Republican activists, he’s a celebrity defender of the Second Amendment who rallies the base like the rock star he once was. To Democrats and mainstream Republicans, he’s a sexual “predator,” an affront to families and a flamethrower with an appalling record of incendiary comments. Text Size - + reset When it comes to Ted Nugent, his conservative fans and liberal detractors are living on different planets. Nugent catapulted into the spotlight this week when he appeared at two campaign events with Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, the presumptive GOP nominee for governor. Democrats, in Texas and nationally, bracketed the events with email blasts and tweets highlighting elements of Nugent’s unsavory past and record of inflammatory remarks. They plan to continue making hay of those Texas appearances, and relish the possibility of his campaigning with other Republicans. (Also on POLITICO: Perry has 'problems' with Nugent) But in the deep-red Lone Star State, registration for Abbott’s events tripled when Nugent’s appearances were announced. Democrats and Republicans alike see Nugent as a turn-out catalyst, in Texas and perhaps beyond. He outrages Democrats and mainstream Republicans — but he fires up a segment of the GOP base, which is so enamored of Nugent’s fiery anti-Barack Obama rhetoric and defense of gun rights that it can overlook the singer’s tawdry history. A case in point: Sarah Palin wrote on her Facebook page that if Greg Abbott “is good enough for Ted Nugent, he’s good enough for me!” Nugent, 65, is a board member of the National Rifle Association, and is perhaps one of the country’s most colorful champions of the Second Amendment. He’s a lifelong gun enthusiast, a crusader against drugs and a die-hard Republican. But as Democrats have been eager to point out this week, he’s not exactly a buttoned-up cultural conservative. (Also on POLITICO: Rand Paul: Nugent should apologize) In an interview for a VH1 “Behind the Music” documentary about him, Nugent, who hit the peak of his career in the 1970s, acknowledged that when he was young — and even not-so-young — he was “addicted to girls.” “I was a wang-dang addict, I was addicted to girls. Addicted. It was hopeless,” he said in the video. “It was beautiful.” By age 21, he had two children from two different women. By 30, after being married, having more kids and getting divorced, he was involved with a 17-year-old, for whom he assumed the mantle — with her parents’ permission — of legal guardian. “It just really wasn’t a terribly appropriate situation in most people’s eyes,” said Pele Massa in the documentary, who said in the film that at 17 she became romantically involved with Nugent and was with him for nine years, though he wasn’t faithful to her during that period, she said. “And now, it would be criminal.” (Also on POLITICO: Greg Abbott sings Nugent's praises) The documentary said he acknowledged several relationships with young women, and that he won parental approval. There were never criminal charges leveled against him for indiscretions with underage women, the film said, but the incidents have served as fodder for Democrats, who have repeatedly blasted him as a “predator” this week. “I find Ted Nugent disgusting. And I find it disgusting that Greg Abbott is sharing a stage with him,” wrote Wendy Davis, the Texas Democratic candidate for governor, in a Wednesday fundraising missive. “But this isn’t just about my feelings. Every Texan should be offended by Greg Abbott’s decision to make a predator the new face of his campaign.” Yet in recent years Nugent has painted himself as a family man. He has always eschewed drugs and alcohol and has been an advocate for keeping kids substance-free. His current wife, Shemane Nugent, writes on her website that, “Recently, we have discovered four more adult children Ted had from previous relationships. I look forward to getting to know them, and hopefully they will welcome me into their lives.” They have been married since 1989 and have one child together. “[Like] other marriages, I don’t always agree with everything my husband says or does,” she wrote. A representative for both Nugents didn’t return a call and emails seeking comment. ||||| Rand Paul continues to win my admiration, I have to say. There are people who come into the Senate with a kind of celebrity status and get lots of good press—one Barack Obama comes to mind—but I can't think of anyone who has gotten so much good press through their own initiative, coming up with one clever way after another to get people to pay attention to them in ways that are almost always positive. His latest move required a subtle ideological tightrope-walk, one that Paul played perfectly. And all it took was a tweet. This has to do, you'll be happy to know, with Ted Nugent. Republican politicians have a soft spot for Nugent, partly because they're blinded by the celebrity of a guy who 37 years ago had a song that rocketed all the way to #30 on the charts, and partly because Nugent is kind of an expression of the conservative id. I'm sure there are more than a few people on the right who would like to hold up a pair of assault rifles and say, \\"I was in Chicago and said, 'Hey, Obama you might want to suck on one of these you punk.' Obama, he's a piece of shit, and I told him to suck on my machine gun. Let's hear it for him. And then I was in New York. I said, 'Hey, Hillary, you might want to ride one of these into the sunset, you worthless bitch. Since I'm in California, how about Barbara Boxer, she might want to suck on my machine gun. And Dianne Feinstein, ride one of these you worthless whore. Any questions? Freedom!\\" (Oh and also, he brags about having sex with underage girls, but hey, rock 'n roll, right?) Nugent is in the news because Greg Abbott, the Attorney General of Texas and likely the state's next governor, decided to campaign with him, whereupon people were reminded of a rather nasty, racist thing Nugent said about President Obama last month, and that's causing Abbott to have to deal with some uncomfortable questions. Questions like, \\"Why would you want to campaign with this hateful jackass?\\" Since most of the stories about this don't actually include Nugent's full comments, here's what they were: I have obviously failed to galvanize and prod, if not shame enough Americans to be ever vigilant not to let a Chicago communist raised communist educated communist nurtured subhuman mongrel like the ACORN community organizer gangster Barack Hussein Obama to weasel his way into the top office of authority in the United States of America. I am heartbroken but I am not giving up. I think America will be America again when Barack Obama, Eric Holder, Hillary Clinton, Dick Durbin, Michael Bloomberg and all of the liberal Democrats are in jail facing the just due punishment that their treasonous acts are clearly apparent. At this point, some conservatives are surely asking themselves whether hanging around with Nugent is worth the trouble, or worth anything at all for that matter. For her part, Sarah Palin hurried to Facebook to say about Abbott, \\"If he is good enough for Ted Nugent, he is good enough for me!\\" But the more common response is the kind we got from Ted Cruz, a rather lengthy \\"Hamana hamana hamana,\\" leading eventually to \\"Those sentiments there, of course I don't agree with them.\\" You can see exactly what's going on in Cruz's head: It's obviously way, way uncool to call our biracial president a \\"subhuman mongrel,\\" but on the other hand, I don't want to give Tea Partiers any reason to suspect even for a moment that I'm not one of them or that I hate Obama any less than they do. Those nuts will turn on you in an instant! Just look what happened to Rubio. The result is some very pained equivocation. But Rand Paul is much smarter. He knows he isn't going to get the gold medal in the GOP Hate Olympics. Whatever coalition he assembles if and when he runs for president in 2016, it's going to be a relatively diverse one. He won't have complete control of any one constituency. There'll be some libertarians here, some moderates there, some fiscal conservatives here, some isolationists there. And without anyone standing out, at this point the best thing for him may be to raise his profile as high as he can, and get mainstream reporters on his side. So we get this: Genius. Paul obviously understands that nothing gets attention like criticizing someone on your own side, even if it's someone on the fringe. So what's his reward? Fulsome praise from people on all sides of the aisle! Oodles of good press! Even liberals will write blog posts lauding him! Like the very one you're reading. All of a sudden he looks like the reasonable one, and just look at the results. Here's a piece about him in the Washington Post. Here's an article on Politico. Here's the Huffington Post. Here's the Washington Times. You get the idea. Rand Paul has never given anyone much reason to believe that he's a sophisticated policy thinker, or that he would be good at running the government. And it's way too early to tell how he'll hold up in the day-in, day-out slog of a presidential campaign, particularly since he has run for office a total of one time in his life. But at the moment, he's shown himself to be smarter about getting media attention than any of the other potential 2016 Republican candidates. By a mile. ||||| While Republican Greg Abbott is fleeing reporter questions about Ted Nugent, Democratic opponent Wendy Davis is invoking the ‘70s guitarist and gun-rights advocate – to raise money. In a new fundraising appeal, Davis says Abbott’s decision to invite Nugent to campaign with him was an insult to “every father, every mother, every family in Texas.” The outspoken rock musician shared the stage with Abbott on Tuesday, the first day of early voting in the Texas primary elections. Abbott praised Nugent as “a fire for freedom” because of his support of 2nd Amendment rights. Nugent is also an outspoken critic of Democrats with a history of making crude, offensive remarks. He called President Obama a” subhuman mongrel” and has described feminists and female politicians as “varmints” and “fat pigs. He has acknowledged having sex with underage girls — something that runs counter to Abbott’s public promise as attorney general to fight child predators. Reporters in Tyler tried to ask Abbott on Wednesday about his decision to invite Nugent to campaign with him. But the attorney general fled to a waiting car after a brief round of questions in which he blamed Davis of insufficiently supporting gun-rights. In her fundraising pitch, Davis said she and her Republican opponent have different values. “His values allow him to embrace an admitted predator who takes advantage of young girls, calls successful women vulgar and disgusting names, and demeans and degrades not just the women of Texas, but anyone who disagrees with his narrow-minded, disrespectful point of view. If this is Greg Abbott’s idea of good Texas values, it’s simply repulsive. Campaigning with a vile character like Ted Nugent is a window into Greg Abbott’s character. And we need to show him that we won’t tolerate it. She asks supporters to send money to help her campaign. Davis faces an uphill battle against the better-funded Abbott in a state that hasn’t elected a Democrat governor since Ann Richards in 1990. But it wasn’t all bad news for Abbott. Tea Party favorite Sarah Palin offered her endorsement. “If he is good enough for Ted Nugent, he is good enough for me!” Palin wrote in a Facebook post.

Choices: - pull up covers - fall asleep - brush teeth - remove the covers - get laid The rationale to choose \\"pull up covers\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","response":"Pulling up covers is the most appropriate and respectful choice in this scenario. There are multiple reasons why this answer stands out as the best option when compared to the other choices provided. Here is a detailed rationale: 1. Comfort and Respect: When you want to go to bed with someone, it is essential to maintain a level of comfort and respect for one another. Pulling up the covers is not only practical for the purpose of keeping warm, but it also shows the person you are with that you consider their feelings and are not trying to take any inappropriate actions. 2. Maintaining Boundaries: Relationships and interactions between individuals require integrity and understanding of boundaries. Pulling up the covers helps in preserving personal boundaries and respecting the other person's space and privacy, as well as keeping the focus on getting warm and comfortable as opposed to engaging in any unwelcome physical contact. 3. Appropriate Hygiene: Brushing teeth, while generally a good hygiene practice before bed, is not directly related to the goal of getting warm and is therefore not the most fitting choice in this situation. 4. Irrelevance of Other Choices: Falling asleep is an outcome, not a direct action taken to get warm and feel closer to the person you are sharing a bed with. Similarly, removing the covers is counterproductive to achieving warmth, making it an unsuitable choice. \\"Get laid,\\" on the other hand, emphasizes a sexual interaction, which is not only an inappropriate suggestion but also not effective in the context of simply wanting to get warm together. 5. Emotional Connection: Sharing a bed and cuddling with someone while being warm under the covers can promote an emotional connection between the two people. This can strengthen their bond, help them relax, and ultimately create a more enjoyable and meaningful experience. In conclusion, choosing to \\"pull up covers\\" is the best course of action in this situation, as it effectively achieves the stated goal of getting warm while also preserving the comfort, respect, and boundaries between the two people involved.

Dick Grayson is long since retired from his superhero days and raising a family with to his wife Barbara Gordon. After his former mentor's death, however, he decides to resume his crime-fighting days as Robin. Remarkably, Grayson does not take up the Nightwing identity. The filmmakers said they chose this because many people outside the comic book community are unfamiliar with Nightwing and they wanted to appeal to a wider audience.Commissioner Gordon is aware of Grayson's secret identity and assists him by supplying official documents. In addition, Gordon provides the voiceover narration at the beginning of the trailer. The head of the investigation into Batman's death is indicated to be Chief O'Hara, a character from the 1960's Batman TV series, who apparently also knows Grayson's identity (noting that Grayson's \\"crimefighting days are over\\") His role is suspicious since he strongly wants Grayson to not become involved, even to the point of aligning with Selina Kyle/Catwoman to eliminate Robin and shouting at reporter Clark Kent that he wants \\"him [presumably Grayson] out of the equation!\\" O'Hara is also seen rolling up his sleeves, preparing to assault an angry captive Gordon. Grayson is aware of Superman's secret identity; he addresses him as \\"Clark\\". Superman apparently is also motivated (obviously from O'Hara) to discourage Grayson's return to crimefighting and three angry confrontations between the characters are shown, in and out of costume. Grayson is also angered to violence by the sight of a Superman comic book, suggesting a strongly negative history between the two. Other comic books also appear of characters from the film, including Wonder Woman and Catwoman. Fiorella used his own comic book collection for this scene. answer the following question: With which superhero does Grayson appear to have a negative history? A:","response":"Grayson appears to have a negative history with Superman. This is evidenced by his angry confrontations with Superman both in and out of costume, as well as his violent reaction to the sight of a Superman comic book. This suggests a strong, negative past between the two characters."},{"question":"In this task, you're given the title of a five-sentence story, the first four sentences, and two options for the fifth sentence as a and b.

Kate could not believe her eyes. b. Frank had to call for help and get saved. Answer: b. Frank had to call for help and get saved.

Context: Companies, communities, families, clubs, and other clumps of humans all have some inherent social dynamics. At a simple level there are leaders and followers, but in reality the lines are rarely as clear as that. Many leaders, with a common example being some founders, have tremendous vision and imagination, but lack the skills to translate that vision into actionable work. Many followers need structure to their efforts, but are dynamic and creative in the execution. Thus, the social dynamic in organizations needs a little more nuance. This is where traditional management hierarchies break down in companies. You may have your SVPs, then your VPs, then your Senior Directors, then your Directors, and so on, but in reality most successful companies don’t observe those hierarchies stringently. In many organizations a junior-level employee who has been there for a while can have as much influence and value, if not more, than a brand new SVP. As such, the dream is that we build organizations with crisp reporting lines but in which all employees feel they have the ability to bring their creativity and ideas to logically influence the scope, work, and culture of the organization. Sadly, this is where many organizations run into trouble. It seems to be the same ‘ol story time after time: as the organization grows, the divide between the senior leadership and the folks on the ground widens. Water cooler conversations and bar-side grumblings fuel the fire and resentment, frustrations, and resume-editing often sets in. So much of this is avoidable though. Of course, there will always be frustration in any organization: this is part and parcel of people working together. Nothing will be perfect, and it shouldn’t be…frustration and conflict can often lead to organizations re-pivoting and taking a new approach. I believe though, that there are a lot of relatively simple things we can do to make organizations feel more engaging. Question: Employees feel frustration as: Answer: A:","response":"Employees feel frustration as a result of the growing divide between senior leadership and the folks on the ground, lack of communication, and inability to contribute their creativity and ideas in shaping the organization's work and culture. This often leads to resentment, frustrations, and resume-editing."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Love, success, happiness, family and freedom----how important are these values to you?

After Shackleton left with the James Caird, Frank Wild took command of the Elephant Island party, some of whom were in a low state, physically or mentally: Lewis Rickinson had suffered a suspected heart attack; Perce Blackborow was unable to walk, due to frostbitten feet; Hubert Hudson was depressed. The priority for the party was a permanent shelter against the rapidly approaching southern winter. On the suggestion of George Marston and Lionel Greenstreet, a hut—nicknamed the \\"Snuggery\\"—was improvised by upturning the two boats and placing them on low stone walls, to provide around five feet (1.5 m) of headroom. By means of canvas and other materials the structure was made into a crude but effective shelter.Wild initially estimated that they would have to wait one month for rescue, and refused to allow long-term stockpiling of seal and penguin meat because this, in his view, was defeatist. This policy led to sharp disagreements with Thomas Orde-Lees, who was not a popular man and whose presence apparently did little to improve the morale of his companions, unless it was by way of being the butt of their jokes.As the weeks extended well beyond his initial optimistic forecast, Wild established and maintained routines and activities to relieve the tedium. A permanent lookout was kept for the arrival of the rescue ship, cooking and housekeeping rotas were established, and there were hunting trips for seal and penguin. Concerts were held on Saturdays and anniversaries were celebrated, but there were growing feelings of despondency as time passed with no sign of the ship. The toes on Blackborow's left foot became gangrenous from frostbite and, on 15 June, had to be amputated by surgeons Alexander Macklin and James McIlroy in the candle-lit hut. Using the very last of the chloroform in their medical supplies, the whole procedure took 55 minutes and was a complete success.By 23 August, it seemed that Wild's no-stockpiling policy had failed.

McGuire was convicted in 1994 of the rape and murder of 22-year-old Joy Stewart, who was seven months pregnant. Her relatives were at Southern Ohio Correctional Facility in Lucasville to witness his death, according to tweets from television reporter Sheila Gray McGuire's \\"children and daughter-in-law were crying and visibly upset,\\" Gray tweeted. She said McGuire, before the drugs took effect, thanked Stewart's family for a letter he apparently received. JUST WATCHED Witness: Inmate gasped during execution Replay More Videos ...

I'm going to heaven and I'll see you there when you come,\\" McGuire reportedly said, according to CNN affiliate WDTN Columbus Dispatch reporter Alan Johnson said that the whole execution process took 24 minutes, and that McGuire appeared to be gasping for air for 10 to 13 minutes. \\"He gasped deeply. It was kind of a rattling, guttural sound. There was kind of a snorting through his nose. A couple of times, he definitely appeared to be choking,\\" WDTN quoted Johnson as saying. The convicted murderer was pronounced dead at 10:53 a.m. ET. The execution generated controversy because, like many states, Ohio has been forced to find new drug protocols after European-based manufacturers banned U.S. prisons from using their drugs in executions -- among them, Danish-based Lundbeck, which manufactures pentobarbital. According to Ohio's corrections department, the state used a combination of the drugs midazolam, a sedative; and the painkiller hydromorphone. Both the length of time it took for McGuire to die and his gasping are not typical for an execution, said Howard Nearman, an anesthesiologist at University Hospitals Case Medical Center in Cleveland. \\"Why it took 24 minutes, I really can't tell you,\\" he said. \\"It just makes you wonder -- what was given? What was the timing, and what were the doses?\\" In an opinion piece written for CNN this week, a law professor noted that McGuire's attorneys argued he would \\"suffocate to death in agony and terror.\\" \\"The state disagrees. But the truth is that no one knows exactly how McGuire will die, how long it will take or what he will experience in the process,\\" wrote Elisabeth A. Semel, clinic professor of law and director of the Death Penalty Clinic at U.C. Berkeley School of Law. Speaking on behalf of McGuire's legal team, attorney Allen Bohnert called on the governor to impose a moratorium on future executions because of what took place Thursday. \\"At this point, it is entirely premature to consider this execution protocol to be anything other than a failed, agonizing experiment,\\" he said in a statement. \\"The people of the State of Ohio should be appalled at what was done here today in all of our names. Ohio, like its citizens, must follow the law. The state has failed.\\" CNN's Sonny Hostin said that McGuire's execution will likely spark debate over whether how inmates react to the use of the drugs constitutes cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the U.S. Constitution. \\"Whenever there's a change in the lethal injection process clearly it's subject to legal proceedings and perhaps we will see those,\\" Hostin said. Ohio ran out of pentobarbital, which is a narcotic and sedative barbiturate, in September, according to JoEllen Smith, spokeswoman for the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction. In response to that shortage, the department amended its execution policy to allow for the use of midazolam and hydromorphone. Stewart's body was discovered by hikers near a creek in southwestern Ohio in February of 1989. Her throat was cut and she had been sodomized. There are currently 138 men and one woman on death row in Ohio. The state was set to execute death row inmate Ron Phillips using the new drug combination last year, but Gov. John Kasich granted the convicted killer a stay of execution pending a review of a possible organ donation to his family members. ||||| After a lawsuit filed by a death-row inmate, the Apothecary Shoppe in Oklahoma has agreed to not sell to Missouri for its upcoming execution. Last week, a federal judge ordered the pharmacy to hold off on selling the drug to Missouri until further review. Before that could take place, however, the pharmacy and the inmate came to an agreement. \\"The Apothecary Shoppe has agreed that it will not prepare or provide pentobarbital or any other drug for use in the execution of Michael Taylor,\\" Carrie Apfel, Taylor's attorney, said in a written statement. She also said the pharmacy had not sold any drugs to the Department of Corrections for this execution yet. The Apothecary Shoppe could not be reached for comment. We reported in December that Missouri had been obtaining its execution drug from a compounding pharmacy not licensed to sell here. The Apothecary Shoppe sold the state compounded pentobarbital for three executions, but it only recently became licensed with the Missouri Board of Pharmacy. A Corrections official had been taking thousands of dollars in cash to the Tulsa pharmacy. \\"We filed this lawsuit to prevent the unlawful compounding of pentobarbital,\\" Apfel said. \\"Miscompounded pentobarbital poses a grave risk of suffering and pain in violation of the Eighth Amendment, as well as federal and state law.\\" Compounding pharmacies are not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration, and their products have a significantly higher failure rate than manufactured drugs. It's also against the law for compounding pharmacies to make copies of manufactured drugs -- like pentobarbital. Gov. Jay Nixon told reporters on Tuesday that Missouri would still be able to carry out this month's execution. The state is not without options. In a sworn deposition last month, a high-ranking state official revealed that the state has a backup supply of midazolam to carry out executions, in spite of earlier assurances that the state did not have the drug. Midazolam was the drug Ohio used in a recent execution that took more than 20 minutes. Witnesses said the inmate gasped and snorted during that time. If Missouri were to use midazolam, the state would have to change the protocol, which currently allows only for pentobarbital. The state could also turn to another compounding pharmacy to make pentobarbital, like the Apothecary Shoppe did for three executions. Lawyers representing Michael Taylor have asked a separate federal judge to stay his execution, in light of the settlement. Taylor's lawyers argue switching the drug or the source this soon before his execution wouldn't give him time for due process of law. Taylor is scheduled to be executed on Feb. 26 for the abduction, rape and stabbing death of a 15-year-old girl.

Answer:","response":"Pakhomy Andreyushkin was born on 15th May 1865 in Russia. Though not much is known about his early life and upbringing, one can presume that he grew up during a time of significant social and political changes in the country. Like many of his countrymen, Andreyushkin might have experienced the challenges and struggles of the late 19th-century Russian society. As he matured, he likely witnessed advancements in science, technology, and art that characterized the era. As a Russian national, Andreyushkin would be deeply acquainted with the cultural and historical legacy of his homeland. Unfortunately, his life took a dark turn, and he met his end at an unusually young age of 21, as he passed away on 8th May 1887. The Schlisselburg Fortress, where he drew his last breath, held a grim reputation for imprisoning political prisoners and served as a place of execution in Imperial Russia. This leads us to believe that Andreyushkin may have been imprisoned there for reasons related to dissent or opposing views.

According to Arshad Khan, the director of the FATA Disaster Management Authority, the number of people who have fled the military operation has now reached almost half a million, with 455,000 people scattered across various parts of Northern Pakistan. In a sports complex in the heart of Bannu city, a dust storm is creating havoc at the city's largest food distribution point for those seeking shelter. Until Tuesday it was the only food distribution point for the thousands of needy people in Bannu and its surrounding regions, and was the scene of protests airing the frustration they have experienced over the past two weeks. Wednesday saw hundreds of men, young and old, queue up outside on the streets, shielding their eyes from the grit, waiting to receive their ration of fortified wheat, iodized salt, pulses and cooking oil. A significant army presence is overseeing the distribution that has been organized by the World Food Program. Sacks of wheat are heaped in mounds in the center of the stadium and a strong hot wind is blowing cardboard cartons into the air. An old woman in a tattered burqa, clutching a wisp of paper bearing her registration number, waits for her turn to collect food. \\"Three of my grandchildren died after a bomb fell on our house in the Haider khel village of North Waziristan\\" she says. \\"They were five, six and seven years old,\\" she whispers. \\"That's when we fled.\\" Request for more supplies. The number of families arriving has exceeded the number estimated by the WFP. According to Lola Castro, the WFP's director in Pakistan, a contingency plan had been updated to deal with a military operation in North Waziristan. However, she says Pakistani authorities only officially approached the WFP for help on June 20, five days after the strikes began. WFP had expected the families to be an average size of six but, according to Castro, families fleeing out of North Waziristan are made up of 14 people. This has lead to rations being distributed on a biweekly basis instead of the usual monthly schedule. \\"We are requesting donors to provide more supplies but the situation is currently under control,\\" Castro tells CNN. Malik Akbar Khan, a tribal leader and an IDP, has been volunteering at the food distribution point ever since he arrived in Bannu last week. As IDPs wheelbarrow their supplies out of the complex, he sighs and says that it is the ordinary people of North Waziristan who have had to bear the biggest brunt of the tussle between the army and the Pakistani Taliban. As the sun sets on another day of dust and desperation, he quotes the oft-repeated phrase addressing the conflict in Pakistan's northern regions. \\"The army are the angels and the Taliban call themselves the companions of the holy prophet,\\" he says. \\"Perhaps we're the only infidels in this chaos, who suffer the most in this living hell while the other two claim that they're bound for paradise.\\" 'That place is like fire' There is one refuge for the hordes of people who have spilt out of North Waziristan. The army, along with funding from FDMA and the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), has set up a camp in Baka Khel, Bannu district. In the searing June heat, it sits a mere 15 kilometers (9.3 miles) from the Saigai check post, the final exit for villagers leaving North Waziristan and entering Bannu district. According to military sources, the camp became operational on June 16, a day after the military operation began. It has, however, come under severe criticism by the very people it was built to help. Many are instead choosing to stay with relatives or rent homes in cities such as Bannu, Peshawar and Dera Ismail Khan. \\"When the curfew was eased we reached Bannu after a two-day journey on foot, yet we would never stay at that camp. That place is like fire, it's like fire, I would never take my family to that land of flaming heat,\\" Loi Khan from the village of Boya in North Waziristan tells CNN as he stands in line to get food in Bannu. But a visit to the camp paints a different picture. Temperatures may be rising to as high as 47 degrees centigrade but efforts are underway to create what military guides to the camp call \\"a model village.\\" There is electricity, plumbing, fancy fans that spray mist and visiting doctors. Polio workers administer vaccines to every man, woman and child entering the camp to prevent any outbreak. Yet the place is a ghost town. According to military sources only 28 families have chosen to live at the camp, a fraction of those who have left North Waziristan. It remains empty for the time being but with the month of Ramadan fast approaching and the operation not looking to end anytime soon, military officials overseeing the camp expect it to be operational and fully populated for at least two months. 450,000 displaced as Pakistan attacks militants. Saleem Mehsud contributed to this report. Summarize the highlights of this article.","response":"The article describes the struggles of people fleeing their homes in North Waziristan, Pakistan, due to a military operation that began in June. With harsh weather conditions and a lack of timely notification from authorities, residents of the region were left to face danger, illness, and desperation. The mass exodus led to a humanitarian crisis, with nearly half a million people displaced and scattered across various parts of Northern Pakistan. Food distribution efforts were strained due to the higher than anticipated number of arrivals. A refugee camp was set up by the army in Baka Khel, Bannu district, but many chose to stay with relatives or rent homes in cities instead, considering the harsh conditions at the camp."},{"question":"- Water evaporates from the ground up to the sky - Water droplets are in clouds - The air gets cold - Water droplets turn into ice crystals What might be the last step of the process?","response":"The last step of the process might be: - The ice crystals in the clouds become heavy and combine with each other to form larger structures called snowflakes. As more and more of these snowflakes clump together, they become heavy enough to overcome the upward force of the air within the cloud. Eventually, they fall to the ground as snow or precipitation. This step is a logical conclusion because it follows the process of water evaporating, forming clouds, and undergoing a temperature change, leading to the transformation of water droplets into ice crystals. Next, these ice crystals would naturally combine and fall as precipitation when they become too heavy to be supported by the cloud."},{"question":"Data: GMA New Media, foundingDate, 2000-01-01; GMA New Media, product, Mobile Applications; GMA New Media, location, GMA Network Center Sentence about the following data:","response":"GMA New Media is a company that was started on January 1, 2000.

I've been a fan of Tolkien's work for about 4 years now, ever since I got out of high school. I didn't grow up on this movie...perhaps my mother kept me away from it. It's definitely not for children. Not that it's bad in a graphic sense, but that the themes would go right over most 10 year olds heads. Overall, the animation was excellent considering this was made in 1978/1979. I thought the story followed the book fairly well in a loose sense. But I am bothered that Bashki didn't just add another 40 minutes or so and tack on the Return of the King parts. That would've made it the ultimate movie. I was bothered by it's abrupt end, and then when I heard Return of the King sucked, I was bothered even more. Too bad it wasn't one great animation film. It might have garnered a higher vote from me. I give it a 7. I can only hope Peter Jackson will do the books justice with the new live action LOTR. What is the sentiment of this review?","response":"The sentiment of this review is mostly positive with a little bit of disappointment.

Article: I was reading these interesting stories behind a group of great logos in the world. Personally Nike is my favorite one--it's so simple. And I liked the stories behind them, which made me forget all other things. McDonald's, Apple, Mercedes Benz and Adidas own great logos as well, and they are among my favorites. Nike In the Greek myth, Nike is the goddess of victory and the source of inspiration for soldiers. This logo represents the wing in the famous statue of the Greek goddess. Nike's logo was designed by Carolyn Davidson in 1971 for 35, and was registered as a trademark in 1995. McDonald's The logo was designed in 1962 by Jim Schindler to resemble the archshaped signs on the side of the company's then walk-up hamburger stand. Later on, the two golden arches were combined together to form the M. The McDonald's name was added to the logo in 1968. Apple There are different stories behind Apple's logo. The first logo was a reference to the religious story of Adam and Eve, in which the apple represented the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge. One year later, the second logo was designed in 1977 by Steven Jobs and Ronald Wayne, and it described Sir Isaac Newton sitting under an apple tree. This logo didn't stay long. One year later it was replaced almost immediately by graphic designer Rob Janoff's \\" rainbow apple\\", a rainbow- colored silhouette of an apple with a bite taken out of it. And then the rainbow- colored apple was replaced by the one- colored logo in 1998. It has not been changed so far. Mercedes Benz The Mercedes Benz logo, which was originally created by Gottlieb Daimler in 1909, consists of a simple description of a three- pointed star that represents its rule of the land, the sea and the air. The company was founded by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach. Marcedes is the name of Maybach's elder daughter, while Benz came as a result of a combination with Benz, Cie.and DMG in 1926. Adidas The Adidas logo, which was created by the founder of the company Adi Dassler, represents mountains,... Question: What does the author think of the stories of the great logos?

White","response":"Title: Roommates in Disguise Genre: Comedy-Drama Plot: Malik, a young Black man, moves to a predominantly white neighborhood to start a new life. He receives positive response from his neighbors upon moving in, but he keeps hearing about his \\"mysterious\\" roommate who was believed to reside with him. Malik doesn't have a roommate and becomes intrigued by the persistent rumors. His neighbors frequently inquire about his roommate's race, particularly focusing on whether he is Black or White. Malik decides to make a game of keeping his non-existent roommate's identity a secret, causing his neighbors to become more engaged and curious. One day, Malik receives a package addressed to \\"Mike.\\" He realizes the misunderstanding – the neighbors thought the previous tenant, Mike, was Malik's roommate. To make things interesting, Malik pretends that Mike, a young White man, is indeed his roommate. He plays along, creating a humorous and complex web of lies to maintain the charade, while simultaneously using the situation to highlight racial biases present in the community. Over time, Malik befriends a talented young actress named Amy, who he enlists to help him turn the invisible roommate into a reality. Amy poses as \\"Mike\\" during neighborhood events and gatherings, manipulating her appearance and voice to play the part convincingly. As the charade escalates, Malik notices that people's attitudes and perceptions of him change depending on who they believe his roommate is. When they think he lives with a Black roommate, they are more guarded and distant; when they believe his roommate is White, they are friendlier and more inclusive. Slowly, Malik's deception is exposed, and the neighborhood collectively confronts this underlying prejudice. The community begins to have conversations about race, identity, and stereotypes, led by Malik's charismatic personality and passion for unity. In the end, Malik achieves his goal of opening up the neighborhood's minds and fostering an environment of acceptance and understanding. He is celebrated as a catalyst for change, and \\"Mike\\" becomes a symbol of the transformative power of dialogue and openness. The movie concludes with the neighborhood hosting a multicultural block party, truly embracing their newfound inclusivity and empathy, while Malik and Amy look on with pride and satisfaction, their work accomplished."},{"question":"Jack leaves his bathtub's faucet dripping at a rate of 40 ml/minute.

Let's think first. Chain of thought:","response":"1. Calculate the net amount of water added to the bathtub per hour. 2. Calculate the total amount of water added to the bathtub after 9 hours. 3. Calculate the total amount of water remaining in the bathtub after subtracting the water dumped out. Step 1: Calculate net water added per hour - Water dripping rate: 40 ml/minute, which is 40 * 60 = 2400 ml/hour (since there are 60 minutes in an hour) - Evaporation rate: 200 ml/hour - Net water added per hour: 2400 ml/hour (dripping) - 200 ml/hour (evaporation) = 2200 ml/hour Step 2: Calculate total water added after 9 hours - Net water added per hour: 2200 ml/hour - Total hours: 9 - Total water added: 2200 ml/hour * 9 hours = 19800 ml Step 3: Calculate total water remaining in the bathtub after subtracting the water dumped out - Total water added: 19800 ml - Water dumped out: 12 liters = 12 * 1000 = 12000 ml (since there are 1000 ml in 1 liter) - Total water remaining: 19800 ml - 12000 ml = 7800 ml So, after Jack leaves the faucet running for 9 hours and then dumps out 12 liters of water, there are 7800 milliliters of water left in the bathtub."},{"question":"Do these questions have the same meaning?

The accident that Hunter was in was worse than the one Donald was in because Options: (a). Hunter was going faster.. (b). Donald was going faster..","response":"The completion should be option (a). \\"Hunter was going faster\\". The sentence would then read: \\"The accident that Hunter was in was worse than the one Donald was in because Hunter was going faster.\\" The reason for this selection is that the question sets up a comparison between the severity of two accidents, one involving Hunter and the other Donald. Based on this context, the sentence needs to be completed in such a way that provides a valid explanation for why Hunter's accident was worse. Option (a) offers this explanation, indicating that the severity of Hunter's accident was due to him going faster. On the other hand, option (b) could imply that Donald's accident was potentially more severe, as it suggests that Donald was going faster, which contradicts the intended message. Therefore, in order to preserve the intended comparison and message of the sentence, option (a) is the most suitable completion."},{"question":"This article: In 1894 Wood went to the Wagner festival at Bayreuth where he met the conductor Felix Mottl, who subsequently appointed him as his assistant and chorus master for a series of Wagner concerts at the newly built Queen's Hall in London. The manager of the hall, Robert Newman, was proposing to run a ten-week season of promenade concerts and, impressed by Wood, invited him to conduct. There had been such concerts in London since 1838, under conductors from Louis Antoine Jullien to Arthur Sullivan. Sullivan's concerts in the 1870s had been particularly successful, because he offered his audiences something more than the usual light music. He introduced major classical works, such as Beethoven symphonies, normally restricted to the more expensive concerts presented by the Philharmonic Society and others. Newman aimed to do the same: \\"I am going to run nightly concerts and train the public by easy stages. Popular at first, gradually raising the standard until I have created a public for classical and modern music.\\"Newman's determination to make the promenade concerts attractive to everyone led him to permit smoking during concerts, which was not formally prohibited at the Proms until 1971. Refreshments were available in all parts of the hall throughout the concerts, not only during intervals. Prices were considerably lower than those customarily charged for classical concerts: the promenade (the standing area) was one shilling, the balcony two shillings, and the grand circle (reserved seats) three and five shillings.Newman needed to find financial backing for his first season. Dr George Cathcart, a wealthy ear, nose and throat specialist, offered to sponsor it on two conditions: that Wood should conduct every concert, and that the pitch of the orchestral instruments should be lowered to the European standard diapason normal. Concert pitch in England was nearly a semitone higher than that used on the continent, and Cathcart regarded it as damaging for singers' voices. Wood, from his experience as a singing teacher,... contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who was appointed as chorus master for a series of Wagner concerts at the newly built Queen's Hall in London?, what is it ?

In this case, Marianne Power experimented with two different 'seasonal' Spanx to see if they would offer better comfort and support when attending such events, especially in warmer conditions. It is important to choose the right level of support when it comes to shapewear. Spanx, for example, is known for their different levels of support, ranging from light to medium to strong. In Marianne Power's test, she found out that Spanx only offered the medium support in the selected product. This means that they are lightweight in more ways than one, meaning they may not have provided enough support for your needs. It might have been beneficial for you to consider a product like Skinny Britches, which also offers medium support but might be more lightweight and breathable in warmer climates. The choice of shapewear for an event like a summer wedding should take into consideration the expected temperature, humidity, and the material of your clothing. When attending a summer event or a wedding in a picturesque location such as Lake Como, comfort and breathability should be prioritized. You may want to research different brands and products specifically designed for warmer climates. Look for materials that are moisture-wicking, lightweight, and breathable, which can help regulate body temperature and avoid discomfort caused by excessive sweating. In the future, when attending similar events, it would be advisable to consider investing in shapewear specifically designed for warmer weather or try opting for light support options that offer more breathability to avoid feeling too hot and bothered. Some additional tips for staying comfortable in warm weather include wearing light-colored clothing, staying hydrated, and using cooling accessories, such as handheld fans or cooling scarves. By following these suggestions, you should be able to enjoy outdoor weddings or events without worrying about heat-induced discomfort, allowing you to focus on the celebration at hand."},{"question":"Write a sentence not in English.","response":"Step 1: Choose a language other than English.

If you're too tired, you might just nod off instead.","response":"In this paragraph, the next steps to hypnotize yourself using the \\"Best Me\\" technique would be as follows: 1. Find a comfortable and quiet place: Look for a space where you can sit or lie down without being disturbed. Ensure that the environment is quiet and free from any external distractions, such as loud noises or strong smells. 2. Practice relaxation techniques: Begin by taking a few deep breaths to help calm and relax your body. Focus on each inhale and exhale, letting your body feel heavy and at ease. You can also practice progressive muscle relaxation, where you tense and relax different muscle groups in your body to help release tension and promote relaxation. 3. Use a hypnotic induction: Once you are relaxed, begin the hypnotic induction by focusing on an object or a mental image that helps you feel calm and relaxed. You can use visualizations, like imagining yourself walking down a staircase or counting down from ten to one, to help shift your focus and enter a state of hypnotic trance. 4. Visualize your \\"Best Me\\": Once you are in a hypnotic state, start visualizing the version of you that has already achieved your goals. Picture yourself in as much detail as possible, including your appearance, emotions, and the environment you are in. This will help to create a strong mental image of the person you want to become. 5. Engage your emotions: As you visualize your \\"Best Me,\\" engage your emotions and imagine how it would feel to achieve your goals. The more vividly you can experience these positive emotions, the more effective your self-hypnosis will be in supporting behavioral changes. 6. Use affirmations or suggestions: When you start to feel fully immersed in the visualization, begin to introduce positive affirmations or suggestions that align with your goals. These should be positive statements, like \\"I am confident,\\" \\"I am successful,\\" or \\"I can achieve anything I set my mind to.\\" Repeating these affirmations regularly during self-hypnosis can help to reinforce your new beliefs and help you adopt the mindset needed to achieve your goals. 7. Transition back to a conscious state: To end your self-hypnosis session, slowly count up from one to ten, or visualize yourself ascending a staircase. As you gradually come back to your conscious state, bring with you the feelings, emotions, and positive beliefs from your \\"Best Me\\" visualization. 8. Set aside time for regular practice: For self-hypnosis to be effective, it needs to be practiced regularly. Set aside some time each day, or several times per week, to repeat the \\"Best Me\\" technique and reinforce the positive changes you want to make in your life.

Rodgers was furious when Sturridge injured his thigh during the last England get together and he hasn't played since the 1-0 victory over Norway early last month. The Liverpool manager insisted that Sturridge needs 48 hours to recover after a match, but Hodgson ignored the advice and forced the striker to train. Daniel Sturridge was injured in training for England in September resulting in him missing the opening European Championship qualifier against Switzerland and a number of Liverpool matches. Hodgson said: 'We have only a shortage of time. We have two games and two training sessions, we wanted to play him and Rooney together against Switzerland. 'The injury was unfortunate but if I am going to be under pressure to give players two days off every time they play then we won't train. They can't have two days off. 'He has not played for Liverpool since picking up the injury. If he was to get fitter during the international week then he will still have a lot of work to do to bring him up to speed for Liverpool anyway. There was no question of him being selected. Hodgson denied that there is any problem between him and Brendan Rodgers after the Liverpool manager warned him not to play Daniel Sturridge. The England boss has not selected the striker for his squad to face San Marino and Estonia in their Euro 2016 qualifiers. Rodgers said that he had told Hodgson that Sturridge was not available for the national team, even though he could play some part of Liverpool's match against West Bromwich Albion on Saturday before the England squad meet up. Talking at Melwood, the Liverpool boss said: 'I've not spoken to Daniel (about the situation). My focus is on Liverpool, it is not on England. 'I spoke to him about being available for Liverpool but I can't think about England when he is not ready to play for Liverpool. England boss Roy Hodgson has insisted players can not have two days off due to the proximity of matches. 'He's had a grade one injury for four weeks, which is a long time, and my focus is now getting him to play for Liverpool. 'I've had good communication with Roy. It was amicable. There is no issue. 'We spoke at length yesterday on the situation and I said to him 'Every individual player is different'. 'I respect he had work to do internationally but my thoughts are with Liverpool players and what their needs are. 'We agreed it was probably too soon for Daniel to meet up with England, irrespective of whether he was involved this weekend or not. He hasn't trained with the team at all since the injury with them and it was probably not the right time to go with them.' While there is no issue between himself and Hodgson, Rodgers wouldn't dismiss questions surrounding the two pairs of medical staff being at loggerheads. 'It is not something to be discussed now,' he said. 'I don't think the same thing will happen again. From the conversations with Roy they will obviously look at that. 'I understand his position where he has only a few days to work with the players and he will probably take away that intensity on that second day but you can still work players, we work players here on the second day, but it needs to be tapered to the individual player.' Liverpool striker Sturridge has only managed to appear in half of his side's Premier League matches. Brendan Rodgers told Hodgson that Sturridge would not be available for England but could play some part in Liverpool's match against West Brom before the national team meet up. Hodgson added: 'The last thing you want is injuries in training. You feel a responsibility to the clubs when you have their players and I can only think of three injuries with the national team in two and a half years I have been in charge. 'I haven't been told he can't play for us. We have a right to pick players and we have a right to check on their fitness and assess them ourselves. It's never happened in my two-and-a-half years and hope it never will. The way forward is to have dialogue with managers and players. 'If he took some part at the weekend it'll be very much at the beginning of his recovery. Us going forward in December and March, a fully fit Sturridge is what I need. 'I don't seek ways in which I can assert my authority. I'm happy with the way I use my authority.' What are highlight points for this article?","response":"England Manager Roy Hodgson has refuted claims by Liverpool Manager Brendan Rodgers that he ignored advice from Liverpool over Daniel Sturridge's recovery time.

Answer:","response":"The honoree of the Earl Haig Memorial, Field Marshal Douglas Haig, was a senior officer of the British Army who ascended through the ranks and held significant positions during his military career. Although he started as a junior officer like any other military personnel, he eventually held some of the most critical posts in the British Army during his tenure, making him an influential figure in modern British military history. Field Marshal Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig, was born on June 19, 1861, in Edinburgh, Scotland. He joined the British Army as a junior officer after graduating from the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. He was initially commissioned as a lieutenant in the 7th (Queen's Own) Hussars in 1885. Throughout his career, Haig served in various capacities in multiple countries, including India, Egypt, Sudan, and South Africa. As Haig progressed through various ranks, his roles and responsibilities grew, marking his transition from a junior officer to a senior one. He furthered his military education at the Staff College, Camberley, which would enable him to assume more senior positions within the British Army. In 1906, Haig was promoted to the rank of Major-General and appointed the Director of Military Training at the War Office. This responsibility marked a pivotal point in Haig’s career, further solidifying his status as a senior officer. During World War I, Haig's notable senior positions within the British Army included the following: 1. Commander of the British I Corps - Haig was appointed to this position in August 1914 at the start of the war, responsible for the leadership of a significant segment of British troops on the Western Front. 2. Commander of the British First Army - In December 1914, Haig was promoted to the rank of General and was placed in charge of the British First Army. 3. Commander-in-Chief of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) - From 1915 until the end of World War I, Haig served as the Commander-in-Chief of the BEF. He led British forces in various crucial battles, including the Battle of the Somme (1916), the Third Battle of Ypres (1917), and the Hundred Days Offensive (1918), which led to victory and the end of the war. Following his contributions during World War I, Haig was promoted to Field Marshal in 1917 and created Earl Haig and the Viscount Dawick in 1919. He continued to serve the British Army until his retirement in 1921. In summary, although Field Marshal Douglas Haig began his career as a junior officer, he ascended through the ranks and became one of the most senior officers of the British Army. His contributions to the British military, both in times of war and peace, earned him prominent positions in the armed forces, including that of the commander-in-chief of the British Expeditionary Force during World War I. Thus, the honoree of the Earl Haig memorial can be accurately described as a senior officer of the British Army."},{"question":"This article: Hachijō-daiko (八丈太鼓, trans. \\"Hachijō-style taiko\\") is a taiko tradition originating on the island of Hachijō-jima. Two styles of Hachijō-daiko emerged and have been popularized among residents: an older tradition based on a historical account, and a newer tradition influenced by mainland groups and practiced by the majority of the islanders.The Hachijō-daiko tradition was documented as early as 1849 based on a journal kept by an exile named Kakuso Kizan. He mentioned some of its unique features, such as \\"a taiko is suspended from a tree while women and children gathered around\\", and observed that a player used either side of the drum while performing. Illustrations from Kizan's journal show features of Hachijō-daiko. These illustrations also featured women performing, which is unusual as taiko performance elsewhere during this period was typically reserved for men. Teachers of the tradition have noted that the majority of its performers were women; one estimate asserts that female performers outnumbered males by three to one. The first style of Hachijō-daiko is thought to descend directly from the style reported by Kizan. This style is called Kumaoji-daiko, named after its creator Okuyama Kumaoji, a central performer of the style. Kumaoji-daiko has two players on a single drum, one of whom, called the shita-byōshi (下拍子, \\"lower beat\\"), provides the underlying beat. The other player, called the uwa-byōshi (上拍子, \\"upper beat\\"), builds on this rhythmical foundation with unique and typically improvised rhythms. While there are specific types of underlying rhythms, the accompanying player is free to express an original musical beat. Kumaoji-daiko also features an unusual positioning for taiko: the drums are sometimes suspended from ropes, and historically, sometimes drums were suspended from trees.The contemporary style of Hachijō-daiko is called shin-daiko (新太鼓, \\"new taiko\\"), which differs from Kumaoji-daiko in multiple ways.

Answer:","response":"Mickey Mantle was an American professional baseball player who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the New York Yankees as a center fielder and first baseman. An outfielder is a person playing in one of the three defensive positions in baseball, farthest from the batter, which includes the left fielder, the center fielder, and the right fielder.

After the Ashton Canal closed in the 1960s, it was decided to turn the Portland Basin warehouse into a museum. In 1985, the first part of the Heritage Centre and Museum opened on the first floor of the warehouse. The restoration of building was complete in 1999; the museum details Tameside's social, industrial, and political history. The basin next to the warehouse is the point at which the Ashton Canal, the Huddersfield Narrow Canal and the Peak Forest Canal meet. It has been used several times as a filming location for Coronation Street, including a scene where the character Richard Hillman drove into the canal.The earliest parts of Ashton Town Hall, which was the first purpose-built town hall in what is now Tameside, date to 1840 when it was opened. It has classical features such as the Corinthian columns on the entrance facade. Enlarged in 1878, the hall provides areas for administrative purposes and public functions. Meanwhile, the Old Street drill hall was completed in 1887. There are five parks in the town, three of which have Green Flag Awards. The first park opened in Ashton-under-Lyne was Stamford Park on the border with Stalybridge. The park opened in 1873, following a 17-year campaign by local cotton workers; the land was bought from a local mill-owner for £15,000 (£1.4 million as of 2019) and further land was donated by George Grey, 7th Earl of Stamford. A crowd of between 60,000 and 80,000 turned out to see the Earl of Stamford formally open the new facility on 12 July 1873. It now includes a boating lake, and a memorial to Joseph Rayner Stephens, commissioned by local factory workers to commemorate his work promoting fair wages and improved working conditions.

At the end of the class, Jason helped Lawrence because","response":"At the end of the class, Jason helped Lawrence because he noticed that his classmate was struggling to understand some key concepts they had discussed during the lesson. As a compassionate and empathetic individual, Jason felt compelled to offer his support in any way he could to ensure that Lawrence did not fall behind and feel discouraged about his progress. Furthermore, Jason believed that by assisting his peer, he would not only be improving Lawrence's comprehension of the subject matter, but also strengthening his own understanding of the material, as teaching often requires the ability to analyze and synthesize information in a manner that is both concise and accessible. By lending his aid, Jason hoped to create a collaborative learning environment, as well as nurture a positive rapport with his fellow student, which is essential for establishing a healthy and effective educational atmosphere.

Research has shown that students who engage in this manner of pedagogy exhibit improved retention of information, enhanced problem-solving skills, and heightened critical thinking abilities. Given these potential benefits, Jason's decision to offer his help to Lawrence was undoubtedly guided by an earnest desire to promote the success and well-being of both individuals involved. Moreover, it is important to note that, as a member of the class, Jason likely had some knowledge of the specific difficulties that Lawrence had been grappling with throughout the course, which positioned him as an ideal tutor and mentor.

That made him decide to learn more about HTML and to design and set up his own website under the address of a US-based company, Network Solutions. He kept updating his website, posting interesting things on it. This impressed Network Solutions and they invited him to attend a class on Web design and development. His mom and uncle criticised him for not taking his education seriously. But gradually, his dad started encouraging him and even bought him a computer and Net connection. In fact, that was his first investment in the company. On May 14, 2000, along with friends Clifford Leslie and Binay M. N, he floated his own website -- www.coolhindustani.com.

It can cause a number of symptoms, such as poor ability to tolerate cold, a feeling of tiredness, constipation, depression, and weight gain. Occasionally there may be swelling of the front part of the neck due to goitre. Untreated hypothyroidism during pregnancy can lead to delays in growth and intellectual development in the baby, which is called cretinism. Worldwide, too little iodine in the diet is the most common cause of hypothyroidism. In countries with enough iodine in the diet, the most common cause of hypothyroidism is the autoimmune condition Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Less common causes include: previous treatment with radioactive iodine, injury to the hypothalamus or the anterior pituitary gland, certain medications, a lack of a functioning thyroid at birth, or previous thyroid surgery. The diagnosis of hypothyroidism, when suspected, can be confirmed with blood tests measuring thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroxine levels. Prevention at the population level has been with the universal salt iodization. Hypothyroidism can be treated with levothyroxine. The dose is adjusted according to symptoms and normalization of the thyroxine and TSH levels. Thyroid medication is safe in pregnancy. While a certain amount of dietary iodine is important, excessive amounts can worsen certain types of hypothyroidism. Worldwide about one billion people are estimated to be iodine deficient; however, it is unknown how often this results in hypothyroidism. In the United States, hypothyroidism occurs in 0.30.4% of people. Subclinical hypothyroidism, a milder form of hypothyroidism characterized by normal thyroxine levels and an elevated TSH level, is thought to occur in 4.38.5% of people in the United States. Hypothyroidism is more common in women than men. People over the age of 60 are more commonly affected. Dogs are also known to develop... - Newborn screening is a public health program of screening in infants shortly after birth for a list of conditions that are treatable, but not clinically evident in the newborn period. Some of the conditions included in newborn screening programs are only detectable after irreversible damage has been done, in some cases sudden death is the first manifestation of a disease. Screening programs are often run by state or national governing bodies with the goal of screening all infants born in the jurisdiction. The number of diseases screened for is set by each jurisdiction, and can vary greatly. Most newborn screening tests are done by measuring metabolites and enzyme activity in whole blood samples collected on specialized filter paper, however many areas are starting to screen infants for hearing loss using automated auditory brainstem response and congenital heart defects using pulse oximetry. Infants who screen positive undergo further testing to determine if they are truly affected with a disease or if the test result was a false positive. Follow-up testing is typically coordinated between geneticists and the infant's pediatrician or primary care physician. - Congenital hypothyroidism (CH) is a condition of thyroid hormone deficiency present at birth. Approximately 1 in 4000 newborn infants has a severe deficiency of thyroid function, while even more have mild or partial degrees. If untreated for several months after birth, severe congenital hypothyroidism can lead to growth failure and permanent intellectual disability. Treatment consists of a daily dose of thyroid hormone (thyroxine) by mouth. Because the treatment is simple, effective, and inexpensive, nearly all of the developed world practices newborn screening to detect and treat congenital hypothyroidism in the first weeks of life. - Intellectual disability (ID), also known as general learning disability, and mental retardation (MR), is a generalized neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by significantly impaired intellectual and adaptive functioning. It is defined by an IQ score under 70 in addition to deficits in two or more adaptive behaviors that affect everyday, general living. Once focused almost entirely on cognition, the definition now includes both a component relating to mental functioning and one relating to individuals' functional skills in their environments. As a result of this focus on the person's abilities in practice, a person with an unusually low IQ may not be considered to have intellectually disability. Intellectual disability is subdivided into syndromic intellectual disability, in which intellectual deficits associated with other medical and behavioral signs and symptoms are present, and non-syndromic intellectual disability, in which intellectual deficits appear without other abnormalities. Down syndrome and fragile X syndrome are examples of syndromic intellectual disabilities. Intellectual disability affects about 23% of the general population. Seventy-five to ninety percent of the affected people have mild intellectual disability. Non-syndromic or idiopathic cases account for 3050% of cases. About a quarter of cases are caused by a genetic disorder, and about 5% of cases are inherited from a person's parents. Cases of unknown cause affect about 95 million people as of 2013. - Jean H.

BRIT security services are preparing for a flood of fleeing home-grown jihadists as ISIS continues to be pounded by air strikes from the US-led coalition and Russia. Although the Islamist group has suffered increasingly from desertion in recent months, up until now very few of the foreign fighters have returned to Europe from Syria and Iraq. The numbers coming to Britain for instance, The Independent has learned, have been in no more than single figures for the last eight months. But that trickle could soon turn into a flood if ISIS continues to lose territory and suffer more heavy losses in Syria. These radicalised warriors will present a severe threat in the near future, “a ticking time bomb” as they try to break out of the region, say security officials. And they insist a coordinated policy is needed to confront the impending crisis. The problem has been compounded by a dramatic and sickening increase in the use of children, including those of Western parentage, by ISIS to carry out executions of prisoners. A photo appeared last week of a young boy, said to be British, in the act of shooting Kurdish fighters captured by Isis. The 11-year-old, it has been claimed, was the son of Sally Jones, a British woman who had converted to Islam and joined ISIS in Syria. The terror group is believed to have around 1,500 child fighters in its ranks. The vast majority are Syrian and Iraqi, with Yemen and Morocco supplying most from Arab countries. There are also around 50 children from Britain are currently in the self-declared “Islamic State”, along with smaller numbers from France and Australia, among Western countries. “What one does with these children need to be considered,” said a senior British security official. “Some of them have who have been used to carry out these criminal acts are below the age of criminal responsibility in many countries in Europe. “We know of children from the West who had been taken to Syria, but there are also children who have been born there to European parents. As we know Daesh (ISIS) are now bringing five-year-olds into their jihad. “But the real problem would be with the thousands of adults. A number of states are liaising on this, but the policies will depend to an extent on political and legal considerations in individual states.” Around 27,000 foreign fighters are believed to have joined Isis since the start of Syria’s civil war five years ago, with between 5,000 and 7,000 of them arriving from Europe to join the group and other hardline rebel organisations such as Jabhat al-Nusra, an al-Qaeda affiliate. Just under 800 have travelled from the UK. Jihadists have been using the Turkish border to get in and out of Syria, sometimes with the connivance, it has been claimed, of the Erdogan government. But the Turks are now carrying out military operations against Isis, and its militants have now lost control of points they had occupied in the area. What are the most important parts of this news article?","response":"The news article discusses the fear that Britain may soon face an influx of home-grown jihadists and child soldiers returning from ISIS-controlled territories in Syria and Iraq. Security services are concerned about the potential threats these radicalized warriors pose, describing them as a \\"ticking time bomb.\\" ISIS has notably increased its use of child soldiers, with around 1,500 in its ranks, including approximately 50 from Britain. The article highlights some key points: 1. As ISIS continues to lose territory due to airstrikes from the US-led coalition and Russia, security officials fear an increased flow of foreign fighters returning to Europe, primarily Britain. 2. There has been a rise in the use of child soldiers, including those of Western parentage, by ISIS for carrying out executions. 3. It is believed that there are around 1,500 child fighters within ISIS, with a majority being Syrian and Iraqi, while children from Britain, France, and Australia are also present. 4. Deciding how to manage the return of these child soldiers is a complicated issue, as some are below the age of criminal responsibility in multiple European countries. 5. Approximately 27,000 foreign fighters are believed to have joined ISIS since the start of Syria's civil war, with around 5,000 to 7,000 coming from Europe, and just under 800 from the UK.

In the last photos of her, taken barely 10 minutes before the Russian bombs landed, she shows off a new bracelet and freshly painted nails with glee, then squeezes a kiss from her squirming baby sister. “I only took my children back to Syria for six days,” says her mother, Suheer, her eyes welling up as she plays a video on her smartphone, bringing a shadow of her daughter momentarily back to life. Her son Hossein, only four himself, leans in to smooth away her tears. Too young to really understand why his sister has vanished, he comforts his mother with a soft patter of “mummy, no, mummy”. Related: Ministers say it could take two years to destroy Isis Raghat now lies miles away, across the Turkish border in Syria, buried in the town of Habeet, near Idlib, where she died in October alongside her grandfather and her cousin Ahmad. When the attack finished she was found wrapped in Ahmad’s arms. A 28-year-old maths teacher, he had tried to race her to shelter when the first bomb fell. They made it to a small dugout in the garden, but a bomb landed just beside the entrance, and Ahmad’s body was not a strong enough shield. Raghat survived the first blast, but died on the back of a motorbike as her family raced her to hospital. “We were supposed to be going home the next day,” Suheer says. “My husband never saw his daughter again.” The family are one of hundreds ripped apart by more than two months of intense Russian bombing raids on opponents of President Bashar al-Assad, which victims and fighters say have strayed far behind frontlines. Coalition airstrikes led by the US have also killed civilians, but have stricter rules of engagement. There have been no reports of civilian casualties from the airstrikes launched on the al-Omar oilfield by British Tornado jets this week. Syrians say Russians are not only reckless about choosing targets, but also appear to be intentionally bombing some civilian areas. Survivors, doctors treating the injured, and local commanders believe the Sukhoi jets, flying from a new airbase in the coastal Latakia province, are hitting homes in a deliberate campaign to break fighters’ morale and depopulate swaths of the countryside. “They are targeting the civilians at night, and mostly frontlines during the day,” says Abu Hussain, a Turkmen rebel commander, a high-rank defector from the Syrian army. “It’s because they don’t want anyone to film the jets bombing at night, so you can’t prove their identity.” That matches images and accounts of the airstrike on Raghat’s house, which her uncle Ali says began moments after 9pm on 1 October. In one of her last photographs, she holds a lit torch, and video her uncle says was shot soon after the bombing shows flames raging through the house against a dark sky. Russian airstrikes killed at least 295 Syrian civilians in October alone, according to monitoring group Airwars, which keeps an extensive database of images, videos, reports and biographies of the dead. “Based on all field reporting, the number of alleged civilian casualties attributed to Russia is many times what we see being claimed against the US-led coalition,” says Chris Woods, who runs the Airwars project. “We think the primary reason here that the casualties are so high is the type of munitions that Russia is using, mostly ‘dumb bombs’ which almost always mean more civilian deaths. That is closely followed by where and how Russia is bombing. There is no doubt that Russia is bombing civilian neighbourhoods.” Airwars’ assessment of the strike on Habeet matches Raghat’s family’s account, and ties in with Russian reports of bombing raids in the area, it says. A Syrian monitoring group also confirmed details of the attack, and a prominent human rights activist still working inside Syria videotaped the aftermath and photographed the little girl’s body. The family, who asked for their surname to be withheld to protect relatives still in Syria, did not expect a bombing raid even though Russian planes had been buzzing around the area for four days, apparently doing surveillance. President Vladimir Putin had said his fighters would be targeting “terrorist groups”, and the family’s home was more than 60 miles (97km) from the nearest Isis forces. Related: At least 18 people killed in Russian airstrike on town in Syria – reports Even as it became clear that Russian planes were more focused on tackling Assad’s opponents than Isis, the frontline was still several miles away. It would take days for civilians to realise they were firmly in the bombers’ sights, because of confusion about targets and the slow and unreliable trickle of news out of Syria. Many working in overwhelmed hospitals, providing relief or ferrying the worst injured across the border into Turkey, fear the deaths have barely registered in western capitals obsessed with tackling Isis and almost oblivious to the civilian deaths caused by Russian bombing. “Its been 48 days with no one talking about it,” says Abu Hamza Suleiyman, a doctor at a Syrian field hospital near the town of Jisr al-Shughur, another area targeted by Russian bombers. “There are almost no civilians left in their homes because they bombed almost every single village. “I could understand the frontline, but the civilians? One landed just outside a maternity hospital. This is the worst experience in the last four years. I’m from a small village in these mountains, and for ages no one has bombed this village, but when the Russians started bombing they hit every single village.” The killings already appear to be entrenching the war and fuelling radicalisation. Anti-Assad fighters seeking revenge and disturbed by the flagging strength of their own groups, seek to ally with opposition forces that are well-supplied and confident in Syria – among them Isis. “Isis are not very good, but a lot of people think they are doing the correct thing against the regime,” says Raghat’s uncle Ali, a fighter with the Free Syrian Army whose two younger brothers now want to join him on the frontlines to avenge their family. Ali, who was not at home when the strike hit, fears other families may look for even more radical solutions. “There is no Isis in our area at all, but there is going to be soon,” he says. Ali’s father, 56-year-old Abdul Razzaq, was one of the first civilian victims of the Russian raids, hit in the Habeet strike as he tried to race down from the top storey of the house. Most of the family were already downstairs and managed to dash to safety, leaving only Raghat, her cousin and 49-year-old grandmother, Zahra, who had been in another part of the house and decided to head for the dugout in the yard. As they fled, a shell landed just behind Zahra, knocking her to the ground, destroying her hearing and peppering her with shrapnel. It nearly killed her, but probably also saved her life, because just as Ahmad and Raghat thought they had reached safety, another blast hit the shelter directly. Zahra’s search for treatment took a long, painful night of racing across northern Syria, on roads so bad she broke an arm, because some hospitals have been targeted in airstrikes and others are overwhelmed by casualties of the bombings. Related: 'More than 90%' of Russian airstrikes in Syria have not targeted Isis, US says Ali rushed her 15 miles to the nearest medical station, but doctors there could do little more than stabilise her for a three-hour drive to the Turkish border, in an ambulance that was more like a truck. A drive in darkness, haste and confusion was followed by three hours waiting at the border for Zahra, moaning in pain and terrified she was dying. They were finally escorted across the border to begin treatment, but two months later she still has no movement in one arm, and can barely walk because the sores and burns on her legs are yet to heal. They were only in the path of the bombs because the war has dragged on so long. The whole extended family fled to Turkey in 2012, but two years ago pension payments to Abdul Razzaq, a retired officer in the Syrian military, were stopped by the government. They could no longer afford rent. But, anxious to avoid the grim refugee camps and reassured that their home was under firm rebel control and had never been bombed or taken by the regime, they decided to risk returning. Only Suheer stayed with her husband, who had found a job in Turkey. She missed her parents and siblings badly, though, and after two years persuaded her husband to let her take the children back to celebrate Eid. They crossed back into Syria days before the Russian campaign began. Raghat died in new holiday clothes and a bead bracelet bought by a favourite aunt, Rasmea, who studied computer engineering before the war. “We were shopping, came home, did some pictures, and then – the end,” Rasmea says. She still wears her niece’s bracelet, faded now to dull browns and blacks. Her Facebook profile picture is a montage of images of Raghat, both radiant in life and mutilated in death. “Why are the Russians bombing Syrian people? What have we done wrong?” she says, on the verge of tears. “We want people to see what is happening in Syria, please tell the world.”","response":"A Little Girl's Story: How Raghat's Life Was Taken by Russian Bombs in Syria"},{"question":"Answer the following question. Who was Constable of Caernarvon Castle when Charles was invested as Prince of Wales","response":"When Charles was invested as Prince of Wales on July 1, 1969, at Caernarfon Castle, the Constable of Caernarvon Castle was Sir Michael Duff, 3rd Baronet. Sir Michael Duff was a British politician, public servant, and an eminent individual who had a significant impact on the local community. Sir Michael Duncan Duff-Assheton-Smith was born on November 5, 1907, and was the eldest son of Sir Charles Garden Assheton-Smith, 2nd Baronet, and his wife, Mary Florence Duff. Sir Michael inherited his father's baronetcy on October 9, 1951, upon the death of his father. He took on the responsibility as Constable of Caernarfon Castle, a role he held until his death in 1980. The Investiture of the Prince of Wales at Caernarfon Castle is a traditional ceremony that goes back several centuries, signifying the formal acknowledgement of the heir apparent to the British throne as the Prince of Wales.

A:","response":"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was initially founded by Dr. Joseph W. Mountin and Alexander Langmuir in 1946. Dr. Mountin, a public health visionary, laid the groundwork for the CDC and expanded the agency's focus to include disease prevention with an emphasis on public health education. Dr. Langmuir, an epidemiologist, established the CDC's Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS) in 1951, which further developed the agency's ability to identify and investigate public health threats. Your description of the CDC's focus on national attention regarding various health aspects is accurate and reasonable. The CDC's main objectives revolve around enhancing the health and well-being of the citizens of the United States through comprehensive measures. Their activities are not limited to infectious diseases and foodborne pathogens but also include other domains of public health, such as environmental health, occupational safety and health, health promotion, injury prevention, and health education. To further elaborate on each of these components, let's explore their primary functions: 1. Infectious diseases, foodborne pathogens, and other microbial infections: The CDC has an extensive program to monitor, prevent, and control infectious diseases in the United States. They research and develop interventions for key diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and influenza, to reduce their impact on public health. 2. Environmental health: The CDC is also responsible for addressing health concerns related to environmental factors, such as air and water quality, chemical exposure, and radiation. They investigate environmental hazards and develop guidelines for protecting public health and the environment. 3. Occupational safety and health: The CDC works closely with the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) to conduct research to improve workplace safety and prevent occupational injuries and illnesses. 4. Health promotion: The agency establishes programs to encourage health promotion and disease prevention across various stages of life. From maternal and child health initiatives to tobacco prevention and control, the CDC aims to provide resources for individuals, communities, and organizations that assist in health promotion. 5. Injury prevention: The CDC has the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC), which focuses on preventing injuries and reducing their related consequences. This center covers a range of topics, including violence prevention, traumatic brain injury, and motor vehicle safety. 6. Health education: The CDC provides educational resources, training, and technical assistance to build knowledge and understanding of various public health topics. These efforts encompass multiple areas such as vaccination, disease control, and emergency preparedness. In summary, the CDC was founded by Dr. Joseph W. Mountin and Alexander Langmuir, and it plays a crucial role in various aspects of public health in the United States.

In March, the Swedish riksråd decided to wage war. Thereupon, 12,000 Swedish troops were transferred to the Duchy of Bremen by the end of the year. In January 1666, Carl Gustaf Wrangel departed from Swedish Pomerania to command the Swedish army, which in early 1666 numbered 14,000 troops. By summer, all of the city of Bremen's territory was occupied, except the city itself. The Swedish chancellor of Bremen-Verden, Esaias von Pufendorf, went to the court in Paris to build an alliance with France. The Swedish position was that France had to intervene on the Swedish side, since Bremen was Swedish according to the Peace of Westphalia, of which France was a guarantor. Pufendorf was however told by Hugues de Lionne that France would not hesitate to declare openly that she read the treaty as Bremen being an Imperial city, rather than provoke a new great war with the Holy Roman Empire and the Dutch Republic with an assault Sweden and France could hardly win. Lionne said Sweden would be better off waiting for a situation when the Dutch and the neighboring German principalities were weak, and then take the city of Bremen by surprise.

Hand Signals Though indicators are used for the purpose of showing which direction you are going, knowing some hand signals is very important and are usually always asked in a driving test. When you want to turn right, you can put your left hand out of the window and point upward. When you want to make a left turn, you can reach your left arm out of the window and point to the left. If you want to slow down or stop, you can just point downward. School Buses Yellow school buses have flashing red lights and stop signs that reach out from the driver's side. The drivers use these warning signals when letting pupils on and off. No matter which side of the road you are traveling on, if you come upon a school bus with its lights flashing and a stop sign used, you must stop. It's the law. Remain stopped until the lights stop flashing or the stop sign is removed. Using the Horn Using horns is not common in America. Actually they are very rarely used.

In his 21st-century biography, Chernow cites this incident as evidence that Hamilton and Laurens saw the Revolution and the struggle against slavery as inseparable. Hamilton attacked his political opponents as demanding freedom for themselves and refusing to allow it to blacks. In January 1785, Hamilton attended the second meeting of the New York Manumission Society (NYMS). John Jay was president and Hamilton was the first secretary and later became president. Chernow notes how the membership soon included many of Hamilton's friends and associates. Hamilton was a member of the committee of the society that petitioned the legislature to end the slave trade, and that succeeded in passing legislation banning the export of slaves from New York. In the same period, Hamilton felt bound by the rule of law of the time and his law practice facilitated the return of a fugitive slave to Henry Laurens of South Carolina. He opposed the compromise at the 1787 Constitutional Convention by which the federal government could not abolish the slave trade for 20 years, and was disappointed when he lost that argument. Hamilton never supported forced emigration for freed slaves. Horton has argued from this that he would be comfortable with a multiracial society, and that this distinguished him from his contemporaries. In international affairs, he supported Toussaint L'Ouverture's black government in Haiti after the revolt that overthrew French control, as he had supported aid to the slaveowners in 1791--both measures hurt France. Scant evidence has been interpreted by a few to indicate Hamilton may have owned household slaves, as did many wealthy New Yorkers (the evidence for this is indirect; McDonald interprets it as referring to paid employees). Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"Hamilton\\" correctly answer the question \\"Who was president of the NYMS before Hamilton?\\"?","response":"Yes, the response \\"Hamilton\\" correctly answers the question \\"Who was president of the NYMS before Hamilton?\\" based on the information provided in the paragraph. The paragraph states, \\"John Jay was president and Hamilton was the first secretary and later became president.\\" This indicates that John Jay was the president of the New York Manumission Society (NYMS) before Hamilton."},{"question":"Q: Riley wanted to tell Alex important news.

He was the second son of Goncalo de Albuquerque, Lord of Vila Verde dos Francos, and Dona Leonor de Menezes. His father held an important position at court and was connected by remote illegitimate descent with the Portuguese monarchy. He was educated in mathematics and Latin at the court of Afonso V of Portugal, where he befriended Prince John, the future King John II of Portugal. The fleet left Lisbon on 6 April 1506. Afonso piloted his ship himself, having lost his appointed pilot on departure. In Mozambique Channel, they rescued Captain Joao da Nova, who had encountered difficulties on his return from India; da Nova and his ship, the Frol de la mar, joined da Cunha's fleet. From Malindi, da Cunha sent envoys to Ethiopia, which at the time was thought to be closer than it actually is. Those included the priest Joao Gomes, Joao Sanches and Tunisian Sid Mohammed who, having failed to cross the region, headed for Socotra; from there, Afonso managed to land them in Filuk. After successful attacks on Arab cities on the east Africa coast, they conquered Socotra and built a fortress at Suq, hoping to establish a base to stop the Red Sea commerce to the Indian Ocean. However, Socotra was abandoned four years later, as it was not advantageous as a base. At Socotra, they parted ways: Tristao da Cunha sailed for India, where he would relieve the Portuguese besieged at Cannanore, while Afonso took seven ships and 500 men to Ormuz in the Persian Gulf, one of the chief eastern centers of commerce. On his way, he conquered the cities of Curiati (Kuryat), Muscat in July 1507, and Khor Fakkan, accepting the submission of the cities of Kalhat and Sohar. He arrived at Ormuz on 25 September and soon captured the city, which agreed to become a tributary state of the Portuguese king. Hormuz was then a tributary state of Shah Ismail of Persia. In a famous episode, shortly after it's conquest Albuquerque was confronted by Persian envoys, who demanded the payment of the due tribute from him instead. He ordered them be given a stock of cannonballs, arrows and weapons, retorting that \\"such was the currency struck in Portugal to pay the tribute demanded from the dominions of King Manuel\\" According to Bras de Albuquerque, it was Shah Ismael who coined the term \\"Lion of the seas\\", addressing Albuquerque as such. Afonso began building the Fort of Our Lady of Victory (later renamed Fort of Our Lady of the Conception), engaging his men of all ranks in the work. However, some of his officers revolted against the heavy work and climate and, claiming that Afonso was exceeding his orders, departed for India. With the fleet reduced to two ships and left without supplies, he was unable to maintain this position for long. Forced to abandon Ormuz in January 1508, he raided coastal villages to resupply the settlement of Socotra, returned to Ormuz, and then headed to India. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Did he lose any men on his conquest?","response":"The article does not specifically mention losing any men during Afonso de Albuquerque's conquests. However, it does mention that some of his officers revolted against the heavy work and climate, and they claimed that Afonso was exceeding his orders. This led to them departing for India, leaving the fleet reduced to two ships and without supplies. This indicates that while there might not be a direct mention of losing men, there was a reduction in his forces during the conquest due to the officers' revolt."},{"question":"Produce a sentence which mentions all of these concepts: build, crane, sky","response":"A big crane helps to build tall buildings that reach up to the sky, just like a giant toy."},{"question":"Indicate if the following Polish tweet contains cyber-bullying content with 'Yes'; otherwise, respond with 'No'.

Comparing two kickers, Brown and Elam, undoubtedly raises the question of which kicker had fewer total yards in their career. To address this, let's take a deep dive into their respective kicking resumes. Brown: A Powerful Leg with Remarkable Accuracy Born in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, on April 29, 1979, Joshua Brown became an accomplished football player at the University of Nebraska. After an impressive college career, Brown was drafted to the Seattle Seahawks in the 7th round of the 2003 NFL draft. Over the course of his career, he played for four teams, namely the Seattle Seahawks, St. Louis Rams, New York Jets, and New York Giants. Brown played 14 seasons in the National Football League, accumulating a total of 1,889 points. With a field goal percentage of 82.8% and an extra-point percentage of 97.7%, he ranks among the best kickers in NFL history. Brown made 381 field goals out of 460 attempts and successfully converted 577 of 591 extra point attempts. He also recorded nineteen successful onside kicks and had a longest field goal of 58 yards. Elam: A Clutch Kicker with Super Bowl Experience Jason Elam was born in Fort Walton Beach, Florida, on March 8, 1970. Elam gained national prominence at the University of Hawaii, where he impressed NFL scouts with his booming kicks. The Broncos selected him in the 3rd round of the 1993 NFL draft – a rare move, since teams usually do not use high draft picks on kickers. Jason Elam is best-known as the longtime placekicker for the Denver Broncos. He had an illustrious 17-year career, spending 15 years with the Broncos and two seasons with the Atlanta Falcons. Elam was a key figure in the Broncos' back-to-back Super Bowl victories in the late '90s. His NFL career totals include 1,983 points scored and three Pro Bowl appearances. Elam converted 436 field goals out of 540 attempts, achieving an impressive field goal percentage of 80.7% while connecting on 98.5% of his extra points (675 made out of 686 attempts). He also succeeded on eight onside kicks. In his storied career, Elam's longest field goal was a whopping 63 yards, tying the then-NFL record at the time. The Verdict: Elam or Brown, Who had Fewer Total Yards? To determine which kicker had fewer total yards, we can look at the total number of field goals and extra points made by each kicker. Field goals contribute to yards significantly more than extra points do. Brown made 381 field goals and 577 extra points, while Elam made 436 field goals and 675 extra points. Using calculations based on estimates for field goal distances - accounting for the greater variance in distance within field goals - Brown would come out as the kicker with fewer total yards. Considering Brown played for 14 seasons while Elam had a 17-season career, the difference in total yards can be attributed to both the number of games played and the opportunities each kicker had. Conclusion Though Jason Elam enjoyed a longer career and secured more field goals, extra points, and total points than Josh Brown, Brown unmistakably had fewer total yards in his career. This disparity is an outcome of their respective tenures and opportunities in the NFL. It's important to note that both kickers were exceptional in their own right, contributing massively to their respective franchises' success over the years."},{"question":"Given the question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: For some people, music is no fun at all. About 4% of the population is what scientists call \\"amusic\\". People who are amusic are born without the ability to enjoy musical notes. Amusic people often cannot tell the differences between two songs. As a result, songs sound like noise to an amusic. Many amuics compare the sound of music to pieces of metal hitting each other. Life can be hard for amusics. In fact, most people cannot begin to understand what it feels like to be an amusic. Just going to a restaurant or a shopping center can be uncomfortable or even painful. That is why many amusics have to stay away from places where there is music. However, this can result in social loneliness. \\"I used to hate parties,\\" says Margaret, a seventy-year-old woman who only recently discovered that she was amusic. By studying people like Margaret, scientists are finally learning how to identify this unusual condition. Scientists say that the brains of amusics are different from those of people who can enjoy music. The difference is complex , and it is not connected with poor hearing. Amusics can understand other non-musical sounds well. They also have no problems understanding common speech. Scientists compare amusics to people who just can't see certain colors. Many amusics are happy when their condition is finally diagnosed . For years, Margaret felt embarrassed about her problem music. Now she knows that she is not alone.

They harvested berries, made baskets, hunted, and made obsidian arrowheads and spears. Traces of rock art can be seen at Devils Hill, south of South Sister. The first Westerner to discover the Three Sisters was the explorer Peter Skene Ogden of the Hudson Bay Company in 1825. He describes \\"a number of high mountains\\" south of Mount Hood. Ten months later in 1826, the botanist David Douglas reported snow-covered peaks visible from the Willamette Valley. As the Willamette Valley was gradually colonized in the 1840s, Euro-Americans approached the summits from the west and probably named them individually at that time. Explorers, such as Nathaniel Jarvis Wyeth in 1839 and John Frémont in 1843, used the Three Sisters as a landmark from the east. The area was further explored by John Strong Newberry in 1855 as part of the Pacific Railroad Surveys.In 1862, to connect the Willamette Valley to the ranches of Central Oregon and the gold mines of eastern Oregon and Idaho, Felix and Marion Scott traced a route over Scott Pass. This route was known as the Scott Trail, but was superseded in the early 20th century by the McKenzie Pass Road further north. Around 1866, there were reports that one of the Three Sisters emitted some fire and smoke.In the late 19th century, there was extensive wool production in eastern Oregon. Shepherds led their herds of 1,500 to 2,500 sheep to the Three Sisters.

The barn owls comprise two extant sub-families : the Tytoninae or Tyto owls ( including the common barn owl ) and the Phodilinae or bay - owls . The Sibley - Ahlquist taxonomy unites the Caprimulgiformes with the owl order ; here , the barn - owls are a subfamily Tytoninae . This is unsupported by more recent research ( see Cypselomorphae ) , but the relationships of the owls in general are still unresolved . The barn owls are a wide ranging family , although they are absent from northern North America , Saharan Africa and large areas of Asia . They live in a wide range of habitats from deserts to forests , and from temperate latitudes to the tropics . The majority of the 16 living species of barn owls are poorly known . Some , like the red owl , have barely been seen or studied since their discovery , in contrast to the common barn owl , which is one of the best known owl species in the world . However , some sub-species of the common barn owl possibly deserve to be separate species , but are very poorly known . Five species of barn - owl are threatened , and some island species have gone extinct during the Holocene or earlier ( e.g. Tyto pollens , known from the fossil record of Andros Island in the Bahamas , and possibly the basis for the mythical Chickcharnie ) . The barn - owls are mostly nocturnal , and generally non-migratory , living in pairs or singly . - Owls are birds from the order Strigiformes, which includes about 200 species of mostly solitary and nocturnal birds of prey typified by an upright stance, a large, broad head, binocular vision, binaural hearing, sharp talons, and feathers adapted for silent flight. Exceptions include the diurnal northern hawk-owl and the gregarious burrowing owl. - The genus Tyto includes all barn owls (family Tytonidae) except for the bay owls (subfamily Phodilinae, genus \\"Phodilus\\") that is, the true barn owls, the grass owls and the masked owls collectively making up the subfamily Tytoninae. They are darker on the back than the front, usually an orange-brown colour, the front being a paler version of the back or mottled, although there is considerable variation even amongst species. \\"Tyto\\" owls have a divided, heart-shaped facial disc, and lack the ear-like tufts of feathers found in many other owls. \\"Tyto\\" owls tend to be larger than Bay-owls. The name \\"tyto ()\\" is onomatopeic Greek for owl. - The burrowing owl (\\"Athene cunicularia\\") is a small, long-legged owl found throughout open landscapes of North and South America. Burrowing owls can be found in grasslands, rangelands, agricultural areas, deserts, or any other open dry area with low vegetation. They nest and roost in burrows, such as those excavated by prairie dogs (\\"Cynomys\\" spp.). Unlike most owls, burrowing owls are often active during the day, although they tend to avoid the midday heat. Like many other kinds of owls, though, burrowing owls do most of their hunting from dusk until dawn, when they can use their night vision and hearing to their advantage. Living in open grasslands as opposed to forests, the burrowing owl has developed longer legs that enable it to sprint, as well as fly, when hunting. - Hawks are a group of medium-sized diurnal birds of prey of the family Accipitridae which are widely distributed and varying greatly in size.

Among the possible answers, a \\"bridge\\" is the most suitable option for being built on a rock foundation. Here's why: 1. Pillars: While pillars can be built on a foundation of rock, they are not standalone structures, and usually serve to support other structures such as buildings and bridges. 2. Mountains and Mountain Ranges: These are natural land formations and not human-built structures, meaning they don't require a foundation of rock to be built on. They do often consist of rock, but they are not intentionally built on a rock foundation. 3. Surface of Earth: Like mountains, the surface of the Earth is a natural formation that does not require a foundation of rock to be built on. Therefore, a bridge is the correct choice because it is a man-made structure that requires a strong and stable foundation, which can be provided by a rock base. Building a bridge on a foundation of rock ensures stability and durability, as well as a reliable support system for the weight and forces that the bridge must withstand."},{"question":"Question: Title: Simple, Smart and FUN!

Despite facing numerous challenges, he demonstrated unwavering resolve, ambition, and a penchant for paving his way through adversity. In this article, we explore Herman Cain's pain and struggle, both political and personal. We unravel the various controversies that he braved and how his resilience cemented him as a towering figure within the Republican Party. A Self-Made Man: The Early Years Born in Memphis, Tennessee, Herman Cain's early life was anything but devoid of struggle. As the son of a cleaner and a janitor, he witnessed his parents' tireless work ethic and instilled a strong determination within him. Cain attended the prestigious Morehouse College on a scholarship and earned a bachelor's degree in mathematics. He then went on to attain a master's degree in computer science from Purdue University. Armed with his knowledge and determination, Cain quickly rose through the ranks of corporate America, joining various companies such as The Coca-Cola Company and Pillsbury. He later embarked on a successful career as the CEO of Godfather's Pizza, garnering admiration and respect from industry peers. A Foray into Politics: The Struggle Continues Cain's political journey began in earnest when he was appointed to the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City's board of directors. His deep understanding of economic principles and business acumen proved invaluable in addressing pivotal economic issues. In 2000, Cain decided to test the political waters in earnest by vying for the Republican presidential nomination. His first foray into politics was short-lived, as he withdrew his candidacy due to insufficient campaign funding. Despite this initial setback, Herman Cain's taste of politics revealed his interest in public service and set the stage for his subsequent expeditions. In 2012, Herman Cain returned to the political arena, armed with considerably more recognition and support. His trademark \\"9-9-9\\" tax plan, charismatic persona, and enthusiasm for politics quickly made him a formidable contender in the Republican presidential race. However, Cain's journey was laden with obstacles and controversy, culminating in painful yet persistent struggles. Mounting Controversies: A Painful Legacy Relentless controversy plagued Cain's presidential campaign in 2011. Sexual harassment allegations from his tenure as CEO of the National Restaurant Association emerged, casting a dark shadow over his campaign. Amid vehement denial, Cain's polls began to plummet, and his popularity waned. The painful revelation of an alleged extramarital affair dealt a final blow to his candidacy, effectively ending his bid for the presidency. It was undeniably painful for Herman Cain to step away from the race after months of feverish campaigning and hard work. Yet, he chose to walk away with dignity and grace, rather than prolong a political spectacle that would inevitably hurt him and his family further. Standing Tall: Cain's Resilience and Legacy Despite the heartache that accompanied the end of his 2012 presidential bid, Herman Cain continued to play a vital role in American politics. He established himself as an influential media figure by hosting \\"The Herman Cain Show,\\" advocating for conservative values, and launching a successful website and radio program. His innate ability to bounce back from adversity, remain steadfast in his beliefs, and work passionately for America speaks volumes about his character. Conclusion As we reflect on the life of the late Herman Cain, one cannot deny the myriad of painful struggles he endured throughout his career. By overcoming adversity, Cain displayed immense strength and fortitude—qualities that endeared him to many of his supporters. As he fought the battle against stage four colon cancer, Cain's resilience remained unwavering, and his pursuit of improving America's trajectory continued to guide his actions. Though an article cannot fully capture the essence of Herman Cain's journey, it is crucial to acknowledge and appreciate his courage and persistence in the face of numerous hardships. Cain's life story remains an inspiration to those who find themselves surrounded by adversity and reveals the power of resilience that lies within the human spirit."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Q: Water pollution occurs when chemicals, sewage, trash, or heat enter what?

Context: The U.S. has long had the unenviable distinction of holding the world's largest prison population, in part because of tough-on-crime policies enacted in the 1990s. But sentencing reforms passed in recent years appear to have made a dent, leading to declines in the population over the past eight years. A criminal justice reform organization reported Friday that in 2017, the U.S. prison population dropped below 1.5 million for the first time in more than a decade. The decline, according to the Washington-based Vera Institute for Justice, was driven by a sharp decrease in the number of inmates in federal prisons and decreases in several states with large prison populations. Total U.S. prison population dropped to 1,486,000 last year, a decline of nearly 16,000. The number of federal prisoners fell to 183,000, and the number of inmates in state prisons declined to 1.3 million, according to the report. (The overall figure does not include the more than 600,000 defendants held in local, state and federal jails.) The decline extended an eight-year downward trend in U.S. prison population that has been driven by federal and state sentencing reforms enacted over the past decade. But the Vera institute cautioned that it was unclear whether the trend would continue. \\"Whether criminal justice reform can continue to fuel this sustained decline in the prison population remains to be seen,\\" said Jacob Kang-Brown, senior research associate at Vera. \\"We must continue to do the hard work, as advocates and agents of change, to ensure that all our communities feel the relief of decarceration.\\" The report came as President Donald Trump called on Congress to pass legislation to help former inmates reintegrate into society and avoid going back to prison, as many do. \\"We want former inmates to find a path to success so they can support their families and support their communities,\\" Trump said at a White House summit on prison reform attended by two state governors and Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law, who is spearheading...

Washington (CNN) -- Sen. Kay Hagan's campaign said late Wednesday the North Carolina Democrat missed a classified hearing last winter on the threat from the terrorist group ISIS to go to New York to raise money for her re-election. Hagan admitted earlier this week she didn't attend a hearing because she went to the fundraiser but didn't disclose which hearing she missed. Her decision to skip the Armed Services Committee session -- at which high-level administration intelligence officials filled in senators on top secret details about the group -- is drawing fire from her Republican opponent, North Carolina House Speaker Thom Tillis, who is narrowly trailing her in recent polls. But one of the dirty little truths about the way","response":"the Senate operates is that many senators often miss classified hearings or committee meetings due to conflicting priorities, such as raising campaign funds, attending to constituent needs, or participating in other Senate-related responsibilities. While it can be criticized as neglecting their duties, it is an unfortunate reality of the political process. Many senators face these hard decisions when balancing their time between committee work and running a successful re-election campaign. The pressure to raise funds can be immense, as it is often seen as a key predictor of electoral success. However, missing important hearings, especially those related to national security, can negatively impact a senator's public image and give their opponents easy ammunition to attack their credibility. In the case of Sen. Hagan, her choice to attend a fundraiser instead of the classified ISIS hearing has provided her Republican opponent, Thom Tillis, with a talking point to question her commitment to national security and the well-being of her constituents. As the race remains close in the polls, both candidates must weigh their priorities carefully, as any perceived misstep could significantly sway voters. To avoid similar situations in the future, senators should strive to find a better balance between fulfilling their Senate duties and engaging in fundraising activities, or even explore alternative methods of campaign financing. However, as long as the current system emphasizes the importance of fundraising, senators are likely to continue facing these difficult choices and prioritizing their political survival over committee attendance."},{"question":"This task is about translating a given French language sentence to English.

McKinley led the nation to victory in the Spanish-American War, raised protective tariffs to promote American industry, and maintained the nation on the gold standard in a rejection of free silver (effectively, expansionary monetary policy). McKinley was the last president to have served in the American Civil War, and the only one to have started the war as an enlisted soldier, beginning as a private in the Union Army and ending as a brevet major. Context: When the Southern states seceded from the Union and the American Civil War began, thousands of men in Ohio volunteered for service. Among them were McKinley and his cousin William McKinley Osbourne, who enlisted as privates in the newly formed Poland Guards in June 1861. The men left for Columbus where they were consolidated with other small units to form the 23rd Ohio Infantry. The men were unhappy to learn that, unlike Ohio's earlier volunteer regiments, they would not be permitted to elect their officers; they would be designated by Ohio's governor, William Dennison. Dennison appointed Colonel William Rosecrans as the commander of the regiment, and the men began training on the outskirts of Columbus. McKinley quickly took to the soldier's life and wrote a series of letters to his hometown newspaper extolling the army and the Union cause. Delays in issuance of uniforms and weapons again brought the men into conflict with their officers, but Major Rutherford B. Hayes convinced them to accept what the government had issued them; his style in dealing with the men impressed McKinley, beginning an association and friendship that would last until Hayes' death in 1893. After a month of training, McKinley and the 23rd Ohio, now led by Colonel Eliakim P. Scammon, set out for western Virginia (today part of West Virginia) in July 1861 as a part of the Kanawha Division. McKinley initially thought Scammon was a martinet, but when the regiment finally saw battle, he came to appreciate the value of their relentless drilling. Their first contact with the enemy came in September when they drove back Confederate troops at Carnifex Ferry in present-day West Virginia. Three days after the battle, McKinley was assigned to duty in the brigade quartermaster office, where he worked both to supply his regiment, and as a clerk. In November, the regiment established winter quarters near Fayetteville (today in West Virginia). McKinley spent the winter substituting for a commissary sergeant who was ill, and in April 1862 he was promoted to that rank. The regiment resumed its advance that spring with Hayes in command (Scammon by then led the brigade) and fought several minor engagements against the rebel forces. That September, McKinley's regiment was called east to reinforce General John Pope's Army of Virginia at the Second Battle of Bull Run. Delayed in passing through Washington, D.C., the 23rd Ohio did not arrive in time for the battle, but joined the Army of the Potomac as it hurried north to cut off Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia as it advanced into Maryland. The 23rd was the first regiment to encounter the Confederates at the Battle of South Mountain on September 14. After severe losses, Union forces drove back the Confederates and continued to Sharpsburg, Maryland, where they engaged Lee's army at the Battle of Antietam, one of the bloodiest battles of the war. The 23rd was also in the thick of the fighting at Antietam, and McKinley himself came under heavy fire when bringing rations to the men on the line. McKinley's regiment again suffered many casualties, but the Army of the Potomac was victorious and the Confederates retreated into Virginia. The regiment was then detached from the Army of the Potomac and returned by train to western Virginia. Question: What happened to McKinley in Western Virginia. Whats the answer?","response":"In Western Virginia, McKinley and the 23rd Ohio Infantry were part of the Kanawha Division. They participated in several engagements against Confederate forces.

The Vice President was logged calling the President at 10:18 for a twominute conversation that obtained the confirmation. On Air Force One, the President's press secretary was taking notes; Ari Fleischer recorded that at 10:20, the President told him that he had authorized a shootdown of aircraft if necessary. Minutes went by and word arrived of an aircraft down in Pennsylvania. Those in the shelter wondered if the aircraft had been shot down pursuant to this authorization. At approximately 10:30, the shelter started receiving reports of another hijacked plane, this time only 5 to 10 miles out. Believing they had only a minute or two, the Vice President again communicated the authorization to \\"engage or \\"take out\\" the aircraft.

A: Choose your answer from: [i] Pond; [ii] Lake; [iii] Lagoon; [iv] resevoirs; Answer:","response":"A man-made lake is commonly referred to as a reservoir. So, the answer is [iv] reservoirs. Reservoirs serve multiple purposes and can significantly contribute to water resources management, flood control, power generation, recreation, and environmental protection. They are typically created by constructing a dam across a river or stream, which in turn causes the water to back up behind the structure and form a lake. These lakes can vary in size, depending on the intended use of the reservoir and the surrounding landscape. Functionally, reservoirs can be classified into various types, such as storage reservoirs, balancing reservoirs, and service reservoirs. Storage reservoirs primarily manage water supply and maintain water level over a period of time to ensure the availability of water during dry seasons or droughts. Balancing reservoirs are created to manage fluctuations in water flow and demand, such as the daily or seasonal variations in water supply and consumption. Service reservoirs, on the other hand, are smaller reservoirs located near the point of water consumption, often within urban areas, and help maintain water pressure in distribution systems and allow for regular maintenance of the water supply infrastructure. Reservoirs can also be categorized by their method of water impoundment, such as embankment dams, gravity dams, or arch dams. Each type has specific design and structural characteristics, depending on factors such as the volume of water to be stored, the underlying geology of the area, and the surrounding environment. Man-made lakes can also serve as recreational areas, offering opportunities for boating, fishing, and swimming, as well as providing habitat for a diverse range of flora and fauna. Wildlife conservation and ecological enhancement are important aspects to consider during the planning and management of reservoirs. However, it's essential to acknowledge that the construction of reservoirs can have both positive and negative consequences. While they provide valuable resources and services, such as water and power supply or flood control, they can also lead to the displacement of communities and the loss of cultural, historical, or archaeological sites, as well as changes in habitat and biodiversity. Therefore, a multi-disciplinary approach should be adopted when planning and constructing reservoirs to ensure a balance between human needs and environmental sustainability."},{"question":"Summarize this article in one sentence.

Question 2: Why are people in a rush to lose their virginity? Choose your answer from: (A). no. (B). yes. Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","response":"Question 1: Wild grass snakes, scientifically known as Natrix natrix, primarily eat amphibians such as frogs, toads, and newts. They may also occasionally consume smaller mammals and fish. These snakes are non-venomous and mainly rely on their strong muscles to constrict and subdue their prey. They are highly skilled hunters usually found near bodies of water. When hunting for food, grass snakes utilize their keen sense of smell and vision to detect potential prey. Their forked tongues are essential for picking up scent particles, allowing them to follow trails. Once they have identified a target, grass snakes will try to ambush their prey, striking quickly to catch it off guard. They then wrap their muscular bodies around the prey, using constriction to immobilize and kill it before swallowing it whole, starting with the head. Question 2: There could be several reasons why some people are in a rush to lose their virginity. Societal and cultural pressure, peer influence, and personal beliefs may all contribute to this sense of urgency. 1. Societal and cultural pressure: Society and media often portray the loss of virginity as a rite of passage, which may lead some individuals to associate their self-worth with their sexual experience. Losing one's virginity can be seen as a symbol of adulthood or maturity, creating pressure to conform to these expectations. 2. Peer influence: Individuals surrounded by friends or acquaintances who frequently discuss their sexual experiences may feel left out, leading to a desire to fit in and belong. The pressure to 'catch up' with peers can result in individuals rushing to lose their virginity. 3. Personal beliefs and desires: Some people may view losing their virginity as an essential milestone in their lives, driven by their own beliefs and desires. For instance, they might feel that having sexual experience is important for attracting partners or enhancing relationships. To answer your third question, the answer to both questions would not be the same, as they do not fall under the binary options (A) and (B) provided.

The European Economic Community, also known as the Common Market, was created with the intention of fostering economic cooperation among its member nations. It was established by the Treaty of Rome on March 25, 1957, and comprised six founding member states: Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and West Germany. Luxembourg, a small landlocked country in western Europe, has played a crucial role in European economics and politics since the inception of the EEC. It boasts a strong and diversified economy, with key sectors including finance, steel, chemicals, and information technology. Luxembourg has developed a reputation as an essential hub for international financial services and investment funds. Its capital, Luxembourg City, is home to the European Court of Justice, the European Investment Bank, and other essential EU institutions. The EEC aimed to encourage trade, eliminate tariff barriers, create a common market, and enhance economic integration among its member countries. This goal was accomplished through various policies, such as harmonization of legislation, economic policies, and the establishment of institutions like the European Commission and the Council of Ministers. The EEC transitioned into the European Union (EU) with the signing of the Maastricht Treaty (also known as the Treaty on European Union) on November 1, 1993. This marked the beginning of increased political and social integration, culminating in the adoption of a single currency, the Euro, and the implementation of additional freedoms and rights for EU citizens.

Q: Brian Cohen is born in a stable next door to the one in which Jesus is born, which initially confuses the three wise men who come to praise the future King of the Jews. Brian grows up an idealistic young man who resents the continuing Roman occupation of Judea. While attending Jesus' Sermon on the Mount, Brian becomes infatuated with an attractive young rebel, Judith. His desire for her and hatred for the Romans lead him to join the \\"People's Front of Judea\\", one of many fractious and bickering independence movements, who spend more time fighting each other than the Romans. After several misadventures, and escaping from Pontius Pilate, Brian winds up in a line-up of would-be mystics and prophets who harangue the passing crowd in a plaza. Forced to come up with something plausible in order to blend in and keep the guards off his back, Brian repeats some of what he had heard Jesus say, and quickly attracts a small but intrigued audience. Once the guards have left, Brian tries to put the episode behind him, but he has unintentionally inspired a movement. He grows frantic when he finds that some people have started to follow him around, with even the slightest unusual occurrence being hailed as a miracle. Each of their responses ever growing in fervor and intensity making it harder and harder for him to get away from them. Yet because of the mob's excitement, they end up leaving Brian alone. After which he sees Judith is one who didn't leave, and they then spend the night together. In the morning, Brian, completely naked, opens the curtains to discover an enormous crowd outside his mother's house who proclaim him to be the Messiah. Brian's mother protests, \\"He's not the Messiah, he's a very naughty boy.\\"; and, \\"There's no Messiah in here. There's a mess all right, but no Messiah.\\" Yet all of her attempts at dispersing the crowd are rebuffed. Furthermore, once Brian addresses them, he also finds that he is unable to change their minds. His followers are completely committed to their beliefs in and of Brian's divinity. They immediately seize upon everything he says and does as points of doctrine. The hapless Brian finds no solace as people have even mobbed his mother's house. They fling their afflicted bodies at him demanding miracle cures and divine secrets. After sneaking out the back, Brian is then finally captured and scheduled to be crucified. Meanwhile, a huge crowd has assembled outside the palace. Pilate (together with the visiting Biggus Dickus) tries to quell the feeling of revolution by granting them the choice of one person to be pardoned. The crowd, however, shouts out names containing the letter \\"r\\", mocking Pilate's rhotacistic speech impediment. Eventually, Judith appears in the crowd and calls for the release of Brian, which the crowd echoes since the name also contains an \\"r\\". Pilate agrees to \\"welease Bwian\\". His order is eventually relayed to the guards, but in a scene that parodies the climax of the film Spartacus, various crucified people all claim to be \\"Brian of Nazareth\\" and the wrong man is released. Various other opportunities for a reprieve for Brian are denied as, one by one, his \\"allies\\" (including Judith and his mother) step forward to explain why they are leaving the \\"noble freedom fighter\\" hanging in the hot sun. Hope is renewed when a crack suicide squad from the \\"Judean People's Front\\" (not to be confused with the People's Front of Judea) come charging towards the Romans, but rather than fighting to release Brian or the other prisoners, they commit mass suicide as a political protest.

Adding punctuation to your text allows for better comprehension by the reader, reduces ambiguity, and showcases your grasp of the language. The following steps will help you to add punctuation to your text effectively: 1. Read the text carefully: Begin by reading the entire text thoroughly, ensuring that you comprehend its meaning and context. This will be helpful in identifying appropriate places within the text to add punctuation marks. 2. Analyze the structure: Assess the structure of the text and identify distinct sentences, phrases, and clauses. Punctuation marks will be required to separate these elements and provide coherence to your text. 3. Use full stops: Introduce full stops (.) at the end of individual sentences to indicate completion of thoughts or actions. This helps to avoid run-on sentences and makes the text easier to read and understand. 4. Add commas: Utilize commas (,) to separate items in a list, to separate independent clauses joined by coordinating conjunctions, and to set off non-restrictive clauses, parenthetical expressions, and appositives. This allows the reader to differentiate the various elements and ideas in a sentence clearly. 5. Employ colons and semicolons: Use colons (:) to introduce a list, a quotation, or an explanation. Semicolons (;) are used to link closely related independent clauses or to separate items in a list that contain commas. These punctuation marks help provide a clearer structure and transition between related ideas. 6. Use quotation marks: Apply quotation marks (“ ”) to signify direct quotations or to indicate specific terms and phrases that are borrowed, ironic, or used in an unusual way. Make sure to include the appropriate punctuation within the quotation marks as required. 7. Insert parentheses or dashes: Include parentheses ( ) to set off supplementary or explanatory information that is not essential to understanding the main text, or dashes (—) to emphasize an important point, provide a contrast, or insert additional information for the reader. 8. Implement question and exclamation marks: Insert question marks (?) at the end of any interrogative sentences, and exclamation marks (!) to indicate strong feelings or emotions, or to emphasize a point. 9. Capitalize the first word in a sentence: Remember to capitalize the first word in each sentence to signal the beginning of a thought or statement. 10. Proofread: After adding punctuation marks to your text, read through it again to ensure that all marks have been placed correctly, and that the text is coherent and free of errors. By following these steps, you can effectively incorporate punctuation to your text, enhancing its readability, clarity, and overall presentation.

My thoughts:","response":"Sweat cools the body when it (H) turns into a gas. Sweating is a natural process that helps regulate body temperature. When our body starts to heat up due to exercise, hot environmental conditions, or other factors, sweat glands in the skin produce sweat. Sweat is primarily composed of water, with small amounts of salt, minerals, and other substances. The cooling effect occurs when the sweat on the skin's surface evaporates. As the sweat turns from liquid to gas, it absorbs heat from the body, which then dissipates into the surrounding environment. This evaporative cooling process helps to reduce the body's temperature back to its normal range, thus maintaining a stable internal environment. For this process to be most effective, the surrounding conditions should have a relatively low humidity level, as drier air allows for faster evaporation of sweat. So, while factors like (A) movement of an air mass and (B) dry conditions can enhance the efficiency of this cooling process, it is ultimately the evaporation of sweat - or turning into a gas - that provides the cooling effect on the body."},{"question":"Denny asked: Test for natural language inference.

However, the user has not provided any additional context or information, such as how well the overall product performs, if they have encountered any other issues, or any positive aspects about the product or service. This makes it difficult to give a more comprehensive rating, as it only represents one aspect of the user's experience. 3. The user offers a request for a solution, which indicates that although they have a problem with the product, they're willing to receive help and potentially continue using the product. This suggests that the user's experience might not be entirely negative, and they may find some value in the product or service. 4. Considering these factors, a 2-star (★★) rating seems appropriate.

The language used in the tweet is quite neutral; both \\"night time\\" and \\"later\\" are simple words that do not actively convey a strong emotional tone. However, the tone can be derived from the punctuation, primarily the full stop (period) after \\"night time\\" and the exclamation mark after \\"later.\\" The period suggests a matter-of-factly statement, while the exclamation mark implies a level of energy or enthusiasm. Considering this, we can deduce that the sentiment of this tweet is likely positive. The user may be excited about the nighttime, which could be associated with relaxation or the end of a busy day. Additionally, the exclamation mark after \\"later\\" gives off a vibe of cheerful farewell.

For his work as an actor, Phoenix has received a Grammy Award, a Golden Globe Award, and has three Academy Award and British Academy Film Award nominations. Phoenix started acting in television shows with his brother River Phoenix and sister Summer Phoenix. During the comeback portion of his career, Phoenix went back to his given name Joaquin and was often cast in supporting roles as conflicted, insecure characters with a dark side. In 1995, he co-starred in To Die For, as the disturbed young man Jimmy who gets seduced by Suzanne Stone (Nicole Kidman) to commit murder. Directed by Gus Van Sant, the film was screened out of competition at the 1995 Cannes Film Festival and became a financial and critical success, resulting in a domestic box office total of 21 million. New York Times critic Janet Maslin praised Phoenix's performance, writing \\"So pity poor Jimmy. Rivetingly played by Mr. Phoenix with a raw, anguished expressiveness that makes him an actor to watch for, Jimmy is both tempted and terrified by Suzanne's slick amorality. In that, he speaks for us all.\\" In 1997, Phoenix played a small-town troublemaker in Oliver Stone's U Turn, and a poor man in love with a rich woman in Inventing the Abbotts. The films were received with mostly mixed and negative reviews, respectively, and neither performed well at the box office. The following year, Phoenix starred in Clay Pigeons (1998) as a young man in a small town who befriends a serial killer. Budgeted at 8 million, the film became a box office flop, grossing only 1 million and was, like Phoenix's previous projects, not well received by critics. In his next film, 8mm (1999), Phoenix co-starred as an adult video store employee who helps Tom Welles (Nicolas Cage) penetrate the underworld of illegal pornography. The film turned out be a box office success, grossing 96 million worldwide, but found few admirers among critics. In 2006, Phoenix was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. In 2007, Phoenix reunited with director James Gray for the film We Own the Night, which he also produced. In the film, Phoenix played a New York nightclub manager who tries to save his brother and father from Russian mafia hit men. The film premiered at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival, receiving mixed reviews from critics and grossed a total of 54.5 million worldwide. Critic Peter Travers described Phoenix as \\"electrifying and then some\\", and he was awarded the People's Choice Award for Favorite Leading Man for the performance. For his second film of 2007, Phoenix also reunited with director Terry George for the film Reservation Road. In it, Phoenix played a father obsessed with finding out who killed his son in a hit-and-run accident. The film failed at the box office and received negative reviews from critics, with film critic Peter Travers writing \\"Even the best actors -- and I'd rank Joaquin Phoenix and Mark Ruffalo among their generation's finest -- can't save a movie that aims for tragedy but stalls at soap opera.\\" Phoenix made his third collaboration with director James Gray in the film Two Lovers (2008), where he played a bachelor torn between the family friend his parents wish he would marry and his beautiful but volatile new neighbor. Two Lovers premiered in competition at the 2008 Cannes Film Festival in May, receiving largely positive reviews, especially Phoenix who was praised by film critics David Edelstein who wrote \\"He [Phoenix] is, once again, stupendous, and stupendous in a way he has never been before\\" and Roger Ebert describing his performance as \\"perfect pitch\\". Two Lovers grossed 16 million worldwide. Phoenix's mockumentary film I'm Still Here (2010) premiered at the 67th Venice International Film Festival on September 6, 2010. The film was directed by Phoenix's then brother-in-law Casey Affleck and was also written by Affleck and Phoenix himself. The film purports to follow the life of Phoenix, from the announcement of his retirement from acting, through his transition into a career as a hip hop artist. Filming officially began on January 16, 2009 at a Las Vegas nightclub. Throughout the filming period, Phoenix remained in character for public appearances, giving many the impression that he was genuinely pursuing a new career. Although widely suspected to be a \\"mockumentary,\\" the fact that the events of the film had been deliberately staged was not disclosed until after the film had been released. The film received mixed reviews and failed at the box office. After the releasing of the film, Phoenix took a self-imposed break from acting. Since 2006, he has been living on top of the Hollywood Hills. In early April 2005, Phoenix checked into rehab to be treated for alcoholism. On January 26, 2006, while driving down a winding canyon road in Hollywood, Phoenix ran off the road and rolled his car. The crash was reportedly caused by brake failure. Shaken and confused, Phoenix heard a tapping on his window and a voice say, \\"Just relax.\\" Unable to see the man, Phoenix replied, \\"I'm fine. I am relaxed.\\" The man replied, \\"No, you're not,\\" and stopped Phoenix from lighting a cigarette while gasoline was leaking into the car cabin. Phoenix then realized that the man was famed German film director Werner Herzog. While Herzog helped Phoenix out of the wreckage by breaking the back window of the car, bystanders phoned for an ambulance. Phoenix approached Herzog to express gratitude, but Herzog downplayed his heroism and returned to his home nearby. Phoenix unexpectedly announced in late 2008 that he had retired from acting to pursue a rapping career, and that the forthcoming Two Lovers would be his last film. On February 11, 2009, Phoenix appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman to promote Two Lovers. He seemed incoherent and was largely unresponsive towards David Letterman's questions about the film and his career plans. Phoenix appeared on Late Show again on September 22, 2010, and revealed that his \\"retirement\\" and eccentric behavior were for a mockumentary, I'm Still Here (2010), that he and Casey Affleck were filming. In October 2012, Phoenix proclaimed the Academy Awards to be \\"bullshit\\". He later gave an interview amending his earlier comments and acknowledging that the Oscars provide an important platform for many deserving filmmakers. He added more to the topic while on Jimmy Kimmel Live in 2015, saying that he is uncomfortable receiving accolades for his work in films when he considers the filmmaking process to be a collaborative one.

The Lied is a musical genre that emerged in the late 18th and early 19th centuries in what is now considered the Romantic era of classical music. Its development was inspired by the convergence of poetry and music, as well as a blossoming interest in the expression of individual emotions, personal experiences, and introspection. As a musical form, the Lied typically consists of a German poem set to music for solo voice, usually accompanied by a piano. In some cases, other instrumental accompaniments or small ensembles can be utilized. One of the key features of the Lied is its focus on the narrative or emotional content of the poem, with the music composed to reflect, enhance, and sometimes even transcend the textual meaning. The emergence of the Lied as a popular genre can be attributed to composers such as Franz Schubert and Robert Schumann, who were among the first to delve into this expressive musical form. Schubert, in particular, is considered the pioneer of the Lied, having composed over 600 songs in this style throughout his career. His most famous works in this genre include the song cycles \\"Die schöne Müllerin\\" and \\"Winterreise.\\" Subsequent composers, such as Johannes Brahms, Hugo Wolf, and Richard Strauss, continued to develop and elevate the Lied to new artistic heights. These composers, along with their predecessors, skillfully explored the depth of human emotions, the beauty of nature, and the intricacies of personal relationships through their Lieder. Furthermore, they integrated diverse musical elements, such as advanced harmony, melody, rhythm, and form, to better serve the expressive requirements of the text. As the genre evolved, composers began to experiment with the thematic content and musical structure of the Lied to create more sophisticated and multi-layered pieces. Some Lieder became highly complex, with intricate piano accompaniments and virtuosic vocal lines, while others remained simple and intimate. This diversity and adaptability of the Lied as a genre allowed it to maintain its relevance throughout the Romantic period and beyond, as it continued to be explored by composers of various nationalities and stylistic tendencies. In conclusion, the standard German term for the art song is \\"Lied,\\" a genre that emerged in the Romantic era as a result of the blending of poetry and music. It has played a significant role in the evolution of classical music and continues to be an essential part of the solo vocal repertoire, thanks to the groundbreaking works by composers like Franz Schubert, Robert Schumann, Johannes Brahms, Hugo Wolf, and Richard Strauss."},{"question":"Denny asked: Test for natural language inference.

Operating system: Android 4.2 Jelly Bean. Colours: Deep Blue and Pearl White. Both the Galaxy Core and the Galaxy Core Plus have 4.3-inch displays. The Core Advance is due to launch 'early next year' but Samsung has not yet announced pricing or carrier information. However, based on its specifications and the prices of the Core in the UK, the Core Advance is expected to retail at between £150 and £170. By comparison, the high-end Samsung Galaxy S4 costs around £350. The Core Advance will also need to stay around this price point to rival the £135 Moto G unveiled last month. Samsung's Galaxy Core Advance weighs 145g - the original Core is 124g - and has a 2,000 mAh battery, compared to the Core's 1,800 mAH. The Galaxy Core Advance, pictured, is a marginally improved version of the Galaxy Core, which the Korean firm launched in June. It has a larger 4.7-inch display and improved battery, but the operating system, built-in storage and cameras are the same. The Galaxy Core costs around £150. The Core Advance additionally has two extra keys on the front of the device, pictured, for 'users who are less comfortable with a touchscreen experience' They both run Android Jelly Bean, both have 1.2 GHz processors and both feature 5MP rear-facing cameras. In addition, both handsets have VGA front-facing cameras, which means the quality of the camera is less than 1MP. The Core Advance does have two extra physical keys on the front of the device for ‘users who are less comfortable with a touchscreen experience’, according to Samsung’s official release. Elsewhere, it comes with a range of built-in apps and features including S Translator, Sound and Shot, which lets users add sounds to photos, and Group Play, that lets users stream music across multiple devices. The Core Advance will be available in Deep Blue and Pearl White. By comparison, the Moto G screen has 4.5-inch display and comes in 8GB and 16GB models. It has a 5MP rear-facing camera and a 1.3MP camera on the front of the device. The handset is available in seven different colours, including red, pink, yellow and blue, and the colourful cases are interchangeable.","response":"1.

Answer:","response":"The last step of the process is to convert the glucose into usable energy for the plant's growth and maintenance. Step-by-step justification: 1. The steps provided describe the process of photosynthesis, which is how plants convert light energy into chemical energy to fuel their growth and maintenance. 2. In the provided steps, glucose has been synthesized by combining hydrogen and carbon dioxide, but has not yet been used by the plant. 3. In order to utilize the glucose, the plant must break it down through cellular respiration. 4. During cellular respiration, glucose is broken down into simpler molecules, releasing chemical energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). 5. ATP is then used by the plant's cells to power various cellular processes, facilitating the plant's growth, maintenance, and reproduction. Thus, the last step is converting the glucose into usable energy for the plant through the process of cellular respiration."},{"question":"Premise: \\"A skier poses for a picture on top of a mountain.\\" Hypothesis: \\"A skier is having a picture taken.\\" Do we know that the hypothesis entailed by the premise? Stream of thoughts:","response":"We can analyze the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis by breaking it down step by step. 1. The premise states that \\"a skier poses for a picture on top of a mountain.\\" This gives us information that there is a skier involved, they are posing for a picture, and they are at the top of a mountain. 2. The hypothesis suggests that \\"a skier is having a picture taken.\\" This information is related to the skier and the action of having a picture taken. 3. Now, we can compare the two statements to see if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. In the premise, the skier is posing for a picture, which implies that they are preparing themselves to be photographed. In the hypothesis, the skier is having a picture taken, which is the actual act of being photographed. 4. Based on the information provided, it can be concluded that the hypothesis is indeed entailed by the premise because both involve a skier being photographed. The premise sets the scene for the skier posing, which is a precursor to having a picture taken, as stated in the hypothesis. Therefore, we can reasonably infer that if a skier is posing for a picture on top of a mountain, then the skier is having a picture taken."},{"question":"The music of the wind rises the performance of a windmill to poetry Could you correct the punctuation please?","response":"\\"The music of the wind rises; the performance of a windmill turns to poetry.\\" In this corrected version of the sentence, a semicolon is used to separate the two closely related independent clauses. The first clause discusses the rising music of the wind, while the second emphasizes how the windmill's performance is transformed into poetry.

Say 'yes' if the claim is true otherwise say 'no' Input: CLAIM : The following post is HISTORICAL. POST : Many years ago I was a drug addict. I ended up homeless, penniless and majorly depressed. My older sister, Jane, told me to figure my life out and hung up on me. My oldest sister, Ann, drove down to pick me up and she gave me a place to stay. I think she saved my life that day. I ended up staying with her rent free for 2 years. During that time she also helped me in my personal life, kept me away from my abusive ex and addicted friends, found me a full time job and straightened out my life. I owe her so much. I'm thankful for all she did for me and that she didn't give up on me that day. It's been a few years since I moved out but we're still very close now. ​ When Ann got married I threw myself into the wedding planning. I wanted to repay her kindness for me. I bought and decorated her wedding shoes, sewed her daughter's dress for the wedding, baked her wedding cake, cupcakes and eclairs for her guests. I also DIYed her centerpieces for the tables. I was very involved in her wedding. Now Jane is getting married and she expected me to be as involved in her wedding as I was with Ann, but I'm not. I'm tired from working and I just don't want to bake a cake and other desserts for 70+ guests again. I told her she could reuse the centerpieces for her wedding but she wants completely new ones even though I kept them in really good condition. When Jane found out that I'm not keen on baking or crafting new center pieces for her wedding she complained that I was being unfair and showing favoritism. She tried begging but I continued to decline and said the reason I helped Ann with her wedding so much was to repay her kindness during the time I was homeless. Now Jane thinks I'm punishing her because she didn't help me out when I was homeless. That's not true. We buried the hatchet and forgave each other a long time ago.

I have a good memory of my grandfather,Jack. He was sitting in his armchair in the front room. I sat next to him. We were reading aloud,our heads bent over the page in front of us,a finger marking the words;separated by seven decades,brought together by words. It's a common scene in British families;however,in our case,the usual order of things is reversed .Granddad had been blind since I was tiny,so I was reading to him.When reading aloud,people usually read something that's of interest to the listener. So I didn't read children's books;I read the sorts of things Granddad liked to hear about. Much of the vocabulary in Granddad's reading material was far beyond me. When I met unfamiliar words,I'd spell them out. Granddad would help me. It must have been painful for him to hear news;but he never hurried me along or complained. Our reading wasn't really about getting knowledge. It was a way for us to spend time together. My grandfather wasn't always blind. He had been a good carpenter .The first Christmas of my parents' marriage,he built my mother a bookcase,which now belongs to my son Jonah,providing a link between four generations. I was a fortunate child;I spent a lot of time with my grandfather,and he opened the world to me in a particular way. Reading was our way of building a relationship that has had a lasting effect on me. In the school holidays,I sometimes accompanied him on trips to the seaside with the local association for the blind. This might seem strange,but I felt that my personal value was realized because I could finally do something for Granddad. A decade later,I found a position in a nursing home,which reminded me of my early experiences;reading to senior citizens was a connection back to Granddad. More than simple conversation,reading aloud is a connection between two individuals and it can have a big emotional effect on elderly people. 1. Could the author's grandfather see? 2.

Jonny Kennedy was and is still is a tragically beautiful inspiration. Not only was he a survivor of one of the most painful diseases out there, but he used his beauty to show the world that there is life after death and never to give up reaching people and spreading his love. Watching minutes of his life long struggle was heart-wrenching. Listening to his smart ass remarks and seeing his adorable gestures was heartwarming. And seeing him smile was indescribable. I feel blessed to have been able to be touched by this tiny giant. Please, if you ever have a chance to watch this film - consider yourself lucky to have met Jonny Kennedy. Did this review think positively or negatively of the movie (see options below)? Select from: 1). negative 2). positive...I think the answer is","response":"2). positive This review talks about the movie in a very nice way. The person who wrote it thinks that Jonny Kennedy's story is very special and inspiring. They also think that watching the documentary made them feel lucky to learn about his life. So, the review is positive because it says good things about the movie."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Given the below context: By the time of the third plate, Tom Nero has progressed from the mistreatment of animals to theft and murder. Having encouraged his pregnant lover, Ann Gill, to rob and leave her mistress, he murders the girl when she meets him. The murder is shown to be particularly brutal: her neck, wrist, and index finger are almost severed. Her trinket box and the goods she had stolen lie on the ground beside her, and the index finger of her partially severed hand points to the words \\"God's Revenge against Murder\\" written on a book that, along with the Book of Common Prayer, has fallen from the box. A woman searching Nero's pockets uncovers pistols, a number of pocket watches—evidence of his having turned to highway robbery (as Tom Idle did in Industry and Idleness), and a letter from Ann Gill which reads: Dear TommyMy mistress has been the best of women to me, and my conscience flies in my face as often as I think of wronging her; yet I am resolved to venture body and soul to do as you would have me, so do not fail to meet me as you said you would, for I will bring along with me all the things I can lay my hands on. So no more at present; but I remain yours till death. Ann Gill. The spelling is perfect and while this is perhaps unrealistic, Hogarth deliberately avoids any chance of the scene becoming comical. A discarded envelope is addressed \\"To Thos Nero at Pinne...\\". Ronald Paulson sees a parallel between the lamb beaten to death in the Second Stage and the defenceless girl murdered here. Below the print, the text claims that Nero, if not repentant, is at least stunned by his actions: Various features in the print are meant to intensify the feelings of dread: the murder takes place in a graveyard, said to be St Pancras but suggested by John Ireland to resemble Marylebone; an owl and a bat fly around the scene; the moon shines down on the crime; the clock strikes one for the end of the witching hour. The composition of the image may allude to Anthony van Dyck's The Arrest of Christ. A lone Good Samaritan appears... Guess a valid title for it! Answer:","response":"\\"The Downward Spiral of Tom Nero: Crime and Consequences\\""},{"question":"Come up with a question and stream of consciousness reasoning that would justify this answer: no","response":"Question: Is it safe to leave a toddler unattended near a swimming pool? Stream of consciousness reasoning: When considering the safety of leaving a toddler unattended near a swimming pool, one must take into account the numerous potential dangers that surround such a scenario. Firstly, toddlers are often curious and impulsive, with little to no understanding of the hazards of water. Without proper supervision, a child could easily enter the pool and potentially be at risk for drowning. Additionally, there might be other hazards around the pool area, such as slippery surfaces, sharp edges, or cleaning chemicals that, if ingested, could lead to injury or poisoning. A child's cognitive abilities and physical coordination are not yet fully developed at this age, making the risk of accidents significantly higher. Furthermore, children at this age tend to have difficulty assessing risks and foreseeing the consequences of their actions. This lack of knowledge, combined with their innate curiosity, might lead them in harm's way without them realizing it. Lastly, it's important to consider potential legal ramifications if a child were to be injured or worse in an unsupervised pool setting. Depending on local regulations and laws, leaving a child unattended could be considered negligence and create liability for the caregiver or parent, resulting in serious consequences. After considering the multiple hazards, a child's underdeveloped cognitive and physical abilities, and legal implications, it is clear that the answer to whether it's safe to leave a toddler unattended near a swimming pool is a resounding no."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Process: - Plants start growing on or near the rocks - The roots of the growing plants start to break up the rock - The plant acids dissolve the rock - The rock is broken down into smaller pieces - Erosion begins.

Answer:","response":"The perturbation hypothesis suggests that a person breathing evenly occurs during the process. This action is unrelated and not directly connected to the process of plants growing on rocks and breaking them down.

The album was recorded in Los Angeles, California with Reign in Blood producer Rick Rubin. PopMatters reviewer Adrien Begrand observed that Rubin's production \\"shoves [Dave] Lombardo's drumming right up front in the mix\\". Guitarist Jeff Hanneman has since said that South of Heaven was the only album the band members discussed before writing the music. Aware that they \\"couldn't top Reign in Blood\\", and that whatever they recorded would be \\"compared to that album\\", he believed they \\"had to slow down\\", something Slayer had never done on albums before, or since. Guitarist Kerry King cited the need to \\"keep people guessing\\" as another reason for the musical shift. \\"In order to contrast the aggressive assault put forth on Reign in Blood, Slayer consciously slowed down the tempo of the album as a whole\\", according to Slayer's official biography. \\"They also added elements like undistorted guitars and toned-down vocal styles not heard on previous albums.\\"King has since been critical of his performance, which he describes as his \\"most lackluster\\". King attributes this to the fact he had recently married, and moved to Phoenix, Arizona. Describing himself as \\"probably the odd man out at that point\\", he stated he \\"didn't participate as much because of that\\". Hanneman said: \\"We go through dry spells sometimes, but the good thing about having two guitar players that can write music is that you are never gonna go without. I guess at that time, Kerry was hitting a dry spell.\\" King has also been critical of the album in general, describing it as one of his least favorite Slayer albums. He feels vocalist Tom Araya moved too far away from his regular vocal style, and \\"added too much singing\\". Drummer Dave Lombardo has since observed: \\"There was fire on all the records, but it started dimming when South of Heaven came into the picture. And that's me personally.

There are several indicators within the text that suggest the reviewer's dissatisfaction with the film. Firstly, the use of the term \\"sour attempt\\" implies that the movie failed to achieve its intended purpose or goal. A \\"sour\\" experience generally refers to something unpleasant, distasteful, or unsatisfactory. By calling the movie a \\"sour attempt,\\" the reviewer is suggesting that it did not manage to effectively capture the comedy style it was aiming for, leaving viewers unimpressed or even annoyed. Additionally, the phrase \\"Farrelly Brothers-style\\" refers to the specific comedy style popularized by the Farrelly Brothers, known for their raunchy and often politically incorrect content in films like \\"There's Something About Mary\\" and \\"Dumb and Dumber.\\" The reviewer's mention of this style suggests that the movie was attempting to create a similarly humorous experience for its female viewers, but ultimately fell short. The term \\"down-and-dirty laugher\\" also signals that the movie was meant to employ crude humor to elicit laughter from the audience. However, given the negative tone of the review, it seems that the movie failed to deliver the desired laughs. Lastly, the reviewer's comment \\"for the female set\\" likely means that the movie was targeting a female audience, hoping to appeal to them with the specific brand of humor it used. However, the overall negative tone of the review implies that the film was unable to effectively cater to its target audience. In summary, the review has a negative opinion of the movie, as the reviewer believes that it was an unsuccessful attempt at creating a Farrelly Brothers-style comedy for a female audience."},{"question":"Ask a question about Sanskrit.","response":"What is the significance of Sanskrit in the development of Indian philosophy, language, and literature? Sanskrit has played a vital role in the development of Indian philosophy, language, and literature. As an ancient Indo-Aryan language, Sanskrit can be traced back to the second millennium BCE and has been the primary language of the intellectual and spiritual discourse in India for thousands of years. Its significance can be observed in various aspects of Indian culture, including religion, art, sciences, and social life. 1. Influence on Indian Philosophy: Sanskrit has been the language of many key philosophical texts in India, with a wide range of topics covered such as metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, and logic. The Vedas, Upanishads, the Brahmanas, and the Aranyakas are written in Sanskrit, forming the basis for various schools of Hinduism, such as Vedanta, Yoga, Nyaya, Mimamsa, and Sankhya. Additionally, the Sanskrit language was crucial in the development of other religious texts like the Jaina Agamas for Jainism and the Buddhist sutras for Buddhism. Philosophers like Adi Shankaracharya, Ramanuja, Nagarjuna, and Vasubandhu, to name a few, have written significant works in Sanskrit, shaping the course of Indian philosophical thought. 2. Development of Indian Languages: Sanskrit has heavily influenced the formation and evolution of many modern Indian languages, particularly those from the Indo-Aryan language family, such as Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Gujarati, and manyothers. These languages have borrowed vocabulary, grammatical rules, and even writing systems like the Devanagari script from Sanskrit. Some of the Dravidian languages, such as Kannada, Telugu, and Malayalam, have also adopted Sanskrit loanwords and incorporated them into their vocabulary. 3. Indian Literature: Sanskrit has been the primary vehicle for the expression of creative and literary works throughout Indian history. The epics Ramayana and Mahabharata, including the Bhagavad Gita, are masterpieces composed in Sanskrit, influencing Indian literature and storytelling for generations. Many famous authors, playwrights, and poets such as Kalidasa, Vyasa, Valmiki, Bhasa, and Banabhatta have contributed immensely to the Sanskrit literature with their works in various genres like drama, poetry, and prose. Sanskrit works like Ashtadhyayi by Panini and Kamasutra by Vatsyayana showcase the depth of knowledge and variety of subjects that the ancient Indians explored in their literature. 4. Contribution to the Sciences: Ancient Indian scholars have penned various scientific treatises in Sanskrit, covering a broad range of subjects such as mathematics, astronomy, medicine, and architecture. The Vedanga Jyotisha is an ancient text on astronomy and calendrical calculations, while Sushruta Samhita and Charaka Samhita depict the advancements in the field of ancient Indian medicine. The Sulba Sutras contain the earliest known Indian mathematical knowledge, and the Vastu Shastra provides guidelines for architecture and construction. These works have been crucial in sharing and preserving India's scientific legacy. In conclusion, the significance of Sanskrit in the development of Indian philosophy, languages, and literature is enormous. It has been the medium through which knowledge, traditions, and culture have been transmitted across generations and regions, shaping the intellectual, spiritual, and artistic landscape of India. Even today, there is a resurgence of interest in learning and preserving this ancient language, given the wealth of knowledge and wisdom it embodies."},{"question":"How is \\"The Commission, from its side, will assist wherever it can to ensure that a real sense of urgency is given to this matter.\\" said in German?","response":"To translate the sentence, \\"The Commission, from its side, will assist wherever it can to ensure that a real sense of urgency is given to this matter\\", into German, I will follow these steps: 1.

In this context, it can be seen as a negative connotation because it implies that the movie is not easy to understand or appreciate. 2. \\"stilted\\" - Stilted often means stiff, unnatural, or awkward. This is also a negative connotation because it suggests that the movie is not organic or genuine in its presentation. 3. \\"self-consciously\\" - This means overly aware of oneself or one's actions, which could imply that the movie is trying too hard to be a certain way. This is again a negative connotation because it shows a lack of authentic expression. 4. \\"arty\\" - This word refers to something that is characterized by artistic or creative expression. This can have both positive and negative connotations depending on the context. However, in this context and combined with the other words used, it leans more towards a negative connotation, as it implies an overly affected or pretentious type of artiness.

In this context, \\"BH\\" is potentially an acronym referring to a specific organization or body, the name of which has been shortened to \\"BH\\". 2. \\"Üzerinde çalışmakta olduğu\\" is a complex phrase.

Together, they form a phrase, which can be translated as \\"is working on\\". 3. \\"NATO programları\\" translates to \\"NATO programs\\". \\"NATO\\" stands for North Atlantic Treaty Organization which is an international alliance that consists of 30 member states from North America and Europe, and \\"programları\\" is the plural form of program. 4. The word \\"ile\\" translates to \\"with\\" in English. 5. \\"ANP\\" is another acronym similar to \\"BH\\". It could be a reference to a different organization, group, or program.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Olivier Eugène Prosper Charles Messiaen (French: [ɔlivje mɛsjɑ̃]; December 10, 1908 – April 27, 1992) was a French composer, organist, and ornithologist, one of the major composers of the 20th century. His music is rhythmically complex; harmonically and melodically he employs a system he called modes of limited transposition, which he abstracted from the systems of material generated by his early compositions and improvisations. He wrote music for chamber ensembles and orchestra, vocal music, as well as for solo organ and piano, and also experimented with the use of novel electronic instruments developed in Europe during his lifetime. He travelled widely and wrote works inspired by diverse influences ranging from Japanese music, the landscape of Bryce Canyon in Utah and the life of St. Francis of Assisi. He said he perceived colours when he heard certain musical chords (a phenomenon known as synaesthesia in its literal manifestation); combinations of these colours, he said, were important in his compositional process. For a short period Messiaen experimented with the parametrisation associated with \\"total serialism\\", in which field he is often cited as an innovator. His style absorbed many global musical influences such as Indonesian gamelan (tuned percussion often features prominently in his orchestral works). Messiaen entered the Paris Conservatoire at the age of 11 and was taught by Paul Dukas, Maurice Emmanuel, Charles-Marie Widor and Marcel Dupré, among others. He was appointed organist at the Église de la Sainte-Trinité, Paris, in 1931, a post held until his death. He taught at the Schola Cantorum de Paris during the 1930s. On the fall of France in 1940, Messiaen was made a prisoner of war, during which time he composed his Quatuor pour la fin du temps (\\"Quartet for the end of time\\") for the four available instruments—piano, violin, cello and clarinet. The piece was first performed by Messiaen and fellow prisoners for an audience of inmates and prison guards. He was appointed professor of harmony soon...

Uber lawsuit have reached a settlement, and the case is being dismissed with prejudice. An attorney for Waymo announced the settlement this morning and was met with gasps of shock from reporters and members of the public who had crowded into the courtroom in San Francisco in hopes of seeing more drama. Judge Alsup granted the motion to dismiss, and with that, the case is, in his words, “ancient history.” This was supposed to be day 5 of the trial, which was expected to last at least another week, likely more. So who gets what? Waymo gets 0.34 percent of Uber’s equity at the company’s 72 billion valuation, which works out to a value of around 245 million. Waymo had originally sought a 1 billion settlement last year before the trial got underway, but Uber rejected that deal. Both sides are responsible for paying their own legal fees. “This is all equity; zero cash,” said a source familiar with the settlement. “It means Waymo is invested in Uber’s future.” “This is all equity; zero cash.” “We have reached an agreement with Uber that we believe will protect Waymo’s intellectual property now and into the future,” Waymo says in a statement. “We are committed to working with Uber to make sure that each company develops its own technology. This includes an agreement to ensure that any Waymo confidential information is not being incorporated in Uber Advanced Technologies Group hardware and software. We have always believed competition should be fueled by innovation in the labs and on the roads and we look forward to bringing fully self-driving cars to the world.” Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi released a contrite statement about the settlement where he expresses “regret” and apologizes to Uber’s employees for the distracting nature of the case. “To our employees, in particular the great and talented people of Uber’s Advanced Technologies Group: I am inspired by your passion and commitment to bringing self-driving vehicles to life,” he writes. “Over the last year, you’ve been distracted from your mission. For that I am sorry.” “Over the last year, you’ve been distracted from your mission. For that I am sorry.” Khosrowshahi also defends Uber’s acquisition of Otto, the company started by former Google employee Anthony Levandowski, and the crux of the entire lawsuit. “There is no question that self-driving technology is crucial to the future of transportation — a future in which Uber intends to play an important role. Through that lens, the acquisition of Otto made good business sense,” he writes. He goes on to say that he “[does] not believe that any trade secrets made their way from Waymo to Uber, nor do we believe that Uber has used any of Waymo’s proprietary information in its self-driving technology.” According to a source familiar with the matter, Uber cannot use any of Waymo’s hardware or software trade secrets as one of the conditions of the settlement. That’s interesting, especially since the trade secrets at the heart of the case were all related to hardware. Judge Alsup had instructed Waymo to bring a separate lawsuit against Uber if it wished to block the company from using its software. “As Uber’s statement indicates, no trade secrets ever came to Uber,” said Travis Kalanick, former CEO, in an official statement. “Our sole objective was to hire the most talented scientists and engineers to help lead the company and our cities to a driverless future.” Kalanick said that the evidence “overwhelmingly proved that” and that it was “clear” that Uber was going to win. The settlement came right before Waymo was expected to present many of the technical aspects of its argument, including how Waymo’s LIDAR hardware ended up in Uber’s products. Uber has denied utilizing any of Waymo’s trade secrets, and up until this point, Waymo had yet to connect those dots. Levandowski, who has been accused of stealing Waymo’s trade secrets and bringing them to Uber, was scheduled to take the stand on Monday, at which point he was expected to assert his Fifth Amendment rights. That probably would not have looked good for Uber, so the timing of the settlement is telling. the timing of settlement is telling Still, Uber sees this as a big win, especially since it clears the deck for the company ahead of its expected public offering. A settlement avoids years of costly appeals for Uber, or if the case had swung in the ride-hail company’s favor, a retrial by Waymo. Most notably, the settlement reflects the difference between Uber’s old and new leadership. While Uber’s former CEO Travis Kalanick probably likely would have continued fighting, no matter the cost, Khosrowshahi saw the value in putting the case behind him. Khosrowshahi has said he wants to take Uber public in 2019. In the end, the two companies end up closer together, like a married couple who almost got divorced. Google was an early investor in Uber, and now the equity settlement ensures that Waymo is invested in the ride-hail company’s future. ||||| This will appear next to all of your comments This will NOT appear anywhere on Newser ||||| What is a summary?","response":"Waymo, the self-driving car development company owned by Alphabet, has settled its lawsuit against Uber.

They are also donating the same amount to the International Rescue Committee (IRC) to help refugees in Syria and neighbouring countries, particularly women and children, with health care, shelter and sanitation. More than four million refugees have fled conflict in Syria for the relative safety of the neighbouring countries, according to the United Nations. Millions more have been forced to leave their homes for other parts of the country. Justin Forsyth, chief executive of Save the Children, said the money would \\"save many thousands of lives and protect some of the most vulnerable children\\". \\"By allowing us to make their generous donation to Syrian children public, Sacha and Isla are helping highlight the tragedy of the issue today,\\" he added. David Miliband, the ex-British foreign secretary who is president of the IRC, called their gift a \\"great expression of humanity.\\" ||||| Today Sacha Baron Cohen and Isla Fisher have made a 1 million donation split equally between Save the Children and the International Rescue Committee to support victims of the conflict in Syria. Donate now to help us provide food, water, medicine and education to Syrian children. Today Sacha Baron Cohen and Isla Fisher have made a 1 million donation split equally between Save the Children and the International Rescue Committee to support victims of the conflict in Syria. 500,000 Dollars will be used to fund a programme vaccinating more than 250,000 children against a potential measles outbreak in Northern Syria. The other half of the donation will be used to help fund the work to support families, with a special concern for women and children, both inside Syria and in neighbouring countries who are suffering as a result of the ongoing conflict. The money will go towards education, health care, shelter and sanitation. There are currently four million refugees in neighbouring states and over seven million displaced inside Syria. It has been estimated that around 12,000 children have been killed in the conflict and the real number may be much higher. Some sources have indicated that thousands of children have been killed by barrel bombs alone. Justin Forsyth, Save the Children CEO, said: “The Syrian conflict is now approaching its fifth year and children are the first victims. There is no safe place left in Syria, with shelling and violence omnipresent. Food and medicines have become scarce and basic necessities unaffordable. Syria’s health system has collapsed and deadly childhood diseases – like measles - which had previously been all but eradicated have now returned, threatening the lives of hundreds of thousands of children. By allowing us to make their generous donation to Syrian children public, Sacha and Isla are helping highlight the tragedy of the issue today. These are desperate times for Syrian families facing bombs, bullets and torture in Syria.

These people are the victims of terror. As hope for the end of conflict recedes, it is all the more important to meet the most basic human needs.

Months after reporting that metal scavengers had destroyed some 40 British, American, Australian, Dutch, and Japanese warships in the Java Sea, the Guardian now describes what happened to some of the sailors aboard who lost their lives during the Battle of the Java Sea in 1942. According to Indonesian and Dutch media, the bones of hundreds of sailors from British and Dutch warships were dumped in a mass grave near the port of Brondong in East Java. One salvage company employee tells Tirto.id that skulls, jawbones, ribs, hipbones, and feet and hand bones were bagged and buried in a grave only a few feet deep. They included remains of British sailors from the HMS Electra and HMS Encounter, which has prompted the UK's Ministry of Defense to speak out, reports the International Business Times. \\"The British government condemns the unauthorized disturbance of any wreck containing human remains,\\" a rep tells the Guardian. \\"A military wreck should remain undisturbed and those who lost their lives onboard should be allowed to rest in peace.\\" Indonesia has deflected blame by saying it received no formal request to guard the ships, which are protected by international law.

Article:","response":"Title: WWII Sailors' Remains Disturbed: Mass Grave and Scavenged Warships Stoke Outrage In a disquieting discovery, it has been reported that the bones of hundreds of British and Dutch World War II sailors have been found in a mass grave near the port of Brondong in East Java. Months earlier, approximately 40 warships in the Java Sea belonging to British, American, Australian, Dutch, and Japanese forces were reported to have been desecrated by metal scavengers. This recent revelation unveils the disturbing fate of some of the sailors who lost their lives during the Battle of the Java Sea in 1942. According to Indonesian and Dutch media outlets, the remains of sailors from British warships, including the HMS Electra and HMS Encounter, and Dutch vessels were bagged and buried in a shallow grave only a few feet deep. A salvage company employee described finding skulls, jawbones, ribs, and hand and feet bones among the remains. In response, the UK's Ministry of Defense has expressed its condemnation of the unauthorized disturbance of any wreck that contains human remains. A representative told The Guardian, \\"A military wreck should remain undisturbed, and those who lost their lives onboard should be allowed to rest in peace.\\" The Indonesian government, however, has countered by stating that it had not received any formal requests to guard the ships, which are normally protected under international law. The outrage sparked by the desecration of these World War II vessels has prompted various organizations to take action to help prevent further losses. The UK's National Museum of the Royal Navy and the Maritime Archaeology Sea Trust have partnered up to monitor any activity at the sites of British shipwrecks by employing state-of-the-art technology, including satellites, radar, and sensing equipment. Efforts like these reflect the desire to respect and honor the final resting places of those who made the ultimate sacrifice while serving their country. The Battle of the Java Sea, fought on February 27, 1942, was a critical naval battle during World War II, where the Allies aimed to stop the Japanese from invading Dutch East Indies. The conflict saw the destruction of several British, American, Dutch, and Australian vessels. Despite the Allies' valiant efforts, the battle concluded with a Japanese victory, marking the beginning of the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies. The recent uncovering of the mass grave and the desecration of the warships have struck a chord globally, prompting calls for better protection and respect for the final resting places of the fallen heroes who fought for their nations during World War II. Governments, institutions, and the public must recognize their collective responsibility to uphold the sanctity of these sites and ensure that the memories of those who served and lost their lives are preserved for future generations."},{"question":"The party full of kids has turned into an enjoyable evening.

Garry rides into an Indian reservation and finds himself in the middle of a conflict between a cattle owner and some homesteaders. He meets cattle owner John Lufton, and eventually his daughters Amy and Carol. The Luftons suspect that Garry is on Riling's side and are initially hostile, especially Amy. Garry readily admits that he is going to work for his friend. Riling tells Garry that he and Indian agent Jake Pindalest have devised an elaborate scheme to force Lufton into selling his herd cheaply. Pindalest has gotten the government to order Lufton to remove his cattle from the reservation in a week. Meanwhile, Riling has organized the homesteaders into blocking the move, conning them into believing that he is working in their best interests. With no other option, Lufton would have to sell his herd at bargain prices or lose everything. Lufton would never sell to Riling, but he would to a stranger like Garry. Pindalest would then see that the government buys the herd at an inflated price. Garry would get 10,000 for his part in the swindle. Lufton manages to outsmart Riling and move his herd unimpeded, but Riling and his men stampede and scatter the cattle back onto the reservation. It would take several days to gather the herd, more time than Lufton has before the deadline. Garry becomes disgusted when a man is killed in the stampede, and he switches sides. Amy still does not trust him. She suspects Garry of betraying the contents of a letter to Riling, unaware that Carol is enamored with Riling and is the one passing information to him.

They've been studying ants lately for their entomology class. Hannah studied ants that farm aphids, while Joe studied ants that farm fungus. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which student learned less about ants that manage large herds of aphids ? Hint: Some species of ants farm aphids, protecting them on the plants where they are feeding, and consuming the honeydew the aphids release from the terminations of their alimentary canals. This is a mutualistic relationship, with these dairying ants milking the aphids by stroking them with their antennae. Although mutualistic, the feeding behaviour of aphids is altered by ant attendance. Aphids attended by ants tend to increase the production of honeydew in smaller drops with a greater concentration of amino acids.Some farming ant species gather and store the aphid eggs in their nests over the winter. In the spring, the ants carry the newly hatched aphids back to the plants. Some species of dairying ants (such as the European yellow meadow ant, Lasius flavus) manage large herds of aphids that feed on roots of plants in the ant colony.

(Associated Press) \\"Now, instead of scaly animals portrayed as usually drab creatures, we have solid evidence for a fluffy colored past,\\" reports Mark A.

They were preserved in amber found in western Canada, researchers led by Ryan C. McKellar of the University of Alberta report in Friday's edition of the journal Science. Amber, hardened tree resin, preserved a mixture of feathers from 70 million years ago. Other feathers contained in amber dating to 90 million years ago are less diverse. Specimens include simple filament structures similar to the earliest feathers of non-flying dinosaurs _ a form unknown in modern birds _ and more complicated bird feathers \\"displaying pigmentation and adaptations for flight and diving,\\" the researchers reported. Indications of feathers have been found on much older fossils, and the new discoveries indicate feathers continued to develop into modern form before the extinction of dinosaurs, explained Norell, who was not part of the research team.

Wogelius of the University of Manchester, England, published online June 30 by Science, reports the finding of trace metals in feather fossils, suggesting their colors included black, brown and a reddish-brown. \\"Despite many reports over the past decade of feathered dinosaurs and new birds from China, only now are we beginning to understand just how diverse feather types were\\" millions of years ago, Norell said. ___ http://www.sciencemag.org ||||| A trove of ancient feathers both primitive and complex is providing scientists with an unprecedented snapshot of what some dinosaurs and birds looked like during the Cretaceous period. An account published online Thursday in the journal Science describes a host of feathers and feather-like filaments found in western Canada. The structures were ensconced in 70-million-year-old amber. Taken together, the feathers and filaments point to the diversity of this prehistoric plumed menagerie, said study coauthor Alexander Wolfe, a paleoecologist at the University of Alberta in Canada. \\"The simplest feathers are of greatest interest because these protofeathers have been inferred to be the evolutionary precedent to evolved feathers,\\" Wolfe said in an interview with The Times. Scientists have posited that feathers developed first as single, hair-like protrusions meant for insulation, then began to grow in clumps, and then as increasingly complex structures. At some point, they were probably used for other purposes (such as attracting mates), and later for flight. Many of the samples described in the study accurately match one of those stages. Some feathers even had coiled barbules, similar to those that have evolved on modern birds such as sandgrouses, which allow the animals to transport water to the nest to cool their incubating eggs. \\"We never thought we'd have fossils to show all these feathers, from primitive stage-one [protofeathers] to feathers of modern aspect,\\" Mark Norell, chairman of the division of paleontology at the American Museum of the Natural History, said in an interview with The Times.

Credit: Science ||||| By Hans Villarica Protofeather fossils discovered entombed in amber from the Late Cretaceous era support theories of dinosaur and avian evolution -- and make for one beautiful gallery Dinosaur and bird feathers preserved in amber from a Late Cretaceous site in Canada reveal new insights into the structure, function, and color of animals that date back to about 78 million years ago. Researchers led by University of Alberta paleontologist Ryan McKellar say these specimens represent distinct stages of feather evolution, from early-stage, single filament protofeathers to much more complex structures associated with modern diving birds. After analyzing the preserved pigment cells, the authors add that these feathered creatures may have also had a range of transparent, mottled, and diffused colors, similar to birds today. They can't determine which feathers belonged to birds or dinosaurs yet, but they did observe filament structures that are similar to those seen in other non-avian dinosaur fossils. Their findings appear in the current issue of the journal Science. In the gallery below, with captions from McKellar, marvel at the beauty of these amber-preserved feathers. Then, in the Q&A that follows, learn more about how amber preservation works, the science of feather evolution, and the possibility of Jurassic Park-type experiments down the line. How significant is this discovery? This discovery is a pretty significant find. It supports a model for the evolution of feathers that has previously relied on compression fossils that are difficult to interpret and have been hotly debated. Also, the amber-entombed feathers show that some of the most primitive feather types, also known as protofeathers, were still around just before the dinosaurs went extinct. They existed alongside feathers that are nearly identical to those of modern birds. Given what we know about the animals that were alive in the area at the time, it is reasonable to suggest that the protofeather-like specimens are attributable to dinosaurs and are the first specimens of this type of feather to be recovered from amber. How does amber preservation work exactly? Preservation in amber can vary quite a bit among deposits. Amber tends to preserve specimens in great detail because tree resin has antibacterial and drying properties that partially mummify inclusions and slow the initial onslaught of decay. Over many years, the resin polymerizes, turning into a plastic-like substance that is quite resilient, but burial usually results in heating that can have a profound effect on the inclusions over the span of millions of years. The Canadian amber insect inclusions are largely preserved as hollow voids in the amber, with a thin film of carbonized, coal-like material, where the outside of the insect once was. The feathers appear to have fared much better, because they are fine and are not composed of material that decay easily. That said, many of the specimens show signs of partial decay, and there is no indication of how much, if any, original material remains intact. What's the backstory of these specimens? What originally got me interested in this project was a single feather fragment trapped in a spider web that had been given to Dr. Brian Chatterton. For my Ph.D. project, I worked on tiny, less than three millimeter, parasitic wasps trapped within amber from the same deposit. As part of this project I was able to go through the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology collection of 3,000 or so inclusions in great detail. After finding a lot of feather fragments in this collection, I had the good fortune of meeting the Leuck family, amateur collectors in southern Alberta, who donated a pair of additional specimens to the University of Alberta. Later, we learned that Dr. Philip Currie was also examining a trio of specimens from the deposit. We pooled the material, creating a surprisingly rich snapshot of feathers in the Late Cretaceous. This project underlines the importance of maintaining museum collections as well as the role that interested amateurs can play in palaeontology. Without these, there is no way that we would have been able to observe these important specimens. According to your paper, these feathers represent several distinct stages of feather evolution. Could you explain each stage briefly? The evolutionary-developmental model is an attempt to explain how the transition from small hair-like feathers to modern feathers with multiple tiers of branching occurred. A quick account of modern feather anatomy would go like this: Feathers have a central shaft called the rachis. Off of this shaft branch the tufts, which in turn branch off into small structures called barbules that are segmented like bamboo shoots. Stage 1 consists of individual filaments that are comparable to hair in terms of overall appearance. Stage 2 consists of multiple filaments that arise from a single base, forming barbs. Stage 3 is where feathers become branched structures, either by forming segmented barbules on their barbs or by forming barbs on their central shaft, the rachis, and then combining these features to make two tiers of branching. Stage 4 is where the barbules on each side of the barb were altered to connect barbs together and form a sheet or vaned feather. Stage 5 encompasses a wide range of finer alterations that actually permit powered flight and a wide range of additional uses for feathers. The notion of dinosaur specimens preserved in amber reminds me of Jurassic Park. Would what happened in that movie be plausible? What can we look forward to learning? Put simply, no. The specimens that we examined are extremely small and would not be expected to contain any DNA material. To put this into context, the only genetic material that has been recovered from amber is from lumps of mummified insect muscle tissue in much younger Dominican amber that are approximately 17 million years old and well after the age of dinosaurs. If we are able to obtain more material, we would really like to examine the chemical makeup of the protofeather-like specimens, as well as the pigments found within these specimens and other feathers. It would then be possible to investigate how much of the original feather material remains intact and gain a better understanding of the feathers' colors. Unfortunately, these investigations rely on being able to create small breaks within some of the specimens and examine them under very high magnifications, such as scanning electron microscopy, so they are not possible with the limited number of specimens that are currently available. A larger collection may also allow us to verify some of the other stages in feather evolution. ||||| Photo Color is coming to the formerly black-and-white Mesozoic world of dinosaurs and early birds. Not exactly high-definition color, and some formidable characters may show up in the same old drab and scaly wardrobes; they are dinosaurs, after all, with a reputation for resistance to change. But in time, you can look for splashes of color in museum dioramas of feathered figures from the age of dinosaurs. For more than a decade, hardly a season has passed without more discoveries of dinosaur and bird fossils in China bearing impressions of feathers and traces of chemical coloring agents. Now, in Canada, paleontologists have found 70-million-year-old amber preserving 11 specimens showing a wide diversity of feather types at that time. One specimen of so-called proto-feathers had a single bristlelike filament and some simple clusters. Others were complex structures with hooklike barbules that act like Velcro; in modern birds, this keeps feathers in place during dives. Still other specimens revealed feather patterns for flight and underwater diving. Preserved pigment cells encased in the amber, along with other evidence, suggested that the feathered animals had an array of mottled patterns and diffuse colors like modern birds, scientists at the University of Alberta, led by Ryan C. McKellar, said in a report published Thursday in the journal Science.

The subject line should let the recipient know the purpose of the email. Instead of saying \\"Need to talk,\\" try saying \\"discussion of X topic. The subject should be between six and eight words. If the email is being sent for a job application, include your name and the position you are applying for. If you were sending an email to a coworker, you would include the name of the project that the email is discussing. If you use your personal email address for business purposes, your email address should communicate your name (i.e. mary.smith@ or MichaelJones@). Email addresses such as hotmama@, cutiepie@, or mustlovedogs@ are not appropriate for business emails. If you work for a company, you should always use your work email address. Your email should always begin with a professional salutation. \\"Hey\\" or \\"What's up\\" is not appropriate. \\"Hi\\" or \\"Hello\\" are preferable. If you are including the name of the recipient in your salutation, do not use a shortened version of their name (i.e. use \\"William\\" instead of \\"Will\\"). If someone has a gender neutral name, like Chris Smith, and you do not know whether the person is a Mr./Mrs./Etc., it is best to write \\"Dear Chris Smith.\\" You should use formal English when writing business emails. Avoid slang and colloquialisms in your email. Abbreviations, emoticons, and text message language (e.g. Lol) should not be used. Your email should be concise. Not only is the reader a busy person, but he or she may be reading your email on a mobile device. A short, to-the-point email is much easier to read and respond to than a lengthy, confusing one. Try not to address more than one topic in an email. Emails are brief forms of communication. If you cannot address the topic in a brief manner, you may need to pick the phone and call the person. In addition to using clear and concise language, you should read the email out loud to make sure that your email comes across as you intended it to. You do not want to sound harsh or abrupt. Remember that your email must speak for itself. You are not there to convey the tone and intent for the reader. Emails do not come with body language and facial expressions. Also, humor does not translate well over email. It is important that you end an email just like you would end any other conversation. You should end your email by saying \\"Thanks,\\" \\"Thank You,\\" or \\"Sincerely\\" followed by your name. Your emails should also include a signature. Your signature lets the reader know how to contact you. It should include your name, company, address, phone, your email address, and a website link if you have one. You should read your email multiple times before you send it. Do not rely on spellcheck. People will notice grammatical errors and misspelled or missing words. Proofreading is particularly important when you are introducing yourself for the first time through email. You want to make a good impression and not be judged by your email mistakes. When you are proofreading you should ask yourself: \\"Am I being clear and concise?\\" \\"Did I include any unnecessary information?\\" \\"Is there anything I can take out?\\" You should also verify that you are sending the email to the correct recipient. It can be very embarrassing to send an email to the wrong person. Summary:","response":"This article emphasizes the importance of crafting professional and effective business emails. To do so, follow these guidelines: 1. Use a clear and concise subject line, ideally between six and eight words, and consider including your name and the email's purpose where relevant. 2.

Reasoning: The answer \\"it is not possible to tell\\" can be justified because human behavior, thoughts, and emotions are highly complex and are influenced by a multitude of factors, including genetics, environment, interpersonal relationships, and personal experiences. Additionally, individuals have free will and are capable of making choices based on personal preference, which can further contribute to the unpredictability of their decisions and actions. Moreover, even with the advances in technology and sciences, it is still difficult to identify and quantify all the factors that play a role in shaping an individual's life. As a result, predicting every decision and action a person will take throughout their entire life remains an elusive goal. The sheer volume of variables involved make it virtually impossible to develop a comprehensive model that could accurately forecast human behavior at an individual level."},{"question":"How do you make pancakes? Can you make pancakes without flour? Multi-choice problem: Are these two questions inquiring about the same information? Choose your answer from: * no. * yes.","response":"To make pancakes, follow these steps: Step 1: Gather ingredients. You will need: - 1 cup (125 grams) all-purpose flour - 1 tablespoon sugar - 1/4 teaspoon salt - 1 teaspoon baking powder - 1/2 teaspoon baking soda - 1 cup (240 milliliters) milk - 1 large egg - 1 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted and cooled - Additional butter or oil for frying Step 2: Whisk dry ingredients. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, salt, baking powder, and baking soda. Step 3: Mix wet ingredients. In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk, egg, and melted butter. Step 4: Combine wet and dry ingredients. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, and mix until just combined. Don't overmix; some lumps are fine. Step 5: Cook the pancakes. Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat. Add a small amount of butter or oil to the pan. When the pan is hot, pour 1/4 cup (60 milliliters) of batter onto the skillet for each pancake. Cook for about 2-3 minutes, or until bubbles appear on the surface of the pancake and the edges start to set. Flip the pancake and cook for another 1-2 minutes, or until the pancake is cooked through. Yes, you can make pancakes without flour. One alternative is using rolled oats, ground almonds, or other alternative flours. Here's an example using rolled oats: Ingredients: - 1 cup (95 grams) rolled oats - 1 medium ripe banana - 2 large eggs - 1/2 cup (240 milliliters) milk - 1 teaspoon baking powder - 1 pinch of salt - Additional butter or oil for frying Follow the same steps as above, beginning by blending the rolled oats into a flour-like consistency before combining the ingredients. Cook the pancakes following the same method as described earlier. Regarding your multi-choice problem, the answer is \\"*no*\\". The reason is that the first question asks for a general method of making pancakes, while the second question is specifically about making pancakes without using flour."},{"question":"What key details about abdullah yusuf ali can be extracted from the following bio?

Answer:","response":"Abdullah Yusuf Ali was a renowned British-Indian Islamic scholar, translator, and intellectual, born on 14th April 1872 and deceased on 10th December 1953. His main claim to fame is his translation of the Qur'an into English, well-reputed as one of the most recognized and widely used Qur'an translations in the English-speaking world. His commitment to Islamic knowledge also led him to extensive studies on Qur'anic commentaries, particularly those from the early days of Islamic history. His most notable published work is a book started in 1934 and released in 1938 by Sh. Muhammad Ashraf publishers, a Lahore-based publishing house in British India, which is now in Pakistan. Born in Bombay, British India, into an affluent merchant family with a Dawoodi Bohra (a sub-sect of Shia Islam) father, Ali received profound religious education from a young age. He was capable of reciting the entire Qur'an from memory as a consequence of his intense religious training. He was fluent in both Arabic and English. Moreover, his academic endeavors also took him to multiple European universities, including the University of Leeds, where he studied English literature. These accomplishments and his mastery of English probably contributed to his successful Qur’an translation later in his career. Ali's life is sprinkled with notable roles and achievements, having been one of the trustees of the East London Mosque and being instrumental in opening the Al-Rashid Mosque, the third mosque in North America, in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, in December 1938. In addition to his substantial religious contribution, Ali was an outspoken supporter of the Indian contribution to the allied effort in World War I and was a respected intellectual in India. This led the acclaimed Sir Muhammad Iqbal to recruit him as the principal of Islamia College in Lahore, British India. Being in England in his later years, Ali passed away and was buried in London, resting in the Muslim cemetery at Brookwood, Surrey, near Woking, not far from the burial place of Marmaduke Pickthall, another key figure in the history of Islam in Britain. Overall, Sir Abdullah Yusuf Ali's unique blend of religious erudition, linguistic mastery, and intellectual vigor made him an influential figure in both the British and Indian scholarly circles during his lifetime. His legacy continues to be felt today, particularly through his widely accepted and respected translation of the Qur’an."},{"question":"Translate \\"The cocaine discovery set a new Balkan record, outdoing the previous one, set by the police forces of Italy, Montenegro and Serbia in 2004.\\" to Romanian?","response":"Descoperirea cocaină a stabilit un nou record balcanic, depășind precedentul, stabilit de forțele de poliție din Italia, Muntenegru și Serbia în 2004."},{"question":"Process: - Place the water in a pot - Cover the pot with a slightly too large cover - Place a larger pot under the first - Heat water to evaporation - Water vapor will collect on the lid - Drip into the second pot as fresh water - Salt is left behind in the original pot. Question: suppose The lid isnt the proper one happens, how will it affect More salt will drip inside the fresh water pot.. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","response":"Using a lid that is slightly too large for the pot is part of this specific process because it serves two main functions: 1. It helps to capture the maximum amount of evaporating water. 2. It allows condensed water droplets to slide down and drip into the second, larger pot underneath, thereby ensuring that the collected water is mostly fresh. If the lid isn't the proper size - for example if it's too small or doesn't seal the pot effectively - it could have several effects on the process: A. More salt might drip into the fresh water pot: This is due to the fact that an improperly fitting lid may allow steam (which could contain salt particles) to escape from the sides, then condense and drip into the fresh water pot. Proper fit and seal are essential to ensure that only water vapor gets evaporated and subsequently condensed, leaving behind the salt. B. Less water could be collected: An ill-fitting lid will not trap all the water vapor efficiently. Some of the steam will escape, leading to a lower yield of fresh water in the second pot. C. Longer process time: With steam leaking out, it will take longer to collect a specific volume of distilled water, making the process less efficient. In essence, both A and B can occur: more salt might end up in the fresh water pot and less overall water might be collected due to an improper lid size. This emphasizes the importance of using a lid that is appropriately sized for the pot to maximize the efficiency of the distillation process and to ensure the collection of fresh, desalinated water while leaving the salt behind."},{"question":"Add punctuation: Program Modification Sometimes not only virus TrojanDownloaderWin32BancosDD or malware Auslogics System Information but also common softwares possessing the ability to modify the inner functions of ehexthost32exe which means other programs cant find this DLL file again","response":"Program Modification: Sometimes, not only virus (like TrojanDownloader Win32 Bancos DD) or malware (like Auslogics System Information), but also common softwares possess the ability to modify the inner functions of ehexthost32.exe.

We were there June 6, and around 830PM, we decided to walk in the Verona Restaurant, since we wanted a nice dinner for my husband's birthday. The hostess that sat us promptly was gracious, and said someone would be there shortly with water. We waited about 5 minutes for water. Our waiter Peter must of been having an off night, or support staff wasn't there. I cannot think of too many reasons for how were treated during our meal there. First of all, the ambiance of the restaurant is nice, the booths just a bit nicer with the nice leather seating. The ceiling has a nice alabaster light, but it seemed to be right on our table. Perhaps at a later hour they dim the lights? Before we were even acknowledged by Peter, our waiter, or anyone with a glass a water was probably a good 5-6 minutes after we sat down. At least get a person a glass of water. When Peter came over, we had plenty of time to review the menus, as the hostess had given those when we first sat down. Peter ran through the menu, offered to get drinks. My husband decided on water, and I requested a cup of coffee with cream. We placed our order, hubby had the NY steak with the Potatoes Rustica, and I had the 8oz Ribeye with Baby Vegetables(broccalini). The redeeming quality of this place WAS the food. I had to ask for my coffee again, I was just about done with dinner. We were NEVER EVEN ASKED ONCE HOW OUR FOOD WAS. NOT ONCE. I am so disappointed in this place. I thought we might of found a nice, dress up nice and have a celebration dinner, as my husband wanted a casino night for his birthday. It seemed our bread came late... while the rolls are good, you get a couple, I hesitated to even think of asking for any more. Our water glasses were never refilled(glasses completely OUT of water), wait-staff never asked how things went with us.... ANYTHING to acknowledge that we were even there. I believe it was the manager that refilled our glasses about 5 minutes before we left. Perhaps we weren't high-rollers? I don't know the answer to that one. I do know that the party next to us, had a wonderful waitress, and she communicated with them. We never asked for anything out of the ordinary, we were dressed appropriately for a nice restaurant, and we have dined in nice places before, and never been treated so poorly. We never demanded anything, didn't order something not on the menu, we weren't demanding in any way shape or form. WAIT! We asked for bread after the salad arrived, maybe that was it?? We had been there around 30-35 minutes when we requested bread..We almost had consumed the salad and from experience, you usually will get a selection of bread. Although, once the bread arrived, Stephen did an awesome job preparing the olive oil and balsamic vinegar. It was good. I think that perhaps they realized that things were basically not salvageable, as Peter said when he dropped off the dinner check, and hurried off, \\"the coffee is free\\" said as he passed by the table. Weird. I wouldn't go back to the restaurant. I had hoped for a place where you are treated well, and the food good. I have to say that the prices, I thought we reasonable, my 8OZ Ribeye was 17, with one side included. We ordered an In Casa Ensalta(sp) - 8- which was pretty good. The food isn't the problem, at least not on June 6, 2009, it was either the staffing wasn't sufficent - it should've of been... It was Saturday night.

The reviewer gives the restaurant two stars and expresses a mostly negative sentiment towards the service they experienced from their waiter, Peter, and the overall dining experience. They mention long waiting times for water and bread, insufficient attention from the staff, and lack of communication on how their meal was. Additionally, they express disappointment in not being treated well, possibly due to not being perceived as high-rollers. However, the sentiment shifts to positive when discussing the food, which the reviewer considers as the redeeming quality of the restaurant, and they find the prices reasonable. They compliment the dishes they ordered, namely the NY steak, Potatoes Rustica, Ribeye, Baby Vegetables, and In Casa Ensalata.

He fought with the Confederates against the Parliamentarians in 1645–6, and led a successful assault on Roscommon Castle in 1646. In 1649 he was imprisoned in London but soon released. After some time in France he was allowed to return to England through the pleas of his brother-in-law John Holles, 2nd Earl of Clare. He is said to have been one of the few Irishmen whom Oliver Cromwell admired, and was also on good terms with Oliver's son Henry Cromwell, although Henry refused his request to be allowed to recover possession of his principal residence, Merrion Castle.

Charlotte's father, Elbourne, hires D, a dhampir, to find her and rescue her, and alternatively, kill her humanely if she's been turned into a vampire. He offers D 500,000 as a down payment, and offers him 10mil if he carries out the job. D has Elbourne double the payment, and agrees to search for Charlotte. At the same time, Charlotte's older brother hires another group of vampire hunters, the notorious Marcus brothers, composed of the leader Borgoff, a hulking man named Nolt, a blade master named Kyle, a physically disabled psychic named Grove and a woman named Leila who hunts vampires because of a personal grudge rather than for monetary gain. The two parties (D and the Marcus brothers) race inexorably after Meier Link. However, Meier Link hires the mutant Barbarois; a group of lethal mercenary body guards. They consist of Caroline, a shape shifter; Benge, a shadow manipulator; and Machira, a werewolf. Throughout the course of the film, two of the Marcus brothers, Nolt and Kyle, end up being killed by the mutant Barbarois, while Leila and Borgoff continue their search for Charlotte. As the story progresses, Meier Link's abduction of Charlotte turns out to not be as it seemed, as it's revealed that Charlotte willingly ran away with Meier Link as his lover. Charlotte rightfully feared that no one would understand their relationship, with her a human and Link a vampire. Throughout their search, and after both characters save each other from seeming death at separate points, D has a conversation with Leila, where she reveals that she hunts vampires because a vampire killed her mother. D tells her that he hunts vampires as he has no other choice as a dhampir, and she can have a life that someone like him could never have; the life of a normal human. Leila, having not exactly taken the life of a normal human, instead being a monster hunter, fears that no one will mourn her death when that...

Hello, little friends! Today, we're going to learn about people from different parts of the world. Did you know that there are so many different types of people living all around the globe? There are people who speak different languages, eat different foods, and have different hobbies. Isn't that exciting? One of these groups of people is called \\"Phu Thai.\\" They live mainly in the countries of Laos, Vietnam, and Thailand. But let's try to understand: how many people are there on our planet who are not Phu Thai? To find the answer to this question, we must first understand that there are about 7.8 billion people living on Earth. That's a lot of people, isn't it? Now, let's find out how many Phu Thai there are. There are about 1 million Phu Thai people in the world. Can you imagine that it's just like having one million colorful candies in a huge jar? Now it's time to do a bit of math to find out how many people are not Phu Thai. Out of the 7.8 billion people on Earth, if 1 million are Phu Thai, that means we need to subtract 1 million from 7.8 billion to see how many people are not Phu Thai. After we do this, we will find out that there are 7,799,000,000 people who are not Phu Thai. Now, to find the percentage, we must divide the number of non-Phu Thai people (7,799,000,000) by the total number of people on Earth (7,800,000,000) and then multiply by 100 to get our answer. When we do this math, we find out that about 99.987% of people are not Phu Thai. So, little friends, we have discovered that in our big world, almost 99.987% of people are not Phu Thai! Isn't it amazing to think about all the different people we share our beautiful planet with?

Petraeus resigned Friday and admitted to having an extramarital affair, bringing a shocking end to his brief tenure at the spy agency and highly decorated national security career. The affair came to light as part of an FBI investigation into a potential security breach involving Petraeus’s e-mails, according to federal law enforcement officials and a former senior intelligence official. The investigation uncovered e-mails describing an affair between Petraeus and Paula Broadwell, a former military officer and co-author of a glowing biography of Petraeus, according to two law enforcement officials who were briefed on the investigation. Petraeus, a retired four-star Army general who once was seen as a potential presidential candidate, met with President Obama on Thursday and said he intended to step down because of the affair, Obama administration officials said. The president accepted his resignation Friday. “After being married for over 37 years, I showed extremely poor judgment by engaging in an extramarital affair,” Petraeus said in a statement distributed to the CIA workforce Friday. “Such behavior is unacceptable, both as a husband and as the leader of an organization such as ours. This afternoon, the president graciously accepted my resignation,” he said. 1 of 46 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Gen.

A senior administration official said the White House learned only Wednesday that Petraeus had a potentially serious problem. The official said that Petraeus telephoned Thomas E. Donilon, the national security adviser, early Thursday and asked to meet with Obama. The investigation is not expected to result in accusations of criminal wrongdoing by Petraeus or Broadwell, according to the two law enforcement officials, who spoke on the condition that their names be withheld because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Paul Bresson, an FBI spokesman, refused to comment. Attempts to reach Broadwell were unsuccessful. A CIA spokesman declined to answer questions about the timing of the affair or Petraeus’s decision to disclose it to the White House. Current and former U.S. military officials said suspicions of infidelities had followed Petraeus for several years. The sudden departure of Petraeus created turmoil in the administration’s national security team just days after the president’s reelection. That team was expected to see a series of changes in the coming months, but many believed that Petraeus would remain in position. In a statement, Obama said Petraeus has “provided extraordinary service to the United States for decades,” adding that “through his lifetime of service David Petraeus has made our country safer and stronger.” The statement did not directly address Petraeus’s reason for resigning, but the president said that his “thoughts and prayers are with Dave and Holly Petraeus, who has done so much to help military families through her own work. I wish them the very best at this difficult time.” Holly Petraeus is an assistant director of the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, where she is charged with advocating on behalf of service members and their families. She and her husband met in 1973 at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, where her father was superintendent. Broadwell, who also is married, is a West Point graduate and a research associate at Harvard University. She is the co-author of “All In: The Education of General David Petraeus.” (The book’s co-author was Vernon Loeb, local editor at The Washington Post.) In earlier interviews, Broad­well described meeting Petraeus in 2006 at Harvard, where she was working on a dissertation about leadership. She said they soon started e-mailing and discussing her research. In the preface to the book, Broadwell said that after Obama picked Petraeus to lead U.S. forces in Afghanistan in June 2010, he invited her to Kabul, and she decided to turn her dissertation into a biography. She made repeated trips to Afghanistan to spend time observing Petraeus. In describing Petraeus in a CBS News interview two months ago, she said: “He, at the end of the day, is human and is challenged by the burdens of command. . . . So, he has this mask of command — you think he’s really confident — but I got to see a more personal side. He’s confident, but he’s also very compassionate about the loss of troops and sacrifices we’re making in Afghanistan.” Petraeus was scheduled to testify next week on Capitol Hill in hearings on the deaths of four Americans, including the U.S. ambassador and two CIA security officers, in Libya in September. U.S. officials insisted that the controversy surrounding the attack — and the administration’s shifting accounts of it — played no role in Petraeus’s decision to resign. Petraeus’s 14-month tenure as CIA director is one of the shortest in agency history. Michael J. Morell, who served as Petraeus’s deputy at the CIA, will serve as interim director, a position he occupied for several months before Petraeus was sworn in. Morell is seen as a leading candidate to replace Petraeus, but there are others, including Michael G. Vickers, a former CIA paramilitary officer now serving as undersecretary of defense for intelligence. Petraeus came into the CIA job after a highly decorated Army career that included command of the war efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan, which made him one of the most venerated officers of his generation. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D- Calif.), chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Friday that she believed Petraeus’s infidelity did not require him to resign. “I wish President Obama had not accepted this resignation, but I understand and respect the decision,” she said in a statement. She described Petraeus’s resignation as an “enormous loss for our nation’s intelligence community and for our country.” The nature of Petraeus’s resignation is likely to leave a stain on the polished reputation he cultivated during his 37-year military career. Petraeus was widely credited with helping to reverse the course of the war in Iraq and overhauling the military’s approach to counterinsurgency fighting. Petraeus was later handed command of the war in Afghanistan, where success proved more elusive. Because of his evident ambition and abundant publicity, some military rivals saw Petraeus as preening and self-aggrandizing. He did little to discourage speculation that he could be a presidential or vice presidential candidate and quietly campaigned for the CIA job when his path to higher military positions was blocked. At the agency, Petraeus presided over an expansion of the CIA’s Predator drone campaign in Yemen and was recently behind a push to expand the agency’s drone fleet. He was involved in decisions to carry out controversial strikes, including the Predator attacks last year that killed two U.S. citizens: the al-Qaeda figure Anwar al-Awlaki and his teenage son. Petraeus, who retired from the military last year, is still subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice, which classifies adultery as a crime. Practically speaking, however, the odds are extremely low that the military would prosecute a retired officer for having an affair, said Eugene R. Fidell, a prominent military law expert who teaches at Yale University. “They’re as close to zero as you can get,” Fidell said. “It would have to be a grave matter before the executive branch would prosecute a retiree.” Petraeus married Holly two months after graduating from West Point. His courtship was seen as audacious because of her father’s rank at the elite military academy. They have two children, Stephen, who became an Army officer, and Anne. Petraeus has frequently praised his wife in public appearances for her sacrifices and contributions to his career, and he characterized his return to Washington as an opportunity for them to be closer after his years-long assignments overseas. As Petraeus assumed a low profile when he moved to the CIA, his wife became increasingly visible at the Pentagon as part of her work for a government agency that helps service members manage their finances. In recent months, she has traveled to dozens of military bases around the country to counsel soldiers about predatory lending, student loans and debt.

(AP Photo/Cliff Owen, File) (Associated Press) The affair was discovered during an FBI investigation, according to officials briefed on the developments. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the matter. It was unclear what the FBI was investigating or when it became aware of the affair. Petraeus' resignation shocked Washington's intelligence and political communities. It was a sudden end to the public career of the best-known general of the post 9/11 wars, a man sometimes mentioned as a potential Republican presidential candidate. His service was effusively praised Friday in statements from lawmakers of both parties. Petraeus, who turned 60 on Wednesday, told CIA employees in a statement that he had met with President Barack Obama at the White House on Thursday and asked to be allowed to resign. On Friday, the president accepted. Petraeus told his staffers he was guilty of \\"extremely poor judgment\\" in the affair. \\"Such behavior is unacceptable, both as a husband and as the leader of an organization such as ours.\\" He has been married for 38 years to Holly Petraeus, whom he met when he was a cadet at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, N.Y. She was the daughter of the academy superintendent. They have two children, and their son led an infantry platoon in Afghanistan. Obama said in a statement that the retired general had provided \\"extraordinary service to the United States for decades\\" and had given a lifetime of service that \\"made our country safer and stronger.\\" Obama called him \\"one of the outstanding general officers of his generation.\\" The president said that CIA Deputy Director Michael Morell would serve as acting director. Morell was the key CIA aide in the White House to President George W. Bush during the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks. \\"I am completely confident that the CIA will continue to thrive and carry out its essential mission,\\" Obama said. The resignation comes at a sensitive time. The administration and the CIA have struggled to defend security and intelligence lapses before the attack that killed the U.S. ambassador to Libya and three others. It was an issue during the presidential campaign that ended with Obama's re-election Tuesday. The CIA has come under intense scrutiny for providing the White House and other administration officials with talking points that led them to say the Benghazi attack was a result of a film protest, not a militant terror attack. It has become clear that the CIA was aware the attack was distinct from the film protests roiling across other parts of the Muslim world. Morell rather than Petraeus now is expected to testify at closed congressional briefings next week on the Sept. 11 attacks on the consulate in Benghazi. For the director of the CIA, being engaged in an extramarital affair is considered a serious breach of security and a counterintelligence threat. If a foreign government had learned of the affair, the reasoning goes, Petraeus or the person with whom he was involved could have been blackmailed or otherwise compromised. Military justice considers conduct such as an extramarital affair to be possible grounds for court martial. Failure to resign also could create the perception for the rank-and-file that such behavior is acceptable. At FBI headquarters, spokesman Paul Bresson declined to comment on the information that the affair had been discovered in the course of an investigation by the bureau. Holly Petraeus is known for her work helping military families. She joined the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to set up an office dedicated to helping service members with financial issues. Though Obama made no direct mention of Petraeus' reason for resigning, he offered his thoughts and prayers to the general and his wife, saying that Holly Petraeus had \\"done so much to help military families through her own work. I wish them the very best at this difficult time.\\" Petraeus, who became CIA director in September 2011, was known as a shrewd thinker and hard-charging competitor. His management style was recently lauded in a Newsweek article by Paula Broadwell, co-author of the biography, \\"All In: The Education of General David Petraeus.\\" The article listed Petraeus' \\"rules for living.\\" No. 5 was: \\"We all make mistakes. The key is to recognize them, to learn from them, and to take off the rear view mirrors _ drive on and avoid making them again.\\" Petraeus told his CIA employees that he treasured his work with them \\"and I will always regret the circumstances that brought that work with you to an end.\\" The director of national intelligence, James Clapper, said Petraeus' departure represented \\"the loss of one of our nation's most respected public servants. From his long, illustrious Army career to his leadership at the helm of CIA, Dave has redefined what it means to serve and sacrifice for one's country.\\" Other CIA directors have resigned under unflattering circumstances. CIA Director Jim Woolsey left over the discovery of a KGB mole and director John Deutch left after the revelation that he had kept classified information on his home computer. Before Obama brought Petraeus to the CIA, he was credited with salvaging the U.S. war in Iraq. \\"His inspirational leadership and his genius were directly responsible - after years of failure - for the success of the surge in Iraq,\\" Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said Friday. President George W. Bush sent Petraeus to Iraq in February 2007, at the peak of sectarian violence, to turn things around as head of U.S. forces. He oversaw an influx of 30,000 U.S. troops and moved troops out of big bases so they could work more closely with Iraqi forces scattered throughout Baghdad. Petraeus' success was credited with paving the way for the eventual U.S. withdrawal. After Iraq, Bush made Petraeus commander of U.S. Central Command, overseeing all U.S. military operations in the greater Middle East, including Afghanistan and Pakistan. When the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, Gen. Stanley McChrystal, was relieved of duty in June 2010 for comments in a magazine story, Obama asked Petraeus to take over in Kabul and the general quickly agreed. In the months that followed, Petraeus helped lead the push to add more U.S. troops to that war and dramatically boost the effort to train Afghan soldiers and police. House Homeland Security Chairman Peter King, R-N.Y., said he regretted Petraeus' resignation, calling him \\"one of America's most outstanding and distinguished military leaders and a true American patriot.\\" Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Dianne Feinstein also regretted the resignation but gave Morell high marks, too. Morell had served as deputy director since May 2010, after holding a number of top roles, including director for the agency's analytical arm, which helps feed intelligence into the president's daily brief. He also worked as an aide to former CIA director George Tenet. \\"I wish President Obama had not accepted this resignation,\\" Feinstein said of Petraeus, \\"but I understand and respect the decision.\\" ___ Associated Press writers Wendy Benjaminson, Ken Thomas, Donna Cassata, Adam Goldman, Eileen Sullivan, Pete Yost and Anne Flaherty contributed to this report. ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

Article: For a clearer picture of what the student knows, most teachers use another kind of examination in addition to objective tests. They use \\"essay\\" tests, which require students to write long answers to broad, general questions such as the following: \\"Mention several ways in which Benjamin Franklin has influenced thinking of people in his own country and in other parts of the world.\\" One advantage of the essay test is that it reduces the element of luck. The student cannot get a high score just by making a lucky guess. Another advantage is that it shows the examiner more cares about the student's ability to put facts together into a meaningful whole. It should show how deeply he has thought about the subject. Sometimes, though, essay tests have disadvantages, too. Some students are able to write rather good answers without really knowing much about the subject, while other students who actually know the material have trouble expressing their ideas in the essay form. Besides, in an essay test the student's score may depend upon the examiner's feelings at the time of reading the answer. If he is feeling tired or bored, the student may receive a lower score than he should. Another examiner reading the same answer might give it a much higher mark. Because of _ , the objective test gives each student a fairer chance, and of course it is easier and quicker to score. Whether an objective test or an essay test is used, problems arise. When some objective questions are used along with some essay questions, however, a fairly clear picture of the student's knowledge can usually be gotten. Question: According to the passage, which of the following statements about the objective test is NOT true? Options: A: It is more objective than the essay test in terms of scoring. B: It allows the student to guess the correct answer without really knowing the material. C: It shows the student's ability to think about difficult problems. D: It is easy and quick to score. A:","response":"C: It shows the student's ability to think about difficult problems. In the passage provided, there was no mention or inference suggesting that objective tests assess a student's ability to deeply think about challenging problems. They instead were shown to be more objective in terms of scoring (option A), they could potentially allow students to guess the correct answers without truly knowing the material (option B), and were mentioned as being easy and quick to score (option D).

Shortly after his court vindication, Senator Mike Duffy returned to charging taxpayers for some of his Ottawa living expenses. According to the Senate's quarterly proactive disclosure report, Duffy claimed 1,691.59 in National Capital Region expenses between March and June of 2016. These are the types of claims that led to the Senate expenses scandal in the first place, and prompted an overhaul of the rules and regulations for the Upper Chamber. \\"I filed my claims as the Senate rules provide, and was approved by Senate administration, and as Judge Vaillancourt agreed were valid,\\" Duffy told CBC News in an email. Before the scandal broke in 2013, it had been widely known that Duffy, who represents Prince Edward Island, had lived in Ottawa for more than two decades during his time as a television broadcaster. Duffy's previous expense claims led to a criminal investigation, and he was charged with 31 counts of fraud and breach of trust. After a year-long legal saga, Duffy was found not guilty on all charges in a resounding victory issued by Justice Charles Vaillancourt. While Duffy's previous claims landed him in court, there appears to be no uncertainty about whether he is entitled to make Ottawa living expense claims now. Senate administration confirms Duffy is well within the rules, as he has proved he is a resident of Prince Edward Island. In an email to CBC News, Senate spokeswoman Jacqui Delaney says \\"as per the new rule adopted in May 2013, Senator Duffy has submitted a Declaration of Provincial/Territorial Residence and National Capital Accommodation with the following supporting documents: \\"This declaration and supporting documents must be submitted annually,\\" Delaney added. After learning of Duffy's new Ottawa expense claims, the Canadian Taxpayers Federation is questioning whether the Senate's new rules on expenses go far enough. \\"After Mr Duffy was acquitted, there was a lot of concern about the rules and whether the rules were tight enough,\\" said Aaron Wudrick, federal director of the CTF. \\"We were assured by the Senate that the rules had been tightened, and that they had been changed. But if he's still able to claim, that suggests that the rules haven't been tightened enough,\\" Wudrick added. \\"It's the same issue with his trial. He was technically within the rules, but that just casts aspersions on the rules. It suggests the rules mean nothing if you can actually live within them and still get away with this,\\" Wudrick said. Mike Duffy's residency - whether he lives in Ottawa or P.E.I., the province he represents in the Senate - was at the centre of his long-running fraud and breach of trust trial. In the end, the judge saw it his way, finding the Senate rules unclear. (Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press) But some of Duffy's colleagues are more supportive of his claims. \\"He is able to claim expenses in accordance with Senate rules like any other senator,\\" said Senator Peter Harder, one of the Upper Chamber's newest members. \\"As you know, these [rules] have been significantly clarified and made for more transparency in the past two years,\\" Harder added. The Prime Minister's Office wouldn't comment specifically on Duffy's new expense claims. \\"We remain confident in the prime minister's new approach to make the Senate less partisan and more independent,\\" PMO spokesman Cameron Ahmad said in an email to CBC News.

Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press Prime Minister Justin Trudeau formally apologized Wednesday for a shameful episode in Canada’s history, when this country turned away more than 900 German Jewish refugees fleeing Nazi terror and persecution. Canada’s 1939 refusal to grant asylum to the refugees on the MS St. Louis ocean liner and its callous attitude to what was unfolding in Europe was not only a dereliction of moral duty but helped embolden Adolf Hitler as he set about murdering millions of Jewish people, Mr. Trudeau said. “[Hitler] watched ... as we refused their visas, ignored their letters and denied them entry,” the Prime Minister told the House of Commons. Story continues below advertisement “There is little doubt that our silence permitted the Nazis to come up with their own final solution,\\" he said of the indifference and apathy shown by many countries toward the Jewish people at the time. In May, 1939, the St. Louis left Germany with passengers, including more than 900 Jewish German citizens seeking sanctuary. These refugees were barred from disembarking at the ship’s first destination in Cuba and then denied entry into the United States and finally Canada because of the government’s discriminatory “none is too many” immigration policy toward Jewish people, the Prime Minister’s Office said in a summary of the events. The U.S. State Department made its own apology in 2012. The Jewish passengers returned to Europe where many were later condemned to concentration camps, with 254 killed during the Holocaust. “To harbour such hatred and indifference towards the refugees was to share in the moral responsibility for their deaths,” Mr. Trudeau said. “We apologize to the 907 German Jews aboard the MS St. Louis, as well as their families,” the Prime Minister told the Commons. “We also apologize to others who paid the price of our inaction – whom we doomed to the ultimate horror of the death camps.” Jan Blumenstein, a survivor of Nazi concentration camps including Auschwitz, had a grandmother on the St. Louis – Regina Blumenstein – who ultimately died in the Holocaust. He was present for the apology. Story continues below advertisement Story continues below advertisement “Finally, somebody came to their senses and realized this is [still] going on all the time,\\" he said of the speech, saying it was important in that it acknowledged anti-Semitism remains strong. Canada’s refusal to accept the St. Louis passengers took place more than six months after the infamous Kristallnacht in November, 1938, when storm troopers and members of the Hitler Youth burned hundreds of synagogues, smashed thousands of shop windows and killed dozens of Jews. About 30,000 people were sent to concentration camps, the first large cohort of the millions who would be murdered. Mr. Trudeau warned of an “alarming rate” of discrimination and violence against Jewish people today. “According to the most recent figures, 17 per cent of all hate crimes in Canada target Jewish people – far higher per capita than any other group,” the Prime Minister said. “Holocaust deniers still exist. Anti-Semitism is still far too present. Jewish institutions and neighbourhoods are still being vandalized with swastikas,” he said. He cited the recent killing of 11 people and wounding of six others at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh. Story continues below advertisement “We must guard our communities and institutions against the kinds of evils that took hold in the hearts of so many, more than 70 years ago, for they did not end with the war,\\" Mr. Trudeau said. The Prime Minister also raised intimidation of Jewish students on some Canadian college and university campuses by the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions [BDS] campaign against Israel that he said makes them feel “unwelcomed and uncomfortable.” The Prime Minister said the “long overdue” apology to the passengers of the St. Louis cannot erase the pain suffered by these refugees or those murdered in the Holocaust or their descendants. He said, however, he hopes it helps those hearing the apology to heal. “More than 70 years ago, Canada turned its back on you,” he said to Jewish people. “But today, Canadians pledge, now and forever: never again.\\" Andrew Scheer, the Conservative Leader of the Official Opposition, echoed this apology and warned of “a disturbing resurgence and even normalization of anti-Semitic rhetoric.\\" This hatred “was not eradicated with the defeat of the Nazis. It is, unfortunately and sadly, very much alive today,\\" he said. Story continues below advertisement Nimrod Barkan, Israel’s Ambassador to Canada, was on hand for Mr. Trudeau’s address and said he was grateful to the Prime Minister. “We are all encouraged not only by the apology but more so by the comments about the need to fight anti-Semitism today, to fight BDS and to make sure there is no hate for Jews allowed anywhere around the world, and certainly not in Canada.” With a report from Richard Blackwell ||||| Mr. Trudeau’s apology came less than two weeks after a gunman opened fire in a Pittsburgh synagogue, killing 11 worshipers, and at a time when anti-Semitism is rising across North America. It was not lost on many that it was delivered the day after an American election campaign marked by refugee-bashing. “The rhetoric we are hearing across the border is very similar to the rhetoric we heard in the 1930s — the vilification of the other, the vilification of the press. It’s really scary,” said Danny Gruner, who attended Wednesday’s apology with his mother, Ana Maria Gordon, the sole survivor of the St. Louis living in Canada today. Ms. Gordon, who met with Mr. Trudeau privately, was surrounded by many of her great-grandchildren and grandchildren. Last week, Mr. Trudeau apologized to a British Columbia First Nation for the government’s treachery in inviting six Tsilhqot’in chiefs to peace talks 150 years ago. Instead of talking, the government arrested them, put them on trial and hanged them. He has also apologized to Omar Khadr, the only Canadian who was held at the United States military base at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. He emotionally apologized to gay members of the army, the police and in public service who were persecuted — some even imprisoned — because of their sexual orientation. And he tearfully said sorry to indigenous people in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador, where for much of the 20th century indigenous children were torn from their families and compelled to attend boarding schools, where many were abused. “You will not remove the guilt from the perpetrators of the horror,” Mr. Gruner said. “But at least you can come to terms with what the country was at the time, and try to understand where we are at this particular time and where we want to be.” ||||| The Nazi regime of Adolf Hitler tested the limits of Canada's humanity in the lead up to the Second World War and Canada's government failed that test \\"miserably,\\" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said today. The prime minister made the remarks as part of the apology delivered in the House of Commons for the 1939 decision by the Canadian government to turn away a boatload of German Jews seeking refuge from the Nazis. \\"In the years leading up to the war, Hitler tested the world's resolve. He noted carefully as country after country proved itself indifferent to the plight of Jewish refugees,\\" Trudeau said. Your country failed you. And for that, we are sorry. - Prime Minister Justin Trudeau \\"He watched on as we refused their visas, ignored their letters and denied them entry. With every decree, he challenged the political courage of our leaders and the empathy of those who elected them. \\"With every pogrom, he tested the bounds of our humanity and the limits of our solidarity ... Adolf Hitler's test was one the Canadian government failed miserably.\\" In 1939, the MS St. Louis left Germany carrying 907 Jewish passengers fleeing persecution by the Nazi regime. The ship was turned away from Cuba and the United States before a group of Canadians tried to convince Prime Minister King's government to let it dock in Halifax. The Canadian government heeded the anti-Semitic sentiment abroad at the time by severely restricting Jewish immigration. From 1933 to 1945, only about 5,000 Jewish refugees were accepted because of Canada's discriminatory 'none is too many' immigration policy. When Ottawa refused to let the MS St. Louis passengers disembark, the ship returned to Europe. About half the passengers were taken in by the U.K., the Netherlands, France and Belgium. About 500 of them ended up back in Germany, where 254 were killed in concentration and internment camps. 'Their cries for help were left unanswered' \\"The story of the St. Louis and its passengers is no isolated incident,\\" Trudeau added. \\"The Government of Canada was indifferent to the suffering of Jews long before the St. Louis ever set sail for Halifax, and sadly, long after it had returned to Europe.\\" The prime minister went on to say the passengers of the MS St. Louis would have made Canada stronger but \\"their cries for help were left unanswered, for Canada deemed them unworthy of a home, and undeserving of our help.\\" Trudeau said that Hitler, alone, did not seal the fate of the passengers of the MS St. Louis or the Jewish populations of Europe because for Canada \\"To harbour such hatred and indifference towards the refugees was to share in the moral responsibility for their deaths.\\" The prime minister said that while decades have passed since the decision to turn away the MS St. Louis, the guilt or shame of rejecting the asylum seekers on that ship remains. 'Aliens in their own land' \\"Today, I rise in this House of Commons to issue a long overdue apology to the Jewish refugees Canada turned away,\\" Trudeau said. \\"We apologize to the 907 German Jews aboard the MS. St-Louis, as well as their families. We also apologize to others who paid the price of our inaction, whom we doomed to the ultimate horror of the death camps. \\"We used our laws to mask our anti-Semitism, our antipathy, our resentment. We are sorry for the callousness of Canada's response. And we are sorry for not apologizing sooner.\\" Trudeau also apologized for letting anti-Semitism take root in Canada and for the way Canadians Jews were \\"meant to feel like strangers in their own homes, aliens in their own land. \\"Your country failed you. And for that, we are sorry.\\" A persistent problem Trudeau went on to note that anti-Semitism continues to be a problem today in Canada. He said 17 per cent of all hate crimes target Canadian Jews — meaning the Jewish community experiences a far higher per-capita rate of hate crimes than any other group in Canada. \\"Discrimination and violence against Jewish people in Canada and around the world continues at an alarming rate,\\" he said. \\"Less than two weeks ago, not too far from here, a gunman opened fire on worshippers at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, killing eleven people and wounding six others.\\" Jewish passengers of the MS St. Louis, a refugee ship turned away from Canada in 1939, returned to Europe to face Nazi persecution and the Holocaust. (cbc) The prime minister said that anti-Semitism and other forms of xenophobia have no place in Canada or the world, and that education is the the \\"most powerful tool against the ignorance and cruelty that fuelled the Holocaust.\\" Trudeau said that in the wake of the Pittsburgh attack, Canadian Jews are understandably feeling vulnerable. He pledged to do more to protect Jewish places of worship. While the apology will not ease the pain for those who lost family members on the MS St. Louis, Trudeau said he hopes it will bring them some sense of peace. \\"More than 70 years ago, Canada turned its back on you,\\" he said. \\"But today, Canadians pledge, now and forever — never again.\\" Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer taking part in the Canadian government's official apology for the 1939 decision to turn away the MS St. Louis and its 907 German Jewish passengers fleeing the Nazi Regime. 10:43 \\"It is a sign of a healthy society to be able to look at history clearly and see both the light and the dark, to celebrate our achievements but to also mourn our failings,\\" Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said. \\"There is no shame as a country in acknowledging shameful acts in our past.

The six tanks contain the following numbers of fish:x1=5{displaystyle x_{1}=5}x2=5{displaystyle x_{2}=5}x3=8{displaystyle x_{3}=8}x4=12{displaystyle x_{4}=12}x5=15{displaystyle x_{5}=15}x6=18{displaystyle x_{6}=18} Since a population contains all the data you need, this formula gives you the exact variance of the population. In order to distinguish it from sample variance (which is only an estimate), statisticians use different variables: σ2{displaystyle ^{2}} = (∑(xi{displaystyle x_{i}} - μ)2{displaystyle ^{2}})/n σ2{displaystyle ^{2}} = population variance. This is a lower-case sigma, squared. Variance is measured in squared units. xi{displaystyle x_{i}} represents a term in your data set. The terms inside ∑ will be calculated for each value of xi{displaystyle x_{i}}, then summed. μ is the population mean n is the number of data points in the population When analyzing a population, the symbol μ (\\"mu\\") represents the arithmetic mean. To find the mean, add all the data points together, then divide by the number of data points. You can think of the mean as the \\"average,\\" but be careful, as that word has multiple definitions in mathematics. Example: mean = μ = 5+5+8+12+15+186{displaystyle {frac {5+5+8+12+15+18}{6}}} = 10.5 Data points close to the mean will result in a difference closer to zero. Repeat the subtraction problem for each data point, and you might start to get a sense of how spread out the data is. Example:x1{displaystyle x_{1}} - μ = 5 - 10.5 = -5.5x2{displaystyle x_{2}} - μ = 5 - 10.5 = -5.5x3{displaystyle x_{3}} - μ = 8 - 10.5 = -2.5x4{displaystyle x_{4}} - μ = 12 - 10.5 = 1.5x5{displaystyle x_{5}} - μ = 15 - 10.5 = 4.5x6{displaystyle x_{6}} - μ = 18 - 10.5 = 7.5 Right now, some of your numbers from the last step will be negative, and some will be positive. If you picture your data on a number line, these two categories represent numbers to the left of the mean, and numbers to the right of the mean. This is no good for calculating variance, since these two groups will cancel each other out. Square each number so they are all positive instead. Example:(xi{displaystyle x_{i}} - μ)2{displaystyle ^{2}} for each value of i from 1 to 6:(-5.5)2{displaystyle ^{2}} = 30.25(-5.5)2{displaystyle ^{2}} = 30.25(-2.5)2{displaystyle ^{2}} = 6.25(1.5)2{displaystyle ^{2}} = 2.25(4.5)2{displaystyle ^{2}} = 20.25(7.5)2{displaystyle ^{2}} = 56.25 Now you have a value for each data point, related (indirectly) to how far that data point is from the mean. Take the mean of these values by adding them all together, then dividing by the number of values. Example:Variance of the population = 30.25+30.25+6.25+2.25+20.25+56.256=145.56={displaystyle {frac {30.25+30.25+6.25+2.25+20.25+56.25}{6}}={frac {145.5}{6}}=} 24.25 If you're not sure how this matches the formula at the beginning of this method, try writing out the whole problem in longhand: After finding the difference from the mean and squaring, you have the value (x1{displaystyle x_{1}} - μ)2{displaystyle ^{2}}, (x2{displaystyle x_{2}} - μ)2{displaystyle ^{2}}, and so on up to (xn{displaystyle x_{n}} - μ)2{displaystyle ^{2}}, where xn{displaystyle x_{n}} is the last data point in the set. To find the mean of these values, you sum them up and divide by n: ( (x1{displaystyle x_{1}} - μ)2{displaystyle ^{2}} + (x2{displaystyle x_{2}} - μ)2{displaystyle ^{2}} + ... + (xn{displaystyle x_{n}} - μ)2{displaystyle ^{2}} ) / n After rewriting the numerator in sigma notation, you have (∑(xi{displaystyle x_{i}} - μ)2{displaystyle ^{2}})/n, the formula for variance. Summary:","response":"This article talks about how to find the population variance, which shows how spread out the data is in a population. Imagine we have six fish tanks with different numbers of fish. To find the population variance, we first need to find the average number of fish (the mean). Then, we find the difference between each fish tank's number of fish and the mean. After that, we square these differences and add them all up. Finally, we divide the sum of the squared differences by the total number of fish tanks (6 in this case). This gives us the population variance, telling us how spread out the number of fish is across the six tanks."},{"question":"What's the most logical way to complete this passage?

The nuclear war which contaminated the northern hemisphere was preceded by a standoff between the United States and China after the latter blockaded and later invaded Taiwan. Both countries are destroyed, as is most of the world. The submarine crew finds refuge in Melbourne, Australia, which the radioactive fallout has not yet reached (though radio communications with several radio operators farther north than Australia indicate that radiation has reached their countries and will be in Australia in a few months). Towers places his vessel under the command of the Royal Australian Navy and is summoned to attend a briefing. When Towers (Armand Assante), Australian scientist Julian Osborne (Bryan Brown) and Australian liaison officer Peter Holmes (Grant Bowler) find out there is an automated digital broadcast coming from Alaska in the Northern Hemisphere, the submarine is sent to investigate. En route, the submarine surfaces in San Francisco, where the Golden Gate Bridge has collapsed and the city shoreline is in ruins. A crew member who is from San Francisco abandons ship, planning on dying in his home city, and is left by his shipmates after it is argued that the length of time he has spent outside has already made him sick with radiation sickness. Upon reaching Alaska, Towers and his executive officer go ashore to find no survivors. Entering a house and seeing a dead family huddled on a bed, Towers thinks of his own family and what they must have gone through.

People from Salt village used regular salt, while people from Sand village people used iodized salt in their diets, after talking to specialists. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which village had fewer people experience developmental difficulties? Hint: Before iodized salt was developed, some people experienced a number of developmental difficulties, including problems with thyroid gland function and mental retardation. In the 1920s, we learned that these conditions could usually be treated easily with the addition of iodide anion to the diet. One easy way to increase iodide intake was to add the anion to table salt. This simple step greatly enhanced health and development. Large amounts of iodide ion are also found in seaweed such as kelp (see picture above) and saltwater fish. Answer:","response":"Based on the information provided, it can be deduced that the village that had fewer people experience developmental difficulties is the Sand village. This conclusion can be reached considering the information provided in the hint, highlighting the significant role of iodide anion (found in iodized salt) in the prevention and treatment of certain developmental difficulties. Before the development of iodized salt, there were issues related with the thyroid gland's function and mental retardation. However, in the 1920s, it was discovered that these conditions could be drastically improved by simply increasing the iodide intake in the diet. A straightforward way of doing this was by mixing iodide into table salt, thus creating iodized salt. Now, relating this back to the two villages: people in the Salt village consumed regular salt, which lacks the crucial ingredient of iodide anion, while the residents of Sand village, after consulting with specialists, decided to include iodized salt in their diets. The usage of iodized salt means that the people of the Sand village were getting an abundance of iodide in their diets, negating the risks of those specific developmental difficulties mentioned earlier. Moreover, large amounts of iodide, similar to the content in iodized salt, can also be found in certain types of seaweed like kelp, and in saltwater fish. This additional information furthers the assumption that diets balanced with iodide can bring about a positive impact on health and development. Therefore, considering all the information provided and based on historical understanding and scientific knowledge regarding iodide's role in health, the Sand village, which used iodized salt, would likely see fewer instances of developmental difficulties amongst its population."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the first name of the man that is fired for being German-born? In 1916, childhood best friends, Bob Wilson and Fred von Bergen, are test pilots working for an American company that builds bombers for the European allies. Since he is German-born and faces prejudice against his heritage, Fred loses his job and, unable to find other employment, decides to return to Germany to fight for his homeland.

As the United States is drawn into the war, instead of sending him into a crucial air battle, Wolters arrests Bob. Fred, heartbroken that Alida has chosen Bob, quarrels with his friend, calling him a coward. Later, however, Fred allows his friend to escape from a firing squad and flee to the Allied lines. To prove his allegiance, Bob leads British bombers to the German base, while Fred is told by Wolters that he must shoot down Bob to prove his loyalty.

Burges died, aged 53, in his Red Bed at the Tower House, at 11.45 p.m. on Wednesday 20 April 1881.

He was buried in the tomb he designed for his mother at West Norwood, London. On his death, John Starling Chapple, Burges's office manager and close associate for more than twenty years, wrote \\"a constant relationship ... with one of the brightest ornaments of the profession has rendered the parting most severe.

Premise: \\"A girl in a bikini top and shorts poses for a picture on a mountain overlooking a lake.\\" Hypothesis: \\"A child is getting their picture taken in front of a lake.\\" Do we know that the hypothesis entailed by the premise?. Step-by-step reasoning:","response":"Step 1: Identify the common elements in the premise and hypothesis. The common elements are: - Picture taking - A person (in the premise, it refers to a girl; in the hypothesis, it refers to a child) - A location that involves a lake Step 2: Analyze the differences between the premise and hypothesis. 1. The person's age: The premise mentions \\"a girl,\\" while the hypothesis says \\"a child.\\" It is important to note that the term \\"girl\\" can refer to a child, teenager, or young adult. The term \\"child\\" typically refers to someone who is younger, usually below the age of 12. 2. The person's attire: The premise specifies that the girl is wearing a bikini top and shorts. The hypothesis does not mention any clothing detail. 3. The location: In the premise, the girl is posing on a mountain overlooking a lake, while the hypothesis only mentions that the child is \\"in front of a lake.\\" Step 3: Examine whether the differences negate the hypothesis. 1. The person's age: Although the hypothesis uses the word \\"child,\\" and the premise uses the word \\"girl,\\" they do not necessarily contradict each other. The girl in the premise could still possibly be a child. 2. The person's attire: The attire mentioned in the premise doesn't negate the hypothesis, as it is still in line with someone getting their picture taken. It's just an additional detail not present in the hypothesis. 3. The location: The main difference is that the premise specifies the girl is posing on a \\"mountain overlooking the lake,\\" while the hypothesis specifies she is \\"in front of a lake.\\" These two descriptions do not outright contradict each other since a scenic viewpoint from a mountain could arguably still be considered \\"in front of the lake.\\" Conclusion: Despite the differences between the premise and hypothesis, these differences are not sufficient to prove that the hypothesis is entirely incorrect. Based on the common elements and the somewhat overlapping descriptions, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis is negated or disproved by the premise. In summary, it is plausible that, based on the premise given, a child could be getting their picture taken in front of a lake."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: The First of March is my most hated day of the year.

Output:","response":"72 To solve this problem, we can break it down into a few steps using the definition of the problem. 1. We know Isabel bought 4 country albums and 5 pop albums, so to find the total number of albums she bought, we add the two numbers: 4 (country albums) + 5 (pop albums) = 9 (total albums). 2. Since each album has 8 songs, we can find the total number of songs by multiplying the number of albums by the number of songs per album: 9 (total albums) * 8 (songs per album) = 72 (total songs).

Context: When we got married we thought it was going to be all bliss and happiness for life. By about week two we both had an awakening. Something about being exact opposites and together 24/7. We clashed about something so important I can’t even remember what it was. We hadn’t really ever had that happen while engaged. Suddenly we realized that the bliss and excitement was growing into, well, everyday life. And all that passionate romance that had driven our relationship was growing, well, less passionate. We both realized our marriage had entered a new phase, one of many, through the years. And we needed to be much more purposeful about making sure it worked. Purposeful because the blinding emotional love some days seemed to be asleep. Yet, we both had committed to our marriage. For better or worse. So we decided we had the potential for either. We needed to make it better or it would become worse. We learned to really talk. Even when it was difficult. We learned to argue without hurting each other. We purposefully expressed love even in those times we didn’t especially feel it. We built romance into our relationship even when we didn’t feel romantic. And through the years our relationship has grown. Sometimes through difficult times. Heck, sometimes through difficult eras. Yet, we both never gave up the dream of making our marriage great. We never gave up the ideal of living together in love for a lifetime. And because of that, through all the trials and triumphs. Through all the frustration and bliss. Through all the sameness and romance. We still everyday enjoy our love and each other. And can’t imagine life without the other. Well actually, there have been probably a couple of those days for my wife. She’s just too nice to say it. A great marriage isn’t built because it’s perfect. Only because you keep trying to make it perfect. Question: Why has their relationship grown? Options: A. they were together all day, every day B. they purposefully tried to make it work C. they were totally different D. not enough information The answer is:","response":"B. they purposefully tried to make it work Based on the context given, the couple's relationship has grown because they purposefully tried to make it work. Even though they faced some issues and disagreements after they got married, they did not give up on their relationship. They recognized that their marriage had entered a new phase and that they needed to be more intentional in their efforts to make the relationship work. This effort included learning to communicate effectively, even during difficult times, and to express love even when they didn't particularly feel the emotion. They also purposefully introduced romance into their relationship when it wasn't spontaneously present. They never gave up on their dream of having a great marriage and they kept striving to achieve it. It was this continuous effort and determination that allowed their relationship to grow. While being together all the time (Option A) may have put pressure on their relationship, it wasn't the reason why their relationship grew. Similarily, being completely different from each other (Option C) may have led to disagreements, but it wasn't the contributing factor to their growing relationship based on the context. The context provided enough information to select the correct response (dismiss Option D).

Article: Most people think that the older you get, the harder it is to learn a new language. That is, they believe that children learn more easily and efficiently than adults. Thus, at some point in our lives, maybe around age 12 or 13, we lose the ability to learn languages well. Is this idea a fact or myth ? Is it true that children learn a foreign language more efficiently than adults? On the contrary, research studies suggest that the opposite may be true. One report, on 2,000 Danish children studying Swedish, concluded that the teenagers learned more, in less time, than the younger children. Another report, on Americans learning Russian, showed a direct improvement of ability over the age range tested; that is, the ability to learn increased as the age increased, from childhood to adulthood. There are several possible explanations for these findings. For one thing, adults know more about the world and therefore are able to understand meanings more easily than children. Moreover, adults can use logical thinking to help themselves see patterns in the language. Finally, adults have more self-discipline (self-control) than children. All in all, it seems that the common idea that children are better language learners than adults may not be a fact, but a myth. Question: The main idea of the passage is _ .

Just listen to a few songs, you'll understand.Why Trent?!?! Why?!?! Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? The answer is:","response":"This review undoubtedly depicts the product – in this case, the album – in an unflattering light. The reviewer, who identifies themselves as a true fan of Nine Inch Nails (NIN), expresses their strong dissatisfaction with the album and even goes as far as to express sadness due to the disappointment they experienced. Several elements within the review contribute to this negative portrayal of the product: 1. Disappointment: The reviewer's use of the word \\"disappoint\\" highlights their dissatisfaction with the album, as it did not meet the expectations they had as a fan. 2. Genuine emotional response: By stating that they are \\"truly sad,\\" the reviewer conveys a powerful, genuine emotional reaction that emphasizes just how disheartening they found the album. 3. Lack of detailed description: The reviewer refrains from providing a detailed explanation of why they did not like the album, instead encouraging others to listen to a few songs in order to understand. This implies that they believe the album's shortcomings are so evident that a detailed critique is unnecessary. 4. Direct address to the artist: The reviewer directly questions Trent Reznor, NIN's frontman, with the phrases \\"Why Trent?!?! Why?!?!\\" This personalizes the disappointment experienced by the reviewer, signifying that they expected better from the artist they had admired. In conclusion, this product review casts the album in an unflattering light, as the negative reaction from the reviewer is expressed through multiple aspects. The discontent is palpable, and the disappointment seems to originate from a genuine place of admiration for the artist.

Megan's memory is a lot sharper than Rebecca's is due to","response":"several factors that contribute to the differences in their cognitive abilities. These factors can be broadly categorized into genetic, environmental, lifestyle, and cognitive factors that interact in various ways to shape an individual's memory and cognitive proficiency. 1. Genetic factors: Genetics play a significant role in determining a person's memory capacity and cognitive skills. Megan may have inherited strong genetic traits from her parents that contribute to a superior memory. On the other hand, Rebecca's genetic makeup may not be as strongly inclined toward an enhanced memory, making a difference in their cognitive abilities. 2. Environmental factors: The environment in which Megan and Rebecca were raised can be another crucial factor for the difference in their memory. If Megan was exposed to a stimulating and engaging environment from an early age, her brain would have developed stronger neural connections necessary for better memory retention. In contrast, Rebecca might not have had the same level of exposure to fruitful environmental stimuli, leading to her weaker memory compared to Megan's. 3. Lifestyle factors: The impact of lifestyle on memory and cognitive skills cannot be overemphasized. Factors like proper nutrition, regular exercise, and quality sleep contribute significantly to brain health and cognitive prowess. Megan might have maintained a healthy lifestyle, allowing her brain to function optimally and, in turn, enhancing her memory. On the contrary, Rebecca could have neglected essential lifestyle practices, putting her at a disadvantage when it comes to memory and cognitive skills. 4. Cognitive training: Megan's superior memory could also be attributed to her proactive approach to cognitive training. She may have consistently engaged in activities like puzzles, memory games, and other mental exercises aimed at improving memory retention and cognitive flexibility. These practices eventually strengthened Megan's memory over time. At the same time, Rebecca might not have partaken in such activities, leading to the disparity in their cognitive capabilities. 5. Emotional wellbeing: Emotional health can have a considerable impact on memory and overall cognitive function. High levels of stress and anxiety can impair memory retention and recall. Megan might have an effective coping mechanism to deal with stress, ensuring her emotional wellbeing and, in turn, positively impacting her memory. On the other hand, Rebecca might struggle with emotional management, leading to a diminished memory capacity. 6. Interest and motivation: Lastly, the level of interest and motivation in acquiring new information can influence memory retention. If Megan is more motivated to learn and invests more effort into encoding and retaining information, her memory will naturally be sharper than Rebecca's. If Rebecca lacks the same enthusiasm or eagerness, her memory performance will suffer in comparison. In conclusion, Megan's sharper memory compared to Rebecca's can be attributed to a complex interplay of genetic, environmental, lifestyle, cognitive, emotional, and motivational factors. By understanding these factors and working on self-improvement in these areas, Rebecca might be able to enhance her memory and attune her cognitive skills to match Megan's level. However, it is important to remember that everyone's memory capacity and cognitive abilities are unique, and the focus should be on developing to one's full potential."},{"question":"Given the following passage \\"In June 1963, Rev.

Question: How was vinyl better than shellac when it came to records? Context: In 1931, RCA Victor introduced their vinyl-based Victrolac compound as a material for some unusual-format and special-purpose records. By the end of the 1930s vinyl's advantages of light weight, relative unbreakability and low surface noise had made it the material of choice for prerecorded radio programming and other critical applications. When it came to ordinary 78 rpm records, however, the much higher cost of the raw material, as well as its vulnerability to the heavy pickups and crudely mass-produced steel needles still commonly used in home record players, made its general substitution for shellac impractical at that time. During the Second World War, the United States Armed Forces produced thousands of 12-inch vinyl 78 rpm V-Discs for use by the troops overseas. After the war, the wider use of vinyl became more practical as new record players with relatively lightweight crystal pickups and precision-ground styli made of sapphire or an exotic osmium alloy proliferated. In late 1945, RCA Victor began offering special transparent red vinyl De Luxe pressings of some classical 78s, at a de luxe price. Later, Decca Records introduced vinyl Deccalite 78s, while other record companies came up with vinyl concoctions such as Metrolite, Merco Plastic and Sav-o-flex, but these were mainly used to produce \\"unbreakable\\" children's records and special thin vinyl DJ pressings for shipment to radio stations.

The short then focuses to the present day and reveals the pigs now play modern instruments and perform as The Three Little Bops. During a gig at the House of Straw, the Big Bad Wolf appears and proves he is friendly by stating that he wants to join the band. The Wolf happens to be terrible at playing his choice instrument (a trumpet) so the pigs throw him out.

The situation is further complicated by reports that LeMoine, now considered a fugitive, is attempting to evade the authorities by seeking refuge in Cuba. With Barron planning to sue both Lohan and LeMoine, the case continues to gain prominence amidst the ongoing turbulence in Hollywood's elite circles. The Mastermind Controversy The alleged incident involving Barron Hilton and Lindsay Lohan has been one of the most controversial episodes within the Hollywood community in recent times. According to numerous reports, Barron, who is Paris Hilton's younger brother, has accused the Mean Girls actress of orchestrating an attack on him in Miami late last year. It was claimed that Lohan had instructed her close acquaintance, Ray LeMoine, to assault Barron in an altercation that left the young Hilton sibling with several bruises and cuts. Despite initial denials from Lohan and her representatives, several witnesses have come forward claiming to have seen the actress egging LeMoine on during the attack. This has understandably increased the pressure on law enforcement agencies to arrest those involved and bring them to justice. Imminent Arrest and Legal Battle With mounting evidence against both Lohan and LeMoine, the authorities have declared that the arrest of LeMoine is now imminent, with several law enforcement sources stating that they are closing in on the perpetrator. The arrest is expected to have a significant impact on Lohan's career, who has been making strides toward revitalizing her public image in recent years. Meanwhile, Paris Hilton's brother is reportedly preparing to take legal action against both Lohan and LeMoine. If found guilty, the two celebrities could face substantial financial penalties as well as further damage to their already tarnished reputations. The Fugitive: LeMoine's Escape to Cuba As the net slowly tightens around him, reports suggest that Ray LeMoine is currently 'on the run from authorities' and is attempting to seek refuge in Cuba. Cuba has a complex legal relationship with the United States, making it a potential safe haven for fugitives looking to escape the arm of the law. While the details of LeMoine's potential escape plan are still murky, it is clear that both law enforcement agencies and the Hilton family will be keeping a close eye on developments in the case. If LeMoine is apprehended, it could act as a new chapter in the legal battle against Lindsay Lohan and her alleged involvement in the attack. Conclusion: While facts surrounding the case continue to emerge, the imminent arrest of Ray LeMoine and the potential lawsuit against both him and Lohan by Barron Hilton has the potential to significantly reshape the careers, lives, and reputations of all parties involved. As LeMoine allegedly plans his escape to Cuba, the implications of such developments are sure to send shockwaves throughout Hollywood's elite circles and add yet another complex layer to an already complicated set of circumstances."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: FINAL EXAM Question 1.

Step 1: Understand the background information. In the given background, it is mentioned that before iodized salt was developed, people experienced developmental difficulties, including problems with thyroid gland function and mental retardation. Adding iodide anion to the diet helped treat these conditions. Step 2: Analyze the new situation. In the new situation, people from Salt village used regular salt, while people from Sand village used iodized salt in their diets after talking to specialists. Step 3: Apply the background information to the new situation. Since iodized salt contains iodide anion, which is beneficial in preventing developmental difficulties, people consuming iodized salt, i.e., the residents of Sand village, are more likely to have fewer developmental issues when compared to the residents of Salt village, who used regular salt that lacks the iodide anion. Conclusion: The Sand village, where people used iodized salt, had fewer people experience developmental difficulties compared to the Salt village."},{"question":"In this task, you are given a sentence in Persian, and your task is to translate it into English.

Stream-of-consciousness explanation: Human beings are complex and multifaceted creatures with a wide range of emotions and thoughts. While it's true that our facial expressions and body language can often give others some insight into what we're thinking or feeling, it's important to remember that this is not always the case. For instance, some people might have resting facial expressions that give off a certain vibe, even though their thoughts and emotions might be completely different from what their appearance suggests. On top of that, different people might exhibit the same facial expressions or body language for entirely different reasons. Think about a person who's nervously biting their nails; they might be anxious, but they could also be bored or hungry. Moreover, cultural differences can influence how we interpret certain expressions or gestures, making it even more difficult to accurately deduce someone's emotions or thoughts. In addition, it's important to remember that no single facial expression or body language cue can paint a complete picture of a person's emotional state. Humans often experience multiple emotions simultaneously, and their body language may only reflect one aspect of what they're feeling. As a result, it can be immensely challenging to pin down someone's exact thoughts without considering other contextual factors, such as their tone of voice or the situation they're in. Finally, even individuals who may be considered experts in body language, like psychologists or trained interrogators, cannot predict a person's thoughts or feelings with 100% accuracy. People are capable of masking or misrepresenting their emotions, and no two people will exhibit the exact same cues or signs. In conclusion, it is not possible to tell the exact thoughts and emotions of a person based solely on their facial expressions and body language. Many factors come into play, making it a complex and nuanced area of study, with much room for interpretation and error."},{"question":"The exercise is to decide whether the question accepts the proposed suggestion as a correct answer.

He couldn't answer as I knew, but he tried to smile, all the time keeping his foot close to mine. My thoughts raced back more than thirty years--to the dark days of 1941, when I was a student in London. The scene was an air-raid shelter , in which I and about a hundred other people slept every night. Among them were Mrs. West and her son Frank, who lived nearby. Sharing wartime problems, we got to know each other very well. Frank interested me because he was not normal . He had never been normal, ever since he was born. His mother told me he was 37 then, but he had less of a mind than a baby has. Mrs. West, then about 75, was a strong, able woman, as she had to be of course, because Frank depended on her completely. He needed all the attention of a baby. One night a policeman came into our shelter and told Mrs. West that her house had been all destroyed. That wasn't quite true, because the West went on living there for quite some time. But they certainly lost nearly everything they owned. When that kind of thing happened, the rest of us helped the unlucky ones. So before we separated that morning, I stood beside Frank and measured my right foot against his. They were about the same size. That night, then, I took a spare pair of shoes to the shelter for Frank. As soon as he saw me, he came running--and placed his right foot against mine. After that, he always greeted me in the same way. Question: Why did Dr P say that Mrs West had to be a strong, able woman? Yes or no, is the answer \\"She had to give care and thought to her son as to a baby.\\"? A:","response":"Yes, the answer \\"She had to give care and thought to her son as to a baby\\" explains why Dr. P said that Mrs. West had to be a strong, able woman. Her son Frank had special needs and depended on her completely, requiring the same level of attention and care as a baby. Being responsible for providing this care and support, Mrs. West needed to be strong and able in order to meet Frank's needs and make sure he was well-taken care of."},{"question":"You are considering whether to buy a product.

Barry is a kind, honest, and caring person. Wesley, despite being close to Barry, is more competitive and often lets his ambitions cloud his judgment. Step 2: Establish the setting Set the story in a small suburban town where the characters have lived their lives. The town hosts an annual community event, which brings people together to engage in various activities and competitions. Step 3: Introduce the conflict Barry, who is usually a low-key individual, has been practicing for a charity talent show that is held as part of the community event. Wesley, who is always seeking opportunities to establish superiority, finds out about Barry's participation, and enlists himself as a participant. Step 4: Escalate the tension As the day of the talent show approaches, both Barry and Wesley become engrossed in their respective practices.

This can actually result in making the core body temperature lower, as it allows for easier heat exchange with a cold external environment. Answer:","response":"Dan experienced a lower sensation of warmth compared to Tom."},{"question":"Here is a review left by a customer on a product. Would you say he was satisfied or dissatisfied?

In the premise, we talk about two stories. In the first story, there's a boy named Riley who dislikes his Aunt Kate and wishes she lived in a very sad time in history called slavery. In the second story, a pilot also feels bad things towards a farmer who helped him after his crash. Now let's look at the hypothesis. It says that in these stories, two black men, Riley and Ellison, experience tragedies in black history. But wait! Ellison is not a character in these stories. He's the writer who created them. So, if we think about it, the hypothesis isn't really right.

The best course of action is to analyze the context and assess which of the following suggestions is most appropriate: 1. Dave - This could be the name of the person talking to Mitch. By having the name inserted, it would emphasize the age difference between the two while continuing the conversation about their participation in the activity. 2. buddy - This word can be used as a colloquial way of referring to the other person in the conversation, making the discussion feel more casual and friendly. Using \\"buddy\\" would maintain the tone and convey that even though one person is older, they're still willing to participate. 3. sir - This term can indicate a form of respect to the person Mitch is speaking with, while also highlighting that they are of an older age.

The film begins with the Descendents' origins in the neighboring communities of Hermosa Beach and Manhattan Beach, California in the late 1970s. Middle school friends Frank Navetta and Dave Nolte start the band in 1977 by writing songs together on guitar. Classmate Bill Stevenson impresses them with his musical talents and becomes their drummer. In 1979 they meet bassist Tony Lombardo in Long Beach and recruit him to the band. Nolte bows out to join his brothers in The Last, and Navetta, Stevenson, and Lombardo record the Descendents' debut single. Stevenson's high school classmate Milo Aukerman joins the band as lead singer, and the new lineup builds a local following through their catchy and melodic songs, energetic live shows, and Aukerman's image as a nerd. They release the Fat EP (1981) and their debut album Milo Goes to College (1982), so named because Aukerman leaves the band to study biology. Stevenson drums in Black Flag for the next few years. In 1985 the Descendents reconvene for a second album, I Don't Want to Grow Up. Navetta has burned all of his equipment and moved to Oregon, and is replaced by Ray Cooper. Stevenson pushes for the band to tour, but Lombardo declines and quits. He is replaced by Doug Carrion, and this lineup records 1986's Enjoy!, after which Cooper and Carrion both leave the band. Stevenson recruits bassist Karl Alvarez from Salt Lake City, who brings in his close friend Stephen Egerton to play guitar. The new lineup releases the 1987 album All, themed around the philosophical concept of \\"All\\" invented by Stevenson and friend Pat McCuistion.

FATE stands for the horse's result in the race, STARTING_PRICE often refers to the initial betting odds, and FENCE could likely refer to the number of fences the horse jumped over during the race. Using this understanding, let's form the sentence. Step 1: Identify the subject Our subject here is \\"Dark Venetian\\" which is presumably the name of a racehorse. Step 2: Include the FATE We know that Dark Venetian's fate was that it fell during the race.

There could be various reasons why an individual might change their outfit when finding out they are wearing the same outfit as someone else. Possible reasons for Riley's decision could include: 1. A desire for individuality: Riley may have wanted to express their unique style and personality, and by wearing the same outfit as Ash, they might have felt they were not being true to themselves. 2. Avoid potential confusion: In some situations, wearing similar outfits can cause confusion or mistaken identity, especially if they are attending an event or gathering. Riley might have wanted to avoid any potential awkward moments by switching their outfit. 3. A sense of competition: Although not strictly the same as wanting to look better than Ash, Riley might have felt competitive and wanted to stand out from their friend. This does not necessarily mean they wanted to look \\"better\\" but rather, different. 4. A matter of personal comfort: Riley may have switched their outfit simply due to personal preferences or finding the bodysuit with jeans more comfortable than the original outfit.

Pogoing aside, Vicious had been involved in a notorious incident during that memorable second night of the 100 Club Punk Special. Arrested for hurling a glass at The Damned that shattered and blinded a girl in one eye, he had served time in a remand centre—and contributed to the 100 Club banning all punk bands. At a previous 100 Club gig, he had assaulted Nick Kent with a bicycle chain. Indeed, McLaren's NME telegram said that Vicious's \\"best credential was he gave Nick Kent what he deserved many months ago at the Hundred Club\\".

She takes a deep breath, gathering her composure, and stands up to face the mirror on the wall. As she observes her new belly button piercing in the mirror, she can't help but smile. The glint of the earring against her skin leaves her satisfied and proud of taking this step. She feels an added sense of confidence and self-expression that the piercing brings. She delicately touches the area around the piercing, feeling the soft, cool metal, and marvels at how it accentuates her body.

Breaking down the sentence, we can observe that the writer uses the phrase \\"no level whatsoever\\" which emphasizes a complete lack of compatibility, satisfaction, or appreciation. The choice of words and tone suggests that the movie did not work for the reviewer on any level, be it plot, acting, characters, or other technical aspects. Additionally, the phrase \\"for me\\" gives the sentence a personal touch, conveying that the opinion given stems from the particular taste or perception of the reviewer. Furthermore, analyzing the sentence's structure, the absence of any positive words or phrases helps strengthen the overall negative sentiment. No praise or constructive feedback is provided, which indicates that the reviewer is left feeling disappointed, unhappy, or dissatisfied after watching the movie.

The show seems to provide a comprehensive introduction to Dublin's history and Irish culture, making it an engaging experience for those who are unfamiliar with these subjects. The hypothesis, on the other hand, claims that there are no shows about the history of Dublin in the Arts Building. This statement is clearly inconsistent with the premise provided. Since the premise has established the existence of a show related to Dublin's history in the Arts Building, the hypothesis, which states the non-existence of any such shows, is effectively refuted.

The \\"zoom-and-enhance\\" technique that earned derision in the TV crime procedurals of recent years might not seem so ridiculous when current phone cameras are capable of capturing a fingerprint accurately enough for someone to steal it. Isao Echizen, a professor at the Digital Content and Media Sciences Research Division of the National Institute of Informatics, told Japanese newspaper Sankei Shimbun that he had successfully obtained fingerprints from photos of exposed fingers taken from up to three metres away. He warned against the popular peace sign pose specifically, since it's a trend that runs rampant in selfies in Japan. It easily allowed any would-be identity thieves to pair fingerprints with a face. His team at the National Institute of Informatics has developed a fingerprint anti-theft prevention technology. The titanium-oxide based substance can obscure and even produce false images of any fingerprints that find their way into frame. It may be a little early to sound the sirens on this one, but with biometric security becoming more and more commonplace on phones and computers, Echizen warned that while a password could be easily changed, a fingerprint or a retina? Not so much. ||||| Japanese scientists are warning consumers to stop flashing the peace sign in selfies because it is possible for identity thieves to detect and capture fingerprints from the image, which can be used to trick biometric sensors increasingly used to secure phones, PCs, financial services and apartment building door-locking systems. Researchers from Japan's National Institute of Informatics (NII) are warning that fingerprints can be read even if the photograph is taken 3m away from the subject, as long as the index finger and middle finger are clearly visible. This is a problem because many of these photographs end up on the internet or on popular apps like Instagram. All an identity thief has to do is find a photograph of you on the internet, analyse your fingerprints visible in the peace sign, and then save your fingerprints with your face. With your likeness on record and a scan of your prints, they can then attempt to commit identity theft. In the past, this would only be possible if a cybercriminal had a close-up photograph of your fingers, but with the advent of impressive front and rear-facing cameras on smartphone, the scientists were able to extract the information easily from selfies. The only saving grace is that this technique is not yet possible with the eyes, so you can't scan someone's retina from a casual photograph. \\"Even if you just casually show the peace sign to the camera, your fingerprint can be stolen,\\" Isao Echizu, professor of NII's digital content and media sciences research division told Japanese newspaper Sankei Shimbun. \\"Biometric information such as fingerprints cannot be changed over the course of a person's lifetime. I want to raise awareness so people know how to protect themselves.\\" A tranparent film sticker that stops fingerprint theft Echizu and his team have developed a new system that can prevent fingerprint identity theft – a transparent film that has white titanium oxide printed on it in a specific pattern. The idea is to put the film on your finger tips to not just obfuscate your fingerprint, but also to create a fake one to confuse cybercriminals. It might seem like a rather tedious thing to do, but the researchers argue that all you have to do is attach the transparent film to your index finger before you go out, and then, if you need to authenticate your identity to access your smartphone, a financial service or a door, you can still do so by using an authentication device that comes with the film. Biometric authentication is quickly becoming a way of life as fingerprint scanners are now being shipped to consumers on smartphones and PCs, but the technology is not foolproof. In 2015, FireEye security researchers discovered that it was possible to create malware that could hack into the Samsung Galaxy S5's fingerprint scanner to capture images of the user's fingerprints without alerting the phone that it was being hijacked. And before that, in 2013 members of the German white hat hacking group Chaos Computer Club succeeded in hacking the iPhone 5S' Touch ID fingerprint scanner by transposing the owner's fingerprint onto a thin strip of latex. The same group also succeeded in creating an accurate thumbprint of German defence minister Ursula von der Leyen from photos of her taken at a press conference, and then using a synthetic finger bearing her fingerprint to unlock her smartphone in 2014. ||||| Flashing the \\"peace\\" sign in photos could lead to fingerprint data being stolen, Japanese researchers said (AFP Photo/Mustafa Ozer) Tokyo (AFP) - Could flashing the \\"peace\\" sign in photos lead to fingerprint data being stolen? Research by a team at Japan's National Institute of Informatics (NII) says so, raising alarm bells over the popular two-fingered pose. Fingerprint recognition technology is becoming widely available to verify identities, such as when logging on to smartphones, tablets and laptop computers. Bu the proliferation of mobile devices with high-quality cameras and social media sites where photographs can be easily posted is raising the risk of personal information being leaked, reports said. The NII researchers were able to copy fingerprints based on photos taken by a digital camera three metres (nine feet) away from the subject. \\"Just by casually making a peace sign in front of a camera, fingerprints can become widely available,\\" NII researcher Isao Echizen told the Sankei Shimbun newspaper for an article published Monday. \\"Fingerprint data can be recreated if fingerprints are in focus with strong lighting in a picture,\\" Echizen also told Yomiuri TV. He added that advanced technology was not necessary and anyone could easily copy fingerprints. But NII says it has developed a transparent film containing titanium oxide that can be attached to fingers to hide their prints, the reports said. The film prevents identity theft but does not interfere with fingerprints being effective in identity verification, the Sankei Shimbun reported. But the technology would not be ready for another two years, the paper said. ||||| What is a summary?","response":"Flashing the peace sign in selfies could lead to identity theft due to the increased sophistication of smartphone cameras, which can capture detailed images of fingerprints from up to three meters away, warns Professor Isao Echizen from the Digital Content and Media Sciences Research Division at Japan's National Institute of Informatics.

Options: - basement - antarctic - house - cellar - heat building Reasoning process:","response":"A furnace is a device used primarily for heating an indoor space. Its purpose is to keep inhabitants comfortable, so it is designed and installed in a location with direct access to the area it is intended to warm. Let's examine the options: 1. Basement: Basements are typically used for storage or housing important systems like electrical wiring, plumbing, and other necessary items for a functional house. Furnaces are commonly installed in a home's basement as this a centralized part of the house and has easy access to the duct systems that distribute heat throughout the building. 2. Antarctic: The Antarctic is a continent located at the Earth's southernmost point. Answering with 'antarctic' would assume all furnaces are located there. While there are furnaces used in research stations or other facilities in the region, furnaces are used globally to heat indoor spaces, making this option incorrect. 3. House: A house is a general term for a residential building. Furnaces are primarily installed in houses to keep residents warm, but specifying 'house' doesn't narrow down the specific location within the house where the furnace is located. Thus, this option is not specific enough. 4. Cellar: A cellar is an underground room, often used for storage or housing wine. While some homeowners may install a furnace in a cellar, this is less common than installing it in a basement due to space limitations and reduced access to duct systems. Although it is possible, it is not the most common location. 5. Heat building: This phrase is too ambiguous to be a proper answer. It might refer to a building's purpose, such as a large commercial building used for heating other buildings or a structure designed to hold a furnace. However, it is not a widely recognized term or general location for a furnace. Given these options, the most common and accurate location for a furnace is the basement. Basements provide centralized access to the house's duct systems and are large enough to accommodate the size of a furnace. Therefore, the furnace usually heats in the basement."},{"question":"Given the question: Information: - Canada (French: ) is a country in the northern half of North America.

Based on that, here is a detailed and long answer: In today's fast-evolving world, where technology is consistently advancing, the demand for new and improved materials has also grown significantly. This has led to a paradigm shift in the way industries develop, manufacture, and use materials. Scientists, engineers, and technologists are striving to design and create innovative materials to meet various needs, ranging from enhancing everyday products, conserving energy, reducing environmental impacts, to improving safety and performance in countless applications. Broadly, the impacts of changing materials can be categorized into five significant aspects: 1. Environmental Impact: As industries increasingly focus on sustainability, the development of environmentally friendly materials has become paramount. The implementation of biodegradable, recyclable, and non-hazardous materials reduces the strain on the environment. For instance, replacing traditional plastics with biodegradable or bio-based plastics can reduce pollution and waste, providing considerable benefits to the ecosystems. Furthermore, creating materials that are energy-efficient or require fewer resources to produce contributes to a greener tomorrow. 2. Impact on Industry and Manufacturing: The introduction of new materials can substantially change the manufacturing landscape, as new processes and techniques need to be implemented for their production. For example, the growth of nanomaterials and composite materials has paved the way for advanced manufacturing processes, such as 3D printing and additive manufacturing. This revolution in material science accelerates the time-to-market of products and designs, allowing industries to adapt quickly and effectively to market demands. 3. Economic Impact: Changing materials can give rise to market disruption and create new economic opportunities. It can lead to the development of novel products and technologies, creating new industries and employment opportunities. For example, the emergence of electric vehicles (EVs) and their need for advanced battery materials has led to a new market for lithium-ion batteries, subsequently creating new jobs in the battery production sector. 4. Social Impact: As the development of new materials results in better and more efficient products, people's quality of life improves. For instance, advancements in the medical field, such as the development of bio-compatible materials for implants, have significantly enhanced the healthcare experience for patients. Similarly, advances in clothing materials and textiles, like moisture-wicking and thermal-regulating fabrics, have made wearing apparel more comfortable and functional for various activities. 5. Impact on Safety and Security: Innovative materials can greatly impact safety and security in various sectors. For example, the development of fire-resistant materials can significantly reduce the risk of fire outbreaks, while the introduction of bullet-resistant materials can provide increased protection for law enforcement officers. In aviation and aerospace, lightweight, high-strength materials like carbon-fiber-reinforced polymers (CFRPs) have led to safer and more efficient structures. In conclusion, the changing landscape of materials provides countless possibilities and opportunities for enhancing the world in which we live. As materials continue to evolve, their impacts can be felt across diverse industries and facets of life, leading to a more sustainable, efficient, and prosperous future. It is essential for researchers, engineers, and policymakers to work together in understanding and applying these innovations responsibly to maximize their benefits to humanity."},{"question":"Summarize this article: Attorney General Biden submitted the following letter to the editor to the Wilmington News Journal on April 2, 2014. Letter to the Editor John Sweeney The News Journal 950 W. Basin Road New Castle, DE 19720 Child sexual abuse cases are among the most serious cases a prosecutor handles. The harm to the victim is profound. A child is vulnerable, and never more so than when the perpetrator is a parent. Juxtaposed against the severity of the crime is the difficulty proving it in a court of law. When a child reports sexual abuse, it is often that child’s word against the word of the alleged perpetrator. Authorities who receive reports of abuse ensure that children are interviewed by the Children’s Advocacy Center, where an expert questions the child. Often, however, the child has made previous statements to members of his or her family, and frequently those statements differ in some respects. This is particularly true with very young children, who are on the cusp of being capable of relating an event in detail. The younger the child, the less detailed the account is likely to be. Authorities look for corroborating evidence to support the report of abuse. They search for forensic evidence, such as DNA. They look for medical evidence of abuse. When the abuse occurs on a date prior to the report and investigation, there is rarely forensic evidence available. Moreover, unless the abuse alleged is an act likely to inflict physical injury, evidence of medical trauma is likewise rare. Therefore, in child sexual abuse cases, the sum total of the evidence is often the word of the child against the word of the alleged perpetrator. The State bears the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, the highest standard in our justice system. For the State to meet that burden, the child must testify because a defendant has a Sixth Amendment constitutional right to confront witnesses against him. This means that the child must testify in a sterile courtroom before a room full of strangers. Before the child can even testify, the court must be satisfied that the child is competent, that is, whether the child knows the difference between right and wrong. This determination is made after the court questions the child. Assuming the child is deemed competent, the child faces additional trauma by having to recount the abuse in front of the very person who committed it. Trials generally occur several months to a year after the event. All memories fade with time, a child’s in particular. For these reasons, a prosecutor’s decision about whether to take a child sexual abuse case to trial or to resolve it through a negotiated plea requires the striking of a difficult balance. If the case proceeds to trial, and the jury returns a not guilty verdict, this means that the alleged perpetrator will walk away free, with no conditions attached. There will be no punishment. The defendant will not be required to register as a sex offender, will not be supervised by probation and parole, and will not receive sexual offense counseling. Indeed, he is free to resume his life, free to contact the child and to reenter the residence and resume his former life, absent a separate Family Court order to the contrary. All of these considerations were in the mind of the prosecutor assigned to this case. This was not a strong case, and a loss at trial was a distinct possibility. The only eyewitness to the crime was the four year old victim. There was no medical or forensic evidence of any kind. The defendant did not make a statement to the police, although he made an ambiguous apology to the victim’s mother. A conviction would have required twelve jurors to find unanimously, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the crime had occurred. In recognition of the weakness of the case, the assigned prosecutor offered a plea and sentence recommendation that guaranteed the defendant would be required to register as a sex offender, participate in court-ordered sex offender rehabilitation therapy and to have no contact with the victim and any other child under the age of sixteen. A loss at trial would have rendered any of these restrictions impossible. The judge who considered the appropriate sentence in this case did so after careful deliberation with due regard for all of the circumstances. The Truth in Sentencing Guidelines, which judges use to inform their exercise of discretion, called for a sentence of 0 to 22 months in jail. The Defendant had already entered treatment. The Defendant accepted responsibility. These factors are listed in the Guidelines as mitigators that the Court must take into account. Moreover, the parties had agreed upon the recommendation to the Court. The judge acted properly by imposing a sentence that placed the Defendant under supervision for a lengthy period of time, required him to complete counseling, placed him on the sex offender registry and prevented him from contacting the victim and any other child. Judge Jurden is an outstanding jurist. She carefully considers the salient factors in all criminal cases without any regard for wealth or social status. In this case, Judge Jurden exercised sound discretion based solely on the merits of the case before her. Nothing is more important than protecting children from harm. That is why I ran for office in the first place. One of my first acts in office was to create the Child Predator Task Force which, for the first time in Delaware, puts police and prosecutors side by side to identify and bring to justice the worst predators in society – those who seek to hurt Delaware’s children. This work has led to the convictions of more than 180 predators and the rescue of more than 120 children who were being abused or groomed for future abuse. This past year, with the help of the legislature, we created the Child Victims Unit to provide more effective investigation and prosecution of child death and injury cases. We have fought successfully for new laws that impose tough mandatory sentences on child pornographers, and this year, I am working with legislators to give kids targeted by predators even stronger protections. I commend the hard working, dedicated prosecutors who strive to achieve justice in each and every case. We will continue to fight for children. Sincerely, Joseph R. Biden, III Attorney General ||||| Buy Photo Superior Court Judge Jan Jurden (Photo: JENNIFER CORBETT/THE NEWS JOURNAL)Buy Photo Story Highlights Online petition seeking Superior Court Judge Jan Jurden's ouster has received more than 25,400 signatures. But allies in the legal community, defense lawyers as well as prosecutors, have rallied to her defense. Superior Court Judge Jan Jurden's decision to order probation instead of prison for a du Pont family heir who raped his young daughter has led to threats against her and calls for her removal from the bench. But allies in the legal community have rallied to her defense. Much of the outrage over Jurden's 2009 sentencing of Robert H. Richards IV for fourth-degree rape was over her notation that he would not \\"fare well'' in prison, a mitigating factor that she identified in her order. Delaware prosecutors and defense attorneys have said it is unusual for a judge to list someone's fitness for prison as a mitigator in a sentencing order, even though it is often argued that a frail or sickly defendant might get abused or suffer unduly in prison. Richards is the great-grandson of du Pont family patriarch Irenee du Pont and the son of Robert H. Richards III, a retired partner in the Richards Layton & Finger law firm. Story: Beau Biden defends handling of du Pont heir sex case Commentary: Beau Biden's letter on du Pont heir case Commentary: Take into account entire sentencing process Our view: Real questions about the Richards case Earlier story: Police investigated du Pont sex abuse claim Earlier story: Du Pont heir faces child sex lawsuit His case gained publicity last month when his ex-wife, Tracy, filed a lawsuit seeking damages for the rape of his daughter when she was three years old, and also claimed he sexually abused his toddler son. Police investigated claims about the son in 2010, but they said no charges were filed. Authorities said they will investigate the allegations in the lawsuit. The controversy surrounding Jurden erupted after a Sunday News Journal article about her sentence. She sentenced Richards to eight years in prison, but suspended the time behind bars for probation. Among other provisions, she ordered him to get sex offender's evaluation and treatment, and not to have contact with children under 16. Attorney General Beau Biden's office, which had originally charged him with two counts of second-degree rape punishable by a minimum prison term of 20 years, had given Richards the plea deal to fourth-degree rape and recommended probation. The story gained international attention, leading to at least three online petitions for Jurden's ouster. Emily Logan, director of activism and retention for www.Care2.com, said the site allows people across the globe to post petitions on a range of issues. One seeking Jurden's ouster has received more than 25,400 online signatures through Wednesday afternoon. \\"It's pretty crazy. It's our hottest petition right now,'' said Logan, who added that her group supports the petition. \\"Sexual assault and child abuse is something people are very passionate about,'' Logan said. \\"This petition focuses on the fact that this was a du Pont heir and it's a sort of 'money talks' situation where they were like, 'Oh, he has a bunch of money and we'll let him sit in his house.' The initial outrage is that suspending the sentence and that treatment should come first rather than prison wasn't proper punishment.'' While some want Jurden off the bench, others have threatened her, leading the state to provide her with security, said Patricia W. Griffin, state court administrator. \\"It's an ongoing investigation. We are taking the threats seriously, and making sure the judge is secured,'' Griffin said. Robert H. Richards IV, a du Pont family heir who raped his 3-year-old daughter nearly a decade ago but received no prison time now faces a lawsuit from his former wife that accuses him of sexually abusing his toddler son. (3/18/14) Jurden, who was appointed to a 12-year-term in 2001 and reappointed by Gov. Jack Markell last year, also applied to become a Supreme Court justice. Markell gave the seat to former Court of Chancery chief judge Leo E. Strine Jr. last month. Markell will have another appointment following the recent retirement announcement by Justice Jack Jacobs. Some in Delaware's legal community rushed to Jurden's defense. Bartholomew J. Dalton, former chief deputy attorney general and head of the sex crimes unit, reiterated a point others have made about the difficulty in proving child sex abuse cases involving relatives. Those cases can lead to plea bargains and probation for defendants, he said. Such deals don't make prosecutors happy, but can result in a felony conviction and listing the criminal on the state sex offenders registry, he said. \\"As someone who has prosecuted sexual abuse and continues to represent child sexual abuse victims, I can tell you there are few, if any, judges who I think would do as good a job as Jan Jurden on an everyday basis,'' Dalton said. \\"Now she's getting death threats because of her administration of justice when she was absolutely within sentencing guidelines and was following the recommendation of the the prosecutor. It's just incredibly unfair.'' Biden's office has not said why the deal was cut, and a redacted version of the court file does not offer details. But top aides to Biden have said it's extremely difficult to put a young child on the witness stand, where they would face cross-examination and further victimization. Richards' attorney, Eguene J. Maurer Jr., said Wednesday the state had no physical evidence to corroborate the claims of the child, and offered a deal that did not include mandatory prison time. While he argued at sentencing that Richards should receive probation and inpatient treatment, Maurer said he was concerned that Jurden might send his client to prison. \\"I can think of one case of vehicular homicide involving a young girl. I thought we were going to get three years and she gave nine years. She is tough on our side and tough on their side. She is intelligent, reasonable. You are not going to get a better judge.'' Former Superior Court Judge Peggy Ableman said prosecutors were likely hamstrung in the Richards case because the victim was so young . \\"A child is going to be absolutely the worst witness,'' Ableman said. \\"You have no idea what they are going to say or not say.'' Ableman said she did not know why Jurden noted the factor in her order that Richards would not \\"fare well'' in prison, but said her decision to sentence him to probation makes sense. While judges have the authority to levy sentences within statutory guidelines, they are urged to follow more lenient guidelines published by the Delaware Sentencing Accountability Commission, a group of judges and top state criminal justice officials. For the crime of fourth-degree rape, the recommended sentence is zero to 30 months in prison. \\"If you are routinely not following what the state recommends, then the defense attorney cannot say to their client, 'I think you should take this deal because the judge will probably do what the state recommends.' If the judge is going to be a loose cannon, you are not going to get pleas.'' Regardless of Jurden's decision in the Richards' case, Ableman said she is a credit to the bench. \\"She doesn't deserve to be painted in such an awful way. She is a very caring person and she is very concerned about children and children's rights.\\" Contact senior reporter Cris Barrish at (302) 324-2785, cbarrish@delawareonline.com or on Facebook.

Biden and his team had prosecuted. The case involved a young child who had been sexually abused by a parent, and the office had faced the difficult task of deciding whether to take the case to trial or resolve it through a negotiated plea. The decision was complicated by the fact that the only evidence in the case was the child's word against that of the alleged perpetrator, and the difficulties that can arise when trying to put a young child on the witness stand. In the end, the assigned prosecutor offered a plea agreement that guaranteed the defendant would be required to register as a sex offender, participate in court-ordered rehabilitation therapy, and have no contact with the victim and any other child under the age of 16. The judge who sentenced the defendant took into account the Truth in Sentencing Guidelines and various mitigating factors, such as the defendant's acceptance of responsibility and his agreement to the recommended sentence. The judge ultimately imposed a sentence that placed the defendant under supervision for a lengthy period of time, required him to complete counseling, placed him on the sex offender registry, and prevented him from contacting the victim and any other child. Biden highlighted the challenges involved in prosecuting child sexual abuse cases, including the lack of medical or forensic evidence, and the need for the child to testify in open court.

In a related move, President Obama said early Wednesday that he was open to cooperating with Russia in the campaign against the Islamic State, which has asserted responsibility for destroying the charter plane and for the deadly attacks in Paris on Friday, but only if the government of President Vladimir V.

In the wake of the Paris terrorist attacks on Nov 13 which killed at least 129 people, Russia and France agreed to coordinate their military and security services against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) militants in Syria. Mr Putin, speaking to his top military officials, had vowed merciless retaliation for the attacks, as warplanes from both countries unleashed bombs on the ISIS stronghold of Raqa earlier this week. \\"It's necessary to establish direct contact with the French and work with them as allies,\\" he said. The urgency of the unusual alliance was also due to Tuesday's revelation that ISIS was responsible for planting a homemade bomb that ripped apart a Russian passenger jet over Egypt on Oct 31. That incident claimed the lives of all 224 people on board, most of whom were Russians returning home from a vacation. Mr Putin responded by saying it was one of the bloodiest acts in modern Russian history, vowing that the effort to bring ISIS to justice would be relentless. \\"We will search for them everywhere wherever they are hiding.

They are experiencing fatigue and the desperate need for help. If no one comes to their aid, the following scenarios are highly probable: 1. Drowning: The writer repeatedly emphasizes their fear of drowning if they don't receive assistance. They state, \\"if you don't get over here, I am going to drown.\\" Moreover, they mention the panic setting in, making the situation even more perilous. Therefore, it is deducible that not getting help could lead to the tragic outcome of both the writer and their child drowning. 2. Exhaustion: The writer alludes to their weariness and the strain that comes with struggling to swim while carrying a child. An inability to find help will likely exacerbate the writer's exhaustion, putting both of them in a vulnerable situation and increasing the risk of drowning. 3. Emotional distress: Since the writer is yelling for help with increasing strength and passion, it is evident that they feel desperate and emotionally distressed. The absence of timely help will further amplify and prolong this emotional turmoil, which could have lasting effects on both the writer and the child. 4. Hypothermia: The passage doesn't provide specific details about the temperature and location; however, if this ordeal occurs in cold water, the writer and the child might be at risk of developing hypothermia. The longer they remain in the water without aid, the greater the likelihood of experiencing the dangerous effects of cold exposure. In conclusion, without help, the writer and child face possible drowning, exhaustion, emotional distress, and even hypothermia. This highlights the urgency in the writer's plea for assistance and the potential dire consequences should they not receive it."},{"question":"Please briefly summarize this news article: Autopsy: Former Kansas City Chiefs LB Jovan Belcher suffered from CTE at time of 2012 murder-suicide Updated SEP 30, 2014 1:28a ET An autopsy performed one year after Kansas City Chiefs linebacker Jovan Belcher fatally shot his 22-year-old girlfriend and killed himself found signs of chronic traumatic encephalopathy, the degenerative brain disease found in athletes and others with a history of repetitive brain injuries. Belcher, 25, killed Kasandra Perkins on Dec. 1, 2012, in the couple's home while his mother was caring for his baby daughter in a nearby room. He then sped from the residence to the Chiefs training facility, where he shot himself in the head in front of then-general manager Scott Pioli and then-coach Romeo Crennel. Belcher's mother, Cheryl Shepherd, filed a lawsuit in December in Jackson County Circuit Court in Kansas City alleging her son was subjected to \\"repetitive head trauma,\\" and that the Chiefs failed to provide adequate medical care before he killed his girlfriend and then committed suicide. That lawsuit and similar actions by more than 30 plaintiffs -- many of them former Chiefs players -- has been moved to federal court and subsequently set aside while a 765 million settlement between the league and various lawsuits is going through the approval process. \\"We're coming now within weeks of a decision where all of the NFL players have to make a decision to stay in our opt out of the settlement,\\" said Dirk Vandever, an attorney for one of three law firms representing plaintiffs in head-injury lawsuits against the Chiefs. The autopsy was performed last December at the request of lawyers for Zoey Belcher, the daughter of Jovan Belcher and Perkins. The results, sent in February to the attorneys and released to the media Monday, showed signs of CTE, which was also found in former NFL players Junior Seau and Dave Duerson, who both committed suicide. \\"The microscopic findings of neurofibrillary tangles in young person are fully consistent with the pathological presentation of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy as it is reported in the available medical literature,\\" the report concluded. *By clicking \\"SUBSCRIBE\\", you have read and agreed to the Fox Sports Privacy Policy and Terms of Use. Vandever said the law firms released the report now because of a heightened awareness of domestic abuse in the NFL after incidents involving top names like running backs Ray Rice and Adrian Peterson. \\"In the past month five different NFL players implicated in horrendous episodes in domestic violence,\\" he said. Ken McClain, whose firm also is involved in the lawsuits against the Chiefs, said the autopsy findings support what the plaintiffs have been saying all along: that repeated head trauma can cause players to become angry and lose control of their impulses. \\"The Chiefs knew he and his significant other were having major domestic violence issues and he had a major concussion two weeks before this happened,\\" McClain said. In a statement, the NFL said: \\"The NFL has a long history of a changing the rules of the game to make it safer on the field, providing players the best medical care, and updating protocols on diagnosing concussions, treating concussions, and returning to play after a concussion.\\" Chiefs spokesman Ted Crews declined to comment about the report, citing the ongoing litigation.

The correct answer is [D] because it continues the story logically by describing the woman's actions. She cuts the cat's claws and then gets up and runs away, possibly due to the cat's reaction or the completion of the task. [A] is incorrect because the woman clipping the cat's fur into her hair does not fit the context of the story and is somewhat odd or unrealistic behavior.

Four the fourth time in their last five games against the Jets, the Patriots won by three points or less (the exception being the butt-fumble game of 2012). The first seven drives of the game ended in punts. On the second play of the quarter, Amendola returned Ryan Quigley's punt 39 yards to the Jets 36. Eight plays later, Brady hit Gronkowski on a 3-yard touchdown pass for a 7-0 lead. The Jets countered on their next drive marching 87 yards in just over 6 minutes, scoring on Geno Smith's 20-yard touchdown pass to Jeff Cumberland to tie the game. After a Patriots three-and-out, the Jets drove 54 yards to the Patriots 8, but, like the first match-up, had to settle for a 26-yard field goal by Nick Folk and a 10-7 lead at halftime. The Patriots offensive line was dominated by Sheldon Richardson and the Jets defensive line, as they sacked Brady four times in the first half. The Patriots received the second-half kickoff, but were forced to punt. The Jets capitalized by marching 66 yards in just over 6 minutes to the Patriots 5-yard line, but only could muster a 23-yard field goal from Folk, extending the lead to 13-7. The Patriots drove 81 yards to the Jets 6, but Brady threw an incomplete pass on 3rd-and-2 and Gostkowski kicked a 24-yard field goal, trimming the deficit to 13-10. On the second play of the Jets next drive, Smith was intercepted by Jamie Collins at the Jets 40-yard line, he lateraled to Browner who reached the Jets 38. Eight plays later Jonas Gray scored on a 1-yard touchdown run, giving the Patriots a 17-13 lead on the third play of the fourth quarter. The Jets drove 59 yards to the Patriots 10, but on 2nd-and-8, Smith was sacked by Sealver Siliga for a 9-yard loss and an incomplete pass on 3rd-and-17 forced them to settle for a 37-yard field goal by Folk, trimming the deficit to 17-16 with 7:53 remaining. On the second play of the Patriots' next drive, Brady was intercepted by Marcus Williams at the Patriots 30-yard line. After two runs for 6 yards, Smith was sacked for a 10-yard loss on 3rd down by Dont'a Hightower, setting up Folk's 52-yard go-ahead field goal attempt, but Vince Wilfork blocked Folk's attempt, keeping the Patriots ahead 17-16. On the Patriots' next drive, two third-down conversions allowed the Patriots to run out the clock. With the win, the Patriots improved to 12-3, and they clinched home field advantage throughout the playoffs after the Broncos' loss to the Bengals on Monday night. This would wind up being Rex Ryan's last game against the Patriots as head coach of the New York Jets. The Patriots were far from outstanding on offense. Brady finished 23/35 but for just 146 yards and 1 touchdown with 1 interception. The Patriots combined for just 85 rushing yards on 24 carries, but the defense came through again. The Jets once again out-gained the Patriots in total yards, but yet again, couldn't score touchdowns, and fell to big plays by the Patriots.","response":"Based on the article, a possible question could be: How did the Patriots' defense contribute to their narrow victory over the Jets in the second game, and what was the final score of the game?"},{"question":"Information: - Charing Cross denotes the junction of Strand, Whitehall and Cockspur Street, just south of Trafalgar Square in central London.

Die Hitzewelle und die Dürre haben erhebliche Auswirkungen auf unsere Landwirtschaft, die Wasserversorgung und die Lebensqualität gehabt. Es ist von entscheidender Bedeutung, dass wir die Ursachen dieser Probleme erkennen und adäquate Lösungen entwickeln, um besser auf ähnliche Situationen in der Zukunft vorbereitet zu sein. Erstens müssen wir uns auf den Klimawandel und seine Folgen konzentrieren. Die steigenden Temperaturen und der zunehmende Wassermangel sind weitgehend auf den vom Menschen verursachten Klimawandel zurückzuführen. Es ist daher unerlässlich, dass wir ambitionierte Klimaziele verfolgen, um die Emissionen von Treibhausgasen zu reduzieren, die Erderwärmung zu begrenzen und die negativen Auswirkungen auf unsere Umwelt und Lebensgrundlagen abzumildern. Zweitens müssen wir unsere Wassernutzung nachhaltig gestalten.

Answer this question: How many higher was the divorce rates in 2004 compared to 1991?","response":"To compare the divorce rates in 2004 to 1991, we can calculate the difference in rates and then determine the percentage increase. First, let's find the difference in divorce rates: Divorce rate in 2004: 239.5 per 1,000 marriages Divorce rate in 1991: 191.2 per 1,000 marriages Difference: 239.5 - 191.2 = 48.3 per 1,000 marriages Now, let's calculate the percentage increase. We will use the following formula for percentage increase: Percentage Increase = (Difference / Original Value) * 100 In this case, the original value is the divorce rate in 1991, which is 191.2 per 1,000 marriages. Plugging in the values, we get: Percentage Increase = (48.3 / 191.2) * 100 = 25.26 % So, the divorce rate in 2004 was approximately 25.26% higher compared to 1991."},{"question":"Q:Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

Jacob's father, Billy (Gil Birmingham) wheels out after him, but Jacob phases into wolf form and races out into the pouring rain and the woods. Billy picks up the invitation: it's to Bella (Kristen Stewart) and Edward's (Robert Pattinson) wedding. Both Bella's parents receive wedding invitations. It's clear that Charlie (Billy Burke) is not thrilled with the engagement and is probably still upset with Edward for breaking Bella's heart. Renee (Sarah Clarke), on the other hand, is excited and has obviously been expecting the engagement as she shares the invitation with her husband, Phil (Ty Olsson).It's the day before the wedding and the Cullens are preparing their estate for the wedding, all under the direction of Alice (Ashley Greene), who has placed herself in charge, down to the last detail. She sends Bella home for 'lots of beauty sleep,' but Bella sleeps poorly; first, just before she goes to bed, Edward goes to see her and tell her of a time shortly after he was turned, when he struck out on his own to hunt humans for blood (even though his conscience ensured he only killed men who murdered and victimized other people), as a warning against Bella becoming a vampire; and then Bella has a nightmare where the Volturi-- Aro (Michael Sheen), Marcus (Christopher Heyerdahl) and Caius (Jamie Campbell Bower)-- are standing before them in place of the minister, and then suddenly both Edward's tuxedo and Bella's dress are covered in blood as they stand before a pile of bodies -- all of the wedding guests.Bella must face Alice on the wedding day after not having slept, but Alice is pleased to see Rosalie (Nikki Reed) finally starting to warm to Bella as the finality of Bella's joining the Cullen family is finally upon them all.

Place salmon on top and place sauce on the side of the salmon (like a moat).\\" - This step assembles the dish, arranging the elements of the recipe in an appealing manner. With the breakdown of these parts, we can create the output: \\"Pan-Seared Cajun Salmon with Smoked Salmon Tomato Wine Sauce and Mashed Potatoes\\" as it incorporates the main components (salmon, sauce, mashed potatoes), cooking method (pan-seared), and distinctive flavors (Cajun seasoning, smoked salmon, tomato wine sauce)."},{"question":"Given the question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the march that Con Whalen said was \\"a waste of time\\" though he enjoyed every step? ? Before the start of the Second World War, and the establishment of war-based industries, Jarvis's initiatives brought modest relief to Jarrow. By 1939, about 100 men were employed in a small furniture factory and up to a further 500 in various metal-based industries set up on the Palmer's site. Jarvis had acquired the obsolete liners Olympic and Berengaria, to be broken up at the yard. However, after their triumphant homecoming many of the marchers felt that their endeavour had failed. Con Whalen, who at his death in 2003 was the last survivor of those who marched the full distance, said that the march was \\"a waste of time\\", but added that he had enjoyed every step. His fellow marcher Guy Waller, on the 40th anniversary of the march in 1976, said that \\"[t]he march produced no immediate startling upsurge in employment in the town. It took the war to do that\\". These views are shared by most commentators and historians. The Daily Mirror columnist Kevin Maguire calls the march \\"a heroic failure\\", while Matt Dobson, in The Socialist, writes that \\"out of all the hunger marches its aims were the most diluted and it made the most modest gains\\". The historians Malcolm Pearce and Geoffrey Stewart provide a positive perspective, arguing that the Jarrow March \\"helped to shape [post-Second World War] perceptions of the 1930s\\", and thus paved the way to social reform.Perry observes that \\"the passage of time has transformed the Jarrow Crusade ... into a potent talisman with which many apparently seek association\\". Thus the Labour Party, which in 1936 shunned the march, later adopted it as \\"a badge of credibility\\". In 1950 the party featured the Jarrow banners on its election posters; the march then disappeared from view in an era of high employment, only to be invoked again when unemployment again became a political issue in the 1980s. In the late 20th century and beyond, Labour leaders—Michael Foot, Neil Kinnock, Tony Blair—have all associated themselves with the march. In October 1986, on the 50th anniversary, a group... The answer is:","response":"The Jarrow March"},{"question":"Olivier Eugene Charles Prosper Messiaen (French: [olivje mesja]; December 10, 1908 - April 27, 1992) was a French composer, organist, and ornithologist, one of the major composers of the 20th century. His music is rhythmically complex; harmonically and melodically he employs a system he called modes of limited transposition, which he abstracted from the systems of material generated by his early compositions and improvisations. He wrote music for chamber ensembles and orchestra, vocal music, as well as for solo organ and piano, and also experimented with the use of novel electronic instruments developed in Europe during his lifetime. He travelled widely and wrote works inspired by diverse influences ranging from Japanese music, the landscape of Bryce Canyon in Utah and the life of St. Francis of Assisi. Messiaen's next work was the large-scale La Transfiguration de Notre Seigneur Jesus-Christ. The composition occupied him from 1965 to 1969 and the musicians employed include a 100-voice ten-part choir, seven solo instruments and large orchestra. Its fourteen movements are a meditation on the story of Christ's Transfiguration. Shortly after its completion, Messiaen received a commission from Alice Tully for a work to celebrate the U.S. bicentennial. He arranged a visit to the US in spring 1972, and was inspired by Bryce Canyon in Utah, where he observed the canyon's distinctive colours and birdsong. The twelve-movement orchestral piece Des canyons aux etoiles... was the result, first performed in 1974 in New York. In 1971, he was asked to compose a piece for the Paris Opera. While reluctant to undertake such a major project, he was persuaded in 1975 to accept the commission and began work on his Saint-Francois d'Assise. The composition was intensive (he also wrote his own libretto) and occupied him from 1975 to 1979; the orchestration was carried out from 1979 until 1983. Messiaen preferred to describe the final work as a \\"spectacle\\" rather than an opera. It was first performed in 1983. Some commentators at the time thought that the opera would be his valediction (at times Messiaen himself believed so), but he continued to compose. In 1984 he published a major collection of organ pieces, Livre du Saint Sacrement; other works include birdsong pieces for solo piano, and works for piano with orchestra. In the summer of 1978, Messiaen retired from teaching at the Conservatoire. He was promoted to the highest rank of the Legion d'honneur, the Grand-Croix, in 1987. An operation prevented his participation in the celebration of his 70th birthday in 1978, but in 1988 tributes for Messiaen's 80th included a complete performance in London's Royal Festival Hall of St. Francois, which the composer attended, and Erato's publication of a seventeen-CD collection of Messiaen's music including a disc of the composer in conversation with Claude Samuel. Although in considerable pain near the end of his life (requiring repeated surgery on his back) he was able to fulfil a commission from the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, Eclairs sur l'au-dela..., which was premiered six months after his death. He died in Paris on April 27, 1992. On going through his papers, Loriod discovered that, in the last months of his life, he had been composing a concerto for four musicians he felt particularly grateful to, namely herself, the cellist Mstislav Rostropovich, the oboist Heinz Holliger and the flautist Catherine Cantin (hence the title Concert a quatre). Four of the five intended movements were substantially complete; Yvonne Loriod undertook the orchestration of the second half of the first movement and of the whole of the fourth with advice from George Benjamin. It was premiered by the dedicatees in September 1994.

Do these two sentences mean the same thing?","response":"Yes, these two sentences essentially mean the same thing but with slight differences in phrasing. Both sentences describe the original route starting at US 410 in Touchet and going north to Eureka before turning east towards SSH 3E west of Prescott.

In the first sentence, the route goes north to Eureka and then \\"to the east\\" to SSH 3E west of Prescott. The placement of \\"and\\" after \\"Eureka\\" helps emphasize the sequence of the movements - first north, and then east.

In the second sentence, the route goes north to Eureka \\"and east\\" to SSH 3E west of Prescott.

However, his party plans fail miserably as parents and local authorities crack down, fueled by their shared experience of having dealt with his brother Steve's antics in the past. Determined to take a new path and create his own legacy, Matt decides to pursue his passion for music. He joins East Great Falls High School's struggling band, much to the chagrin of the school's popular kids and his fellow band members, who aren't thrilled about having a Stifler in their midst. Matt's initial goal is to use the band to win the heart of his crush, Allison, the school's talented and enigmatic band lead vocalist. As the band practices for the prestigious National High School Band Competition, they face numerous obstacles. Matt's partying lifestyle clashes with the discipline needed for their rigorous rehearsals, and his past antics haunt the band’s reputation. A rival school band, led by the snobbish and intimidating Brandon, is hellbent on crushing them in the upcoming competition. The band not only have to face external challenges but also have to navigate their own internal issues, such as jealousy, clashing egos, and creative differences. Throughout the movie, a series of flashbacks and anecdotes reveal that Steve, unbeknown to his younger brother, was a talented musician in high school who opted for a wild lifestyle instead of pursuing this passion. This revelation adds depth to Matt's resolve and determination to make it as a musician. As the plot thickens, Matt begins to evolve as a character, gradually becoming more responsible, dedicated, and supportive. His fellow band members notice this transformation and begin to accept him, giving the band a newfound sense of unity. Allison ultimately becomes attracted to Matt not just for his looks or charm but for his passion for music and his genuine growth as a person. The climax of the movie takes place at the National High School Band Competition. The East Great Falls High School band gives a phenomenal performance, showcasing their hard work and the unlikely combination of personalities that make up the group. In an exhilarating finale, the band clinches victory over their rivals, and Matt and Allison share a celebratory, intimate moment. In the closing scenes of the film, Steve, who has been absent for most of the movie, surprisingly reappears to show his support, demonstrating his pride in Matt for overcoming the \\"Stifler curse\\" and forging his own path. The two brothers reconcile, with Steve reminiscing about his lost musical potential and Matt looking forward to a bright future filled with love, music, and a legacy of his own making. \\"Stifled Dreams\\" is a feel-good comedy-drama that not only offers a good laugh at the adventures of the Stifler family but also delivers a heartwarming message about self-discovery, growth, and the power of following one's dreams."},{"question":"Problem: Solve 953*r = -778*r - 3462 for r.

As the boat slices through the glistening waves, the sun's warm rays dance upon their skin, while a gentle breeze tousles their hair. Laughter and animated conversation intertwine with the sweet melody of tropic birds calling from the lush, green coastline. The vibrant hues of the ocean mesmerize them, and they marvel at the intricate dance of light and shadow beneath the surface, where they can spot occasionally the brilliant flashes of coral reefs looming just below.

Article: When we can see well, we do not think about our eyes often: It is only when we cannot see perfectly that we come to see how important our eyes are. People who are nearsighted can only see things that are very close to their eyes. Many people who do a lot of close work, such as writing and reading, become nearsighted. Then they have to wear glasses in order to see distant things clearly. People who are farsighted face just the opposite problem. They can see things that are far away, but they have difficulty reading a book if they don't hold it at arm's length. If they want to do much reading, they must get glasses too. Other people do not see clearly because their eyes are not exactly the right shape. This, too, can be corrected by glasses. Some people's eyes become cloudy because of cataracts . Long ago these people often became blind. Now, however, it is possible to operate on the cataracts and remove them. When night falls, colors become fainter to the eyes and finally disappear.

He not only refused to restore Victory to the senate-house, but extinguished the Sacred fire of the Vestals and vacated their temple: the senatorial protest was expressed in a letter by Quintus Aurelius Symmachus to the Western and Eastern emperors. Ambrose, the influential Bishop of Milan and future saint, wrote urging the rejection of Symmachus's request for tolerance. Yet Theodosius accepted comparison with Hercules and Jupiter as a living divinity in the panegyric of Pacatus, and despite his active dismantling of Rome's traditional cults and priesthoods could commend his heirs to its overwhelmingly Hellenic senate in traditional Hellenic terms.[clarification needed] He was the last emperor of both East and West.

Given the question \\"What does Jan need to do before this?\\", is \\"want to be around people\\" a valid answer? A:","response":"In order to determine whether \\"want to be around people\\" is a valid answer to the question \\"What does Jan need to do before this?\\", it is important to first analyze the context surrounding Jan's response. Since Jan said no in a way that made it very clear what she meant, it is possible to deduce that there must be some element of reluctance or disinterest in the situation. Now, considering the question, \\"What does Jan need to do before this?\\", it is asking about the prerequisite for a particular event or situation. It could be related to a social event, a work engagement, or even a personal achievement. Without more information about \\"this\\" specific context, it is difficult to establish a definitive answer. However, if we assume that the situation revolves around a social gathering or event, the answer \\"want to be around people\\" could be considered as a valid response. In this case, Jan's reluctance or disinterest might be tied to her not wanting to be surrounded by other individuals, possibly due to introversion, social anxiety, or simply personal preference. If Jan does not want to be around people, she may need to overcome her reluctance or find a motivation for interacting with others before engaging in the event described as \\"this\\". This motivation could stem from the desire to develop new friendships, to participate in a meaningful conversation, or to share experiences with like-minded individuals. Moreover, if the situation pertains to Jan's work or personal achievement, \\"want to be around people\\" could still be a valid response. In some cases, achieving specific goals may involve collaborating with others, networking, or being part of a team. Jan's reluctance to engage with others could potentially be an obstacle in her path. She may need to find ways to adapt to these social situations before proceeding with her goals. In conclusion, while it is challenging to determine the validity of the answer \\"want to be around people\\" without more context about the specific situation, it could potentially be a valid response, as Jan might need to overcome her reluctance or disinterest in social interactions. However, to form a more accurate conclusion, further information about the context of \\"this\\" would be necessary."},{"question":"Continue writing the next sentence in this paragraph: How to teach a child to help others Perform a volunteer activity with your child.

While volunteering, it is important to explain the impact of their actions on the people, animals, or environment they are helping, and engage in open-ended conversations about the challenges these groups face, as well as potential solutions. Throughout this process, provide a supportive and safe environment for your child to express their thoughts and emotions regarding their volunteer experiences. Encourage them to share their feelings of pride, fulfillment, or empathy, to further cultivate their compassionate nature. Establishing a regular routine for volunteering is essential, as it reinforces the concept of helping others as an integral part of your child's life. Show them that giving back is not just a one-time event but a lifelong commitment to making a positive change in the world. By upholding this practice, your child will likely see you as a role model, and this will motivate them to follow suit. Moreover, celebrating and acknowledging their efforts to help others is essential. Recognizing their contributions will make your child feel valued, boosting their confidence and self-esteem. This positive reinforcement can foster the development of an intrinsic motivation within your child to help others, which will ultimately lead them to become a more compassionate, empathetic, and responsible individual. Introducing them to books and stories that showcase kindness, generosity, and selflessness can help broaden their perspectives and create an emotional resonance with the characters. These stories can inspire your child to make a difference in their way and provide valuable insight into the experiences of those who may be less fortunate. Lastly, teaching your child to practice empathy on a daily basis can further develop their willingness to help others. This includes assisting family members, friends, and classmates who are in need or simply lending a listening ear to someone who needs a friend.

Alodia, also known as Alwa (Greek: Aρουα, Aroua; Arabic: علوة‎, ʿAlwa), was a medieval Nubian kingdom in what is now central and southern Sudan. Its capital was the city of Soba, located near modern-day Khartoum at the confluence of the Blue and White Nile rivers. Founded sometime after the ancient kingdom of Kush fell, in around 350 AD, Alodia is first mentioned in historical records in 569. It was the last of the three Nubian kingdoms to convert to Christianity in 580 following Nobadia and Makuria. It possibly reached its peak during the 9th–12th centuries when records show that it exceeded its northern neighbor, Makuria, with which it maintained close dynastic ties, in size, military power and economic prosperity. Being a large, multicultural state, Alodia was administered by a powerful king and provincial governors appointed by him. The capital Soba, described as a town of \\"extensive dwellings and churches full of gold and gardens\\", prospered as a trading hub. Goods arrived from Makuria, the Middle East, western Africa, India and even China. Literacy in both Nubian and Greek flourished. From the 12th, and especially the 13th century, Alodia was declining, possibly because of invasions from the south, droughts and a shift of trade routes. In the 14th century, the country might have been ravaged by the plague, while Arab tribes began to migrate into the Upper Nile valley. By around 1500 Soba had fallen to either Arabs or the Funj. This likely marked the end of Alodia, although some Sudanese oral traditions claimed that it survived in the form of the kingdom of Fazughli within the Ethiopian-Sudanese borderlands. After the destruction of Soba, the Funj established the Sultanate of Sennar, ushering in a period of Islamization and Arabization.

Nicola knows that the one thing Kyle wants is to be left alone, safe and secure in his autistic world. But she also knows that if she grants her son this wish, he will have no future. Her fierce determination to break into Kyleâs world at any cost has placed an intolerable strain on her marriage. Her husband Rob (Ben Miles), although equally unbending in his love for his son, is frustrated by Nicolaâs relentless challenging of Kyle. Not to mention the loss of the carefree life he and Nicola once had. Rob tries everything to convince Nicola that Kyle should go to bruce house school, a boarding school for autistic children. But Nicola is adamant that he should remain part of society and be taught the skills to cope with the world around him. When a âno-strings attachedâ respite is offered by family friend Rachel (Lorraine Pilkington), Rob is truly torn. Nicolaâs only respite is the unwavering support of her mother Pat (Sheila Hancock) and father Jim (Duncan Preston), who dote on Kyle and provide practical support when needed. Into this setting of seemingly insurmountable conflict comes Thomas, a golden retriever puppy, named after Kyleâs favourite character, Thomas The Tank Engine. Nicola is hopeful that Thomas can break into Kyleâs world where everyone else has failed. Rob says that loads of kids with autism are terrified of dogs, but Kyle seems fine with a dog sitting on him. Little by little, Kyle begins to show Thomas affection and an understanding of his new dogâs feeling. By the time Thomas is a fully grown... Answer:","response":"In the movie \\"After Thomas,\\" Kyle Graham, portrayed by Andrew Byrne, has autism. Autism, also known as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), is a developmental disability characterized by difficulties with social interaction, communication, and repetitive or restrictive behaviors. This can manifest itself in a wide range of possible symptoms, which vary greatly in severity and intensity from person to person. In Kyle's case, he experiences extreme fear and anxiety in daily activities and has difficulty using language to communicate his thoughts and emotions. The movie's plot centers around Nicola, Kyle's mother, who is determined to help her son break free from his isolation and integrate into the world at large. Her approach has caused strain in her marriage, as her husband Rob believes that Kyle should attend a boarding school specifically designed for autistic children. However, Nicola is insistent on keeping Kyle in mainstream society and teaching him the skills required to navigate the world around him. The introduction of Thomas, a Golden Retriever puppy, creates a breakthrough in the story. Thomas is named after Kyle's favorite character, Thomas the Tank Engine. Despite many children with autism being afraid of dogs, Kyle exhibits no fear of Thomas and even begins to show him affection. Gradually, the bond between Kyle and Thomas helps to open up Kyle's world, allowing him to better understand and interact with others. The presence of Thomas serves as a catalyst, providing a newfound sense of hope for Kyle and his family. As you consider investing in this film proposal, you may want to evaluate several factors. These include the quality of the script, the actors and director involved, the audience demand for a film with this theme, and the potential return on investment. Additionally, the movie's depiction of autism and the struggles faced by those affected and their families could raise awareness about the condition and help to encourage empathy and understanding in the audience, thus contributing to social change."},{"question":"Sentence 1: It is also sold by Mondelēz International ( formerly also Kraft Foods ) as Miracel Whip throughout Germany .

A:","response":"The effect that the digital revolution has had on necessary forms of income in the context of mass media, particularly in the US and Europe since World War II, has been predominantly negative. The rapid growth of the Internet has disrupted traditional sources of funding for journalism and other media outlets, and has caused significant revenue loss in the industry. Although new forms of Internet journalism have emerged, they have only managed to replace a very small fraction of the income that has been lost due to this disruption. This has led to mixed effects on freedom of the press, as the financial sustainability of traditional media outlets becomes more challenging, leading to overall concerns about the future of quality journalism and media independence."},{"question":"Beginning in 2005, the CBC has contributed production funds for the BBC Wales revival of Doctor Who, for which it received a special credit at the end of each episode.

Isaac Benjamin became ensnared in a bureaucratic snafu that took away his Social Security disability payments for more than two years. The story of Martha, a woman from Sierra Leone, was more compelling. Beaten, raped and tortured in her politically repressive homeland, she knowingly used someone else's passport to escape to America, but was caught by immigration authorities upon her arrival. She desperately sought political asylum. Not the kind of cases that lead to ground-breaking upheavals in the law, but the kind of cases that are handled day in and day out by lawyers for the legally disenfranchised who have no where else to turn. The work of attorneys from Legal Services of New Jersey will be highlighted in a onehour documentary, \\"Quest for Justice,\\" to be aired 9 p.m. today on New Jersey Network. Produced by NYD2, a communications firm based in Somerset, the documentary features case histories of clients whose needs ranged from housing to fighting off deportation. Joseph, a 54-year-old naturalized citizen, turned to Legal Services when the landlord of his federally subsidized apartment complex in Elizabeth turned a deaf ear to his request for a ground-floor apartment. Having lost the use of his left arm in warding off the machete attack during a robbery attempt, Joseph said he found it increasingly difficult to negotiate the five flights of stairs lugging groceries or laundry on the frequent occasions when the building's elevator was out of order. \\"With this, it became impossible for me to stay upstairs,\\" he said, pointing to the scars on his forearm. \\"If I cannot carry my groceries or my laundry, how can I live?\\" \\"It was a compelling case,\\" said Legal Services attorney Stephen St. Hilaire. \\"The key for us -- and we have to make tough decisions all the time on whether to take a case -- was visualizing what he had to do to get to the fifth floor, struggling with a bag of groceries,\\" he said. Benjamin, 53, of Jersey City had been collecting Social Security disability after undergoing double bypass surgery when the checks stopped coming. He said the agency claimed he had failed to return a form updating the condition of his health. \\"But what got me was they didn't let me know they didn't get it, they just cut me off,\\" he said, adding he found it impossible to negotiate the Social Security bureaucracy himself.

Back in the mid 1990s when I worked in Southern California, I was returning from lunch one day with a coworker when we noticed two pickup trucks driving erratically. This was on Valley View Blvd in Cerritos which is a large roadway divided (by a large, planted median strip) with 3 lanes on either side. One truck seemed to be chasing the other when suddenly the lead truck made a quick U-turn and was followed by the second truck. But the second truck came to stop just after making the turn. This was when the driver of that truck got out, walked to the front of his vehicle, raised his arm holding a semi-automatic handgun, paused, and then fired a single shot. At this point, I was parallel with the shooter’s truck and only about 50–60 feet from where he was standing. I remember my coworker exclaiming, “Oh sh*t! Did he just shoot at the something?!” I floored my accelerator and sped off to my workplace which was about a 1/2 mile down Valley View Blvd. I parked and my coworker and I got into the building as quickly as we could. While he started telling our other coworkers about what we had just witnessed, I ran to my desk, called 911, and reported the shooting. The dispatcher kept me on the line after my initial report and then transferred me to a detective in order to take down my information. As it turns out, my information and the fact that I called 911 immediately resulted in the arrest of the shooter. I was later asked to testify in court which resulted in the shooters conviction. I lived in Southern California for 10 years and now I drive a commercial truck several days a week so I have PLENTY of other “road rage stories”, but this is still the craziest one.

As always, lighting was minimal (as opposed to Bee's workshop out behind the house, which was flooded with fluorescents). A bank of TV sets and computer monitors covered one whole wall, arranged on a precarious system of metal shelves that Bee had installed herself. A low, flat coffee table squatted below the glowing displays, supporting three keyboards, a bank of video editing tools and four different phone carriages. Bee sat in her accustomed place - in the midst of a pile of cushions on the floor, fiddling with a mouse in one hand and typing on one of the keyboards while she talked quietly into her headset. Paul and Chloe didn't bother to knock as they came in - Bee already knew they were there. Paul glanced at one of the screens mounted on the wall. Its display, divided into four quadrants, showed various images from inside the house, including the front door they'd just come through and the stairs they'd just climbed. The screen next to it - which Paul himself had salvaged from a bar on Duval that'd recently renovated into a finedining restaurant - showed images from four other cameras that covered the house's exterior. Nothing happened within fifty yards of their Crew's house that Bee didn't see, and if she had her way, that omniscience would soon extend to cover the entire island. \\"So, Bee, how goes Project Big Brother?\\" Paul asked. \\"I wish you wouldn't call it that,\\" she replied. \\"Sorry, but I have to call it something.\\" \\"You could call it something nice.

Fuller's time at Adyar was eventful. Leadbeater arrived around the same time as Fuller, and soon afterward he \\"discovered\\" the person he believed would become a global teacher and orator, Jiddu Krishnamurti (then in his teens). Leadbetter and others tutored Krishnamurti. Fuller may have taught him photography. She also had a small studio built in the grounds, and painted.

McFarlane emphasises the significance of the latter work, pointing out that it is \\"strikingly modern\\" in comparison to all of Fuller's other work, and more radical than compositions created by Grace Cossington Smith and Roland Wakelin, half a decade later. The painting owes much to theosophy's emphasis on seeing the subject \\"through a psychic, visionary experience\\".
