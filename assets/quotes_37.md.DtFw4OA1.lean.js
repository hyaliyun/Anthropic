Review: This product worked great at first but as other reviewers have pointed out it is not very well made. After less then a year of use one of the flanges that hold the grip at the end of the rotating arm broke causing the grip to come out when using the grater. Is this product review negative? Answer:","response":"Yes, this product review is negative. The reviewer has highlighted several points that indicate their dissatisfaction with the overall quality and durability of the product. In their review, they mention the following aspects that contribute to its negative tone: 1. The product's initial effectiveness: The reviewer begins by sharing that the product worked well at first, indicating that it initially met their expectations. However, this statement also implies that the product's performance may have declined over time, leading to their dissatisfaction. 2. Comparison to other reviews: The reviewer acknowledges the opinions of others who have also pointed out the product's poor construction. By referring to these other reviews, the reviewer adds credibility to their own negative experience and reinforces the notion that this issue might be a widespread problem. 3. Durability issue: The reviewer cites a specific issue they encountered with the product – the flange that holds the grip at the end of the rotating arm broke after less than a year of use. This event not only affected the product's functionality but also raised concerns about its durability and the overall quality of its materials and construction. 4. Defective component: Due to the broken flange, the grip on the rotating arm becomes detached, rendering the grater unusable. This demonstrates a significant design flaw that has a direct impact on the product's performance and usability. In summary, considering the points mentioned by the reviewer – the product's initial performance, comparison to other negative reviews, durability issue, and defective component – it is clear that this product review has a negative tone. The reviewer has expressed their dissatisfaction with the product's quality and durability, and their experience ultimately led to disappointment and dissatisfaction with the product."},{"question":"Here is a premise: Internal control should be recognized as an integral part of each system that management uses to regulate and guide its operations rather than as a separate system within an agency.

Peasant society is much less documented than the nobility. Most of the surviving information available to historians comes from archaeology; few detailed written records documenting peasant life remain from before the 9th century. Most the descriptions of the lower classes come from either law codes or writers from the upper classes. Landholding patterns in the West were not uniform; some areas had greatly fragmented landholding patterns, but in other areas large contiguous blocks of land were the norm. These differences allowed for a wide variety of peasant societies, some dominated by aristocratic landholders and others having a great deal of autonomy. Land settlement also varied greatly. Some peasants lived in large settlements that numbered as many as 700 inhabitants. Others lived in small groups of a few families and still others lived on isolated farms spread over the countryside. There were also areas where the pattern was a mix of two or more of those systems. Unlike in the late Roman period, there was no sharp break between the legal status of the free peasant and the aristocrat, and it was possible for a free peasant's family to rise into the aristocracy over several generations through military service to a powerful lord.

The exact delimitation, and the internal systematics, are a matter of debate; for long this group was used as a \\"wastebin taxon\\" to hold any fireflies with insufficiently resolved relationships. Regardless, they are very diverse even as a good monophyletic group, containing flashing and continuous-glow fireflies from the Holarctic and some tropical forms too. The ancestral Lampyrinae probably had no or very primitive light signals; in any case several modern lineages have returned to the pheromone communication of their ancestors independently it seems. - A pheromone (from Ancient Greek \\"\\" \\"to bear\\" and hormone, from Ancient Greek \\"\\") is a secreted or excreted chemical factor that triggers a social response in members of the same species. Pheromones are chemicals capable of acting outside the body of the secreting individual to impact the behavior of the receiving individuals. There are \\"alarm pheromones\\", \\"food trail pheromones\\", \\"sex pheromones\\", and many others that affect behavior or physiology. Pheromones are used from basic unicellular prokaryotes to complex multicellular eukaryotes. Their use among insects has been particularly well documented.

Article: As I was busy working on my work plan in my bedroom, I could hear my four children playing upstairs. Suddenly, I heard the children running down the stairs and shouting, \\"Freddie, Freddie.\\" _ My three-year old son Freddie was lying on his side on the ground. I cried for my husband Simon to dial 999 and within minutes the air ambulance arrived. They quickly took him in the helicopter. During the flight, Freddie was looking at me and I remember thinking was a good sign, but then his eyes began to roll. As the doctors tried to stabilize him, I couldn't believe what was happening. When we arrived at the hospital in Portsmouth, there were some doctors and nurses waiting for us and they immediately set to work on Freddie. I was hopelessly wishing everything would be alright, but Freddie had broken his skull in two places and blood clots were forming in his brain. He needed surgery , and only a surgeon at another hospital in Bristol could do it. This meant another helicopter ride, but we couldn't go with Freddie because there was no enough space. Simon and I drove the long 130 miles from our home in north Devon in silence. Neither of us dared say what we were thinking, \\"What if we get there and he's dead?\\" \\"Is he going to be brain-damaged?\\" Freddie was just coming out of surgery when we arrived. The surgeon said it had gone well. When I finally saw him, I hardly recognize my child--he was covered in tubes and there were wires coming out of his head. On the third day, Simon went home to see our three girls and to pick up some clean clothes for us. While he was gone, the pressure in Freddie's brain suddenly increased. He was taken into theater again and this time I fell apart. Luckily, the surgery managed to stabilize Freddie. After almost a week, Freddie was finally woken up. When he opened his eyes, he looked at me. He didn't say anything, but I knew straight away that it was my old Freddie, and that he was going to be alright.

Many Chinese consumers like Jiang have learned to refuse plastic bags whenever possible in their shopping. \\"A plastic bag may only cost a few jiao, but it's more about how bad they are for the environment,\\" Jiang said. The plastic ban is for the most part well carried out in big cities, and has been obviously effective in reducing white waste. On the first anniversary of the plastic ban Global Village of Beijing, an NGO environmental organization, shows that during the year of the ban the consumption of plastic bags fell by about 40 billion pieces in chain supermarkets alone, saving more than 1.2 million tons of petrol. However, enforcement shows rather less muscle in smaller cities, towns and countryside. In a remote town like Lichuan, the awareness of environmental protection is not as strong as that in big cities. Street vendors worry that they are likely to lose customers if they charge them for plastic bags. Seeing no significance in the issue, local government often turn a blind eye to banned bag trade in the market. There are still those who don't have an interest in living green. Cui Lin, another Beijinger, often forgets to bring a cloth bag when shopping, and has to buy plastic bags. \\"Anyway I think plastic bags are neater and cleaner, and I don't mind paying a couple more jiao,\\" he shrugged. Mrs Yu, a vegetable vendor in Lichuan County, Jiangxi Province, recalled that before plastic bags became popular in the early 1990s, Chinese people always... Question: Which is NOT the reason why some people still use plastic bags when shopping? Options: A: Cloth bags are difficult to get and heavy to carry.

You need to find all elements of A from the ith element to the jth element, reverse the order in which they occur, and then concatenate them to output the resultant string. i and j will be non-negative, and will always have a value less than the length of A. i will always be less than j. Perform the operations in order, i.e., do not concatenate the elements and then reverse the string. Teacher: Now, understand the problem?

First, let's find the elements from the ith to the jth element, which are A[1:20] since i = 1 and j = 19. (Remember that in Python, the range is inclusive on the left side and exclusive on the right side.) A[1:20] = ['Z', 'w', 'F', '6905', 'Y', '711', 'a', '2057', 'T', 'a', '3193', '3649', '5749', 'O', 'b', 'Y', 'G', '3571', '9417'] 3.

To determine whether the hypothesis \\"I have been run over\\" is true or not, we need more information and context regarding the premise \\"and run over.\\" The phrase \\"and run over\\" can imply that someone or something has experienced being run over, but without further context, we cannot definitively confirm if the statement \\"I have been run over\\" is accurate. There are several scenarios where the phrase \\"and run over\\" might apply. For example: 1. As part of a traumatic experience of an individual who is saying, \\"I have been pushed and run over by a car.\\" In this case, the hypothesis \\"I have been run over\\" would be true. 2. As part of a machine or robot's operational history where it narrates, \\"I have been programmed and run over numerous systems checks.\\" In this case, the hypothesis \\"I have been run over\\" is not true, as the context refers to running system checks and not physically being run over. 3. As part of a conversation where an individual is describing someone else's situation, like \\"She was traveling to the store and run over by an intoxicated driver.\\" In this case, the hypothesis \\"I have been run over\\" is not true, as the person saying the phrase is not the one who was run over. 4. As a figurative expression where an individual feels overwhelmed or taken advantage of, as in \\"I have been mentally exhausted and run over by my workload.\\" While the hypothesis \\"I have been run over\\" could be considered true in a metaphorical sense, it is not meant to be taken literally.

Me: Hmmm, let me think. I think this is the detailed solution:","response":"Step 1: Determine the initial number of bricks Joe and Adam initially built the garden wall with three courses of bricks, with each course containing 400 bricks. So the initial number of bricks can be calculated as: Initial number of bricks = 3 courses * 400 bricks per course = 1200 bricks. Step 2: Determine the number of bricks in the added courses They added two more courses to the wall, each with an additional 400 bricks. So the number of bricks in the added courses can be calculated as: Added courses = 2 courses * 400 bricks per course = 800 bricks. Step 3: Calculate the total number of bricks after removing half of the last course The last course of bricks was reduced by half to allow easy checkup of the garden. Half of the bricks from the last course is: Removed bricks = 400 bricks * 1/2 = 200 bricks. Now, we will subtract these removed bricks from the added courses: Adjusted added courses = 800 bricks - 200 bricks = 600 bricks. Step 4: Calculate the final total number of bricks in the wall Finally, we will add the initial number of bricks to the adjusted added courses to find the total number of bricks in the wall: Total number of bricks = Initial number of bricks + Adjusted added courses = 1200 bricks + 600 bricks = 1800 bricks. So, the garden wall has a total of 1800 bricks."},{"question":"Single/multi-select question: Is it possible to conclude that \\"An older asian woman displaying bread for sale\\" if \\"The woman is young and caucasian.\\"?

It appears that the tweet is a response to a previous conversation or a question related to the potential uses of a ladder. Without complete context, it is challenging to pinpoint the exact sentiment; however, we can still infer certain aspects of the emotion behind the tweet. 1. Neutral or Open-minded: The message appears to have a neutral sentiment, suggesting there are multiple possibilities when it comes to using or modifying a ladder. The tone seems open-minded, allowing for creative or unconventional ideas from others while discussing what they \\"could do\\" with the ladder. 2. Casual and Informal: The tweet appears casual and informal in nature, thanks to the lowercase letters and the omission of punctuation. It indicates a laid-back, conversational approach to express the idea that many things could be done to or with the ladder. 3. Engaging and Encouraging: The tone of the tweet also comes across as engaging and encouraging. It involves the recipient of the tweet (either a user or a general audience) in the discussion and invites them to think creatively and share their own ideas on the topic. This can spark interest and invite potential solutions or suggestions from others. 4. Ambiguity: Being a short tweet stripped of context, there is an apparent ambiguity to the message, which makes it difficult to assign a specific sentiment. This is because the sentiment is partially affected by missing context clues or references, which shape how an emotion is perceived and inferred. In conclusion, it would be accurate to describe the sentiment of this tweet as neutral or open-minded, as it encourages creativity and diverse ideas surrounding the topic of ladders. It is also casual, informal, engaging, and encouraging, inviting the recipient to contribute their thoughts to the discussion.

A trace of childish innocence in his face gives the lanky Bethlehem lawyer a Jimmy Stewart-like quality of quiet trust. In black jeans and button-down shirt, he's a kind of folk hero in the south Bethlehem melting pot where he's crafted a law practice catering to working-class families - mostly Latino - in the shadow of the hulkish remnants of Bethlehem Steel. A two-hour drive away, at City University of New York Law School in Queens, Rooney spends several days a week helping upstart lawyers develop storefront practices that, like his, provide legal representation to folks who can't afford a 250-an-hour legal counselor. Kristin Booth Glen, the law school's dean, took one look at Rooney and knew he was the right person to head the innovative Community Legal Resources Network. ''Fred's so low-key, he's Midwestern in effect,'' says Glen, a former New York Supreme Court judge. ''He captivates people, he inspires loyalty.'' For bringing legal representation to the poor and a host of other social causes, including finding medical care for seriously ill children in Latin America, the Moravian College Alumni Association has chosen Rooney for its prestigious Haupert Humanitarian Award. The award, given to only a select few alumni, will be presented at 7:30 tonight at a reception on Moravian's Priscilla Payne Hurd campus. Moravian, where he was an undergraduate in the early 1970s, inspired Rooney's deep sense of social justice. The son of a Bethlehem Steel executive in New York, he came to the Bethlehem campus from an affluent upbringing on Long Island. The young Rooney might have set his sights on Washington, D.C., like his uncle, former U.S. Rep. Fred Rooney of Bethlehem. After all, politics run in the Rooney family. His brother, state Rep. T.J. Rooney of Bethlehem, is a power in the state Legislature and the Democratic Party. But on a trip to Colombia when he was a junior at Moravian, the child of privilege saw human suffering, malnutrition and poverty the likes of which he had never imagined. ''I couldn't understand why we live this way and they live that way,'' Rooney recalled. ''It's been the guiding light of my life ever since.'' After graduating in CUNY Law School's first class in 1986, he took a job with Lehigh Valley Legal Services.

We have this equation: -367*y + 12225 = 57*y - 8551. First, we want to get y's (the little letters) together on one side and the numbers without y's on the other side. Step 1: Move the 57*y to the left side by subtracting it from both sides. It changes to: -367*y - 57*y + 12225 = -8551. Step 2: Combine those y's: (-367 - 57) * y + 12225 = -8551. This simplifies to -424*y + 12225 = -8551. Now, let's get the numbers together on the other side. Step 3: Move 12225 to the right side by subtracting it from both sides. It becomes: -424*y = -8551 - 12225. Step 4: Combine those numbers: -424*y = -13776. Now, we want to find what y is. Step 5: Divide both sides by -424 to find the value of y: y = -13776 / -424.

Think carefully first, then make a decision:","response":"Overfeeding Lactobacillus can potentially be unwise for individuals regardless of their dental insurance status. Lactobacillus is a type of bacteria that can be beneficial for gut health and is commonly found in probiotic supplements and fermented foods like yogurt, sauerkraut, and kefir. However, it also plays a role in tooth decay. Lactic acid, a byproduct of Lactobacillus' metabolism of sugar, can contribute to the demineralization of tooth enamel, which may lead to cavities. As a result, individuals with an imbalanced oral microbiome or those consuming excessive amounts of sugar can be at risk of dental caries due to overfeeding Lactobacillus. While dental insurance status does not directly affect the health consequences of overfeeding Lactobacillus, those without dental insurance may be more hesitant to seek professional dental care due to the out-of-pocket expense. This can allow dental issues to go untreated or undiagnosed, potentially leading to worsened oral health problems in the long run. So, it is essential for people, regardless of their dental insurance status, to maintain a balanced diet and healthy oral hygiene routine. Brushing and flossing regularly, limiting sugar intake, visiting a dentist for regular check-ups, and maintaining a balanced intake of probiotics may aid in preventing dental problems caused by overfeeding Lactobacillus or other bacteria. If you are concerned about the effects of Lactobacillus on your oral health, it is always a good idea to consult with a dental professional."},{"question":"What is the answer to this question? when does a wronkle in time come out?","response":"To find the answer to the question \\"When does A Wrinkle in Time come out?\\" I will perform the following steps: 1.

As a narrative, philosophical or didactic device, it is chiefly associated in the West with the Socratic dialogue as developed by Plato, but antecedents are also found in other traditions including Indian literature. In the 20th century, philosophical treatments of dialogue emerged from thinkers including Mikhail Bakhtin, Paulo Freire, Martin Buber, and David Bohm. Although diverging in many details, these thinkers have articulated a holistic concept of dialogue as a multi-dimensional, dynamic and context-dependent process of creating meaning. Educators such as Freire and Ramón Flecha have also developed a body of theory and technique for using egalitarian dialogue as a pedagogical tool. - A video game is an electronic game that involves human or animal interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor.

Many different self-help group programs exist, each with its own focus, techniques, associated beliefs, proponents and in some cases, leaders.

But officials in the Brazilian town of Biritiba Mirim, 70km (45miles) east of Sao Paulo, _ . They plan to prohibit residents from dying early because the local cemetery has reached full capacity. There's no more room to bury the dead, they can't be cremated and laws forbid a new cemetery. So the mayor has proposed a strange solution: outlaw death. Mayor Roberto Pereira says the bill is meant as a protest against federal regulations that prohibit new or expanded cemeteries in preservation areas. \\"They have not taken local demands into consideration\\", he claims. A 2003 decree by Brazil's National Environment Council forbids burial grounds in protected areas. Mr. Pereira wants to build a new cemetery, but the project has been stopped because 98% of Biritiba Mirim is considered as a preservation area.

Most physicians have a contract relationship with one or more hospitals in the community. They send their patients to this hospital, which usually charges patients according to the number of days they stay and the facilities(operating room, tests, medicines that they use). Some hospitals belong to a city, a state or, in the case of veteran's hospitals, a federal government agency. Others are operated by religious orders or other non-profit groups. Some medical doctors are on salary. Salaried physicians may work as hospital staff members, or residents, who are often still in training. They may teach in medical schools, be hired by corporations to care for their workers or work for the federal government's Public Health Service. Physicians are among the best paid professionals in the United States. In the 1980s, it was not uncommon for medical doctors to earn incomes of more than 100 000 a year. Specialists, particularly surgeons, might earn several times that amount. Physicians list many reasons why they deserve to be so well rewarded for their work. One reason is the long and expensive preparation required to become a physician in the United States. Most would be physicians first attend college for four years, which can cost nearly 20 000 a year at one of the best private institutions. Prospective physicians then attend medical school for four years. Tuition alone can exceed 10 000 a year. By the time they have obtained their medical degrees, many young physicians are deeply in debt. They still face three to five years of residency in a hospital, the first year as an apprentice physician. The hours are long and the pay is relatively low. Setting up a medical practice is expensive, too. Sometimes several physicians will decide to establish a group practice, so they can share the expense of maintaining an office and buying equipment. These physicians also take care of... The expenses for becoming a doctor are spent on _ . A) schooling and retraining B) practice in a hospital C) facilities he or she uses D) education he or she receives Answer:","response":"The expenses for becoming a doctor are spent on D) education he or she receives. Self-employed private physicians form the backbone of medical practice in the United States, providing individualized care to patients and working collaboratively with community hospitals. A physician's relationship with a hospital is often contractual; they refer patients to the hospital for various treatments and services, and the hospital, in turn, charges the patient for their stay, tests, and medications. This symbiotic relationship ensures a comprehensive healthcare system is in place. Hospitals in the United States might belong to city, state, or federal government agencies, religious orders, or other non-profit organizations, offering diverse services and specialized facilities for the patients. Some doctors, on the other hand, choose a salaried role, working for hospitals, and medical schools. They might also join corporations that focus on employee wellbeing or the Public Health Service. Physicians in the United States are well-compensated, with salaries in the 1980s often exceeding 100,000 a year. Specialists, particularly surgeons, can earn multiple times that amount due to the complexity of their work and the demand for their services. A significant reason behind the high pay for physicians is the lengthy, expensive preparation required to become a doctor. Prospective physicians typically attend a four-year college program that costs close to 20,000 a year at top private institutions. This is followed by four years at medical school, which can set a student back more than 10,000 annually in tuition fees. Consequently, upon completion of their medical degrees, many young doctors are faced with considerable debt. The road to becoming a practicing physician doesn't end with obtaining a medical degree; it continues with a three to five-year residency in a hospital, the first year of which is spent as an apprentice. During this time, doctors often work long hours for relatively low pay. Additionally, setting up a medical practice is an expensive affair, with some doctors opting for group practices to share the costs of establishing an office and acquiring equipment. In summary, the expenses for becoming a doctor focus primarily on the education they receive, which includes both college and medical school, as well as the practical experience gained during hospital residencies. These investments in their education allow physicians to hone their skills and expertise to provide the best possible care for their patients."},{"question":"How is \\"The newly displaced persons who arrived in Gori have reported incidents of intimidation, physical violence and looting.\\" said in French?","response":"To translate the given sentence into French, I will follow these steps: 1.

Team Black studied air pollution and the ozone layer, Team Red studied the water. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which team observed that the layer of ozone is being destroyed by air pollution? Hint: Unfortunately, the layer of good ozone is being destroyed by air pollution. The chief culprits are chlorine and bromine gases. They are released in aerosol sprays, coolants, and other products. Loss of ozone has created an ozone hole over Antarctica. Ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. In humans, this increases skin cancers and eye cataracts. It also disturbs the nitrogen cycle, kills plankton, and disrupts ocean food webs. The total loss of the ozone layer would be devastating to most life. Its rate of loss has slowed with restrictions on pollutants, but it is still at risk.

He was the first child of the journalist Robert Mortimer Wheeler and his second wife Emily Wheeler (née Baynes). The son of a tea merchant based in Bristol, in youth Robert had considered becoming a Baptist minister, but instead became a staunch freethinker while studying at the University of Edinburgh. Initially working as a lecturer in English literature Robert turned to journalism after his first wife died in childbirth. His second wife, Emily, shared her husband's interest in English literature, and was the niece of Thomas Spencer Baynes, a Shakespearean scholar at St. Andrews University. Their marriage was emotionally strained, a situation exacerbated by their financial insecurity. Within two years of their son's birth, the family moved to Edinburgh, where a daughter named Amy was born. The couple gave their two children nicknames, with Mortimer being \\"Boberic\\" and Amy being \\"Totsy\\". When Wheeler was four, his father was appointed chief leader writer for the Bradford Observer. The family relocated to Saltaire, a village northwest of Bradford, a cosmopolitan city in Yorkshire, northeast England, which was then in the midst of the wool trade boom. Wheeler was inspired by the moors surrounding Saltaire and fascinated by the area's archaeology. He later wrote about discovering a late prehistoric cup-marked stone, searching for lithics on Ilkley Moor, and digging into a barrow on Baildon Moor. Although suffering from ill health, Emily Wheeler taught her two children with the help of a maid up to the age of seven or eight. Mortimer remained emotionally distant from his mother, instead being far closer to his father, whose company he favoured over that of other children. His father had a keen interest in natural history and a love of fishing and shooting, rural pursuits in which he encouraged Mortimer to take part. Robert acquired many books for his son, particularly on the subject of art history, with Wheeler loving to both read..., what would be the answer ? Answer:","response":"The answer is Robert Mortimer Wheeler, who studied at the University of Edinburgh and later became a journalist."},{"question":"Four generations of one family have worked for General Motors.

This ruling, which allows employers to post workplace regulations related to union activities, has been met with criticism from those who believe it has the potential to inhibit workers from organizing bargaining units and engaging in other collective actions. Body: I. Overview of the National Labor Relations Board's (NLRB) Job and Authority A. The NLRB: An independent federal agency tasked with enforcing the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) B. The NLRB's jurisdiction: Covers most private sector employers and employees, except for agricultural laborers, independent contractors, and those employed by a parent or spouse II. The Ruling that Permits Employers to Post Workplace Regulations A. The crux of the ruling: Asserts that employers can display rules or posters that influence union activities B. Examples of regulations: Restrictions on the use of company bulletin boards and email systems for union activities, rules surrounding employees gathering in break rooms, or soliciting signatures for union authorization cards on company property III. Critiques of the Ruling and its Potential Effects on Union Activity A. Critics contend that the ruling may suppress workers' rights to organize and participate in union-driven activities B. Key concerns: 1. Employees may feel pressured to refrain from union organization due to potential employer retaliation 2. The presence of regulations could create an atmosphere of intimidation or fear around discussing or pursuing union matters IV. Employers' Perspective on the Ruling A. Employers argue that posting workplace regulations is necessary for maintaining control over company property and ensuring employees focus on work-related tasks B. The potential benefits for employers: 1. Enhanced workflow and productivity without interruptions from union-related activities 2. A decrease in potential conflicts and disputes emerging from union organization and discussions on company property 3. Greater overall control over company culture and employee conduct V. Balancing Interests: Striking a Compromise between Employers and Labor Unions A. Recognizing and respecting employees' rights to organize and participate in union activities according to the NLRA B. Establishing clear communication and understanding between employers and employees to avoid unnecessary disputes and conflicts Conclusion: The ruling by the National Labor Relations Board permitting employers to post workplace regulations has been met with significant controversy as critics argue that it may suppress workers' rights to engage in union activities. While employers maintain that regulations are necessary to protect company interests, it is crucial to strike a balance between the rights of both parties. Ensuring that employers respect and acknowledge their employees' rights to organize while establishing clear and open communication will help mediate conflicts and maintain a harmonious workplace environment."},{"question":"Add spaces between the words in the following text: Spain(40holidayapartmentsandhouses)holidayapartmentsandhouses","response":"To add spaces between the words in the given text, I'll follow these steps: 1.

At a simple level there are leaders and followers, but in reality the lines are rarely as clear as that. Many leaders, with a common example being some founders, have tremendous vision and imagination, but lack the skills to translate that vision into actionable work. Many followers need structure to their efforts, but are dynamic and creative in the execution. Thus, the social dynamic in organizations needs a little more nuance. This is where traditional management hierarchies break down in companies. You may have your SVPs, then your VPs, then your Senior Directors, then your Directors, and so on, but in reality most successful companies don’t observe those hierarchies stringently. In many organizations a junior-level employee who has been there for a while can have as much influence and value, if not more, than a brand new SVP. As such, the dream is that we build organizations with crisp reporting lines but in which all employees feel they have the ability to bring their creativity and ideas to logically influence the scope, work, and culture of the organization. Sadly, this is where many organizations run into trouble. It seems to be the same ‘ol story time after time: as the organization grows, the divide between the senior leadership and the folks on the ground widens. Water cooler conversations and bar-side grumblings fuel the fire and resentment, frustrations, and resume-editing often sets in. So much of this is avoidable though. Of course, there will always be frustration in any organization: this is part and parcel of people working together. Nothing will be perfect, and it shouldn’t be…frustration and conflict can often lead to organizations re-pivoting and taking a new approach.

Context: A man is in a garage with newspaper on a table. Now, let's go through the options one by one: a). shows various things like lawn mower, and cutter. This option may be relevant if we consider the garage setting, where yard tools like lawn mowers and cutters are usually found. However, there's no indication in the context that he is displaying any such items at the moment. b). shows how to cut the top off a pumpkin, and removes the insides. This option seems unrelated to the context given. While it's possible that a man could do this activity in a garage, there's no mention of pumpkins in the initial statement, so the connection is weak. c). is showing how to take building out of a large box. This option is confusing and lacks clarity. Taking a \\"building out of a large box\\" doesn't quite fit the garage setting, nor does it seem to connect well with the context of a newspaper on a table. d). stacks the newspaper together and lays the paper out on the paper and spreads it around the whole table. This option directly connects with the context, as it involves the newspaper mentioned in the initial statement. The man interacts with the newspaper, spreading it out on the table, which fits well within a garage setting where newspapers can be used to cover surfaces before working on projects. Based on the evaluation, the most fitting ending for the paragraph is: The man stacks the newspaper together and lays the paper out on the paper and spreads it around the whole table."},{"question":"Read this: The Philippines has had small grassroots movements for U.S. statehood.

These would include the presence of similar key elements such as addressing an individual, an expression of gratitude, similar sentence structure, and a certain degree of paraphrasing. A sentence that's highly similar (rated 5/5) might be, \\"Thank you, Lustig Andrei,\\" while a completely dissimilar sentence (0/5) might look like, \\"The cat jumped over the moon.\\" To illustrate a c) out of 5 sentence, we might consider a sentence that has some aspects in common but also various differences. Some potential c) out of 5 sentences might include: 1. \\"Thank you for your assistance, Andrei.\\" 2. \\"Much appreciated, Andrei Lustig.\\" 3. \\"Lustig, your help is appreciated.\\" Each of these sentences shares some elements with the original: they address a person (potentially the same person if one assumes 'Andrei' and 'Lustig' are interchangeable) and they express gratitude. However, they structure this expression somewhat differently, and they alter the terms used to express said gratitude. Some even rearrange words in the address, which might slightly affect the meaning. They strike a balance between mirroring the original and taking on a new form, which is, in essence, the characteristics of a c) out of 5 in terms of a textual similarity scale."},{"question":"Is the following review positive or negative?

Some of the sounds he captured have a very high frequency and others are very low frequency. When he is done he begins to edit the sound with a computer program. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Do the high frequency sounds have a longer or shorter wavelength than the low frequency sounds? Answer:","response":"In the context of the paragraph provided, Bill is working with sound effects that have varying frequencies, ranging from very high to very low. To understand the relationship between frequency and wavelength, it's necessary to comprehend the basics of wave properties and behavior. Sound travels in waves, and these waves have certain characteristics, such as frequency and wavelength. Frequency refers to the number of wave cycles that pass a given point in a specific time period, usually expressed in Hertz (Hz). High frequency sounds have more cycles per second, while low frequency sounds have fewer cycles per second. In general, sound with a higher frequency is considered as a high pitch sound, whereas sound with lower frequency is considered as a low pitch sound. Wavelength, on the other hand, is the physical length of one wave cycle. It is the distance between two consecutive points in a wave that are in the same phase, such as two wave peaks or two troughs. Wavelength and frequency are inversely proportional to each other, according to the following formula: speed of sound = frequency × wavelength With the speed of sound being constant in a medium (approximately 343 meters per second in air at room temperature), it's clear that as the frequency increases, the wavelength must decrease, and vice versa. Given this information, the high frequency sounds that Bill captured in the sound studio would have shorter wavelengths, while the low frequency sounds would have longer wavelengths. This inverse relationship between frequency and wavelength is applicable to all types of waves, including sound, light, and electromagnetic waves. In summary, high frequency sounds have shorter wavelengths, while low frequency sounds have longer wavelengths."},{"question":"Write a sentence not in English.","response":"As an AI, I can understand and generate content in multiple languages.

A) Because she found work in an English hospital. B) Because she organized a training school for nurses. C) Because the First World War broke out. D) Because her father was seriously ill. Answer:","response":"D) Because her father was seriously ill."},{"question":"Background: The Greeks (Greek: Ellenes) have been identified by many ethnonyms. The most common native ethnonym is \\"Hellen\\" (Ellen), pl. Hellenes (Ellenes); the name \\"Greeks\\" (Latin: Graeci) was used by the Ancient Romans and gradually entered the European languages through its use in Latin. The mythological patriarch Hellen is the named progenitor of the Greek peoples; his descendants the Aeolians, Dorians, Achaeans and Ionians correspond to the main Greek tribes and to the main dialects spoken in Greece and Asia Minor (Anatolia). Context: There is currently no satisfactory etymology for the name Hellenes. Some scholars assert that the name of the priests of Zeus in Dodona, \\"Selloi\\" (Selloi; also Elloi Helloi), changed to Sellanes (by analogy with Akarnanes) and then to Hellanes and Hellenes. This theory is based on Aristotle's comments in Meteorologica where he places Ancient Hellas in Epirus between Dodona and the Achelous river, where in his opinion the great deluge of Deucalion must have occurred. The land was inhabited by Selloi and Graeci, who later came to be known as Hellenes. In that regard Graici (Graikoi) was a native name of a Dorian tribe in Epirus which was used by the Illyrians. Homer mentions that the Selloi were the prophets of Zeus at Dodona, but he is referring to Zeus of Dodona as god of the Pelasgians who were Pre-Dorian populations. It is possible that the extension of a particular cult of Zeus in Dodona (a tendency among the Greeks to form ever-larger communities and amphictionies) caused the name to further extend to the rest of the peninsula. However, this theory connects the name Hellenes with the Dorians who occupied Epirus, and the relation with the name Greeks given by the Romans becomes uncertain. The toponyms, especially an ancient city Hellas in southern Thessaly and the Greek tradition indicate that the name Hellenes is Pre-Dorian and that it is more likely that the homeland of the Graikoi who were later called Hellenes was in central Greece. The Greek tradition mentions an earlier deluge of Ogyges in the region of Boeotia which was occupied by the Minyans a group of autochthonous or Proto-Greek speaking people. The region was called Graike in ancient times probably after the old city of Graea (from Proto-Greek grau-j-, \\"old lady\\") on the coast. Homer refers to Hellenes as an originally relatively small tribe settled in Thessalic Phthia. During the era of the Trojan War they were centered along the settlements of Alos, Alope, Trachis, and the Pelasgian Argos. This Homeric Hellas is expressly described as \\"kalligunaikos\\", kalligynaikos, \\"of beautiful women\\", and its warriors, the Hellenes, along with the feared Myrmidons, were under the command of Achilles. The Parian Chronicle mentions that Phthia was the homeland of the Hellenes and that this name was given to those previously called Greeks (Graikoi).Alcman (7th century BC) also refers that the mothers of Hellenes were Graikoi. In Greek mythology, Hellen, the patriarch of Hellenes, was son of Deucalion, who ruled around Phthia with Pyrrha, the only survivors after the great deluge. It seems that the myth was invented when the Greek tribes started to separate from each other in certain areas of Greece and it indicates their common origin. The name Hellenes was probably used by the Greeks with the establishment of the Great Amphictyonic League. This was an ancient association of Greek tribes with twelve founders which was organized to protect the great temples of Apollo in Delphi (Phocis) and of Demeter near Thermopylae (Locris). According to legend it was founded after the Trojan War, by the eponymous Amphictyon, brother of Hellen. Question: Are there any potential ideas as to how the name was created?. Whats the answer?","response":"There are several potential ideas and theories as to how the name \\"Hellenes\\" was created, but no definitive answer has been agreed upon. Some of the main theories include: 1. Selloi/Sellanes/Hellanes/Hellenes Theory: According to some scholars, the name Hellenes is derived from the priests of Zeus in Dodona, known as \\"Selloi.\\" It is believed that the name changed to Sellanes, then to Hellanes, and finally to Hellenes. This theory is based on Aristotle's comments in Meteorologica, where he identifies the land inhabited by Selloi and Graeci as Ancient Hellas in Epirus. 2. Graikoi/Graeci/Greeks Theory: Another theory suggests that \\"Graeci\\" or \\"Graikoi\\" was a native name of a Dorian tribe in Epirus, used by the Illyrians. Over time, this name was adopted by the Greeks and later, European languages through its use in Latin. 3. Homeric Hellas Theory: Homer mentions Hellenes as a relatively small tribe settled in Thessalic Phthia, known for beautiful women. During the Trojan War, these warriors were under the command of Achilles. The Parian Chronicle mentions that Phthia was the homeland of the Hellenes, and this name was given to those previously called Greeks (Graikoi). 4. Mythological Connection: In Greek mythology, Hellen, the patriarch of the Hellenes, was the son of Deucalion, who ruled with Pyrrha as the only survivors after the great deluge. This myth may have been invented when Greek tribes began to separate, indicating a common origin. The name \\"Hellenes\\" could have been popularized following the establishment of the Great Amphictyonic League, which was an association of Greek tribes that protected the temples of Apollo and Demeter. In summary, there are multiple theories about the creation of the name \\"Hellenes,\\" each with its historical and mythological connections. While these theories provide possible explanations, there is no conclusive answer to how the name was created."},{"question":"Question: What was the German-Soviet dividing line in regards to annexing Poland?

Bilbo Baggins, the main character in the book \\"The Hobbit\\" by J.R.R. Tolkien, does find the One Ring during his adventures. Chain-of-thought: 1. The statement refers to the book \\"The Hobbit\\" written by J.R.R. Tolkien, a high-fantasy novel published in 1937. It serves as a prequel to the famous \\"Lord of the Rings\\" series. 2. Bilbo Baggins is the protagonist of \\"The Hobbit.\\" He is a hobbit from the Shire who gets involved in an epic adventure orchestrated by the wizard Gandalf and a group of dwarves led by Thorin Oakenshield. 3. During this adventure, Bilbo encounters Gollum, a small, lake-dwelling creature living deep inside the Misty Mountains. Gollum had previously possessed a magical ring that could render its wearer invisible. 4. Bilbo inadvertently finds the One Ring near Gollum's lair when he stumbles upon it while lost in the dark tunnels. He uses it to escape from Gollum and the goblin-infested caverns. 5. This One Ring is later revealed as the central plot device in \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy. It was created by the Dark Lord Sauron to control all other magical rings and, through them, dominate all of Middle-earth. The ring serves as a symbol of power and corruption throughout Tolkien's works. In conclusion, the statement \\"Bilbo Baggins finds the ring in the book 'The Hobbit'\\" is accurate since this is a crucial event in the story and lays the groundwork for the events in the subsequent \\"Lord of the Rings\\" series."},{"question":"Test sentence: \\"They represented to the dean Mary as a genuine linguist.\\" Is this test sentence a correct grammatical English sentence?","response":"Yes, little buddy, this test sentence is a correct grammatical English sentence.

Based on this information, we can better understand the specific requirements related to the springs in question and provide a more accurate and comprehensive response tailored to the given dimensions. Springs are incredibly versatile and essential components in various applications and industries, such as automotive, aerospace, construction, and everyday household items. There are several types of springs, including compression springs, tension springs, and torsion springs, each designed to meet specific needs and requirements. These springs can be made from various materials, such as stainless steel, copper, and plastic, and can come in different sizes, shapes, and configurations. When considering a spring with a length of 180mm, it is essential to understand the parameters that affect its performance and characteristics. These factors include wire diameter, coil diameter, material, and the number of coils. By altering these parameters, you can achieve varying levels of stiffness, strength, and durability, depending on the intended application and load requirements. For example, a longer spring generally offers more flexibility and a lower spring rate (stiffness), leading to a softer feel when it is compressed or stretched. Conversely, a shorter spring with the same parameters will exhibit a higher spring rate, leading to a stiffer feel in the same application. Therefore, it is crucial to consider the length of the spring according to the use case and desired performance. In precision applications, it may also be essential to consider the allowable tolerance for the length of the springs. Tolerances are essential because they ensure that the springs will work correctly and efficiently in a given application. Common manufacturing standards such as DIN, ASTM, and ISO provide tolerance ranges for different spring types and dimensions. Another important aspect to consider is the fatigue life of a spring with a specific length, like 180mm. Fatigue life refers to the number of times a spring can be compressed or stretched before failure occurs, a critical parameter for applications that require constant or repeated motion. When designing a spring, factors like material choice, coil geometry, surface conditions, and stress can affect the spring's fatigue life, making it crucial to understand how these elements interact with the spring's overall length. In summary, thelengthofthespringsis180mm, which is a critical parameter when considering the design, performance, and requirements of a specific spring application. Length, in conjunction with factors such as wire diameter, coil diameter, material, and the number of coils, significantly influences the characteristics and capabilities of a spring. By thoroughly understanding these factors, one can design and select the most appropriate spring for the intended use case."},{"question":"Read this article and answer this question The median age in the city was 39.4 years. 24.2% of residents were under the age of 18; 8.1% were between the ages of 18 and 24; 24.7% were from 25 to 44; 28.4% were from 45 to 64; and 14.6% were 65 years of age or older.

Let me break down the tweet and explain the reasons behind the positive sentiment assessment: 1. \\"Top of the morn!\\" – This phrase is a cheerful and friendly greeting, often used to express enthusiasm towards the person you're addressing. In itself, this expression demonstrates a positive tone and is meant to bring a sense of happiness or warmth to the person receiving the message. 2. \\"@VioletJohe\\" – This is a mention of another Twitter user, indicating that the person is addressing or directing the message towards them. Here, the sentiment doesn't seem to be particularly negative or positive, but when combined with the rest of the tweet, it becomes part of a friendly interaction. 3. \\"ok, please.\\" – Although brief, this portion of the tweet can be interpreted as polite and respectful. The author is likely requesting something from @VioletJohe, but does so in a courteous manner by adding \\"please.\\" Generally, using polite language such as \\"please\\" or \\"thank you,\\" can be seen as a positive sentiment because it indicates respect and consideration towards others. Taking into account these points, it becomes apparent that the sentiment of the tweet is generally positive. The message is conveyed in a friendly and polite manner, aimed at establishing a pleasant interaction with the person being addressed. Although there may be a request involved, the overall tone remains respectful and warm, which leads me to classify the sentiment as (B). positive."},{"question":"Legislation regarding sexual offences in the United Kingdom is devolved. Sex with an adult who is related as parent (including adoptive parent), grandparent, child (including adopted child), grandchild, brother, sister, half-brother, half-sister, uncle, aunt, nephew or niece, is illegal. In England and Wales the offence is against the Sexual Offences Act 2003 which effectively replaced the offence of incest with two new wider groups of offences: familial child sex offences (sections 25--29) and sex with an adult relative (sections 64--65). These laws are intended to protect the rights of people, so as to avoid potential violation. However, these laws still outlaw consensual sexual relationships between family members, even if they are fully willing and knowledgeable to the potential consequences. There has been some debate surrounding the rhetoric used by the Sexual Offences Review Team.

Movie title: 12 Angry Men Movie plot: In a New York City courthouse, an eighteen-year-old boy from a slum is on trial for allegedly stabbing his father to death. Final closing arguments having been presented, a visibly bored judge instructs the jury to decide whether the boy is guilty of murder. If there is any reasonable doubt of his guilt they are to return a verdict of not guilty. The judge further informs them that a guilty verdict will be accompanied by a mandatory death sentence.The jury retires to a private room, where the jurors spend a short while getting acquainted before they begin deliberating. It is immediately apparent that the jurors have already decided that the boy is guilty, and that they plan to return their verdict without taking time for discussion with the sole exception of Juror 8 (Henry Fonda), who is the only \\"not guilty\\" vote in a preliminary tally. He explains that there is too much at stake for him to go along with the verdict without at least talking about it first. His vote annoys the other jurors, especially Juror 7 (Jack Warden), who has tickets to a baseball game that evening; and Juror 10 (Ed Begley Sr.), who believes that people from slum backgrounds are liars, wild, and dangerous.The rest of the film's focus is the jury's difficulty in reaching a unanimous verdict. While several of the jurors harbor personal prejudices, Juror 8 maintains that the evidence presented in the case is circumstantial, and that the boy deserves a fair deliberation. He calls into question the accuracy and reliability of the only two witnesses to the murder, the \\"rarity\\" of the murder weapon (a common switchblade, of which he has an identical copy), and the overall questionable circumstances.

When I hit about 35 I started having trouble with weight. The strange thing was to me, it wasn’t that I was eating more then I used to, as a matter of fact I started eating less. When that didn’t help I barely ate at all. Still I couldn’t lose weight. What I didn’t know was we start to lose muscle mass every decade beginning in our thirties, and I was a ripe 35. Muscles use up more calories than fat, so less muscle means a slower metabolism and the need for fewer calories, and the pounds stack on easier. My second problem was my narcolepsy. When you wake up after a nights sleep there is a release of adrenaline which prompts body and mind into action and helps burn off calories. Narcolepsy causes me to sleep on and off during the day, and as explained by my doctor (so if I have this wrong about adrenaline it is my doctors fault lol) I am not getting that adrenaline release because my bodies clock doesn’t know if I am asleep or awake. He suggested in the morning to start exercising about 20 minutes to get that adrenaline rush, in the afternoon exercise about twenty minutes more for the same reason… Dieting and exercising brought those pounds back down. I will say it is much harder in the winter for me then in the summer. Summer time I am naturally active. I ride bikes with my husband, swim, garden, mow about an acre of lawn.

Traditionally, in botany the term division was used instead of \\"phylum\\", although from 1993 the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants accepted the designation \\"phylum\\". Depending on definitions, the kingdom Animalia contains approximately 35 phyla, Plantae contains about 12, and Fungi contains around 7. Current research in phylogenetics is uncovering the relationships between phyla, which are contained in larger clades, like Ecdysozoa and Embryophyta. - Starfish or sea stars are star-shaped echinoderms belonging to the class Asteroidea. Common usage frequently finds these names being also applied to ophiuroids, which are correctly referred to as brittle stars or \\"basket stars\\". About 1,500 species of starfish occur on the seabed in all the world's oceans, from the tropics to frigid polar waters. They are found from the intertidal zone down to abyssal depths, below the surface. - Tube feet are small active tubular projections on the oral face of an echinoderm, whether the arms of a starfish, or the undersides of sea urchins, sand dollars and sea cucumbers. They are part of the water vascular system. - The term sand dollar (or sea cookie or snapper biscuit in New Zealand, or pansy shell in South Africa) refers to species of extremely flattened, burrowing sea urchins belonging to the order Clypeasteroida. Some species within the order, not quite as flat, are known as sea biscuits. Related animals include other sea urchins, sea cucumbers, and starfish. - Echinoderm is the common name given to any member of the phylum Echinodermata (from Ancient Greek, , \\"echinos\\" \\"hedgehog\\" and , \\"derma\\" \\"skin\\") of marine animals. The adults are recognizable by their (usually five-point) radial symmetry, and include such well-known animals as sea stars, sea urchins, sand dollars, and sea cucumbers, as well as the sea lilies or \\"stone lilies\\". Echinoderms are found at every ocean depth, from the intertidal zone to the abyssal zone. The phylum contains about 7000 living species, making it the second-largest grouping of deuterostomes (a superphylum), after the chordates (which include the vertebrates, such as birds, fishes, mammals, and reptiles). Echinoderms are also the largest phylum that has no freshwater or terrestrial (land-based) representatives. - Eleutherozoa is a subphylum of echinoderms . They are mobile animals with the mouth directed towards the substrate . They usually have a madreporite , tube feet , and moveable spines of some sort , and some have Tiedemann 's bodies on the ring canal . All living echinoderms except Crinoidea belong here . - The madreporite is a lightcolored calcareous opening used to filter water into the water vascular system of echinoderms. It acts like a pressure-equalizing valve. It is visible as a small red or yellow button-like structure, looking like a small wart, on the aboral surface of the central disk of a sea star. Close up, it is visibly structured, resembling a \\"madrepore\\" (stone coral, Scleractinia) colony. From this, it derives its name. - Scleractinia, also called stony corals or hard corals, are marine animals in the phylum Cnidaria that live on the seabed and build themselves a hard skeleton. The individual animals are known as polyps and have a cylindrical body crowned by an oral disc with a mouth and a fringe of tentacles. Although some species are solitary, most are colonial. The founding polyp settles on the seabed and starts to secrete calcium carbonate to protect its soft body. Solitary corals can be as much as across but in colonial species the polyps are usually only a few millimetres in diameter. These polyps reproduce by budding but remain attached to each other, forming a multi-polyp colony with a common skeleton, which may be up to several metres in diameter or height according to species. - Sea urchins or urchins, archaically called sea hedgehogs, are small, spiny, globular animals that, with their close kin, such as sand dollars, constitute the class Echinoidea of the echinoderm phylum. About 950 species of echinoids inhabit all oceans from the intertidal to deep. The shell, or \\"test\\", of sea urchins is round and spiny, typically from across. Common colors include black and dull shades of green, olive, brown, purple, blue, and red. Sea urchins move slowly, feeding primarily on algae. Sea otters, starfish, wolf eels, triggerfish, and other predators hunt and feed on sea urchins. Their roe is a delicacy in many cuisines.

This reduces the exclusion of smaller athletes in sports where physical size gives a significant advantage. Weight classes are used in a variety of sports, especially combat sports (such as boxing, wrestling, and mixed martial arts). - Professional boxing, or prizefighting, emerged in the early twentieth century as boxing gradually attained legitimacy and became a regulated, sanctioned sport. Professional boxing bouts are fought for a purse which is divided between the boxers as determined by contract. Most professional bouts are supervised by a regulatory authority to guarantee the fighters' safety. Most high-profile bouts obtain the endorsement of a sanctioning body, which awards championship belts, establishes rules, and assigns its own judges and referee. - Welterweight is a weight class in combat sports. Originally the term \\"welterweight\\" was used only in boxing, but other combat sports like Muay Thai, taekwondo and mixed martial arts also use it for their own weight division system to classify the opponents. In most sports that use it, welterweight is heavier than lightweight but lighter than middleweight. - Jeff Mayweather (born July 4, 1964 in Grand Rapids, MI) is a former boxer who fought in the 1990s. - Boxing is a combat sport in which two people wearing protective gloves throw punches at each other for a predetermined set of time in a boxing ring. - Muay Thai is a combat sport of Thailand that uses stand-up striking along with various clinching techniques. This physical and mental discipline which includes combat on shins is known as \\"the art of eight limbs\\" because it is characterized by the combined use of fists, elbows, knees, shins, being associated with a good physical preparation that makes a full-contact fighter very efficient. Muay Thai became widespread internationally in the twentieth century, when practitioners defeated notable practitioners of other martial arts. The professional league is governed by The Professional Boxing Association of Thailand (P.A.T) sanctioned by The Sport Authority of Thailand (S.A.T.), and World Muaythai Federation (WMF) overseas. - Super featherweight, also known as junior lightweight, is a weight division in professional boxing, contested between and up to . - Roger Mayweather ( born April 24 , 1961 ) is a retired professional boxer . He won two major world titles in two different weight classes . Throughout his career , Mayweather fought against many other boxing champions of the 1980s and 1990s . He is a part of the Mayweather boxing family ; his brothers are former welterweight contender Floyd Mayweather and former IBO super featherweight champion Jeff Mayweather , and his nephew is five - division world champion Floyd Mayweather Jr. Roger eventually became Mayweather Jr. 's trainer . - Mixed martial arts (MMA) is a full-contact combat sport that allows both striking and grappling, both standing and on the ground, using techniques from other combat sports and martial arts. The first documented use of the term \\"mixed martial arts\\" was in a review of UFC 1 by television critic Howard Rosenberg in 1993. The term gained popularity when newfullcontact.com, then one of the largest websites covering the sport, hosted and republished the article. The question of who actually coined the term is subject to debate. - In combat sports where champions are decided by a challenge, the lineal championship of a weight class is a world championship title held initially by an undisputed champion and subsequently by a fighter who defeats the reigning champion in a match at that weight class. In professional boxing, the lineal champion is informally called \\"the man who beat the man\\". Champions recognized by sanctioning bodies such as the World Boxing Association (WBA) or World Boxing Council (WBC), or the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) may vacate their title voluntarily, or be stripped of the title for breaching the sanctioning body's regulations or contracts. There will thus be a breach of continuity in the list of sanctioned champions which the lineal championship is intended to prevent. However, there is no single canonical list of lineal champions at any weight class, because there is no agreed upon method of determining the starting point for each lineage and conflicting opinions on what to do when the current champion retires or moves to a different weight class, although there is agreement that any stripping of a title be discounted. - The Best Fighter ESPY Award (ESPY means Excellence in Sports Performance Yearly) was created by the cable television network ESPN and has been presented annually since 2007 to the professional or amateur boxer or mixed martial artist, irrespective of nationality, gender, weight class, or sanctioning body or league, adjudged to be the best in a given calendar year. The award subsumed the Best Boxer ESPY Award, limited exclusively to boxers, which was presented between 1993 and 2006, inclusive. - A combat sport, or fighting sport, is a competitive contact sport with one-on-one combat. Determining the winner depends on the particular contest's rules. In many fighting sports, a contestant wins by scoring more points than the opponent or by disabling the opponent. Boxing, wrestling, Muay Thai, Tae Kwon Do, Judo, Brazilian Jiu-jitsu, Sambo, and Mixed Martial Arts are examples of combat sports. - Lightweight is a weight class in the sports of boxing, kickboxing, mixed martial arts, and rowing. - Floyd Joy Mayweather Jr. (born Floyd Joy Sinclair; February 24, 1977) is an American former professional boxer who competed from 1996 to 2015, and currently works as a boxing promoter.

On Thursday the Meat Market sold 210kg of ground beef. On Friday they sold twice that amount. On Saturday they only sold 130kg. On Sunday they sold half of what they sold Saturday. If they originally planned to sell only 500kg, how much meat did they sell beyond their original plans?","response":"Step 1: Calculate the amount of ground beef sold on Friday. Since they sold twice the amount on Friday as compared to Thursday (210 kg), we multiply 210 kg by 2: 210 kg * 2 = 420 kg Step 2: Calculate the amount of ground beef sold on Sunday. Since they sold half of what they sold on Saturday (130 kg), we divide 130 kg by 2: 130 kg / 2 = 65 kg Step 3: Calculate the total amount of ground beef sold from Thursday to Sunday. Add the amounts from Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday: 210 kg (Thursday) + 420 kg (Friday) + 130 kg (Saturday) + 65 kg (Sunday) = 825 kg Step 4: Calculate how much meat was sold beyond their original plans. Subtract the originally planned amount (500 kg) from the total amount sold (825 kg): 825 kg - 500 kg = 325 kg Final Answer: The Meat Market sold 325 kg of ground beef beyond their original plans."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Pick one category for the following text.

I’m as guilty as anyone. But, what about behind those scenes? Those days where the wind is so strong you can’t instastory for talking (I’m looking at you Cornwall), when travel mistakes happen (like in Vienna where I accidentally booked our trip a day short) or when everyone asks you what your next trip will be and you sheepishly have to answer ‘er, not sure’. So I thought I’d get a few things off my chest, and confess a few of the reasons why I probably shouldn’t be calling myself a travel blogger. And yes, these are all very much first world problems. 1. I hate photographs of myself. Ironic, no? Especially when one of the first rules of blogging is all about the cult of personality. I just don’t like them. I wish I did, but there are few times that I fancy a photo and even less when I like the result. 2. We nip into a MacDonalds at least once every trip. It has now become a tradition between nicer restaurants to nip in and order a Big Mac and fries at some point of our trip – but especially in Europe for some reason. Why do their MacDonalds meals taste better? 3. Pastels aren’t really my shade. Again, I wish I could be super girly, twirling in gossamer skirts painted in spring shades but I’m just not. My colour palette is decidedly autumnal/jewel hued and usually sticks to a scarf draped around my neck in a hopefully fashionable manner. And I’m totally ok with that. 4. I once travelled all the way to New Zealand and back (stopping in 3 countries enroute) without a lens cap on my brand new, fairly expensive camera. This is in no way a #humblebrag about the trip, but a comment on how impractical I can be – and how careful I also am.

Let's solve the equation step by step. 0 = -12 * b - 31 - 53 First, we need to combine the numbers -31 and -53: -31 - 53 = -84 Now, the equation is: 0 = -12 * b - 84 Next, we need to get rid of the -84 on the right side of the equation. Let's add 84 to both sides: 0 + 84 = -12 * b - 84 + 84 Which simplifies to: 84 = -12 * b Now we want to find out what b is, so we need to get b alone. To do that, we have to divide both sides of the equation by -12: 84 / -12 = (-12 * b) / -12 This simplifies to: -7 = b So, b = -7.

Given these facts, what is able to make food using inorganic molecules among the following options: - trees - potatoes - ozone - organic fertilizer - bacteria - a plant - a consumer - fungi","response":"Among the given options, the organisms that can make food using inorganic molecules (through a process called photosynthesis) are: 1. Trees: Trees are green plants that contain chlorophyll, allowing them to harness sunlight and convert inorganic molecules like carbon dioxide and water into glucose, their food. 2. Potatoes: Potatoes are the tubers of a green plant, which means that the plant uses photosynthesis to create food for itself. The potatoes store some of the food produced by the plant. 3. Bacteria: Some specific types of bacteria, known as cyanobacteria or photosynthetic bacteria, can produce their own food through photosynthesis. They contain a pigment called bacteriochlorophyll that enables them to capture energy from sunlight and convert inorganic molecules into food. 4. A Plant: Green plants are classified as producers because they can make their own food through photosynthesis by using chlorophyll contained in their cells. The other options - ozone, organic fertilizer, a consumer, and fungi - cannot produce food using inorganic molecules through photosynthesis. - Ozone is a type of oxygen molecule and is not an organism. - Organic fertilizer is a material added to the soil to provide nutrients for plant growth, but it does not produce food on its own. - A consumer, such as an animal or human, obtains its energy and nutrients through the consumption of other organisms and is incapable of photosynthesis. - Fungi are heterotrophic organisms that mainly decompose organic matter to obtain energy and nutrients, and they do not possess photosynthetic capabilities."},{"question":"Q: In this task, you are given an ambiguous question/query (which can be answered in more than one way) and a clarification statement to understand the query more precisely.

Reason I say it was the dumbest is because I still acknowledge that it’s not my kind of dating scene even though I ended up meeting the love of my life through the app. Other than that? Nothing was wrong or dumb. I have done nothing much because the man I am currently dating sent me a superlike after I was on the app for less than 12 hours. I joined, created profile, went through possible matches, and then went to bed. I didn’t have enough time to do something dumb. Now my boyfriend on the other hand was on the app for 4–5 months prior to me joining and him finding me. His story is that he had been in there long enough to end up matching with some bots (robots that somehow end up joining or hacking the app. I have not a clue how) that he would have conversations with to test if they were legitimate people. He would also match with different people who would either immediately block him because he came as weird or he would block them because they came off as weird. When he found me, what he saw in my profile was that I was local, I was a legitimate person because I knew someone that he knew through Facebook, and I had multiple pictures of myself that looked genuine. I also had a description where I stated my intention for using the app which was that I was looking for a serious relationship. What he did after I connected with him was talk to me and then test me as the conversation progressed. How did he test me? He told a corny joke which I laughed to. If I hadn’t have found his joke funny, he probably wouldn’t have asked me out on a date. I hope that answers your question. I know it wasn’t very…. eventful.

They say that despite the moral and legal objections , whatever is scientifically possible will be done ----somewhere, sometime. They believe that science will get out of control in the end. This belief is dangerous too, because it a fuels sense of hopelessness and discourages them from making efforts to build a safer world.

She wrote: 'As soon as you get over the \\"ohmygawd I. can't do this\\" feeling, it's pretty enjoyable... Kay, I gotta go to church now' Olten's mother called killer 'not even human' at hearing on Monday. Article:","response":"Title: A Disturbing Look into the Mind of Alyssa Bustamante: A Teenage Killer In 2009, the small community of St. Martins, Missouri, was shattered by a gruesome crime that has continued to haunt its residents. Alyssa Bustamante, a 15-year-old girl, brutally murdered her 9-year-old neighbor, Elizabeth Olten. What followed was a horrifying testimony from the killer, who showed no remorse and even admitted to finding the act of taking a life \\"enjoyable.\\" The chilling details of this case bring to light the question of how such a young person could commit such a heinous crime, and the events surrounding the murder raise serious concerns about the effect of psychological disorders on the actions of teenagers. At the time of Elizabeth's death, Alyssa was in the midst of a downward spiral. Although she attended church regularly with her family, underneath the façade of piety, Alyssa was dealing with severe mental health issues. An excerpt from her personal diary revealed her disturbed mindset as she wrote, \\"As soon as you get over the \\"ohmygawd I. can't do this\\" feeling, it's pretty enjoyable... Kay, I gotta go to church now.\\" Following the murder, Alyssa was not able to hide her dark side from authorities, and her true nature became the center of attention during her trial. Elizabeth's mother, understandably angered and distraught by her daughter's untimely death, voiced her opinion of the killer, stating that Alyssa was \\"not even human.\\" To comprehend how a teenager like Alyssa could become so detached from reality and engage in such a horrific act, it is important to consider the possible factors that contributed to her mental state. Mental health professionals have pointed to childhood trauma, unstable home environments, and the inability to form healthy relationships as potential contributors to the development of severe behavioral issues in teenagers. The tragedy of Elizabeth Olten's senseless murder is a stark reminder of the need for early intervention and proper treatment for at-risk youth. If the warning signs of Alyssa Bustamante's escalating behavior had been recognized and addressed sooner, perhaps Elizabeth's life could have been spared. In conclusion, the case of Alyssa Bustamante sends a chilling message about the importance of identifying and treating mental health issues in young people. As a society, we must be vigilant in recognizing the symptoms of psychological distress and provide support to help prevent more innocent lives from being taken at the hands of troubled teenagers."},{"question":"Write the last sentence in this story.

The scoring began early in the first quarter when Pittsburgh's Tyler Matakevich blocked a Britton Colquitt punt, knocking the ball into the end zone where it was recovered by Anthony Chickillo for a touchdown. The Browns were able to tie the score by the end of the first quarter, however, as rookie quarterback DeShone Kizer orchestrated a 12-play drive that ended when he scored on a 1-yard touchdown run. The game stayed at 7-7 through most of the second quarter, until the Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger connected with tight end Jesse James on a 4-yard touchdown with 45 seconds left in the first half. The 7-play, 91-yard scoring drive was highlighted by a 50-yard reception by Antonio Brown on a tipped ball. After a Zane Gonzalez field goal brought the Browns within 14-10 early in the third quarter, the Steelers drove down the field again. Roethlisberger threw a second touchdown pass to James to put them up by 11, 21-10. The drive was boosted by a 41-yard pass interference penalty on Browns cornerback Jamar Taylor on a deep pass intended for Brown. The score remained 21-10 until under four minutes remained in the game, when Kizer was able to throw his first career touchdown pass to Corey Coleman. A two-point conversion run by Isaiah Crowell brought the Browns to within a field goal, 21-18. The Browns did not get a chance to score again, however, as the Steelers were able to run out the clock after a long pass from Roethlisberger to Brown. Browns head coach Hue Jackson challenged the ruling; however, the catch call on the field was upheld. The 13th-straight season-opening loss extended an NFL record for the Browns, who also fell to 1-18 in season openers since returning to the league in 1999. The team also lost their 12th straight game against a divisional opponent. The team started 0-1.

The Arctic consists of the Arctic Ocean, adjacent seas, and parts of Alaska (United States), Canada, Finland, Greenland (Denmark), Iceland, Norway, Russia, and Sweden. Land within the Arctic region has seasonally varying snow and ice cover, with predominantly treeless permafrost-containing tundra. Arctic seas contain seasonal sea ice in many places. - The Equator usually refers to an imaginary line on the Earth's surface equidistant from the North Pole and South Pole, dividing the Earth into the Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere. The Equator is about long; some 78.7% lies across water and 21.3% over land. - The Southern Ocean, also known as the Antarctic Ocean or the Austral Ocean, comprises the southernmost waters of the World Ocean, generally taken to be south of 60° S latitude and encircling Antarctica. As such, it is regarded as the fourth-largest of the five principal oceanic divisions: smaller than the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans but larger than the Arctic Ocean. This ocean zone is where cold, northward flowing waters from the Antarctic mix with warmer subantarctic waters. - Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people. - The Southern Hemisphere is the half sphere of Earth which is south of the equator. It contains all or parts of five continents (Antarctica, Australia, about 90% of South America, the southern third of Africa, and several southern islands off the continental mainland of Asia), four oceans (Indian, South Atlantic, Southern, and South Pacific) and most of the Pacific Islands in Oceania. Its surface is 80.9% water, compared with 60.7% water in the case of the Northern Hemisphere, and it contains 32.7% of Earth's land. - The South Pole, also known as the Geographic South Pole or Terrestrial South Pole, is one of the two points where the Earth's axis of rotation intersects its surface. It is the southernmost point on the surface of the Earth and lies on the opposite side of the Earth from the North Pole. - An ocean (the sea of classical antiquity) is a body of saline water that composes much of a planet's hydrosphere. On Earth, an ocean is one of the major conventional divisions of the World Ocean, which covers almost 71% of its surface. These are, in descending order by area, the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic Oceans. The word \\"sea\\" is often used interchangeably with \\"ocean\\" in American English but, strictly speaking, a sea is a body of saline water (generally a division of the world ocean) partly or fully enclosed by land. - Antarctica (US English , UK English or ) is Earth's southernmost continent. It contains the geographic South Pole and is situated in the Antarctic region of the Southern Hemisphere, almost entirely south of the Antarctic Circle, and is surrounded by the Southern Ocean. At , it is the fifth-largest continent. For comparison, Antarctica is nearly twice the size of Australia.

It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east. Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney. - Nukumanu , formerly Tasman Islands , is a medium - sized atoll of Papua New Guinea , located in the Southwestern Pacific Ocean , 4 degrees south of the equator . - The Northern Hemisphere is the half of Earth that is north of the equator. For other planets in the Solar System, north is defined as being in the same celestial hemisphere relative to the invariable plane of the solar system as Earth's North pole. Due to the Earth's axial tilt, winter in the Northern Hemisphere lasts from the December solstice (typically December 21 UTC) to the March Equinox (typically March 20 UTC), while summer lasts from the June solstice (typically June 21 UTC) through to the September equinox (typically September 23 UTC). The dates vary each year due to the difference between the calendar year and the astronomical year. - Oceania (or ), also known as Oceanica, is a region centred on the islands of the tropical Pacific Ocean. Opinions of what constitutes Oceania range from its three subregions of Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia to, more broadly, the entire insular region between Southeast Asia and the Americas, including Australasia and the Malay Archipelago. - The North Pole, also known as the Geographic North Pole or Terrestrial North Pole, is (subject to the caveats explained below) defined as the point in the Northern Hemisphere where the Earth's axis of rotation meets its surface. - Papua New Guinea (PNG Hiri Motu: \\"Papua Niu Gini\\"), officially the Independent State of Papua New Guinea, is an Oceanian country that occupies the eastern half of the island of New Guinea and its offshore islands in Melanesia, a region of the southwestern Pacific Ocean north of Australia.

There may be coral islands/cays on the rim. - A coral island is a type of island formed from coral detritus and associated organic material. They occur in tropical and sub-tropical areas, typically as part of coral reefs which have grown to cover a far larger area under the sea. - Coral reefs are diverse underwater ecosystems held together by calcium carbonate structures secreted by corals. Coral reefs are built by colonies of tiny animals found in marine waters that contain few nutrients. Most coral reefs are built from stony corals, which in turn consist of polyps that cluster in groups. The polyps belong to a group of animals known as Cnidaria, which also includes sea anemones and jellyfish. Unlike sea anemones, corals secrete hard carbonate exoskeletons which support and protect the coral polyps. Most reefs grow best in warm, shallow, clear, sunny and agitated waters. - A sphere (from Greek \\"sphaira\\", \\"globe, ball\\") is a perfectly round geometrical object in three-dimensional space that is the surface of a completely round ball, (viz., analogous to a circular object in two dimensions). - A lagoon is a shallow body of water separated from a larger body of water by barrier islands or reefs. Lagoons are commonly divided into coastal lagoons and atoll lagoons. They have also been identified as occurring on mixed-sand and gravel coastlines. There is an overlap between bodies of water classified as coastal lagoons and bodies of water classified as estuaries. Lagoons are common coastal features around many parts of the world. - Corals are marine invertebrates in the class Anthozoa of phylum Cnidaria. They typically live in compact colonies of many identical individual polyps. The group includes the important reef builders that inhabit tropical oceans and secrete calcium carbonate to form a hard skeleton. - In 2000 it had a population of 254,158. it had a population of 364,145, giving it an annual growth rate of 2.1% over a nine-year period.

It was named in honour of his father, Admiral Sir Fairfax Moresby. - The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east. - Indonesia (or ; Indonesian: ), officially the Republic of Indonesia, is a unitary sovereign state and transcontinental country located mainly in Southeast Asia with some territories in Oceania. Situated between the Indian and Pacific oceans, it is the world's largest island country, with more than seventeen thousand islands. At , Indonesia is the world's 14th-largest country in terms of land area and world's 7th-largest country in terms of combined sea and land area. It has an estimated population of over 260 million people and is the world's fourth most populous country, the most populous Austronesian nation, as well as the most populous Muslim-majority country. The world's most populous island of Java contains more than half of the country's population. - Earth, otherwise known as the world, is the third planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life. It is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets. - The Antarctic (US English , UK English or and or ) is a polar region, specifically the region around the Earth's South Pole, opposite the Arctic region around the North Pole. The Antarctic comprises in the strict sense the continent of Antarctica and the island territories located on the Antarctic Plate. In a broader sense the Antarctic region include the ice shelves, waters, and island territories in the Southern Ocean situated south of the Antarctic Convergence, a zone approximately wide varying in latitude seasonally. The region covers some 20% of the Southern Hemisphere, of which 5.5% (14 million km) is the surface area of the Antarctic continent itself. All of the land and ice shelves south of 60°S latitude are administrated under the Antarctic Treaty System. In a biogeographic sense, the Antarctic ecozone is one of eight ecozones of the Earth's land surface. - Melanesia is a subregion of Oceania (and occasionally Australasia) extending from the western end of the Pacific Ocean to the Arafura Sea, and eastward to Fiji. - The Arctic Ocean is the smallest and shallowest of the world's five major oceans. The International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) recognizes it as an ocean, although some oceanographers call it the Arctic Mediterranean Sea or simply the Arctic Sea, classifying it a mediterranean sea or an estuary of the Atlantic Ocean.

Both championships were won consecutively in the mid-1990s, under the leadership of head coach Rudy Tomjanovich and Hakeem Olajuwon, the Hall of Fame center who was the cornerstone of the Rockets' roster at the time. Here is a detailed breakdown of the two championships: 1. 1993-1994 NBA Championship: The 1993-1994 NBA season was a significant one for the Houston Rockets. They finished the regular season with a 58-24 record, which was the second-best record in the Western Conference. Hakeem Olajuwon, the star center for the Rockets, was named the NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) and also the NBA Defensive Player of the Year. In the playoffs, the Rockets made their way through tough series against the Portland Trail Blazers (3-1), the Phoenix Suns (4-3) in the conference semifinals, and the Utah Jazz (4-1) in the conference finals. They eventually faced the New York Knicks in the NBA Finals, led by their own star center, Patrick Ewing. In a hard-fought, seven-game series, the Rockets emerged as the champions, winning the series 4-3. Hakeem Olajuwon was named the Finals MVP due to his outstanding performance throughout the series. 2. 1994-1995 NBA Championship: The following season, the Houston Rockets aimed to defend their title. The 1994-1995 regular season saw the Rockets finish with a slightly lower record of 47-35, and they entered the playoffs as the sixth seed in the Western Conference. Despite their lower seeding, the Rockets managed to pull off several upsets in the playoffs. In the first round, the Rockets defeated the Utah Jazz (3-2); they then went on to beat the Phoenix Suns (4-3) in the conference semifinals and the San Antonio Spurs (4-2) in the conference finals. The Finals pit the Rockets against the Orlando Magic, a team led by young superstar Shaquille O'Neal and Penny Hardaway. The Rockets, however, took control of the series, sweeping the Magic in four games and claiming their second consecutive NBA Championship. Once again, Hakeem Olajuwon was named the Finals MVP for his dominant performance. Since then, the Houston Rockets have had varying degrees of success but have not won another NBA Championship. The two championship victories in the mid-1990s remain a significant part of the team's history and legacy, with the duo of Hakeem Olajuwon and Rudy Tomjanovich playing crucial roles in achieving those titles."},{"question":"Given the question: Read the bio below and try to give details on saint gens 's: - imagesize - caption - death date - birth date - name - image - birth place Bio: saint gens -lrb- 1104 -- 16 may 1127 -rrb- , also named saint gens du beaucet , was a hermit .

However, if the firearm is displayed in a manner \`\`calculated to cause alarm,'' then it is \`\`disorderly conduct''. Open carry of a handgun in public had long been illegal in Texas, except when the carrier was on property he/she owned or had lawful control over, was legally hunting, or was participating in some gun-related public event such as a gun show. However, the 2015 Texas Legislature passed a bill to allow concealed handgun permit holders to begin carrying handguns openly. The bill was signed into law on June 13, 2015, and took effect on January 1, 2016. A License to Carry (LTC) is still required to carry a handgun openly or concealed in public. See options at the end. Can we conclude that can a bar owner carry a gun in texas? Possible answers: [I] no. [II] yes.","response":"[II] Yes, a bar owner can carry a gun in Texas, provided that they meet certain criteria and conditions. The owner must first have a valid License to Carry (LTC) to openly or concealed carry a handgun in public. Additionally, it is crucial for bar owners to abide by Texas law in accordance with carrying and storing their firearms within their establishments. It is essential to understand that there are specific restrictions imposed by both state and federal laws for carrying a firearm in places that serve alcohol. According to Texas Penal Code Section 46.035, carrying a firearm in a bar or any other business that derives 51% or more of its income from the sale of alcohol for on-premises consumption is generally prohibited. Establishments with these conditions usually display the \\"51% sign\\" that informs visitors that carrying firearms is not allowed. However, this restriction does not apply to the bar owner if they have the LTC and are legally carrying on their owned or controlled premises. Despite being allowed to carry a firearm, the bar owner must ensure that the weapon is not displayed in a manner \\"calculated to cause alarm,\\" which would be considered disorderly conduct according to Texas Penal Code Section 42.01. It's worth noting that if the owner's establishment falls under the category of a \\"blue sign\\" business, meaning it derives less than 51% of its income from the sale of alcohol for on-premises consumption, the owner and customers with an LTC can carry their handguns, whether openly or concealed, as long as the business owner allows it. In summary, a bar owner can carry a gun in Texas as long as they have a valid License to Carry, their establishment does not derive 51% or more of its income from on-premises alcohol consumption, and they adhere to the laws and regulations regarding the storage and handling of firearms. While carrying a firearm, the bar owner should remember to maintain the safety and comfort of their patrons and avoid displaying the weapon in a manner that might cause alarm."},{"question":"During the feudal and colonial times in British India, hunting was regarded as a regal sport in the numerous princely states, as many maharajas and nawabs, as well as British officers, maintained a whole corps of shikaris (big-game hunters), who were native professional hunters.

The second box (the hypothesis) is the opposite and says these actions make it harder to give justice to people. It's like taking away cookies from your friends so they can't have any. So, if the premise (first box) is true, that we're helping people get justice more easily, then it's very unlikely the hypothesis (second box) is true, because we can't be both sharing cookies and taking them away at the same time. That means, if the premise is true, it does not support the hypothesis that the actions are hampering our ability to provide justice to clients."},{"question":"Question: The exercise is to decide whether the question accepts the proposed suggestion as a correct answer.

While the author has provided a brief positive comment by stating that it is a \\"great app,\\" the overall review is lacking in several important aspects that make it less favorable. Here are the reasons for this rating: 1. Brevity: The review is extremely short and does not provide any context or specific details about the application. Ideally, a helpful review should discuss the app's features, performance, and any benefits or drawbacks experienced for other users to make an informed decision before downloading the app. 2. Typos and Language: The presence of the multiple repeated letters in the word \\"appppppp\\" indicates a lack of care taken when writing the review. Though it could be interpreted as enthusiasm for the app, it lessens the professionalism of the review. 3. Objectivity: Favorable reviews should maintain a balanced view and should cover not only the positives but possible negatives if any. This specific review does not provide any insights into any potential drawbacks, which makes it less informative for potential users. 4. Constructive Feedback: A useful review should also include constructive feedback for the app developers, enabling them to make improvements and updates based on the users' needs. This feedback could cover suggestions and desired features or aspects that the app may improve upon. This review does not provide any such information. 5. Personal Experience: The review does not share any personal experiences while using the app, like specific examples of cases where the app has been helpful or entertaining. This information is essential for other users who want to understand how the app works and if it's worth their time. Taking these factors into consideration, the review does not provide enough valuable information to other users or the app developers. However, since it is a positive review, it earns a 2 out of 5 rating on the favorability scale, with 1 being the least favorable.

I taught the kitten the way Pa taught me: I threw him into water where he could not stand, and I watched, ready to grab him if he went under. Tiger did not thrash desperately like me. He merely paddled urgently for the edge of the plastic pool with his head high and his thin legs churning. Little Bit said, \\"Dog paddle,\\" and we all laughed. \\"Tiger paddle,\\" I said, and we all laughed some more, even Jordy. That was probably when Ma noticed the kitten swimming lessons and stopped them. Our swimming lessons happened in two places. When Pa took us, we went to Hawkins Springs behind Mrs. DeLyons' Fountain of Youth Motor Hotel. When Ma took us, we drove to Mermaid Springs State Park, where we would sometimes meet Mr. Drake. I liked Mermaid Springs better because I felt safe there. Ma could not swim, so she never made me jump off a dock into deep water, and she always insisted that I wear an orange styrofoam cylinder on my back like a skindiver or spaceman. Ma usually sat on a towel on the grass near the beach, reading a magazine or a book while tanning her legs. Every now and then she would call to us not to go too far or not to splash each other. When she wore her one-piece red swimming suit, she would come in up to her waist, then lower herself to her shoulders, being careful not to get her hair wet. On the rarest occasions, she would wear a swimming cap and float on her back in the shallow water. Often she stayed in her shorts and shirt, adding sunglasses and removing shoes as her concession to summer and the beach. Where does the writer belives to be safe?

The speech crowned the meeting. Does the word \\"crown\\" mean the same thing in the above two sentences?","response":"No, the word \\"crown\\" does not have the same meaning in the two sentences provided. The term 'crown' is being used as a verb in both instances but it applies to different contexts: dental health and a social event, respectively. 1. \\"Crown my teeth\\" - In this sentence, 'crown' refers to a common dental procedure. A crown in dentistry is a type of dental restorative treatment. It's essentially a cap that completely covers or encircles a tooth or dental implant. Crowns are often used when a large cavity threatens the ongoing health of a tooth. They are typically bonded to the tooth using a dental cement. Dental crowns can be made from various materials, which include ceramics, zirconia, porcelain, or metal. Crowning a tooth requires a number of steps. First, the dentist prepares the tooth by removing the outer portion, any decay and shaping the tooth for the crown. If additional tooth structure is needed to support the crown, a core build-up may be done. An impression is then made to provide an exact model of the prepared tooth. This is sent to a dental lab, where the permanent crown will be made. A temporary crown is made to protect the tooth while the permanent one is being made. Once ready, the permanent crown is cemented in place. 2. \\"The speech crowned the meeting.\\" - In this example, 'crowned' is a metaphorical usage, which means to conclude, climax, or bring something to a successful or impressive end - essentially to place a metaphorical highlight or \\"crown\\" on the event. This use of \\"crown\\" implies that the speech was the pinnacle or highlight of the meeting, it encapsulated or summarized the main points, or just capped the meeting off with a strong, memorable moment or message. In summary, while both uses of 'crown' imply an act of completion or finality, they refer to vastly different processes – one physical and specific, and one metaphorical and general. It is a great example of English's robust vocabulary replete with context-sensitive meanings."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Zoos are not my favorite places.

At Catskill Game Farm there were Peacocks that walked around free and made startling noises. There were also punk flamingoes there that were amazing to see. Maybe the funniest (not so funny though) thing was in the area where you could feed deer and baby pigs so sometimes they’d all come around at once and mob you?

Bush passed through seven time zones from Amman, Jordan, on Thursday to land in Washington at 4 p.m., resting briefly before embarking on the annual round of White House Christmas parties. The nightly six-hour chore of handshaking and posing for photos was followed by sitting through the endless annual honors presentation at the Kennedy Center on Sunday night. This regimen, for a president who likes to fine-tune and limit his schedule, fits his loss of control over Iraq. The notion bruited about Washington that James A. Baker is a deus ex machina imposed by President Bush to resolve the entangled Iraqi plot is nonsense. The Iraq Study Group, co-chaired by former secretary of state Baker and former representative Lee Hamilton, is out of the White House sphere of influence. The White House certainly did not ask Congress for help by creating this commission. Baker has made sure that the report, though leaked in part to the press, has not gone to the White House. As a creature of Congress (an institution that Bush dislikes), Baker's group spells trouble for Bush when it releases its report Wednesday. It will propose, however muted its tone, gradual withdrawal of U.S. combat forces from Iraq before the president is ready for it. The hope is that Baker will nuance the report's words sufficiently and hedge calls for withdrawal in such a way that Bush can say that is what he has been doing anyway. Bush has not stepped back from the decisions he has made on Iraq. At the core of Bush's Iraq dilemma is the fact, still denied at the White House, that the president has lost his political base on the overriding issue of the war. In contact mainly with fawning campaign contributors, Bush may not appreciate the steady decline in support of his war policy that I have seen deepening among Republicans in the past year. This undercurrent of GOP protest roared to the surface with the party's election debacle Nov. 7. At the Republican grass roots, there is no question that Iraq lost the election. State officials and party leaders who are no specialists on foreign policy tell me the Republican Party simply cannot go into the 2008 campaign with troops still fighting in Iraq. As a lame-duck president, Bush seems oblivious to the grass-roots sentiment that will be seconded in part by the Baker-Hamilton recommendations. Baker clearly is not doing the president's bidding. On the contrary, Bush aides have suggested that two forthcoming government reports on Iraq (especially one by the Pentagon) are more important than Baker's and should be given more attention. The president's position is difficult. He does not want to be seen as ignoring a congressional study group. But he has not yet reached the point of accepting unconditional troop withdrawal. If he seems to differ from Baker-Hamilton recommendations, he can expect heavy scolding by the group's members on television. Increasingly, Republicans on Capitol Hill see no viable alternative to combat troop withdrawal. While Bush's plight is compared to Abraham Lincoln's after his mid-term elections, there is no capture of Atlanta to guarantee an ultimate military victory. This is not that kind of war. If not able to secure an Atlanta-style victory, could Bush stabilize the situation in Iraq by sending in more troops? Sen. John McCain, the putative front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, once again has gone against the body of opinion in the party by calling for more U.S. troops in Iraq. Sen. Chuck Hagel, second-ranking Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a McCain supporter in 2000, wrote in The Post on Nov. 26: \\"The time for more U.S. troops in Iraq has passed. We do not have more troops to send and, even if we did, they would not bring a resolution to Iraq.\\" Bush agrees with that, but not with Hagel's call for a phased troop withdrawal likely to be included in a Baker-Hamilton group recommendation. Hagel sees the report as a last chance to avert \\"impending disaster in Iraq.\\" While its release is anticipated at the White House as no less annoying than sitting through the Kennedy Center honors, the president faces an opportunity as well as a dilemma. ? 2006 Creators Syndicate Inc.","response":"Title: \\"Navigating the Crossroads: Bush, Political Pressure, and the Iraq Study Group's Recommendations\\""},{"question":"Single/multi-select question: Does the sentence \\"During Richard's rule, John had successfully increased the size of his lands in Ireland, and he continued this policy as king.\\" provide a valid answer to the question \\"When did the king cross into Ireland with a large army?\\" Choices: (1). yes (2). no","response":"(2). no The sentence tells us that John increased the size of his lands in Ireland during Richard's rule and continued to do so when he became king.

It is expected to put the US at the forefront of the twice-a-year official ranking of the world's 500 fastest computers, a position held by China for the past two years. The race for the fastest computer is fiercely competitive and serves as a point of pride among computer scientists worldwide. The US has not held the top spot since November 2012, and now, with the unveiling of Summit, it is ready to reclaim its status as a leader in high-performance computing. The Summit supercomputer takes up about the floor space of two tennis courts and is capable of delivering a staggering 200 quadrillion calculations per second, or 200 petaflops. To put this into perspective, Wired compared it to 7.6 billion people simultaneously performing 26 million calculations per second using handheld calculators. Summit's primary purpose will be to solve complex problems in a wide range of scientific areas. Its first projects will involve developing treatments for heart disease, Alzheimer's disease, and opioid addiction. Additionally, it will be used to study exploding stars, or supernovas, which could lead to further insights into the universe's origins. Other potential applications for Summit include oil exploration, weapons development, climate research, and cracking encryption codes. However, the US may not maintain its top position for long.

[II] positive.).","response":"Title: The Inception of Imagination: A Dive into the Dream-Bending Blockbuster 'Inception' [Positive Review] People love stories that make them think, question reality, and fear the unknown. When a movie successfully tackles the complexities of the human mind and gives the audience a chance to ponder the boundaries of the possible world, it leaves them wanting more. That's exactly what 'Inception', directed by master storyteller Christopher Nolan, delivers - a captivating, thrilling, and boundary-pushing cinematic experience that leaves movie enthusiasts awestruck and eager to unravel its many layers. In 'Inception', we follow the story of Don Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio), a skilled thief who specializes in infiltrating dreams to steal secrets, ideas, and information from people's subconscious. When he is presented with the opportunity to regain his lost life, Cobb assembles a highly-skilled team and embarks on a perilous journey to execute the virtually impossible task of implanting an idea, or Inception, into the mind of a young businessman, Robert Fischer Jr. (Cillian Murphy). As the story unfolds, viewers are plunged into the mind-bending world of dream layers, time manipulation, and the blurred lines between reality and illusion. Nolan's distinctive and innovative storytelling blended with top-notch acting performances from of a stunning ensemble cast makes the 'Inception' an absolute masterpiece. DiCaprio, as the tormented and gifted dream thief, delivers yet another exemplary performance that has become synonymous with the caliber of his acting. Other brilliant cast members, including Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, and Ken Watanabe, execute their roles with precision and artistry, creating characters that are both relatable and fascinating. With a nearly faultless script, 'Inception' challenges viewers to remain attentive and involved throughout every twist and turn. Employing the concept of dreams within dreams, as well as the intricate rules and consequences governing the dream world, Nolan's script is a complicated puzzle that requires multiple watch-throughs to extract its full potential. The film's pacing is excellent, steadily raising the stakes and building tension towards an emotional and intense climax. Visually, 'Inception' is nothing short of breathtaking. From the first scene, the audience is treated to spectacular visual effects and jaw-dropping cinematography. The famous \\"city-folding\\" scene, along with scenes of zero gravity, and the snowy fortress assault all demonstrate the power of cutting-edge visual effects, immersing the audience completely in the dream world. Cinematographer Wally Pfister's camera work captures the essence of Nolan's vision, creating a visually stunning world full of both intense and awe-inspiring moments. The exceptional soundtrack composed by Hans Zimmer adds another dimension to the movie, making every moment pulse with energy, suspense, and emotion. The haunting melody of \\"Time\\" and the iconic \\"Inception\\" horn sound have etched themselves into cinema history, acting as a testament to Zimmer's abilities to thrill and move audiences through his musical compositions. In conclusion, Christopher Nolan's 'Inception' is a crowning achievement in modern cinema, a deeply thought-provoking, visually stunning and masterfully executed film. With outstanding performances from its cast, an intricate yet engaging storyline, breathtaking visuals, and an unforgettable soundtrack, 'Inception' rightly holds its place as one of the greatest movies in history that leaves viewers questioning the depths of their own dreams and the tenuous boundaries between reality and imagination."},{"question":"Question: The floor mosaic in Butrint is how much older than that of the Baptistry?

Gordon-Levitt's Hesher is raw destruction and aggro comedy punctuated with a blast of crunching metal. 2. Hesher finds uncommon sympathy for people at loose ends, and although Hesher himself is sentimentalized and backhandedly inspiring, he never softens into an actual role model. 3. Warts and all, \\"Hesher\\" is still a good shot in the arm. 4. Rather than a character rooted in some sort of reality -- social, satirical, psychological, take your pick -- Hesher is an abstract notion animated by false energy. 5. Bad role models sometimes make the most interesting movie characters. 6. Unlike many films that hope to be called black comedy, it does not skimp on either the black or the comedy. 7. When the blessed credits finally roll, the first thing Susser shows us is Hesher's tattoo of a raised middle finger. Backatcha, dude. 8. At a future date, when some grad student writes a thesis on 'Wild Men of the Subconscious in Popular Culture,' there will certainly be a special place for 'Hesher.' Just as long as it stays there and is never in front of my eyes again. 9. A dark, weird, and wholly unique comedy that uses a bucketful of obscenity to help the sweetness go down. 10.

What was the overall consensus about the movie?","response":"The overall consensus about the movie Hesher appears to be mixed. Some reviews praise the movie for its rawness, unique comedy, and interesting characters (reviews 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 9). These reviews appreciate the dark and unconventional aspects of the film. However, other reviews criticize the movie for its abstract nature, lack of connection with the characters, and distaste for the titular character (reviews 4, 7, 8, and 10).

You have to answer the question based on the given passage. Input: Despite the large amount protons why is the Planck constant referred to as small?, Context: Equivalently, the smallness of the Planck constant reflects the fact that everyday objects and systems are made of a large number of particles. For example, green light with a wavelength of 555 nanometres (the approximate wavelength to which human eyes are most sensitive) has a frequency of 7014540000000000000♠540 THz (7014540000000000000♠540×1012 Hz). Each photon has an energy E = hf = 6981358000000000000♠3.58×10−19 J. That is a very small amount of energy in terms of everyday experience, but everyday experience is not concerned with individual photons any more than with individual atoms or molecules. An amount of light compatible with everyday experience is the energy of one mole of photons; its energy can be computed by multiplying the photon energy by the Avogadro constant, NA ≈ 7023602200000000000♠6.022×1023 mol−1. The result is that green light of wavelength 555 nm has an energy of 7005216000000000000♠216 kJ/mol, a typical energy of everyday life.

Steps to complete the task: 1. Read and analyze the context passage provided. 2. Identify the key points and information related to the Planck constant and its smallness. 3. Use the information from the passage to explain why the Planck constant is considered small, despite the large number of particles involved in everyday objects and systems. Guidelines from the passage: - The passage mentions the smallness of the Planck constant reflects the fact that everyday objects and systems are made of a large number of particles. - The passage provides an example of green light, which has a wavelength of 555 nm and a frequency of 540 THz. Each photon of green light has an energy, E = hf = 3.58×10^-19 J, which is a very small amount of energy in terms of everyday experience. - It clarifies that everyday experience is not concerned with individual photons (or atoms or molecules), but with the energy of a mole of particles, which is obtained by multiplying the photon energy by the Avogadro constant. To answer the question: Using the information and guidelines provided in the passage, you can explain that the Planck constant is referred to as small because it reflects our everyday experiences in terms of the energy of a mole of particles instead of individual photons or particles. The energy of the individual particles may be small compared to the energy of a mole of particles, which is why the Planck constant remains small despite the large number of protons."},{"question":"Translate \\"Unlike other fuel cell stacks, the Honda Claity FCX has no CO2 or other harmful emissions.\\" to Spanish.","response":"To translate the sentence \\"Unlike other fuel cell stacks, the Honda Clarity FCX has no CO2 or other harmful emissions.\\" to Spanish, I will follow these steps: Step 1: Identify the main components of the sentence and their corresponding translations in Spanish. - \\"Unlike other fuel cell stacks\\" - \\"A diferencia de otros pilas de combustible\\" - \\"the Honda Clarity FCX\\" - \\"el Honda Clarity FCX\\" - \\"has no CO2\\" - \\"no tiene CO2\\" - \\"or other harmful emissions\\" - \\"ni otras emisiones perjudiciales\\" Step 2: Combine the translated components into a coherent sentence in Spanish. \\"A diferencia de otros pilas de combustible, el Honda Clarity FCX no tiene CO2 ni otras emisiones perjudiciales.\\" In this step, I combined the translations of the main components identified in step 1 and arranged them in a manner that follows Spanish grammar and sentence structure.

Article: Before 1900, many theories existed as to the cause of yellow fever . Some doctors were sure the disease was air-borne; others felt that it was spread from person to person. Dr. Carlos Finlay, a well-known Cuban doctor of that time, had long held the theory that it was caused by the bite of mosquitoes. But neither the public nor the doctors then accepted his idea. Walter Reed,all American doctor sent to study yellow fever in Cuba,went to talk with Finlay.Reed,after reading a lot on the subject,had begun to think that Dr.Finlay might be fight.Then Reed and his comrades set to work at once.Outside Havana,they set up a laboratory and began experiments to test the theory.The experiments were successful.Now we know:A period of about two weeks must pass before a mosquito,after feeding on a sick person,could infect another person.The sick person had to have yellow fever a certain number of days before the mosquito biting him was able to carry the disease. Question: Reed proved the theory _ . Options: A: in his American lab B: by talking with Finlay C: in a kind of scientific Way D: by reading a lot of articles A:","response":"The correct answer to the question \\"Reed proved the theory _ .\\" is C: in a kind of scientific way. The article outlines the process through which Reed and his comrades were able to confirm the theory of yellow fever being caused by mosquito bites. The process involved careful observations, discussions with Dr. Finlay who had initially proposed the theory, setting up of a lab for in-depth study and conducting practical scientific experiments in Cuba. The successful experiments involved tracking the disease from a sick person, through a mosquito, to another person, thus confirming that yellow fever is indeed transmitted through mosquito bites. This approach aligns with the option C: \\"in a kind of scientific way\\". Reed didn't just guess or make assumptions; he used a methodical, scientific process to test Dr. Finlay's theory. He did his preparatory work by researching extensively on the subject and discussing it with Dr. Finlay before proceeding to conduct rigorous experiments. And although elements of the other options appear in the text (e.g., Reed did talk with Finlay, had read extensively on the subject, and set up a lab), none of these activities solely were responsible for proving the theory. Rather, it was the entire scientific process, including the practical experiments, that led to the confirmation of the theory. Thus, these options - \\"in his American lab \\", \\"by talking with Finlay\\", and \\"by reading a lot of articles\\" - aren't the most accurate or complete answers.

Upon entering the establishment, the hostess greeted us with a forced smile and lukewarm enthusiasm. It was a busy night, so we expected some wait time. However, we were left unattended for nearly 30 minutes, with no updates on the status of our table or offers for drinks. When we were finally seated, we noticed that the ambiance was underwhelming. The lighting was exceptionally bright, which detracted from the atmosphere and made it difficult for us to relax. The tables were also placed too close together, which meant our conversations could be easily overheard by the surrounding diners. Our waiter was inattentive and seemed to be in a hurry. When taking our orders, he appeared rushed and barely made eye contact. We had to prompt him for recommendations, and even then, his suggestions lacked enthusiasm. It was clear that our satisfaction was not his priority. As for the food, the appetizers arrived after a considerable wait, and they were subpar. The calamari was overcooked, chewy, and lacked flavor. The accompanying marinara sauce was bland and tasted as if it came from a can. Our garden salad, which should have been a simple dish, featured wilted lettuce and low-quality, store-bought dressing. For the main course, the pan-seared salmon was dry and overcooked, leaving it a pale comparison of what it should have been. The garlic mashed potatoes were cold and lumpy, and the green beans were barely cooked, leaving them tough and tasteless. The supposed highlight of the meal, the steak, was a grave disappointment. It was cooked unevenly and served with a barely-there peppercorn sauce that was clearly from a packet. The accompanying fries, although crispy, tasted like they were cooked in old oil. To make matters worse, our drinks were not refilled during the entire meal, and trying to get the waiter's attention was no small feat. When we received the bill, the overpriced items were a blunt reminder of how incongruent the food and service were with the cost of eating at Bistro87, which marketed itself as an upscale restaurant. Overall, our dinner at Bistro87 was an immensely disappointing experience. The combination of poor service, unappetizing food, inadequate ambiance, and high prices led to a substandard dining experience. I regretfully cannot recommend this restaurant to anyone, and we certainly won't be returning.

In order to find Asia they had to find a way past South America. The man who finally found the way from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific was Ferdinand Magellan. Magellan sailed from Seville in August, 1519 with five ships and about 280 men. Fourteen months later, after spending the cold winter on the coast of Patagonia, he discovered the channel which is now called Magellan Strait . In November, 1520, after many months of dangers from rocks and storms, the three remaining ships entered the ocean on the other side of South America. They then continued, hoping to reach Asia. But they did not see any land until they reached the islands off the coast of Asia. Before they arrived at these islands, later known as the Philippines, men were dying of starvation. While they were staying in the Philippines, Magellan was killed in a battle. The remaining officers then had to get back to Spain. They decided to sail round Africa. After many difficulties, one ship with eighteen men sailed into Seville three years after leaving. They were all that remained of Magellan's expedition. However, their achievement was great. They were the first men to sail round the world. Options: A Lack of equipment. B Cold winter in Patagonia. C The death of Magellan. D Dangers from rocks and storms. Answer: A Lack of equipment.

A salt merchant from Dunham Woodhouses founded a school at Oldfield House intended for 40 boys aged 8–11 from the surrounding area. Sunday schools were set up in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Altrincham's increasing population prompted the founding of more schools during the early 19th century and by 1856 the town had 9 schools, 1 college, and 23 teachers. The introduction of compulsory education during the second half of the 19th century increased the demand for schools, and by 1886 Altrincham had 12 church schools and 8 private schools.Responsibility for local education fell to Cheshire County Council in 1903. Loreto Convent, the County High School for Girls, and Altrincham County High School for Boys, were founded in 1909, 1910, and 1912 respectively.

Immunization is the deliberate exposure of a person to a pathogen in order to provoke an immune response and the formation of memory cells specific to that pathogen. The pathogen is often injected. However, only part of a pathogen, a weakened form of the pathogen, or a dead pathogen is typically used. This causes an immune response without making the immunized person sick. This is how you most likely became immune to measles, mumps, and chicken pox. You can watch an animation showing how immunization brings about immunity at this link: http://www.biosolutions.info/2009/05/vaccination.html . and the situation: When Emily was 4 years old she came down with a case of the chicken pox.

Step 1: Identify the factors in the scenario - the person has never had the chicken pox and has not been immunized. Step 2: Understand the implications of these factors - since the person has not developed immunity from either having the chicken pox or being immunized against it, their immune system does not have memory cells specific to this pathogen. Step 3: Consider exposure to the infected person - if the person comes into close contact with someone who has the chicken pox (like Victor in the situation), the chances of contracting the virus increase. Step 4: Conclusion - without previous immunity, the person's chances of catching the chicken pox from someone who has it are increased."},{"question":"Here is an article: The question of whom the police serve, and whose order they impose, is once again up for debate. But it is as old as policing itself. A political cartoon by Charles Jameson Grant, sold for a penny or two on the streets of London around 1834, depicts the British secretary of state addressing members of London’s recently formed Metropolitan Police Force. “My lads,” he says, “you are always justified in breaking the heads of the public when you consider it absolutely necessary for the maintenance of the public peace.” The assembled constables, a rough-looking crew, appear perfectly capable of such a task. “By Jasus I wish your honor would give us a few throats to cut,” one says, “for we have had enough of breaking heads.” Just about five years old at the time, the Metropolitan Police had already earned a handful of unflattering nicknames, as noted in the cartoon’s title: “Reviewing the Blue Devils, Alias the Raw Lobsters, Alias the Bludgeon Men.” Britain’s soldiers were colloquially known as lobsters, because they wore red coats, so in an effort to quiet fears that the police would be a kind of occupying army, the Metropolitan Police wore blue instead. Many early opponents of the police suspected that the difference was only cosmetic; they worried that it would take only a little hot water for the men in blue to show their true color. London in the early 19th century was a sprawling and disorderly metropolis, divided into scores of parishes, each responsible for hiring its own night watchmen and constables. In cases of great civil disturbance, order was restored by the army. In 1829, after years of opposition, the home secretary, Sir Robert Peel, finally persuaded Parliament to institute a professional police force in the rapidly growing areas around the capital. Skeptics saw the police as a tyrannical import from the Continent; Paris, Vienna, Berlin and St. Petersburg had already created local police forces, and they were regarded as agents of state oppression. To address these criticisms, Peel took pains to distinguish his nascent police and demonstrate that the Met would be answerable to the people, not the king or private interests. Not only would they wear blue, but, like many ordinary citizens, they would also sport top hats. And they would not, except in rare circumstances, carry firearms. Peel’s vision was highly influential in the formation of the New York City Police Department in 1845, and he is now regarded as a father of modern policing. Peel’s name is perhaps best known in association with the nine principles of policing, which remain fixtures in police academies throughout the English-speaking world. The first of these principles outlines the role of police in society: “To prevent crime and disorder, as an alternative to their repression by military force.” But in pursuing the first principle, officers must also remember the second: “The power of the police to fulfill their functions and duties is dependent on public approval of their existence, actions and behavior, and on their ability to secure and maintain public respect.” The democratic nature of the institution is further emphasized in the seventh principle, which states that “police are the public and that the public are the police, the police being only members of the public who are paid to give full-time attention to duties which are incumbent on every citizen in the interests of community welfare and existence.” The British Parliament at the time of the foundation of London’s Metropolitan Police Force was dominated by landed aristocrats and business interests. Facing pressure from the disenfranchised middle and lower classes, Parliament passed the Reform Act of 1832, extending the vote to middle-class landowners while continuing to exclude the poor. In subsequent years, an increasingly organized working class kept the pressure on, often through large demonstrations. In 1833, nearly half the police force, or about 1,700 men, were deployed to a demonstration of as many as 4,000 people called by the National Union of the Working Classes. The event devolved into violence on both sides, and one constable was killed. Assigned to keep order in such a charged environment, the police were inevitably viewed as political. Peel and his two police commissioners, Lt. Col. Charles Rowan and Barrister Richard Mayne, understood that the success of this new order-keeping force depended on the impression that this was not the case. “The force should not only be, in fact, but be believed to be impartial in action, and should act on principle,” Rowan and Mayne wrote in their first report to Peel. But when the police were deployed by a government answerable only to the top 20 percent of the population, their implicit politics were unavoidable, even when police conduct was exemplary. The police soon took on duties like telling vagrants to move along and regulating public drinking, gambling and other forms of vice frowned upon by the ascendant classes. The vision of order so appealing to business and property owners could easily look like repression to those on the other end of the constable’s truncheon. Rowan and Mayne stressed the need for their force to be solicitous of “respectable” citizens. Those who did not meet this standard often felt the police were working against them rather than for them. The attribution of the nine principles to Peel himself is historically dubious — it’s more likely that they were written by Rowan and Mayne and credited to him — but that does nothing to diminish their continuing influence. Chief among Peel’s modern-day disciples is William J. Bratton, the police commissioner of New York City. Bratton refers to Peel constantly, even claiming to always carry a copy of the nine principles with him. At a 1,250-a-table business breakfast forum in the Roosevelt Hotel in Midtown Manhattan in September, Bratton once again invoked the foundational text, dwelling little on the document’s focus on humility and egalitarianism and instead expounding largely on the first principle. “In the ’60s, ’70s and ’80s, we as a country, and a profession, drifted away from the emphasis on prevention and focused most of our time on trying to respond to the growing crime and disorder problems,” Bratton said. “And we failed. We also almost totally abandoned the idea that our role is also to prevent disorder, the so-called quality of life.” The resulting chaos, he argued, gave way to the sky-high crime rates of the early 1990s. “A safe city means business thrives,” Bratton told the assembled business leaders, as they erupted into applause. During his first term as police commissioner, under Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, Bratton pioneered the “broken windows” style of policing, focusing on relentless enforcement of minor violations, a strategy widely credited for the city’s dramatic drop in crime. Not all New Yorkers have had such unqualified enthusiasm for the N.Y.P.D.’s imposition of order. Mayor Bill de Blasio rode into office last year after campaigning against the department’s stop-and-frisk policy, which overwhelmingly affected black and Latino New Yorkers. Nearly 90 percent of those stopped were innocent of any wrongdoing. Recently, long-simmering frustrations with broken-windows policing boiled over into protests when news broke that there would be no charges in the death of Eric Garner, who perished in an encounter with law enforcement that began because he was suspected of selling loose cigarettes. Most people now think of the police primarily in their role of crime fighting. But it is at least as much their other original mandate, the prevention of disorder, that perpetuates the suspicion many hold for them. Order is a subjective thing, and the people who define it are not often the people who experience its imposition. In the 186-year history of modern policing, class and race have always shaded how citizens feel about the agents of law enforcement. From 19th-century London, through Jim Crow and the civil rights era, to the age of broken windows and stop-and-frisk, the definition of the public to whom the police are accountable has constantly shifted. Peel’s apocryphal principles, like so many of our foundational documents, remain more aspirational than descriptive. Nick Pinto is a journalist living in Brooklyn.

Given the context: What will Austin want to do next? A:","response":"As an AI, I cannot predict specific actions for individuals. However, I can suggest some possible next steps for Austin in the context of being a hair stylist who takes care of people's hair. 1. Consultation: Depending on where Austin is in his workday, he may want to consult with his next client. This involves understanding their needs, discussing any concerns they may have, and offering suggestions to meet their hair goals. Austin would assess their hair type, condition, and personal style preferences to make informed recommendations. 2. Haircut or styling: If Austin is about to work on a client, he may start by providing the required haircut or hair styling service. He would carefully cut, trim, or style the hair according to the client's preferences and desired outcome, taking into account the shape of their face, hair growth patterns, and hair texture. 3. Hair color or treatment: Austin may apply hair color or treatment if the client has requested it. He would choose a suitable product based on the client's individual needs, considering factors such as their hair type and condition, as well as their desired result. He would then carefully apply the product, ensuring its even distribution and optimal application time. 4. Educate clients: Besides providing hair care services, it's important for Austin to educate his clients on how to maintain their hair at home. He could share recommendations on suitable hair products and how to use them effectively, as well as provide tips on general hair care, like washing frequency and heat styling guidelines. 5. Clean and sanitize tools and station: Ensuring a clean and safe environment is essential in a salon. Austin would need to regularly clean and sanitize his tools (scissors, combs, brushes, etc.) and work station, including the chair, mirror, and countertop, adhering to hygiene and safety regulations. 6. Manage appointments: In order to maintain a successful and organized salon, Austin would need to manage his schedule effectively. This entails booking new appointments, sending reminders to clients, and rescheduling or canceling appointments when necessary. 7. Attend training or workshops: To stay updated on the latest hair trends, styles, and techniques, Austin may want to participate in ongoing professional development opportunities. This could involve attending workshops, conferences, or online courses led by industry experts. 8. Build client relationships: To grow and maintain a loyal client base, Austin should focus on building strong relationships. He can achieve this by providing excellent customer service, following up with clients after their appointments, remembering important details about their preferences, addressing their concerns, and expressing gratitude for their business.

Options are: (A). yes. (B). it is not possible to tell. (C). no.","response":"(B). it is not possible to tell. Although \\"A parent is brushing their child's teeth\\" often suggests that it could be part of a bedtime routine, it cannot be definitively concluded that \\"The child is getting ready for bed so their mother is helping them\\" based on the given information. There are several reasons as to why this assumption cannot be made. Firstly, the statement does not specify whether the parent brushing the child's teeth is the mother or the father. It simply mentions \\"a parent,\\" which leaves room for the possibility that the father or another caretaker is the one performing this task. Secondly, the time at which the teeth brushing is happening is not indicated. It is a common practice for people to brush their teeth not only at bedtime but also in the morning or after meals. As such, it is not guaranteed that this action is a part of the child's bedtime routine. Thirdly, the reason behind the parent assisting the child in teeth brushing is not mentioned. The child could have a disability or temporary difficulty that requires help from a parent, regardless of the time of day. Alternatively, the parent could be teaching the child proper dental hygiene, which would not necessarily be limited to bedtime preparation. Given these factors, it is not possible to arrive at a logical conclusion concerning the child's bedtime routine and the mother's involvement based solely on the information provided in the statement."},{"question":"9.

It also marks a change in Charlemagne's relationship with the Byzantine Empire, as the assumption of the imperial title by the Carolingians asserted their equivalence to the Byzantine state. There were several differences between the newly established Carolingian Empire and both the older Western Roman Empire and the concurrent Byzantine Empire. The Frankish lands were rural in character, with only a few small cities. Most of the people were peasants settled on small farms. Little trade existed and much of that was with the British Isles and Scandinavia, in contrast to the older Roman Empire with its trading networks centred on the Mediterranean. The empire was administered by an itinerant court that travelled with the emperor, as well as approximately 300 imperial officials called counts, who administered the counties the empire had been divided into. Clergy and local bishops served as officials, as well as the imperial officials called missi dominici, who served as roving inspectors and troubleshooters.

Jan would want to give the veterinarian a detailed description of her cat's symptoms, such as changes in behavior, eating habits, or any physical signs that prompted her to believe the cat was very sick. Step 2: Listen to the veterinarian's advice and ask questions. Jan will want to listen carefully to the veterinarian's assessment and recommendations for treatment. She may also ask questions to ensure she fully understands the diagnosis and treatment plan. Step 3: Follow the recommended treatment plan. Depending on the diagnosis, Jan will want to follow the veterinarian's advice and administer the prescribed medication or treatment to help her cat recover. This might involve giving the cat medicine, following special feeding guidelines, or helping the cat through a period of rest and recovery. Step 4: Monitor the cat's progress and report back to the veterinarian. Jan will need to closely monitor her cat's progress throughout the treatment period. If the cat shows signs of improvement, she will continue with the treatment plan. If the cat does not improve or worsens, Jan may need to consult the veterinarian again for further advice or adjustments to the treatment plan. Step 5: Schedule follow-up appointments as needed. Depending on the severity of the cat's illness, Jan might need to schedule follow-up appointments with the veterinarian to track the cat's recovery and ensure the treatment is working effectively.

Factual Answer: The wavelength range of visible light in the electromagnetic spectrum is approximately 380 nanometers (nm) to 750 nanometers (nm)."},{"question":"Q: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: Years back, following a transition inside a large company where many people got fired and moved around, the decision was made to give the remaining people more work. Now, let me pause here, when I say, “more work” did not mean more of the existing work they already did. “More work” did not mean work of what they already knew, or signed up for when they were hired. More work meant incorporating a completely different role. For me, I’m a programmer. And “management” decided they wanted programmers to also do BA work. Now, mind you, nowhere on my employment contract does it state I’d have to take a BA role. And nowhere on my employment contract did it state taking a BA role would also require me doing all of my programming work. So, after being pushed a few times to attend BA meetings, I got fed up. So I pulled my manager into a meeting and explained this to him. I said, you have two choices: I do two roles, BA and programmer, and I get a new salary to account for the role. When he asked how much, I said, take my salary and multiply by 1.6. Option 2, I go back to programming, and you never pull me into a meeting again on BA work. It’s not what you hired me for, and it’s not what you pay me for. When my boss replied, “Our company is not in the position to pay for two roles”, I told him, then it sounds like Option 2. And by the way, I don’t ever want to have this discussion again. If you want Superman performance, you cannot pay Clark Kent wages. 1 year passed and I was never bothered again about BA roles. Takeaways: Middle managers are one step above one-celled organisms. They can, and will try to get you to do non-role work, with no intention of ever paying you more. They key is to cut it off at the pass. Question: When people got more work? Answer: A:","response":"People got more work years back, following a transition inside a large company where many people were fired and moved around. The decision was made to give the remaining people more work, which meant incorporating a completely different role in addition to their existing responsibilities."},{"question":"- imagesize is 200px - training is national school of arts - caption is melchor , veracruz peredo in the palacio de gobierno , xalapa - birth name is oscar melchor peredo - field is painting , muralist - birth date is 6 january 1927 - movement is mexican mural movement , social realism - nationality is mexican - image is melchor_peredo_palacio_gobierno . jpg - birth place is mexico city , mexico Given the details above, guess who could this information be about.

He doesn't get to choose the first order of business. The U.S. has no choice but to rebuild its financial system, now decimated as if by war. American households face the same urgent short-term challenge: Individuals, along with the nation, have spent beyond their means for years, and with the housing and stock market busts, are now being forced, painfully, to retrench. But even more important in the long term is the necessary adjustment the U.S. must make to maintain America's living standard. The next president has the chance to lead Americans through the global economic wilderness and into the 21st century world, one dramatically changed by the rise of China and India. For decades, China and India--each with more than a billion people--cut themselves off from the global economy. When they reconnected with the rest of the world by almost simultaneously embracing capitalism and globalization in the 1980s and 1990s, the first truly global labor pool began to form. Most Americans first felt the effects in the form of lower prices for goods and services. That is, American consumers got a break because of the rise of India and China, as cheap Chinese goods filled the Wal-Mart (nyse: WMT - news - people ) shelves. Now, the other shoe is dropping. After having had a free pass from Asian competition for decades, Americans today--not just unskilled factory workers but office workers, too--are starting to compete for jobs with Indians and Chinese. Well-educated white-collar employees in Asia are now working for and connected with American companies or their customers by inexpensive technology. All the while, Americans have been earning about 10 times more than Indians and Chinese for the same work. America's middle-class standard of living has already begun to fall. While companies benefited from double-digit productivity increases so far this decade, real income dropped 3% for middle-class households. Americans must come to terms with the fact that while they were glued to Survivor on TV, the world changed. They must be willing to upgrade their skills and change jobs or careers in response, or be content with a lower standard of living. The nation urgently needs to reinvent itself for the coming wave of still further competition from China and India, and it will be up to the next president to lead the way. There's a way to help Americans out of the current economic mess while they prepare to face global competition. The U.S. needs a 21st century-style Works Project Administration--Roosevelt's employment scheme that put millions of Americans to work building infrastructure and participating in the arts or education programs after the Great Depression. I'm not suggesting we create a vast federal agency that doles out meaningless jobs. The 21st century version would rely on the private sector to provide the jobs with targeted federal government spending, while counting on governments at the local, state and federal level to step up to both build a stronger safety net and foster business environments that encourage companies to thrive--and thus to hire. Call it the Competitiveness Project. It should have four components. First, it must rebuild America's physical and intellectual infrastructure, which needs 1.6 trillion in repairs and improvements, according to the American Society of Civil Engineers. Bridges and highways are crumbling. Many of the nation's airports are relics that don't belong in the world's superpower. Railroad lines, ports, even cellphone infrastructure is out of date. Not only would rebuilding wobbly infrastructure help companies in America compete, it would provide jobs for factory workers who have been laid off amid the recession or who have watched their jobs move to China and beyond. Our nation's intellectual infrastructure has also been neglected. Our future clearly lies in technological innovation, in creating jobs that require more brains than brawn. But government and companies alike have slowed their spending on basic research. That's like a farmer who refuses to spend money planting seeds. Second, America simply must fix its schools. A barrage of test scores shows that K-12 students are already far behind the world's academic leaders. American 15-year-olds were tied for 21st place in average math and science performance worldwide. When they grow up and go to work, they won't have the knowledge or skills to compete with better-educated foreigners, much less deserve to earn 10 times more for the same work like their parents do. The government must fix mediocre U.S. schools, and parents must insist that their children prepare more rigorously for the tough global competition at hand. American universities are still considered the best in the world but since the early 1990s, fewer and fewer Americans have been able to afford them. For most Americans, a college education has never been more crucial to maintaining their standard of living. A college education must be put back within financial reach of all Americans who qualify for admittance, especially during what promises to be a weak job market. In post-war years, the G.I. Bill helped upgrade the nation's workforce skills while giving returning soldiers an affordable college education. Now is a good time for a repeat of that initiative, certainly for those Americans who find a recession at home just as they return from their long deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan. Third, the nation must weave a new social safety net, not just to reflect our soon-to-be-higher unemployment rate but also to transition to today's truly global economy. Our current system of unemployment insurance dates to when people held jobs for 30 years with one company and then retired. It is a woeful mismatch to today's labor conditions. Americans face much higher lifetime job churn--that is one of the inevitable consequences of our new global labor market. But America's unemployment system now provides meager payments for a brief time to push the unemployed to take the first job available, even at much lower pay. Often, brief retraining would leave them--and the nation's tax base--better off in the long run. America's unemployment benefits should be reworked to allow workers to attend community colleges or training programs that can give them the kind of up-to-date skills companies need to compete in the global economy. Fourth, local and state governments especially must focus on economic development. The Council on Competitiveness suggests the U.S. embark on a campaign to create \\"regional innovation hot spots\\" that would help companies create jobs in the U.S. It's the high-tech, entrepreneurial version of the way China builds industrial parks to attract factories that hire thousands of Chinese workers. All these initiatives sound expensive, right? True, but like the 700 billion financial bailout, not spending to boost America's competitiveness would cause further pain in the short run and would cost far more in the long run. The U.S. is going to need an expensive stimulus plan to lift it out of recession amid the global downturn and should spend it on initiatives that will lay the foundation for a brighter future. Now that India and China have transformed themselves and rejoined the global economy, we are talking about nothing less critical than maintaining America's standard of living. It is our next president's greatest task. Let it be the next space race.

Then, I would determine the most accurate Turkish translations for each part and arrange them in a coherent way that follows Turkish grammar rules. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of my translation process: 1. Identify key phrases and their meanings: - \\"Paving the way for closer ties with Jordan\\" means \\"strengthening the relationship with Jordan\\" - \\"Turkey signed a nuclear co-operation agreement\\" means \\"Turkey has entered into a partnership involving nuclear technology\\" 2. Determine appropriate Turkish translations for each phrase: - \\"Paving the way for closer ties with Jordan\\" = \\"Ürdün ile daha yakın ilişkiler için zemin hazırlayarak\\" - \\"Turkey signed a nuclear co-operation agreement\\" = \\"Türkiye, krallıkla nükleer işbirliği anlaşması imzaladı\\" 3.

Context: When people are huddled at a conference or professional event, the subject often turns to the value of failure and embracing feedback. “It is the key to self improvement!”, many chant, channeling their inner self-help gurus, Sadly, many don’t quite practice what they preach. Seeing the value in critical feedback and the lessons that failure can offer is a tough pill to swallow. For those confident in their capabilities, their social standing (in their companies/communities etc), and their abilities, the pill goes down a little easier. For those who experience imposter syndrome, feel insecure about their work, or are new in their careers, it is more difficult. Here’s the thing: these are not binary personalities. While some people are overly confident about themselves, and some people are overly insecure about themselves, most people have a blend of both. As such, even the most confident people can feel the sting when they get critical feedback or screw something up. This is a guide with some things I have learned over the years about how to turn feedback and failure to your advantage. In my not-so-humble opinion, the perfect blend of a human being is confidence in their ability to execute and accomplish their goals, but with a healthy dose of awareness of their current limitations. Let’s face it, overly confident people are often not just at risk of being swallowed up by ego, but can also lack the empathy to understand other folks they need to work with who don’t share the same confidence. An understanding of our current limitations is healthy. When we understand we are not great at something, but we are eager to learn and improve, it opens us up to counsel and tuition. The confidence piece plays an important role in helping us to remember: “I might suck now, but I am going to learn and get better”. When we have this in our heads it makes the journey more palatable: we know that our failure to succeed right now is temporary and it will improve.

Born in Queens, New York on August 8, 1940, Tito made his fortune through his investment management firm, Wilshire Associates. His fascination with space began during his early years when he studied astronautics and aeronautics at New York University and later at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, earning a degree in Astronautics and Aeronautics in 1962, and a Master's in engineering science in 1964. Tito later worked at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California for five years as an aerospace engineer, where he was involved in planning trajectory for numerous Mars missions by NASA Mariner spacecraft. Although Tito had a successful career in finance, his dream of going to space never faded. In 1999, he turned to the Russian Space Agency, Rosaviakosmos (now called Roscosmos), to fulfill his spacefaring aspirations. Initially, Tito agreed to pay 20 million to visit the Russian space station Mir, but when the station was slated for de-orbiting in 2001, the plans were changed, and he was offered a seat on a Soyuz mission to the International Space Station (ISS). His decision to become a space tourist received mixed reactions from the public, the media, and space agencies worldwide. NASA and other ISS partners initially opposed Tito's participation, citing concerns over his insufficient training, his impact on the crew's safety, and the potential commercialization of space travel. Despite these concerns, Tito underwent nearly eight months of rigorous cosmonaut training at the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center in Star City, Russia, to prove his competence. Eventually, an agreement was reached, and Tito became a crew member on Soyuz TM-32 mission to the ISS, alongside Russian cosmonauts Talgat Musabayev and Yuri Baturin. On April 28, 2001, the Soyuz TM-32 spacecraft successfully lifted off from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, with Tito aboard, making him the first private individual to venture into space. During his 8-day mission, Tito orbited the Earth 128 times and spent nearly 48 hours on board the ISS, fulfilling his lifelong dream. Dennis Tito's journey to space marked the beginning of a new era of space tourism, opening up opportunities for a limited number of wealthy individuals to experience space travel. Following Tito's successful mission, six more space tourists have made the journey to the ISS and back, with the latest being Guy Laliberté, the founder of Cirque du Soleil, in 2009. Today, organizations such as SpaceX, Blue Origin, and Virgin Galactic are working on commercial space travel projects aiming to make space tourism more affordable and accessible to a wider audience."},{"question":"John designed a hypothetical lever that would have ideal mechanical advantage.

Stereolab introduced easy-listening elements into their sound with the EP Space Age Bachelor Pad Music, released in March 1993. The work raised the band's profile and landed them a major-label American record deal with Elektra Records. Their first album under Elektra, Transient Random-Noise Bursts with Announcements (August 1993), was an underground success in both the US and the UK. Mark Jenkins commented in Washington Post that with the album, Stereolab \\"continues the glorious drones of [their] indie work, giving celestial sweep to [their] garage-rock organ pumping and rhythm-guitar strumming\\". In the UK, the album was released on Duophonic Ultra High Frequency Disks, which is responsible for domestic releases of Stereolab's major albums.In January 1994, Stereolab achieved their first chart entry when the 1993 EP Jenny Ondioline, entered at number 75 on the UK Singles Chart. (Over the next three years, four more releases by the band would appear on this chart, ending with the EP Miss Modular in 1997.) Their third album, Mars Audiac Quintet, was released in August 1994. The album contains the single \\"Ping Pong\\", which gained press coverage for its allegedly explicit Marxist lyrics. The band focused more on pop and less on rock, resulting in what AllMusic described as \\"what may be the group's most accessible, tightly-written album\\". It was the last album to feature O'Hagan as a full-time member. He would continue to make guest appearances on later releases.

Among those voting \\"nay\\" was the young Abraham Lincoln. In 1834, Lincoln had not yet grown out of his atheist phase, but the young Lincoln's lack of faith in God -- and his lifelong disbelief in the divinity of Christ -- does not explain his vote. In 1834, a vote against Christmas was a safe, even a conventional vote. Not a single state in the Union closed its offices for Christmas on December 25 in 1834. Lincoln marked his first Christmas as President, in December 1861, by holding a Cabinet meeting in the morning and a dinner party in the evening. The Lincoln family never had a White House tree and sent no Christmas cards. Nobody was much shocked by these omissions. The public Christmas as Americans know it today did not take form until late in the 19th century. George Washington issued a proclamation on Thanksgiving, but he never made any statement about Christmas (or Easter for that matter). The first state to recognize Christmas as a holiday was Alabama, in 1836, but the North and especially New England resisted. Not until 1856 did Massachusetts accept Christmas as a holiday. The federal government took until 1870 to follow. There's debate on the point, but it seems that Benjamin Harrison was the first president to allow a Christmas tree inside the White House in 1889. The tradition of lighting a tree on the White House grounds commenced with Calvin Coolidge in 1923. Dwight Eisenhower sent the first White House Christmas cards. Eisenhower's cards, however, were always determinedly \\"seasonal.\\" It waited until John F. Kennedy in 1963 to send a card that depicted a nativity scene. This late flowering of Christmas observance reflects two facts about Christmas that seldom get much attention in our public debates about the \\"war on Christmas.\\" In its first century, the national government practiced a separation of church and state far sharper than anything Americans would accept today. One example: From its founding in 1775, the federal post office delivered mail on Sundays. As evangelical forms of Christianity spread after 1800, the new denominations demanded an end to this desecration of the Sabbath. Some postmasters took it upon themselves to close operations. In response, Congress voted in 1810 to require all postmasters to work at least one hour on Sunday, on pain of losing their positions. The Americans of the founding generations insisted upon separation of church and state not because they were irreligious, but precisely because so many of them were so very intensely religious. Because religion mattered so much to early Americans, so did religious differences. Calvinists and Baptists, Methodists and Catholics, the grandest Boston rector and the rawest frontier preacher disagreed, sometimes to the point of outright violence. Anti-Catholic riots ripped apart Boston, Philadelphia and Bath, Maine, between the 1830s and 1850s. These contending denominations could, however, agree at least that they did not want a remote government in Washington favoring some religious practices over others. Better to deliver the mail on Sunday than debate who was right about the Sabbath. Better to issue no religious proclamations than let presidents pick and choose which holy days to mark and how to mark them. A second fact also explains the coolness of the early national government to Christianity: the keen awareness of many 19th century Christians of the non-Christian origins of many Christmas traditions. Christmas is celebrated near the date of the old Roman holiday of Saturnalia. Gift-giving on the day was also a Roman tradition. The Christmas tree, the hanging of wreaths and house-to-house caroling hark back to the pre-Christian German holiday of Yule. Calvinists had abandoned their outright ban on Christmas observance on the late 17th century. But many Protestant denominations retained a lingering suspicion of the holiday until deep into the 19th century. Two changes made possible the coalescing of an official Christmas holiday over the 40 years from Calvin Coolidge's outdoor Christmas tree to John F. Kennedy's sacral Christmas card: The fading of distinctions between Christians and the decline of theology within Christianity. The once all-crucial distinctions between Calvinists and Arminians (whose beliefs came from Dutch reformist Jacobus Arminius) and between even Protestants and Catholics have blurred. The once-vivid mistrust of trees and tinsel and burning logs has vanished, as American Christianity evolved away from a creed in which people believed and into a set of practices that people did. If Christians decorate trees, then tree decorating must be Christian -- no matter how or why the custom started and what the custom meant to the people who started it. Devout Christian believers can still be counted in the millions of course. Surrounding them, however, is a larger and more nebulous group for whom what was once a faith has become a folkway. For them, a Christmas tree or a nativity scene is less a declaration of individual belief than it is an expression of group identity. Many Americans feel this group identity to be under threat by changes in recent years. When they champion \\"Christmas as it was,\\" they do not mean \\"Christmas as it was for George Washington or Abraham Lincoln\\" and much less \\"Christmas as it was for Martin Luther or Jonathan Edwards.\\" They mean, \\"Christmas as it was when I was young.\\" That is why we have eruptions such as last week's flap over the whiteness of Santa Claus. If your Christmas celebrates the appearance of God Himself in the form of a human baby, it won't have a lot of room for a gift-giving elf and flying reindeer. But if Santa is at most tangential to the Christmas of faith, he is utterly central to the Christmas of folkway. It is the Christmas of folkway that is the Christmas so passionately defended by those who talk about \\"the war on Christmas.\\" The Christmas of Santa and Rudolph, and trees and stockings, and candy canes and \\"Merry Christmas\\" greetings began to be most publicly celebrated in the United States only after -- and only because -- the religious impetus for the holiday had already dwindled away.

It was established in 1998 as the Mitteilungen aus dem Museum für Naturkunde in Berlin, Geowissenschaftliche Reihe and originally published on behalf of the Museum für Naturkunde by Wiley-VCH; since 2014 it has been published by Copernicus Publications. The editors-in-chief are Martin Aberhan, Dieter Korn, and Florian Witzmann (Museum für Naturkunde). - Eurasia is the combined continental landmass of Europe and Asia. The term is a portmanteau of its constituent continents. Located primarily in the Northern and Eastern Hemispheres, it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Pacific Ocean to the east, the Arctic Ocean to the north, and by Africa, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Indian Ocean to the south. The division between Europe and Asia as two different continents is a historical and cultural construct, with no clear physical separation between them; thus, in some parts of the world, Eurasia is recognized as the largest of five or six continents. In geology, Eurasia is often considered as a single rigid megablock. However, the rigidity of Eurasia is debated based on the paleomagnet data. - Naval warfare is combat in and on the sea, the ocean, or any other major body of water such as a large lake or wide river. - The United States Navy (USN) is the naval warfare service branch of the United States Armed Forces and one of the seven uniformed services of the United States. The U.S. Navy is the largest, most capable navy in the world, with the highest combined battle fleet tonnage. The U.S. Navy has the world's largest aircraft carrier fleet, with ten in service, two in the reserve fleet, and three new carriers under construction. The service has 323,792 personnel on active duty and 108,515 in the Navy Reserve. It has 274 deployable combat vessels and more than 3,700 aircraft in active service . - The Triassic is a geologic period and system which spans 50.9 million years from the end of the Permian Period million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Jurassic Period Mya. The Triassic is the first period of the Mesozoic Era. Both the start and end of the period are marked by major extinction events. The Triassic was named in 1834 by Friedrich von Alberti, after the three distinct rock layers (\\"tri\\" meaning \\"three\\") that are found throughout Germany and northwestern Europered beds, capped by marine limestone, followed by a series of terrestrial mud- and sandstonescalled the \\"Trias\\". - The United States Armed Forces are the federal armed forces of the United States. They consist of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard. The President of the United States is the military's overall head, and helps form military policy with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), a federal executive department, acting as the principal organ by which military policy is carried out. From the time of its inception, the military played a decisive role in the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even so, the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played an important role in the American Civil War, where leading generals on both sides were picked from members of the United States military. Not until the outbreak of World War II did a large standing army become officially established. The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War II and during the Cold War's onset, created the modern U.S. military framework; the Act merged previously Cabinet-level Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the Department of the Air Force and National Security Council. - A reserve fleet is a collection of naval vessels of all types that are fully equipped for service but are not currently needed, and thus partially or fully decommissioned. A reserve fleet is informally said to be \\"in mothballs\\" or \\"mothballed\\"; an equivalent expression in unofficial modern U.S. naval usage is \\"ghost fleet\\". In earlier times, and especially in British usage, these ships were said to be \\"laid up in ordinary\\". - An aircraft carrier is a warship that serves as a seagoing airbase, equipped with a full-length flight deck and facilities for carrying, arming, deploying, and recovering aircraft. Typically, it is the capital ship of a fleet, as it allows a naval force to project air power worldwide without depending on local bases for staging aircraft operations. Aircraft carriers are expensive to build and are critical assets. Carriers have evolved since their inception in the early twentieth century from wooden vessels used to deploy balloons to nuclear-powered warships that carry numerous fighter planes, strike aircraft, helicopters, and other types of aircraft. - Sturgeon is the common name for the 27 species of fish belonging to the family Acipenseridae. Their evolution dates back to the Triassic some 245 to 208 million years ago. The family is grouped into four genera: \\"Acipenser\\", \\"Huso\\", \\"Scaphirhynchus\\" and \\"Pseudoscaphirhynchus\\". Four species may now be extinct. Two closely related species, \\"Polyodon spathula\\" (paddlefish) and \\"Psephurus gladius\\" (Chinese paddlefish, possibly extinct) are of the same order, Acipenseriformes, but are in the family Polyodontidae and are not considered to be \\"true\\" sturgeons. Both sturgeons and paddlefish have been referred to as \\"primitive fishes\\" because their morphological characteristics have remained relatively unchanged since the earliest fossil record. Sturgeons are native to subtropical, temperate and sub-Arctic rivers, lakes and coastlines of Eurasia and North America. Sturgeons are long-lived, late-maturing fishes with distinctive characteristics, such as a heterocercal caudal fin similar to that of sharks, and an elongated spindle-like body that is smooth-skinned, scaleless and armored with 5 lateral rows of bony plates called scutes. Several species can grow quite large, typically ranging 712 feet (2-3 m) in length. The largest sturgeon on record was a Beluga female captured in the Volga estuary in 1827, weighing and long. Most sturgeons are anadromous bottom-feeders which migrate upstream to spawn but spend most of their lives feeding in river deltas and estuaries. Some species inhabit freshwater environments exclusively while others primarily inhabit marine environments near coastal areas, and are known to venture into open ocean. - Scaphirhynchus is a genus of sturgeons native to the United States of America. All species in this genus are considered to be threatened. The pallid sturgeon is Endangered and the Alabama sturgeon is Critically Endangered. - Acipenseriformes is an order of basal ray-finned fishes that includes the sturgeons and paddlefishes, as well as some extinct families. - An aircraft is a machine that is able to fly by gaining support from the air. It counters the force of gravity by using either static lift or by using the dynamic lift of an airfoil, or in a few cases the downward thrust from jet engines. - The lead ship, name ship, or class leader is the first of a series or class of ships all constructed according to the same general design. The term is applicable to military ships and larger civilian craft. - In biology, a common name of a taxon or organism (also known as a vernacular name, English name, colloquial name, trivial name, trivial epithet, country name, popular name, or farmer's name) is a name that is based on the normal language of everyday life; this kind of name is often contrasted with the scientific name for the same organism, which is Latinized. A common name is sometimes frequently used, but that is by no means always the case. - Pseudoscaphirhynchus is a genus of fishes in the Acipenseridae family. The three species, all of which are threatened, are restricted to Central Asia. - FOSSIL is a standard protocol for allowing serial communication for telecommunications programs under the DOS operating system. FOSSIL is an acronym for \\"Fido Opus SEAdog Standard Interface Layer\\". \\"Fido\\" refers to FidoBBS, \\"Opus\\" refers to Opus-CBCS BBS, and \\"SEAdog\\" refers to a Fidonet compatible mailer. The standards document that defines the FOSSIL protocol is maintained by the Fidonet Technical Standards Committee. - USS Sturgeon ( SSN - 637 ) , the lead ship of her class of nuclear - powered attack submarines , was the third ship of the United States Navy to be named for the sturgeon . - The United States of America has seven federal uniformed services that commission officers as defined by Title 10, and subsequently structured and organized by Title 10, Title 14, Title 32 and Title 42 of the United States Code. - A ship is a large buoyant watercraft. Ships are generally distinguished from boats based on size, shape and cargo or passenger capacity. Ships are used on lakes, seas, rivers, and oceans for a variety of activities, such as the transport of people or goods, fishing, entertainment, public safety, and warfare. Historically, a \\"ship\\" was a sailing vessel with at least three square-rigged masts and a full bowsprit. - North America is a continent entirely within the Northern Hemisphere and almost all within the Western Hemisphere. It can also be considered a northern subcontinent of the Americas. It is bordered to the north by the Arctic Ocean, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, to the west and south by the Pacific Ocean, and to the southeast by South America and the Caribbean Sea.

Raccoons constantly play dead when people come near because they frighten them.","response":"In the sentence \\"Raccoons constantly play dead when people come near because they frighten them,\\" the first entity mentioned is raccoons, which are medium-sized mammals native to North America, known for their distinct black mask-like facial markings and bushy, ringed tails. They are highly adaptable creatures and can be found in various habitats, including forests, wetlands, agricultural areas, and urban environments. The second entity mentioned in the sentence is people or humans. This is referring to the Homo sapiens species, which are the dominant and most advanced beings on planet Earth. People are known for their intelligence, ability to communicate using complex languages, tool-making skills, and social structures. In this sentence, raccoons are depicted as engaging in an interesting and unusual behavior: playing dead when people come near. The act of \\"playing dead\\" is also known as thanatosis and is an adaptive behavior exhibited by some animals in order to prevent themselves from being attacked or eaten by predators. By appearing dead, the animal might be perceived as unappetizing or even dangerous to the approaching predator, causing the predator to lose interest and move on. The reason provided for this behavior in raccoons is that they are frightened by humans. This fear might stem from past experiences with people, such as being hunted, harassed, or disturbed in some way. It could also be an innate response to seeing large, unfamiliar creatures like humans approaching their territory. Furthermore, the sentence implies a constant behavioral factor, meaning that raccoons may exhibit this behavior repeatedly when they encounter humans. This indicates that playing dead might be a successful strategy for these animals in avoiding harm and maintaining their safety in the presence of potential threats. In conclusion, the main entities in the sentence are raccoons and people. The raccoons are portrayed as playing dead consistently when in close proximity to humans, presumably to protect themselves from potential harm due to fear or past experiences with people. This adaptive strategy has likely evolved over time to help raccoons survive encounters with the dominant and sometimes aggressive human species."},{"question":"Come up with a question and reasoning that would justify this answer: no","response":"Question: Are all sharks dangerous to humans?

In the context of saltwater, vaporization can separate the water from the salt as the water evaporates, leaving the salt behind. - shaking: This is a physical process that may mix substances but will not separate them. - evaporation: This is a process where a liquid turns into a gas due to an increase in temperature or decreased pressure. Like vaporization, evaporation can separate water from salt as the water evaporates, leaving the salt behind. - mouth of rivers: This is a geographical location and not a process that separates salt from water. - salinity: This is a measurement of the salt content in a body of water and not a process that can separate salt from water. - freezing: When water freezes, salt can sometimes be separated, but this process is not as effective as evaporation. - Heat energy: This is a form of energy that can cause evaporation, but it is not a process itself. - nothing: This answer implies that salt cannot be separated from water, which is incorrect. Step 3: Choose the best answer based on the evaluation. Based on the analysis, the best answer is evaporation since it is a known and effective process to separate salt from water."},{"question":"International Futures (IFs) is a global integrated assessment model designed to help in thinking strategically and systematically about key global systems (economic, demographic, education, health, environment, technology, domestic governance, infrastructure, agriculture, energy and environment) housed at the Frederick S.

The Cabinet is headed by the President of Venezuela , presently Nicolás Maduro , and his corresponding Vice President . The purpose of the ministries is to create , adopt , follow and evaluate policies , strategies , programs and projects in accordance with the constitution and the laws of the Republic . - A commander-in-chief is the person or body that exercises supreme operational command and control of a nation's military forces or significant elements of those forces. In the latter case, the force element is those forces within a particular region, or associated by function. As a practical term; it refers to military competencies that reside in a nation-state's executive leadershipeither a head of state, a head of government, a minister of defence, a national cabinet, or some other collegial body. Often, a given country's commander-in-chief (if held by an official) need not be or have been a commissioned officer or even a veteran. This follows the principle of civilian control of the military. - Executive Vice President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (commonly known simply as the Vice President of Venezuela, is the second highest political position in the government of Venezuela. The Vice President is the direct collaborator of the President of the Republic according to the Constitution. The office of Vice President appeared in the Constitution of 1830 until the Constitution of 1858, and once again in the Constitution of 1999. - A politician (from \\"politics\\" + \\"-ian\\", from the Greek title of Aristotle's book \\"Politika\\", meaning \\"Civic Affairs\\") is a person active in party politics, or a person holding or seeking office in government. In democratic countries, politicians seek elective positions within a government through elections or, at times, temporary appointment to replace politicians who have died, resigned or have been otherwise removed from office. In non-democratic countries, they employ other means of reaching power through appointment, bribery, revolutions and intrigues. Some politicians are experienced in the art or science of government. Politicians propose, support and create laws or policies that govern the land and, by extension, its people. Broadly speaking, a \\"politician\\" can be anyone who seeks to achieve political power in any bureaucratic institution. - Venezuela, officially the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, is a federal republic located on the northern coast of South America. It is bordered by Colombia on the west, Brazil on the south, Guyana on the east, and the islands of Trinidad and Tobago to the north-east. Venezuela's territory covers around with an estimated population . Venezuela is considered a state with extremely high biodiversity (currently ranks 7th in the world's list of nations with the most number of species), with habitats ranging from the Andes Mountains in the west to the Amazon Basin rain-forest in the south, via extensive \\"llanos\\" plains and Caribbean coast in the center and the Orinoco River Delta in the east. - A head of state (or chief of state) is the public persona that officially represents the national unity and legitimacy of a sovereign state. In developing the current Constitution of France (1958), former French president Charles de Gaulle said the head of state should embody \\"the spirit of the nation\\" (\\"\\"). In some countries, typically those with parliamentary governments, the head of state is a ceremonial figurehead that does not actually guide day-to-day government activities and may not even be empowered to exercise any kind of political authority (e.g., Queen Elizabeth II in the United Kingdom). In other countries, the head of state is also the head of government, such as in the U.S., where the president is both a public figurehead and the actual highest ranking political leader who, in practice, oversees the executive branch. - Hugo Rafael Chávez Frías (28 July 1954 5 March 2013) was a Venezuelan politician who served as the 64th President of Venezuela from 1999 to 2013. He was also leader of the Fifth Republic Movement from its foundation in 1997 until 2007, when it merged with several other parties to form the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV), which he led until 2012. - Impeachment is the process by which a legislative body formally levels charges against a high official of Government. Impeachment does not necessarily mean removal from office; it is only a formal statement of charges, akin to an indictment in criminal law, and is thus only the first step towards removal. Once an individual is impeached, he or she must then face the possibility of conviction via legislative vote, which then entails the removal of the individual from office. - A legislature is a deliberative assembly with the authority to make laws for a political entity such as a country or city. Legislatures form important parts of most governments; in the separation of powers model, they are often contrasted with the executive and judicial branches of government. - A presidential system is a system of government where a head of government is also head of state and leads an executive branch that is separate from the legislative branch. The United States, for instance, has a presidential system. The executive is elected and often titled \\"president\\" and is not responsible to the legislature and which cannot, in normal circumstances, dismiss it. The legislature may have the right, in extreme cases, to dismiss the executive, often through impeachment. However, such dismissals are seen as so rare as not to contradict a central tenet of presidentialism, that in \\"normal circumstances using normal means\\" the legislature cannot dismiss the executive. - The President of Venezuela, officially known as the President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and also commonly called President of the Republic is the elected head of state and head of government in Venezuela's presidential system. The president leads the National Executive of the Venezuelan government and is the commander-in-chief of the National Bolivarian Armed Forces. Presidential terms were set at six years in with the adoption of the 1999 constitution, and re-election has been unlimited since 2009. - Nicolás Maduro Moros (born 23 November 1962), more commonly known as Nicolás Maduro, is a Venezuelan politician who has been the 65th President of Venezuela since 2013. Previously he served under President Hugo Chávez as Minister of Foreign Affairs from 2006 to 2013 and as Vice President of Venezuela from 2012 to 2013. - Head of government is a generic term used for either the highest or second highest official in the executive branch of a sovereign state, a federated state, or a self-governing colony, (commonly referred to as countries, nations or nation-states) who often presides over a cabinet, a group of ministers or secretaries who lead executive departments. The term \\"head of government\\" is often differentiated from the term \\"head of state\\", (e.g. as in article 7 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, article 1 of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Crimes against Internationally Protected Persons, including Diplomatic Agents and the United Nations protocol list), as they may be separate positions, individuals, and/or roles depending on the country.

I even ‘came out’ to her at one point. We spent a lot of time together and gradually, I thought I might not be gay after all, as I had feelings of love for her. Eventually, we started dating and I tried to suppress my gay feelings. Eventually, I proposed. We were engaged for just over a year and I got married at the age of 19. I have to admit, when the wedding plans got firmed up and much closer to the date, I started to feel that I was in fact still gay but so much money had already been spent, and plans made that I was too afraid to pull out. Don’t get me wrong, I still love my ex wife a heck of a lot, but as my very best friend. I hate to use the phrase, but with everything that has gone on with me the last few years, she has been ‘my rock’.

People who create new compositions are called composers in classical music. In popular music and traditional music, the creators of new songs are usually called songwriters; with songs, the person who writes new words for a song is the lyricist. \\"Composition\\" is the act or practice of creating a song or other piece of music. In many cultures, including Western classical music, the act of composing typically includes the creation of music notation, such as a sheet music \\"score\\", which is then performed by the composer or by other instrumental musicians or singers. In popular music and traditional music, songwriting may involve the creation of a basic outline of the song, called the lead sheet, which sets out the melody, lyrics and chord progression. In classical music, orchestration (choosing the instruments of a large music ensemble such as an orchestra which will play the different parts of music, such as the melody, accompaniment, countermelody, bassline and so on) is typically done by the composer, but in musical theatre and in pop music, songwriters may hire an arranger to do the orchestration. In some cases, a pop or traditional songwriter may not use written notation at all, and instead compose the song in her mind and then play, sing and/or record it from memory. In jazz and popular music, notable sound recordings by influential performers are given the weight that written or printed scores play in classical music. - An anthem is a musical composition of celebration, usually used as a symbol for a distinct group, particularly the national anthems of countries. Originally, and in music theory and religious contexts, it also refers more particularly to short sacred choral work and still more particularly to a specific form of Anglican church music. - Music theory is the study of the practices and possibilities of music. - The (FIFA ; \\"International Federation of Association Football\\") is the international governing body of association football, futsal, and beach soccer. FIFA is responsible for the organisation of football's major international tournaments, notably the World Cup which commenced in 1930 and the Women's World Cup which commenced in 1991. - A national anthem (also state anthem, national hymn, national song etc.) is generally a patriotic musical composition that evokes and eulogizes the history, traditions and struggles of its people, recognized either by a nation's government as the official national song, or by convention through use by the people. The majority of national anthems are either marches or hymns in style. The countries of Latin America tend towards more operatic pieces, while a handful of countries use a simple fanfare. - Association football, more commonly known as football or soccer, is a team sport played between two teams of eleven players with a spherical ball. It is played by 250 million players in over 200 countries and dependencies, making it the world's most popular sport. The game is played on a rectangular field with a goal at each end. The object of the game is to score by getting the ball into the opposing goal. - The Union of European Football Associations (UEFA, ; ) is the administrative body for association football in Europe, although several member states are primarily or entirely located in Asia. It is one of six continental confederations of world football's governing body FIFA.

This is perfect for all those late night cupcake cravings. Well, maybe eight is only late if you are the mother of three small children. So yes...let me rephrase...this is perfect for all those mid-evening cupcake cravings! We stopped by Cupcakes-A-Go-Go last Saturday night about about 7:40 and they had a plethora of available flavors. To me this is good AND bad. Good, because it means that there is more for me to choose from. Bad because it means they are clearly not the type of shop that makes all their cupcakes fresh in the morning and keep them out until they sell out. It makes me wonder, on the average, how long they DO sit out - are most made the day of? Just wondering... As for the cupcakes themselves, well, I will review each one individually because I feel like they were all pretty different. Here is the order I tried them. (For the record, I did not eat these all myself, I did share...a little.) ;) 1. Mint Oreo: This was the first one I tried, and I was very impressed. The cake was moist and dense with excellent flavor. The frosting was their \\"traditional\\" cream cheese based frosting (which I know only from reading other Yelp reviews) and it fit the cupcake well. It was also thick and dense and complimented the cake perfectly. This one was great. :) 2. Lemon Meringue: I was expecting a nice zesty lemon cupcake. I was disappointed. The cake was a bit dry and the flavor just so-so. The meringue frosting tasted fine. I was pretty underwhelmed. 3. Peanut Butter Cookie Dough: I was SO excited for this cupcake. I was SO let down. The cake was very, very dry. The chunk of cookie dough in the middle was hard. The frosting was the cream cheese based frosting again, which just didn't fit with the rest of it. It did not feel like a cohesive dessert. None of worked together. It was not good. Bummer. 4. Black Forest: First of all - this cupcake looked incredible. It was like the picture-perfect cupcake with it's chocolate cake, white whipped frosting, and a cherry on top. And, I'm happy to report that it tasted even better than it looked!! The cake was just right - sweet, moist, melted in my mouth. The cherries were tasty and didn't feel like they came from a can. The whipped topping was just like grandma makes - not super sweet and made of fresh whipping cream. The entire thing my my trip to Cupcakes-A-Go-Go worth it. THIS is what I hoped all my cupcakes would be. I also purchased a Strawberries and Cream cupcake and a German Chocolate cupcake, but I was far too generous and gave those to my in-laws. What was I thinking?! Part of me wants to give this place 3 stars - because only half of the cupcakes I tried were awesome - one was the opposite of awesome. However, I think I will go with 4. Really good, but could use some improvements. I have now am halfway to a free cupcake (Buy 12 get one free - which is great because you don't have to buy all 12 at one time!), so I will definitely be back to try some more. Hopefully the next ones will wow me and force me to add that last star!

She made the allegation in a letter she gave to her butler and confidant, Paul Burrell, before she died. The former wife of heir-to-the-throne Prince Charles died at the age of 36, along with her lover Dodi al-Fayed and their chauffeur Henri Paul in a Paris road tunnel. The Mirror appeared to be risking an aggressive legal response from Buckingham Palace to its story on Tuesday. The rest of the normally competitive British media omitted the name, apparently to avoid legal action under Britain's tough defamation laws.Â TheÂ tabloid printed a copy of the letter Diana wrote just 10 months before her death on its inside pages. Although it identified the person in its own story, the name was blanked out in the reproduction of the handwritten letter. \\"This particular phase in my life is the most dangerous,\\" it quoted the letter as saying. \\"(...) is planning 'an accident' in my car, brake failure and serious head injury.\\" \\"This particular phase in my life is the most dangerous...

(...) is planning 'an accident' in my car, brake failure and serious head injury\\"Excerpt from Princess Diana's letter to her butlerÂ Burrell, who gave The Mirror access to the letter as part of a serialisation of excerpts of his book which was published late last year, reacted angrily to news the name had been revealed. \\"I am not very happy about it... I only learnt about it late last night. And it was always my intention never to publish that name,\\" he told reporters on Tuesday. Britain's tabloid newspapers have been engaged in an almost daily battle in the years since Diana's death to produce the most sensational headlines about Diana, Charles and other members of her family and former household. Tuesday's revelation came as Royal Coroner Michael Burgess was due to open and adjourn inquests into the deaths of Diana and Dodi. Hundreds of journalists from around the world gathered for the start of the inquests in central London - the first official public hearings into the crash to be held on British soil. An inquiry by French authorities in 1999 ruled the accident was caused by Diana'sÂ chauffeur being drunk and driving too fast. The Mirror said Burrell was prepared to hand over the Diana letter to the coroner as part of the inquest. It said that in doing so, he would be \\"honouring a long-standing promise to cooperate fully with the inquiries\\". After a 15-year marriage, Charles and Diana divorced in 1996 after both had admitted to having adulterous affairs.","response":"The British tabloid The Mirror published a person's name who Princess Diana claimed was planning a car accident for her in a letter given to her former butler, Paul Burrell, prior to her death in 1997.

Translate this to English?","response":"Foreign Minister Vuk Draskovic stated that Slobodan Milosevic's \\"death squads\\" still exist. Vuk Draskovic, the Foreign Minister, has expressed concerns about the ongoing presence of what he refers to as \\"death squads\\" connected to the former Yugoslav President, Slobodan Milosevic. These death squads were allegedly used by Milosevic during his time in power to carry out various brutal acts, including acts of violence and mass killings, as part of a larger campaign of state-sanctioned terror and repression against opposition groups and certain ethnic communities. The reference to the \\"death squads\\" reveals a significant concern on Draskovic's part that the current state of affairs in the region may not have changed much since Milosevic's time in power. The fact that these groups still exist suggests that there continues to be a great deal of unrest, political instability, and potential for violence in the region. In making this statement, Draskovic may be attempting to draw attention to the seriousness of the situation, and to the importance of pursuing reform and measures aimed at breaking down the remnants of Milosevic's brutal regime. This could include efforts to apprehend and bring to justice individuals who were involved in the \\"death squads\\" and their activities, as well as broader actions aimed at promoting political stability, reconciliation, and peace in the region. Additionally, the Foreign Minister's statement highlights the need for increased international attention and support in order to address these ongoing security challenges. This could involve providing assistance in the areas of counter-terrorism and organized crime prevention, as well as offering support for legal and institutional reforms in order to ensure that those responsible for past crimes are held accountable. In summary, the statement by Foreign Minister Draskovic serves as a stark reminder of the brutal legacy left by Slobodan Milosevic and his regime. It highlights the ongoing presence and potential threat posed by these so-called \\"death squads\\" and underlines the urgency of addressing these issues in order to bring about meaningful change, stability, and peace in the region."},{"question":"Gemayel's assassination is almost certain to deepen the political crisis in Lebanon, which started after the resignation of six pro-Syrian ministers, two from Hezbollah, hours after all-party round table talks collapsed.

If you were to cool down steel what would happen to its thermal energy increase or decrease? Answer:","response":"To answer this question, let's proceed step-by-step: Step 1: Understand the concepts involved We need to understand the relationship between temperature, mass, and thermal energy. The problem states that given the same mass, a higher temperature object has greater thermal energy. Therefore, thermal energy is directly related to temperature. Step 2: Apply this understanding to the given scenario In the scenario, steel is cooled down, meaning its temperature is being reduced. Step 3: Determine the effect on thermal energy Since thermal energy is directly related to temperature, and the temperature of the steel is decreasing, the thermal energy of the steel must also decrease. Answer: When steel is cooled down, its thermal energy will decrease."},{"question":"Solve 44*f + 27 = -105 for f. Solve this problem.","response":"Alright, let's solve this problem step by step. We need to find the value of 'f' that makes this equation true: 44 * f + 27 = -105 First, let's subtract 27 from both sides of the equation. That will help us to make one side of the equation just about 'f'. So: 44 * f + 27 - 27 = -105 - 27 44 * f = -132 Now, we need to find the value of 'f', so we will divide both sides of the equation by 44: (44 * f) / 44 = (-132) / 44 f = -3 So the value of 'f' is -3. If we replace 'f' with -3 in our original equation, we'll see that it balances: 44 * (-3) + 27 = -105"},{"question":"A limited symptom attack (LSA), also referred to as a limited symptom panic attack (LPA), is a milder, less comprehensive form of panic attack, with fewer than 4 panic related symptoms being experienced (APA 1994).

Cover-up claims: Former MP and Lib Dem presidency candidate Liz Lynne at the party's conference in Glasgow last week A leading candidate for the Lib Dem presidency was yesterday accused of helping cover up Cyril Smith’s vile catalogue of child sex abuse. Liz Lynne, who succeeded Smith as MP for Rochdale, allegedly ordered her PA to destroy several pages of notes containing a stream of allegations against the paedophile. They detailed a litany of abuse at the Knowl View children’s home in Rochdale, which closed in the mid-1990s. The PA, Deborah Doyle, said she had taken the notes during a 1996 telephone conversation with a former manager of the home, Martin Digan. Last night Miss Lynne said: ‘I have no recollection whatsoever of anybody contacting me about allegations against Cyril Smith or child abuse at","response":"Knowl View children's home. If any such allegations were brought to my attention, I would have taken the appropriate steps to ensure they were thoroughly investigated. It is crucial to protect the welfare of all children, and any claims of abuse need to be treated with the utmost seriousness.' One possible course of action would be to launch an independent investigation into the cover-up claims. The investigation should be led by an impartial third party with no connections to the individuals involved. This would involve gathering all relevant evidence, including statements from Deborah Doyle, Martin Digan, and any other potential witnesses. Additionally, any documents, recordings, or other materials related to the allegations should be collected and preserved. Step 1: Appoint an impartial investigator. To ensure a fair examination of the claims, an unbiased investigator with experience in handling similar cases should be assigned. This individual should possess legal expertise, investigative experience, and familiarity with child abuse cases and their potential impact on the victims. Step 2: Gather evidence. The investigator should collect all pertinent evidence, including the allegedly destroyed notes, any existing records, and statements from those involved or potentially aware of the situation. This should involve interviews with the former PA, the former manager of the home, and any other relevant individuals who may have information about the allegations or the handling of the case. Step 3: Analyze the evidence. The collected evidence should be carefully reviewed, and the credibility of the witnesses should be assessed. The investigator should consider any potential biases, inconsistencies, and other factors that may impact the integrity of the evidence. Step 4: Present the findings. Based on the gathered evidence and analysis, the investigator should present the findings to all relevant parties, taking into account the potential implications for the individuals involved and the need to ensure justice and accountability. This may include reporting the findings to the Lib Dem party, law enforcement authorities, and any organizations responsible for the care and protection of children. Step 5: Take appropriate action. If the investigation concludes that there is sufficient evidence to support the cover-up claims, the responsible individuals should be held accountable, and appropriate measures should be taken to address the situation. This may involve sanctions or disciplinary action against the accused party, as well as steps to prevent future instances of abuse and cover-ups. If the evidence is inconclusive or does not support the claims, further monitoring or inquiries may still be warranted in order to protect the welfare of all children involved. By following these steps, the most logical and thorough response to the allegations can be achieved, ensuring that any potential cover-up is uncovered and that those involved are held accountable for their actions."},{"question":"Nous pensons que la réforme du Conseil de sécurité doit éliminer les privilèges actuellement octroyés à un très petit nombre de pays, qui leur permettent d'exercer leur hégémonie sur le monde entier.

Looking for signs of post-injection inflammatory reactions can help you figure out the best way to relieve your pain or if you need to see your doctor. Common symptoms are: Itching Redness radiating from the injection site Warmth Swelling Tenderness Pain Put an ice or cold pack over the injection site. This can relieve itching, swelling, and pain by constricting blood flow and cooling your skin. Leave the ice on the site for 15 – 20 minutes. Do this three to four times per day until the pain eases. Use a bag of frozen vegetables if you don’t have an ice pack. Put something like a towel between your skin and the ice or cold pack to minimize the risk of frostbite. Put a clean, cool, wet washcloth over the injection site if you don’t want to use ice. Avoid applying heat to your injection site. This can increase swelling as it brings more blood to infected area. Over-the-counter medications can relieve pain and swelling. Consider taking these medications if you have a lot of pain or inflammation at the injection site. Take pain relievers including ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB), naproxen sodium (Aleve) or acetaminophen (Tylenol). Do not give aspirin to children or teenagers under 18, as it increases the risk for Reye's syndrome, a potentially fatal condition. Minimize swelling with NSAIDs (non-steriodal anti-inflammatory drugs) like ibuprofen and naproxen sodium. Avoid taxing the area where you had an injection, especially if it was a cortisone shot. This can give the injection site time to heal and may prevent further pain or discomfort. Keep heavy lifting to a minimum if you got a shot in the arm. Stay off of your feet if you got an injection on your leg. If you have received a steroid shot, avoid heat for 24 hours to ensure the injection will have maximum response.

He described his second-place showing as “probably in between the best surprise of my life and the biggest disappointment, too.” Havret was one stroke behind McDowell when he arrived at the 17th hole. He hit his tee shot into a greenside bunker, hit out to 10 feet and left his par putt short. On the par-5 18th, he thought he had hit his 3-iron second shot perfectly, but the ball drifted into another greenside bunker. “I don’t know why,” Havret said later, joking. “Maybe Graeme was doing something.” After a nice bunker shot, Havret missed the birdie putt. “Yeah, I hit the sand, but that wasn’t the mistake,” he said. “The mistake was the putt. It was bad. Probably the worst of the week. I pulled it.” Golfers paired with Woods often talk about feeling invisible, and at the first hole Havret had reason to wonder if that was not literally the case. On the giant scoreboard near the first green, there were 10 names listed and Havret’s was not among them despite the fact he began the day tied for fourth. “I saw that,” Havret said, adding, “It was like, have I been DQ’ed?” He laughed. “I know I’m coming a little bit from nowhere.” Miles from nowhere is more like it. Havret, 33, was playing in the Open for the first time. On paper, he would have seemed to be overmatched against Woods, a three-time United States Open champion who won by 15 strokes the last time the tournament was held here, in 2000. But then, nobody would have given Havret much of a chance against a 441-pound bull, and he lived to rhapsodize about that encounter. It took place in a bullring in Madrid in 2007 during a friend’s bachelor party. Sometime during the night, Havret hopped into the ring to kick around a soccer ball, only to be met by the bull, who nudged him before he was able to escape. Would he do it again? “For sure,” Havret said, adding, “It was fun.” After surviving a snorting bull, why would Havret sweat a charging Tiger? Asked if he was intimidated to play with Woods, Havret said: “I was not. The job is the same.” “Of course it’s something different,” he added. “You’ve got the crowds so much for him and everybody’s screaming his name all the way around during four and a half hours.” Havret said his ears were ringing, “but it was great.” He added: “We talked a bit and he’s a great player. He didn’t play good today. I was very glad to play with him to have the experience, and it will make me stronger, I hope.” After signing his scorecard, Havret conducted interviews in French and English, his manner as relaxed as if he were at a cocktail party. After answering questions from two TV reporters, a radio journalist stuck his microphone in front of Havret, who made a funny face and quipped, “Where’s the camera?” Havret, who won the French Amateur championship three consecutive years in the late 1990s, could be forgiven for lapping up his 15 minutes of fame. Golf lags in popularity in France, the soccer player on the end of the bench on the national team being easily more identifiable to the public than any golfer other than Woods. Philippe Joubin, a journalist for L’Équipe, the country’s sports daily, glanced at his watch Saturday night after finishing his interview with Havret. It was 5 a.m. in Paris, too early to call his editor to plead for more space and bigger play for his story. “We have to struggle every time to have some space for golf,” Joubin said with a sigh. “It’s very, very, very difficult.” It became harder over the weekend when the French World Cup campaign descended into turmoil with the star Nicolas Anelka kicked off the team and the rest of the players refusing to practice in protest. France, which advanced to the final four years ago, is on the brink of elimination. On Sunday, Joubin said he was still pushing for extra space. He said golf in France was where tennis was in the 1970s, before Yannick Noah won the 1983 French Open and the sport’s popularity skyrocketed. “There are a lot of people playing golf for pleasure, but they’re not interested in competition,” Joubin said. Havret took up the game when he was 7 because his parents, Dominique and Monique, are golfers. Asked which one is better, Havret lowered his voice and said, “Don’t say it to my father, but it’s my mother.” He was teased by friends who did not consider golf a masculine sport, which was why he hated it at first. When Havret was 12, he moved with his family away from those friends and to a home near a golf course, where his love for the game bloomed. Havret, who had his 3-year-old daughter’s name written on his cap and joy written on his face, said he would take away “some great feelings” from this tournament, his fourth major. “I holed a 50-footer to win a playoff and qualify for here on the last green,” he said. “And then all of a sudden I’m here playing with Tiger.” Havret said golf could be hell or paradise. For him on Sunday, it was both. What are the most important parts of this news article?","response":"This news article is about a golfer named Havret from France who played really well in the U.S. Open golf tournament. He was ranked 391st in the world, but he played even better than the top-ranked golfer, Woods. Havret finished just one shot behind the winner, Graeme McDowell. Although he missed some important shots, Havret was happy with his performance and enjoyed playing in the tournament. Golf isn't very popular in France, so Havret's success might help make the sport more popular there."},{"question":"Here is a premise: It's almost possible to ignore the exclusion of male artists and think of Lilith as a savvy packaging of the hottest ... Here is a hypothesis: Lilith is very boring and therefore can almost be ignored. Here are the options: OPTIONS: --yes; --it is not possible to tell; --no; Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","response":"To determine whether the given hypothesis can be drawn based on the given premise, it is important to first analyze each statement independently and its relationship. Premise: \\"It's almost possible to ignore the exclusion of male artists and think of Lilith as a savvy packaging of the hottest …\\" The premise suggests that if we overlook the exclusion of male artists, Lilith can be seen as a clever way of presenting the most sought-after and popular trends, presumably referring to a music compilation (referring to Lilith Fair, an all-female music festival from the late 1990s). This means that despite not including male artists, the Lilith Fair still holds some level of interest and appeal. Hypothesis: \\"Lilith is very boring and therefore can almost be ignored.\\" The hypothesis proposes that Lilith is uninteresting and can be disregarded to an extent. This statement seems to contradict the premise, in that the premise regards Lilith as a potentially attractive bundle of popular content, whereas the hypothesis claims it is boring and barely noticeable. Now, let's analyze the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. If the premise states that Lilith should be seen as an enticing package of popular content (once we ignore the exclusion of male artists), then the hypothesis, which claims Lilith is largely uninteresting, does not directly follow from the premise. Instead, they seem to contradict each other. Therefore, based on the current analysis, it is not possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is true as well. These two statements appear to be contrary to each other, with the premise arguing for a positive appraisal of Lilith (in certain circumstances) and the hypothesis painting Lilith as dull and unremarkable."},{"question":"Here is a dialogue: Aubrie: U had fun last night?

With low frequencies, the stylus must swing a long way from side to side, requiring the groove to be wide, taking up more space and limiting the playing time of the record. At high frequencies, hiss, pops, and ticks are significant. These problems can be reduced by using equalization to an agreed standard. During recording the amplitude of low frequencies is reduced, thus reducing the groove width required, and the amplitude at high frequencies is increased. The playback equipment boosts bass and cuts treble so as to restore the tonal balance in the original signal; this also reduces the high frequency noise. Thus more music will fit on the record, and noise is reduced.\\".

As the fire burns, the stack slowly shrinks. By the end of the evening, all that is left is a small pile of ashes. What happened to the matter that you started with? Was it destroyed by the flames? It may seem that way. What do you think happened? The truth is that the same amount of matter still exists. The wood changed not only to ashes, but also to carbon dioxide, water vapor, and other gases. The gases floated off into the air, leaving behind just the ashes. Although matter was changed, it was not created or destroyed. Because the same amount of matter still exists, we can say that matter is conserved. You may wonder how it can be conserved if something is now missing? Assume you had measured the mass of the wood before you burned it. Assume you had also trapped the gases released by the burning wood and measured their mass and the mass of the ashes. What would you find?

The lifespan of a hamster is 6 years less than that of a bat. The lifespan of a frog is 4 times that of a hamster. Altogether, the lifespan of the animals is 30 years. What is the lifespan of the bat?","response":"Let's break down the information given and solve the problem step-by-step. Step 1: Assign variables to the lifespans of the animals. Let H be the lifespan of the hamster, B be the lifespan of the bat, and F be the lifespan of the frog. Step 2: Interpret the information given in terms of the variables. We are given that a hamster's lifespan is 6 years less than that of a bat. Therefore, H = B - 6. We are also given that a frog's lifespan is 4 times that of a hamster. Therefore, F = 4H. Altogether, the lifespan of the animals is 30 years. Therefore, H + B + F = 30. Step 3: Substitute the expressions we found in step 2 into the equation H + B + F = 30. We can substitute H = B - 6 and F = 4H into the equation: (B - 6) + B + (4(B - 6)) = 30. Step 4: Solve for B. First, expand the equation: (B - 6) + B + 4B - 24 = 30. Next, combine like terms: 6B - 30 = 30. Now, add 30 to both sides of the equation: 6B = 60. Finally, divide both sides by 6: B = 10. The final answer is: The lifespan of the bat is 10 years."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Given the following context: The Mozarts' first London lodgings were above a barber's shop in Cecil Court, near St Martin-in-the-Fields. Letters of introduction from Paris proved effective; on 27 April 1764, four days after their arrival, the children were playing before King George III and his 19-year-old German queen, Charlotte Sophia. A second royal engagement was fixed for 19 May, at which Wolfgang was asked by the king to play pieces by Handel, Johann Christian Bach and Carl Friedrich Abel. He was allowed to accompany the queen as she sang an aria, and he later improvised on the bass part of a Handel aria from which, according to Leopold, he produced \\"the most beautiful melody in such a manner that everyone was astonished\\".Many of the nobility and gentry were leaving town for the summer, but Leopold reckoned that most would return for the king's birthday celebrations on 4 June, and accordingly organised a concert for the 5th. This was deemed a success, and Leopold hastened to arrange for Wolfgang to appear at a benefit concert for a maternity hospital on 29 June, at Ranelagh Pleasure Gardens. Leopold apparently saw this effort to support charitable works as \\"a way to earn the love of this very special nation\\". Wolfgang was advertised as \\"the celebrated and astonishing Master Mozart, a Child of Seven Years of Age...\\" (he was in fact eight), \\"justly esteemed the most extraordinary Prodigy, and most amazing Genius, that has appeared in any Age\\". On 8 July there was a private performance at the Grosvenor Square home of the Earl of Thanet, from which Leopold returned with an inflammation of the throat and other worrying symptoms. \\"Prepare your heart to hear one of the saddest events\\", he wrote to Hagenauer in anticipation of his own imminent demise. He was ill for several weeks, and for the sake of his health the family moved from their Cecil Court lodgings to a house in the countryside, at 180 Ebury Street, then considered part of the village of Chelsea. answer the following question: What is the name of the person who was ill for several weeks?

Further, if a store owner is following a customer - the proper approach is to offer service: \\"How are you doing? Can I get you a different style or size?\\" Hong does not offer service if her subordinates are present. Hong has also insulted the jewelry I was wearing at the time - a 500 item. Her insult was in response to the fact I asked the source of the turquoise on an item in her case. My grandfather was Native American and I have an extensive collection and have worked with turquoise, so I do know the characteristics between the turquoise produced by the domestic mines and how it differs from Mexican and Chinese turquoise. I have truly made an effort to practice more graciousness than she clearly possesses by NOT observing that I could easily identify types of turquoise decades before she married into the Bischoff family. Further, I have heard her misrepresent some of her products to tourists. (Native Americans will usually identify their jewelry by the terms \\"Native American\\", \\"Zuni\\", \\"Navajo,\\" etc - not \\"Indian Made.\\") Further, a majority of her earrings - particularly the Repousse- can be found on eBay.....identical product - 60% less. If one purchases here, I would definitely ask for proof of authenticity. (and they do have some real works of art, but their inventory is a mix). There's another issue: pricing.

His 1937 paper was heavily cited . He completed his doctorate at the Universiteit Utrecht in 1934 . His dissertation was labelled : Reflectivity and Emissivity of Tungsten ; with a Description of a New Method to Determine the Total Reflectivity of Any Surface in a Simple and Accurate Way . His adviser was Leonard Ornstein . From 1934 to 1967 he was employed in the Physical Laboratory of Philips in Eindhoven , and from 1960 to 1972 he was Professor at the Eindhoven University of Technology . - After the explanation of van der Waals forces by Fritz London several scientists soon realised that his definition could be extended from the interaction of two molecules with induced dipoles to macro-scale objects by summing all of the forces between the molecules in each of the bodies involved. The theory is named after H. C. Hamaker who derived the interaction between two spheres, a sphere and a wall, and presented a general discussion in a heavily cited 1937 paper. - A molecule is an electrically neutral group of two or more atoms held together by chemical bonds. Molecules are distinguished from ions by their lack of electrical charge. However, in quantum physics, organic chemistry, and biochemistry, the term \\"molecule\\" is often used less strictly, also being applied to polyatomic ions. - The Netherlands is the main constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. It is a densely populated country located in Western Europe with three island territories in the Caribbean. The European part of the Netherlands borders Germany to the east, Belgium to the south, and the North Sea to the northwest, sharing maritime borders with Belgium, the United Kingdom, and Germany. The largest cities in the Netherlands are Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht. Amsterdam is the country's capital, while The Hague holds the Dutch seat of government and parliament. The name \\"Holland\\" is used to refer informally to the whole of the country of the Netherlands. - The Dommel is a stream in Belgium and the Netherlands, left tributary of the Dieze. It rises in north-eastern Belgium near Peer and flows into the southern part of the Netherlands. The Dommel takes in water from the Keersop, Tongelreep, Run, Gender and Kleine Dommel streams and merges at 's-Hertogenbosch with the Aa stream to form river Dieze, which subsequently flows towards the Meuse. The main cities and towns along the Dommel's course are Peer, Neerpelt, Valkenswaard, Dommelen, Eindhoven, Son en Breugel, Sint-Oedenrode, Boxtel, Sint-Michielsgestel and 's-Hertogenbosch. The most original part and natural state of the Dommel can be found between Eindhoven and Boxtel. Here the Dommel has still its original winds and meanders and forms a cultural-historical and valuable landscape area called the Dommelbeemden. - Fritz Wolfgang London (March 7, 1900 March 30, 1954) was a Jewish-German physicist and professor at Duke University. His fundamental contributions to the theories of chemical bonding and of intermolecular forces (London dispersion forces) are today considered classic and are discussed in standard textbooks of physical chemistry. With his brother Heinz London, he made a significant contribution to understanding electromagnetic properties of superconductors with the London equations and was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Chemistry on five separate occasions. - Friesland (official) or Frisia is a province in the northwest of the Netherlands. It is situated west of Groningen, northwest of Drenthe and Overijssel, north of Flevoland, northeast of North Holland, and south of the North Sea.

It is situated on the North Sea, north of South Holland and Utrecht, and west of Friesland and Flevoland. As of 2015, it has a population of 2,762,163 and a total area of . - In physical chemistry, the van der Waals forces (or van der Waals interaction), named after Dutch scientist Johannes Diderik van der Waals, are the residual attractive or repulsive forces between molecules or atomic groups that do not arise from covalent bonds, nor ionic bonds. It can be shown that van der Waals forces are of the same origin as the Casimir effect, arising from quantum interactions with the zero-point field. The resulting van der Waals forces can be attractive or repulsive. - Eindhoven is a municipality and a city in the south of the Netherlands, originally at the confluence of the Dommel and Gender streams. The Gender was dammed short of the city centre in the 1950s and the Dommel still runs through the city. The city has a population of 223,220 in January 2015, making it the fifth-largest municipality of the Netherlands and the largest in the province of North Brabant. - Noord Brabant, also unofficially called Brabant, is a province in the south of the Netherlands. It borders the provinces of South Holland and Gelderland to the north, Limburg to the east, Zeeland to the west, and the Belgian provinces of Antwerp and Limburg to the south. The northern border follows the Meuse (Maas) river westward to its mouth in the Hollands Diep strait, part of the RhineMeuseScheldt delta. History. The Duchy of Brabant was a state of the Holy Roman Empire established in 1183 or 1190. It developed from the Landgraviate of Brabant and formed the heart of the historic Low Countries, part of the Burgundian Netherlands from 1430 and of the Habsburg Netherlands from 1482, until it was split up after the Dutch revolt. After the War of Independence, Catholics in the Southern Netherlands were systematically and officially discriminated against by the Northern Protestant government until the second half of the 20th century, which had a major influence on the economic and cultural development of the southern part of the Netherlands. Present-day North Brabant (Staats-Brabant) was adjudicated to the Generality Lands of the Dutch Republic according to the 1648 Peace of Westphalia, while the reduced duchy remained in existence with the Southern Netherlands until it was conquered by French Revolutionary forces in 1794. - A municipality is usually a single urban administrative division having corporate status and powers of self-government or jurisdiction as granted by national and state laws, to which it is subordinate. It is to be distinguished from the county, which may encompass rural territory and/or numerous small communities such as towns, villages and hamlets. The term \\"municipality\\" may also mean the governing or ruling body of a given municipality. A municipality is a general-purpose administrative subdivision, as opposed to a special-purpose district. The term is derived from French \\"municipalité\\" and Latin \\"municipalis\\". What entity does 'hugo christiaan hamaker' has the relation 'occupation' with?","response":"Hugo Christiaan Hamaker was occupied in several roles throughout his life, with the most prominent ones being his work as a scientist and a professor. His scientific career mainly revolved around the exploration of forces between molecules, which had ultimately led to the formulation of the now well-recognized Hamaker theory explaining the van der Waals forces between objects larger than molecules. This occupation involved his dealing with the intricate details of molecule interactions and the formation of an advanced and generalized version of the van der Waals theory. The essentiality of his work can be proven by the heavy citation of his 1937 paper. Moreover, Hamaker was associated with the esteemed institutions like Universiteit Utrecht, the Physical Laboratory of Philips, and Eindhoven University of Technology, offering him various platforms to showcase and utilise his profound knowledge and skills in the field of science. He completed his doctorate under the mentorship of Leonard Ornstein at Universiteit Utrecht in 1934, the dissertation of which was titled \\"Reflectivity and Emissivity of Tungsten; with a Description of a New Method to Determine the Total Reflectivity of Any Surface in a Simple and Accurate Way\\", demonstrating his scientific prowess. Hamaker's occupation also involved his tenure at the Physical Laboratory of Philips in Eindhoven, which lasted from 1934 to 1967. This role supplemented his experience and understanding of the practical implementations and implications of theoretical scientific principles. Following this, Hamaker served as a Professor at the Eindhoven University of Technology from 1960 to 1972. Here, he was responsible for disseminating his knowledge and expertise to the next generation of scientists and expanding the horizons of their understanding of the field. Therefore, the entity that Hugo Christiaan Hamaker has the relation 'occupation' with is his various roles in the field of science: a scientist mainly exploring the nature of van der Waals forces, a graduate student at Universiteit Utrecht, a professional at the Physical Laboratory of Philips, and later, a professor at the Eindhoven University of Technology."},{"question":"Están almacenando todo tipo de equipo para motines, chalecos blindados y armas, así como aparatos acústicos ensordecedores para someter a las multitudes.

Other nutrients necessary for an organism to function properly would also not be sufficient. Essentially, many organisms could not exist. Choices: - whitefly - fluxes - aphids - decomposers A: Answer:","response":"The stability of an ecosystem depends on the actions of decomposers. This is exemplified by mushrooms on a decaying log and bacteria in soil. These decomposers break down organic matter, like dead plants and animals, returning vital nutrients back into the ecosystem. Without decomposers, these nutrients would be trapped within waste and dead organisms, causing a shortage for producers (like plants) who require these nutrients to grow. The shortage of key elements like carbon and nitrogen, which are critical for building organic compounds and cells, could lead to the collapse of the ecosystem as a whole. Therefore, from the given choices, the correct one is 'decomposers'."},{"question":"On October 13, 1961, she received a call from an agent who told her a producer was interested in working with her. When she was told it was Alfred Hitchcock who, while he was watching The Today Show, saw her in a commercial for a diet drink called Sego, she agreed to sign a seven-year contract. During their first meeting, the two talked about everything except the role he was considering her for. Hedren was convinced for several weeks it was for his television series, Alfred Hitchcock Presents. Hitchcock later said, \\"I was not primarily concerned with how she looked in person. Most important was her appearance on the screen, and I liked that immediately. She has a touch of that high-style, lady-like quality which was once well-represented in films by actresses like Irene Dunne, Grace Kelly, Claudette Colbert, and others but which is now quite rare.\\" Hitchcock put Hedren through an extensive color screen test that lasted two days and cost 25,000, doing scenes from his previous films, such as Rebecca, Notorious and To Catch a Thief with actor Martin Balsam. According to Balsam, Hedren was very nervous but studied every line, did every move she was asked to, and tried to do everything right. Hitchcock asked costume designer Edith Head to design clothes for Hedren's private life and he personally advised her about wine and food. He also insisted for publicity purposes that her name should be printed only in single quotes, 'Tippi'. The press mostly ignored this directive from the director, who felt that the single quotes added distinction and mystery to her name. Hitchcock was impressed with Hedren. As production designer Robert F. Boyle explained, \\"Hitch always liked women who behaved like well-bred ladies. Tippi generated that quality.\\" Afterward, Hedren was invited to lunch with Hitchcock, his wife, Alma, and Lew Wasserman, head of Universal, at one of Hitchcock's favorite restaurants, Chasen's. There she was presented with a golden pin of three birds in flight, adorned by three tiny seed pearls, and was asked by Hitchcock to play the leading role in his upcoming film The Birds. \\"I was so stunned. It never occurred to me that I would be given a leading role in a major motion picture. I had great big tears in my eyes\\", Hedren later recalled.

Romaine or cos lettuce (Lactuca sativa L. var. longifolia) is a variety of lettuce that grows in a tall head of sturdy dark green leaves with firm ribs down their centers. Unlike most lettuces, it is tolerant of heat. It is more nutritious than iceberg lettuce. In North America, romaine is sold as whole heads or as \`\`hearts'' that have had the outer leaves removed and are often packaged together.","response":"Based on the given text, it can be concluded that romaine hearts are the same as romaine lettuce but with a specific part of the lettuce being referred to. Let’s break down the information presented in the text to understand this further. Romaine lettuce, also known as cos lettuce, is a type of lettuce characterized by its tall head of sturdy dark green leaves with firm ribs down their centers. It is heat-tolerant and more nutritious than iceberg lettuce. The text mentions two ways in which romaine lettuce is commonly sold in North America: 1. Whole heads: This refers to the entire head of romaine lettuce with all its leaves intact. 2. Hearts: This is a specific part of the romaine lettuce where the outer leaves have been removed, leaving only the inner, more tender and lighter-colored leaves. These romaine hearts are often packaged together and sold separately from the whole heads. Thus, romaine hearts are essentially the same plant as romaine lettuce. However, the term \\"romaine hearts\\" specifically refers to a part of the romaine lettuce that has had the outer leaves removed and is deemed more desirable by consumers due to its tenderness and milder flavor. In conclusion, yes, romaine hearts are the same as romaine lettuce, but the focus is on a particular portion of the lettuce when referring to romaine hearts. It is important to note that whether buying whole heads of romaine lettuce or romaine hearts, the nutritional benefits remain the same – it is a healthy, nutritious, and versatile leafy green vegetable that can be used in various culinary applications."},{"question":"Add spaces: Thechoicesareeithershort2-hourdeliverywindowsorhalf-daywindows.","response":"To add spaces to the given string appropriately, I will insert spaces between words based on the language rules, capitalization of subsequent letters, and numerals.

Stream of Consciousness Reasoning: To start, human behavior is incredibly complex and can be influenced by numerous factors such as individual personality, cultural background, emotions, and past experiences. As a result, it is challenging to create a model that takes into account all these aspects and successfully predicts human behavior on an individual level. Secondly, many external factors contribute to influencing individual behavior in a crowd. For example, sudden changes in weather, announcements by event organizers, or unexpected incidents can all cause a shift in how the crowd collectively responds. These factors make it difficult to predict the exact behavior of every person in a large crowd. Additionally, people within a crowd can influence each other in unpredictable ways. As individuals interact with one another, a ripple effect can occur, leading to emergent crowd behaviors that may not be easy to forecast. The larger the crowd, the more significant this challenge becomes. Lastly, it is important to consider that not all information is accessible when attempting to predict individual behavior. Certain aspects, such as people's mental states or hidden intentions, can be nearly impossible to discern from an external point of view. Therefore, based on the complexity of human behavior, the influence of external factors, interactions between individuals in a crowd, and the limitations in accessing necessary information, it is not possible to tell the exact behavior of every individual in a large crowd during a public event."},{"question":"Write a sentence that is about a restaurant with all the following properties: name = Fitzbillies, eatType = coffee shop, food = Italian, priceRange = less than £20, area = riverside, familyFriendly = yes","response":"Fitzbillies is a nice coffee shop near the river where families can enjoy yummy Italian food like pasta and pizza for under £20."},{"question":"He often got thirsty at night and needed a drink, so he always had a night table everywhere he had lived in all his what?

US Treasury Department A:","response":"Title: The Golden Quackers Genre: Family, Adventure, Comedy Plot Overview: The Golden Quackers is a heartwarming family adventure comedy film centered around the Robertson family consisting of father Max, mother Sarah, teenage son Jake, and young daughter Lucy. The family discovers a duck in the wild that carries an unusual secret: it lays golden eggs. The Robertsons embark on an unexpected journey as they protect their newfound fortune while evading the US Treasury Department, which insists on turning over the duck for reasons unknown. As the story begins, the Robertson family has recently moved to a small town in Northern California to escape the busy city life. During one of their hikes, Lucy stumbles upon an ordinary-looking duck that appears to be injured. The compassionate family takes the duck home, nursing it back to health. They decide to call the duck \\"Goldie.\\" Over time, the Robertson family begins to notice that their duck is unlike any other. Miraculously, Goldie starts laying golden eggs! Initially, the family doesn't know what to make of it, but they quickly realize the eggs are valuable and can change their fortunes. News of Goldie and her extraordinary ability spreads throughout the town, eventually catching the attention of the US Treasury Department. The Treasury contacts the family and demands them to turn over the duck, citing the Gold Reserve Act. According to the agents, Goldie's ability to lay golden eggs compromises the stability of the country's gold reserves and the economy. However, the US Treasury Department and Agent Stevens - a determined but comically bumbling agent - have ulterior motivations for acquiring Goldie. Stevens is secretly working on behalf of a mysterious organization that aims to harness Goldie's abilities for their economic profiteering and world domination. The Robertson family refuses to turn in their beloved Goldie and, in response, they go on the run, evading the Treasury agents while trying to uncover the true intentions behind their pursuit. They utilize Goldie's gifts to obtain resources needed to stay one step ahead of the determined yet inept Agent Stevens and his team. Throughout their journey, the Robertsons explore jaw-dropping locations, meet unexpected allies - including a friendly zoologist and a secretive hacker who helps them expose the corruption in the Treasury Department - and face dangerous and comic misadventures. The family learns the importance of sticking together, trusting one another, and standing up for what's right in the face of adversity. In the exciting climax, the family confronts Agent Stevens and his cronies, exposing their plot publicly and leading to his arrest. The US Treasury Department clears the family's name, apologizing for the trouble caused. The Robertson family returns home, setting Goldie free, knowing that true happiness lies not in material wealth but in the bond they share. \\"The Golden Quackers\\" captivates its audience with its blend of humor, adventure, and heartwarming family values, and leaves a lasting message on the true meaning of happiness."},{"question":"Here is a premise: \\"A man wearing sunglasses and long hair is playing a brass instrument.\\" Here is a hypothesis: \\"a man plays at a concert\\" .Does the premise tell us whether the hypothesis is true?

The material, which has been seen by the Guardian, is a series of reports on Trump’s relationship with Moscow. They were drawn up by a former western counter-intelligence official, now working as a private consultant. BuzzFeed on Tuesday published the documents, which it said were “unverified and potentially unverifiable”. Explainer: what is in the Trump-Russia dossier John McCain passed to the FBI? Read more The Guardian has not been able to confirm the veracity of the documents’ contents, and the Trump team has consistently denied any hidden contacts with the Russian government. A spokesman for the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, on Wednesday denied Russia has collected compromising information on Trump and dismissed news reports as a “complete fabrication and utter nonsense”. Dmitry Peskov insisted that the Kremlin “does not engage in collecting compromising material”. Trump’s transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but late on Tuesday, Trump tweeted: “FAKE NEWS – A TOTAL POLITICAL WITCH HUNT!” He made no direct reference to the allegations. An official in the US administration who spoke to the Guardian described the source who wrote the intelligence report as consistently reliable, meticulous and well-informed, with a reputation for having extensive Russian contacts. Some of the reports – which are dated from 20 June to 20 October last year – also proved to be prescient, predicting events that happened after they were sent. One report, dated June 2016, claims that the Kremlin has been cultivating, supporting and assisting Trump for at least five years, with the aim of encouraging “splits and divisions in western alliance”. It claims that Trump had declined “various sweetener real estate deals offered him in Russia” especially in developments linked to the 2018 World Cup finals but that “he and his inner circle have accepted a regular flow of intelligence from the Kremlin, including on his Democratic and other political rivals.” Most explosively, the report alleges: “FSB has compromised Trump through his activities in Moscow sufficiently to be able to blackmail him.” The president-elect has not responded to the allegations. The story of the Trump dossier: secret sources, an airport handoff, and John McCain Read more CNN reported on Tuesday that the FBI was still investigating the credibility of the documents but added that the intelligence chiefs had included a summary of the material in a secret briefing on Russian interference in the election delivered last week to Barack Obama and Donald Trump. The emergence of the documents is potentially explosive, 10 days before Trump’s inauguration and on the eve of his first planned press conference since July last year. Despite glowing references from US and foreign officials who have worked with the source, there are some errors in the reports. One describes the Moscow suburb of Barvikha as “reserved for the residences of the top leadership and their close associates”, but although it is a very expensive neighbourhood, there are no restrictions on who can own property there. The document also misspells the name of a Russian banking corporation. The FBI does not normally make any comment on ongoing counter-intelligence investigations but was under increasing pressure from Democrats and some Republicans to act before the inauguration, particularly because of Comey’s announcement of a continuing investigation into Hillary Clinton’s email server 11 days before the election, which many of her supporters believe cost her the presidency. The reports were initially commissioned as opposition research during the presidential campaign, but its author was sufficiently alarmed by what he discovered to send a copy to the FBI. It is unclear who within the organisation they reached and what action the bureau took. The former Democratic Senate leader, Harry Reid, has lambasted Comey for publicising investigations into Hillary Clinton’s private server, while allegedly sitting on “explosive” material on Trump’s ties to Russia. Another Democratic senator, Ron Wyden, questioned Comey insistently at a Senate intelligence committee hearing on Tuesday on whether the FBI was pursuing leads on Trump campaign contacts with Russia. “Has the FBI investigated these reported relationships?” Wyden asked. Comey replied: “I would never comment on investigations … in a public forum. The Guardian can confirm that the documents reached the top of the FBI by December. Senator John McCain, who was informed about the existence of the documents separately by an intermediary from a western allied state, dispatched an emissary overseas to meet the source and then decided to present the material to Comey in a one-on-one meeting on 9 December, according to a source aware of the meeting. The documents, which were first reported on last year by Mother Jones, are also in the hands of officials in the White House. James Comey refuses to tell Senate if FBI is investigating Trump-Russia links Read more McCain is not thought to have made a judgment on the reliability of the documents but was sufficiently impressed by the source’s credentials to feel obliged to pass them to the FBI. The Senate armed services committee, which Senator McCain chairs, launched an inquiry last week into Russian cyber-attacks during the election. McCain was reluctant to get involved, according to a colleague, for fear the issue would be dismissed as a personal grudge against Trump. He pushed instead for the creation of a special Senate committee to look into connections between campaign staff and Moscow, but the proposal was blocked by the Republican leadership. McCain told the NBC programme Meet the Press on Sunday: “I would like to see a select committee. Apparently that is not in agreement by our leadership. So we will move forward with the armed services committee and I’m sure foreign relations and intelligence committee will as well.” But the senator added: “It is possible if enough information comes out, that that decision could be reversed. I still think it’s the best way to attack the issue.” Asked on the same programme on whether an investigation was ongoing into campaign links to Moscow, Senator Lindsey Graham, another conservative Republican said: “I believe that it’s happening.” According to the report passed to Comey, Russian intelligence allegedly gathered compromising material during Trump’s stay in Moscow in November 2013, when he was in the city to host the Miss Universe pageant. Another report, dated 19 July last year said that Carter Page, a businessman named by Trump as one of his foreign policy advisers, had held a secret meeting that month with Igor Sechin, head of the Rosneft state-owned oil company and a long-serving lieutenant of Vladimir Putin. Page also allegedly met Igor Divyekin, an internal affairs official with a background in intelligence, who is said to have warned Page that Moscow had “kompromat” (compromising material) on Trump. Two months later, allegations of Page’s meetings surfaced in the US media, attributed to intelligence sources, along with reports that he had been under FBI scrutiny. Page, a vociferous supporter of the Kremlin line, was in Moscow in July to make a speech decrying western policy towards Russia. At the time he declined to say whether he had been in contact with Russian officials, but in September he rejected the reports as “garbage”. The Guardian has learned that the FBI applied for a warrant from the foreign intelligence surveillance (Fisa) court over the summer in order to monitor four members of the Trump team suspected of irregular contacts with Russian officials. The Fisa court turned down the application asking FBI counter-intelligence investigators to narrow its focus. According to one report, the FBI was finally granted a warrant in October, but that has not been confirmed, and it is not clear whether any warrant led to a full investigation. A month after Trump’s surprise election victory, Page was back in Moscow saying he was meeting with “business leaders and thought leaders”, dismissing the FBI investigation as a “witch-hunt” and suggesting the Russian hacking of the Democratic Party alleged by US intelligence agencies, could be a false flag operation to incriminate Moscow. Another of the reports compiled by the former western counter-intelligence official in July said that members of Trump’s team, which was led by campaign manager Paul Manafort (a former consultant for pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine), had knowledge of the DNC hacking operation, and in return “had agreed to sideline Russian intervention in Ukraine as a campaign issue and to raise US/Nato defence commitments in the Baltics and Eastern Europe to deflect attention away from Ukraine”. A few days later, Trump raised the possibility that his administration might recognise Russia’s annexation of Crimea and openly called on Moscow to hack Hillary Clinton’s emails. In August, officials from the Trump campaign intervened in the drafting of the Republican party platform, specifically to remove a call for lethal assistance to Ukraine for its battle against Moscow-backed eastern rebels. Trump campaign denies report of Trump Organization tie to Russian bank Read more Manafort stepped down in August as campaign manager and the campaign steadily distanced itself from Page. However, Trump’s praise of Putin and defence of Moscow’s actions in Ukraine and Syria remained one of the few constants in his campaign talking points. Manafort has denied secret links with Moscow calling the allegation “an outrageous smear being driven by Harry Reid and the Clinton campaign”. Since then, Trump has consistently cast doubt on Russian culpability for hacking the Democratic National Committee, defying a consensus of 17 national intelligence agencies. After Obama deported 35 Russian diplomats in retaliation for Moscow’s intervention, Trump praised Putin for not carrying out tit-for-tat deportations of US diplomats. “I always knew he was very smart,” he tweeted. An FBI spokesman declined to comment after the CNN report. ||||| Normally, Twitter loses its mind over something President-elect Donald Trump has tweeted. This evening, it’s losing its mind over an unverified, leaked report that supposedly details the ways in which Russia has been alternately teaming up with Trump and working to collect compromising information about him. The allegations contained in it are startling. Among them: Trump has been filmed with Russian prostitutes, knew about Russian hacking, and changed his policy on the Ukraine for Russia, and on and on. US intelligence agencies and multiple journalists haven’t verified these claims to a sufficient degree that they feel comfortable publishing them. And yet here we are, reading them anyway. And making jokes about golden showers on Twitter related to our next president. What is even going on here? Let’s start with what has taken this report out of the realm of gossip and allegation amongst in-the-know reporters and into your Twitter feed. According to CNN, both Trump and President Obama were given a briefing that included a synopsis of this larger, 35-page report. The ostensible reason for the two-page synopsis that they received was “to make the President-elect aware that such allegations involving him are circulating among intelligence agencies, senior members of Congress and other government officials in Washington,” according to CNN. The New York Times reports that “Intelligence officials were concerned that the information would leak before they informed Mr. Trump of its existence.” In other words: people are talking about it, you should know about it. That took the newsworthiness of the report up a level, and so BuzzFeed followed an almost identical logic and published the 35-page report itself. Its justification for doing so, knowing that the allegations contained therein are unverified, is “so that Americans can make up their own minds about allegations about the president-elect that have circulated at the highest levels of the US government.” In other words: people are talking about it, you should know about it. That reason for publishing is often not only enough, but more than enough to merit publication (cf. this very article). According to BuzzFeed, “the documents have circulated for months, and acquired a kind of legendary status among journalists, lawmakers, and intelligence officials.” It seems likely that it was going to leak one way or another, so a report that Trump and Obama had been briefed on it was as good a time as any for that to happen. BuzzFeed editor-in-chief Ben Smith tweeted out an email he sent to his staff detailing why BuzzFeed chose to publish the document: Here's the note I sent to @buzzfeednews staff this evening pic.twitter.com/OcAloWzVzb — Ben Smith (@BuzzFeedBen) January 11, 2017 Smith’s take here is more nuanced than simply “people are talking about it.” He’s right that it seems clear that this report is behind some of the more serious allegations that have been thrown around by people at the highest levels of US government. Smith’s line of reasoning is defensible — but not every reporter agrees. The report itself was apparently compiled by a former British intelligence agent “whose past work US intelligence officials consider credible,” CNN says. We know only that the report is being taken seriously by serious people. But the work of corroborating the allegations in it hasn’t been finished yet, so other journalists who had seen it chose not to publish it. 1. For those asking, I didn't publish the full memos from the intelligence operative because I could not confirm the allegations. — David Corn (@DavidCornDC) January 11, 2017 But now that it’s out there, published as a PDF with yellow highlights from an unknown reader, it’s out there. I myself tweeted out one of the most explosive allegations (while also noting one of the most salacious parts), and my Twitter notifications are blowing up. The report seems custom-designed to spread on Twitter. It practically begs you to screencap and Tweet whatever part outrages you the most (or makes you titter the most). These soundbites have been weaponized by Twitter, made all the more powerful because they appeal to the deepest desires and fears of Trump’s critics. After months — and years — of watching damning leaks about Hillary Clinton, finally there’s a leak for the other side to share and spread, provenance be damned. FAKE NEWS - A TOTAL POLITICAL WITCH HUNT! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 11, 2017 It’s not “Fake News,” as Donald Trump just declared on Twitter, because the real news here is that Trump himself was briefed on the contents of this report. It’s unverified news, which is an entirely different thing that requires that you pay attention to where it came from, why, and how. It’s not necessarily bad that this report is out there — but we should keep in mind that lots of people have been reading and trying to verify these claims for months now. But as it spreads on Twitter, screenshot by gleefully outraged screenshot, it’s going to be stripped of nuance and context. But we’ll still share and reply and retweet and joke. Because people are talking about it, and that’s the way we talk now. ||||| WASHINGTON (AP) — Top intelligence officials last week told President-elect Donald Trump about an unsubstantiated report that Russia had compromising personal and financial information about him, a U.S. official said Tuesday. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because the official was not allowed to publicly discuss the matter. The briefing about the document was first reported by CNN. A summary of the allegations was separate from a classified assessment of Russia's attempts to meddle in the U.S. presidential election. Trump and President Barack Obama were briefed on the intelligence community's findings last week. Shortly after news reports were published about the briefing, Trump tweeted: \\"FAKE NEWS - A TOTAL POLITICAL WITCH HUNT!\\" Trump was expected to hold a previously scheduled news conference Wednesday to discuss his future plans regarding his role with the Trump Organization. The unsubstantiated dossier on Trump was compiled by a former Western intelligence operative as part of an opposition research project originally financed by a Republican client who opposed Trump, and later funded by Democrats, according to Mother Jones, which published an article about the report in October and said the operative had turned over the report to the FBI. The New York Times reported the operative had previously worked for British intelligence. The Associated Press has not been able to substantiate the information in the dossier, which misspelled the name of Russia's largest bank. It's unclear why the intelligence officials decided to brief the president and Trump on the uncorroborated information at this time, but lawmakers and others have repeatedly noted that Russia collects intelligence on both Democrats and Republicans. \\"The Russians also hacked systems associated with the Republicans. They just chose not to release that material yet,\\" Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the ranking Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee, said Tuesday. \\"There's nothing that prevents them from doing so at a time of their choosing in the future.\\" Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway said in an interview Tuesday on NBC's \\"Late Night with Seth Meyers\\" that \\"nobody has sourced it. They're all unnamed, unspoken sources in the story.\\" She said it may have originated with a Russian investigator or groups that wanted Hillary Clinton to win the White House. The report had been circulating in Washington for months. In October, former Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid wrote the FBI asking the bureau to publicly disclose what it knew about the Trump campaign's ties to Russia. Reid was aware of the dossier before he wrote the letter, according to a person knowledgeable about the subject who spoke on condition of anonymity because this person was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter. FBI Director James Comey refused earlier Tuesday to say whether the FBI was investigating any possible ties between Russia and Trump's presidential campaign, citing policy not to comment on what the FBI might or might not be doing. Comey was pressed by Democrats on the committee about whether the FBI was conducting an investigation. There was no mention during the hearing about the summary of the dossier, which was attached to the classified hacking assessment. \\"I would never comment on investigations — whether we have one or not — in an open forum like this so I can't answer one way or another,\\" Comey told the panel during his first public appearance before Congress since the election. In late October, Comey angered Democrats when he announced 11 days before the election that the FBI was looking at more emails as part of its investigation of Hillary Clinton. Oregon Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden said the American people had a right to know about whether there is an FBI investigation into the Trump campaign's ties with Russia. An active FBI investigation of the next president for ties between his campaign and a nation accused of meddling in the presidential election could further stoke mistrust in the legitimacy of the democratic process. It could also put Trump's own FBI in the awkward position of examining the conduct of those closest to the commander-in-chief. The FBI was among three U.S. intelligence agencies that collaborated on last week's report on Russia's election activity. It tied Russian President Vladimir Putin to the hacking of email accounts of the Democratic National Committee and individual Democrats like Clinton's campaign chairman, John Podesta. It said there was no evidence the Russians tampered with vote tallies; the agencies said they couldn't assess if Russia succeeded in influencing Americans to vote for Trump. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who opposed Trump in the GOP primary, said Russia's activity wasn't guided by its support for Trump, but rather \\"to influence and to potentially manipulate American public opinion for the purpose of discrediting individual political figures, sowing chaos and division in our politics, sowing doubts about the legitimacy of our elections.\\" Democrats at the committee hearing focused their toughest questions on Comey, who was widely criticized for breaking FBI policy in his decision to notify Congress about additional information that came up related to Clinton. He is in the fourth year of a 10-year term, meaning he is expected to stay on in the Trump administration. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., said Comey set a new standard by discussing the bureau's activity related to Clinton's private email server. That standard, she said, is the FBI discusses ongoing investigations when there is a \\"unique public interest in the transparency of that issue.\\" The intelligence agencies' findings on Russian hacking fit that standard, she argued. \\"I'm not sure I can think of an issue of more serious public interest than this one,\\" Harris said. \\"This committee needs to understand what the FBI does and does not know about campaign communications with Russia.\\" Sitting beside Comey, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said, \\"Fair point.\\" ___ Associated Press writer Kathleen Hennessey contributed to this report. ||||| Tweet with a location You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. President-elect Donald Trump was not told about unverified reports that Russia has compromising information on him during last week's intelligence briefing, according to a senior intelligence official with knowledge of preparations for the briefing. A summary of the unverified reports was prepared as background material for the briefing, but not discussed during the meeting, the official said. During Trump's press conference Wednesday morning, the president-elect said he was made aware of the information \\"outside that meeting.\\" A 35-page memorandum published by BuzzFeed on Tuesday includes claims that the Russian government has been cultivating, supporting and assisting Trump for five years — even obtaining compromising information in an effort to blackmail him. (BuzzFeed is partially funded by the parent company of NBC News.) The document, which was not prepared by the U.S. government, contains obvious errors. It was originally generated as part of opposition research by anti-Trump Republicans and then shopped by Democrats. Related: Seth Meyers Confronts Conway Over Trump Allegations Two U.S. officials told NBC News that materials prepared for Trump in advance of last week's intelligence briefing included damaging allegations from the memorandum — unverified by American intelligence agencies — about his dealings with the Russians. Officials prepared a two-page summary of the memo for Trump's briefing Friday at Trump Tower in New York. The summary was an \\"annex,\\" or addendum, included in the \\"supporting documents\\" that accompanied the classified briefing report. While multiple officials say the summary was included in the material prepared for the briefers, the senior official told NBC News that the briefing was oral and no actual documents were left with the Trump team in New York. During the briefing, the president-elect was not briefed on the contents of the summary. “Intel and law enforcement officials agree that none of the investigations have found any conclusive or direct link between Trump and the Russian government period,” the senior official said. According to the senior official, the two-page summary about the unsubstantiated material made available to the briefers was to provide context, should they need it, to draw the distinction for Trump between analyzed intelligence and unvetted “disinformation.” The briefers also had available to them unvetted “disinformation” about the Clinton Foundation, although that was not orally shared with Trump. The Russian government on Wednesday denied reports that it has compromising information about Trump, dismissing the claims as a \\"total hoax.\\" Amid increased interest in the dossier Wednesday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov rejected all of the allegations out of hand. Trump later blamed intelligence agencies for allowing the dossier to leak, tweeting: \\"Are we living in Nazi Germany?\\" \\"The Kremlin does not have compromising information about Trump,\\" Peskov said, according to Russian state-run news agency TASS. \\"It's a total hoax, absolute fabrication and utter nonsense. The Kremlin does not collect compromising information.\\" Peskov also called the reports \\"pulp fiction.\\" Trump did not respond to the reports directly but sent a tweet appearing to refer to it on Tuesday night. Early Wednesday, he sent several others that followed Peskov's comments. Trump has repeatedly cast doubt over findings by American intelligence officials that Russia interfered in the U.S. election with the aim of helping him win. NBC News reported last week that the gulf between Trump and U.S. intelligence agencies had grown so wide that the two camps couldn't even agree on the scheduled date of a briefing Trump had been due to receive. Related: Putin's Sassy Trolling Sent Message to Trump, Experts Say Peskov mentioned Trump's initial tweet, and went on to say that some people were “boosting the hysteria and go to any lengths to maintain this state of 'witch hunting.'” Michael McFaul, who was ambassador to Russia from 2012 to 2014, told NBC News he was sure Russian officials were \\"thrilled\\" to see Americans bickering about the leaked memo. \\"It doesn't make us look like we are a healthy democracy.\\" McFaul also said that Trump had contributed to an atmosphere in which \\"fake news\\" could flourish because of his past promotion of the unfounded \\"birther\\" conspiracy theory about President Barack Obama's birthplace. In an interview with NBC News before his farewell address Tuesday night in Chicago, Obama said he had not seen the news accounts of Trump's Russian ties but noted that \\"as a matter of principle and national security, I don't comment on classified information.\\" Last month, Obama expelled 35 Russian diplomats as punishment for Russia's alleged cyberattacks in the run-up to the Nov. 8 election. The CIA has concluded that the interference was intended to help Trump win, and intelligence officials told NBC News that they believe \\"with a high level of confidence\\" that Russian President Vladimir Putin was personally involved in the covert campaign. Trump has been skeptical about the alleged Russian hacks, even as he repeatedly praised Putin. ||||| Summary:","response":"Documents allegedly showing secret contact between Moscow's intelligence and US President-elect Donald Trump's election campaign have been passed to FBI director James Comey by Senator John McCain, according to The Guardian. The papers, which were commissioned as opposition research, were first reported by Mother Jones last year and have also been viewed by the Obama administration. The contents of the papers have not been verified, but their source has previously been described as having a reputation for Russian contacts.

In 1964 MCA formed Universal City Studios, Inc., merging the motion pictures and television arms of Universal Pictures Company and Revue Productions (officially renamed as Universal Television in 1966). And so, with MCA in charge, Universal became a full-blown, A-film movie studio, with leading actors and directors under contract; offering slick, commercial films; and a studio tour subsidiary launched in 1964. Television production made up much of the studio's output, with Universal heavily committed, in particular, to deals with NBC (which later merged with Universal to form NBC Universal; see below) providing up to half of all prime time shows for several seasons.

The first situation states, \\"A man, wearing all black clothing, is running down the street as a car comes toward him with its headlights on.\\" This situation describes a man in dark clothing who may not be easily visible, especially at night. The driver of the car with the headlights on must exercise caution to avoid a potential collision with the man running down the street. Factors such as the speed of the car, the visibility of the man, and the alertness of the driver could determine the outcome of this situation. The second statement, \\"A child sleeping on the couch,\\" is an entirely different situation. It simply describes a child who is resting on a couch. There is no direct correlation or link between the man running down the street in black clothing and the child sleeping on the couch. Here's a more detailed analysis of each situation: Situation 1: A man, wearing all black clothing, is running down the street as a car comes toward him with its headlights on. - This situation could occur at nighttime, given that the car has its headlights on. - The man wearing all black clothing could be doing so for various reasons. He might be exercising, attempting to hide or escape from someone, or his choice of attire might be unrelated to his actions. - It is also important to consider the environment of this situation. Is it a residential neighborhood or a busy street with cars driving by frequently? The setting can also influence the potential risks present in this scenario. - Both the driver and the man running down the street must be aware of their surroundings to prevent any accidents or conflicts. Situation 2: A child sleeping on the couch. - This situation is quite straightforward. The child is resting on a couch, likely in a comfortable and familiar environment, such as their home. - Factors that can influence this situation include the time of day, the reason the child is sleeping on the couch (such as illness, refusing to sleep in their bed, or napping after a long day), and if there are adults supervising or nearby. In conclusion, the assertion that the first scenario involving the man in black clothing running down the street as a car approaches means that \\"A child sleeping on the couch\\" is incorrect since there is no direct connection between these two situations. They both represent separate instances and have different circumstances and factors involved."},{"question":"Produce a sentence which mentions all of these concepts: add, color, outfit, pop","response":"To add a pop of color to your outfit, try incorporating vibrant accessories like a brightly colored scarf or statement jewelry."},{"question":"I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: When thirty-two-year-old tennis player Andre Agassi made to the final of the U.S. Clay Court Championship in April 2003, he set a new world record: he became the oldest player ever to be number one in the world's tennis rankings. It was one of the greatest achievements in Agassi's long and successful career. Andre Agassi turned professional in 1986 at the age of sixteen. His career soon took off, and in 1990, Agassi was famous around the world, though never having won an important tennis championship. Many people thought he was famous more for his long blond hair and colorful tennis shirts than for his tennis skills. They wondered if he could really win an important tournament. In 1992, Agassi proved _ wrong by winning one of the greatest prizes in world tennis--the Wimbledon singles final. His first attempt to win this tournament had been in 1987, but he lost his opening game. He then refused to take part in Wimbledon for the next three years. He said his reason for not playing was that the officials refused to allow him to wear his colorful shirts, but some people said it was because he was afraid to lose. After several more championship victories, Agassi's luck began to run out. By 1997, the year of his marriage to a movie actress--- Brooke Shields, Agassi's ranking had dropped to 141stin the world. Many people thought his career was over. Agassi and Shields divorced two years later, and Agassi made a comeback with a new trainer, a new hairstyle, and new determination. In 1999, he won both the French Open and the U.S. Open and ended the year back as the world's number one. By 2003, he had earned more than 27 million in prize money, making him one of the most successful tennis players of all times. Question: Which statement is right about Agassi? Options: A: He was always lucky to win the championship. B: He was the youngest player ever to be number one in the world's tennis rankings. C: He took part in Wimbledon in 1987.

Write a story that ends with: Christian got on the team.","response":"Step 1: Establish the setting To create an engaging story, I will first begin by setting the stage. I need to develop a situation in which Christian's initial dislike of football can be addressed and the transition to joining the team can occur. I'll start by creating a high school setting as it offers a relatable and common environment for the story to unfold. Step 2: Develop the characters I will create a compelling cast of characters, including Christian, his best friend, a supportive teacher, and a football coach. By developing these characters, I can create opportunities for interactions that will push Christian to grow. Step 3: Introduce the conflict Next, I need to introduce a conflict or challenge that Christian must overcome in order to transform his attitude about football. This should be something that gives him a reason to play football, despite his initial dislike of the sport. Step 4: Show Christian's growth Christian's development as a character will be key to making the story engaging. As his attitude toward football evolves, I will need to show how his relationships with the other characters change as well. Step 5: Reach the resolution Finally, the story must end with Christian joining the football team, reflecting his transformation. This will serve as the resolution of the conflict, and the culmination of his character development. The Story: Christian always hated football. He couldn't understand how people could be so passionate about a sport he considered boring and brutish. Instead of attending high school games, he immersed himself in art and music – passions that brought him joy and fulfillment. One day, Christian's best friend, Mark, approached him excitedly. \\"Hey, Christian! The football team needs a substitute player for a charity game in a few weeks. Coach wants to know if you'd be up for it. It's for a good cause!\\" Christian hesitated, his dislike for the sport weighing heavily on his decision, but loyalty to his friend and a hint of curiosity spurred him on. \\"Alright, I'll give it a try.\\" The next few weeks were grueling. Christian couldn't help but feel out of place amongst the team, and the physical demands of football left him exhausted. However, he found help from an unexpected source: Mr. Thompson, his history teacher and a former football player. Mr. Thompson shared stories of teamwork, camaraderie, and the lessons he had learned on the field. Through his interactions with the team, Christian slowly started to see the value of football. He was moved by their devotion to teamwork and strong support for one another, regardless of winning or losing. Christian's developing bond with the team paralleled his growing appreciation for the game. The day of the charity game arrived. Despite some initial nervousness, Christian stepped onto the field. He was no longer an outsider, but a vital part of the team. Together, they played their hearts out, and though they didn't win, it barely seemed to matter. It was a turning point, where Christian finally felt the pride and unity that football could bring. As they walked off the field, the coach approached him. \\"Christian, you showed real heart out there. How would you feel about joining the team permanently?\\" Christian hesitated for a brief moment, reflecting on the past few weeks. He never could have imagined himself playing football, but now it was hard to imagine life without the bonds he'd formed and the sense of camaraderie he'd come to cherish. He looked up and managed a smile. \\"Coach, I'd be honored. I'm in.\\" And with that, Christian got on the team."},{"question":"Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: About 97% of the world's water is salty and is found in our oceans and seas. But, as we can't drink seawater, how can it be important? Every part of our seas and oceans contains an amazing number of animals and fish that live at different ocean depths. Most of the different species of animals and fish depend on simple plants for their food. These simple plants called algae drift near the surface of the ocean and use sunlight to turn carbon dioxide and water into food and oxygen. In fact, algae produce over half of the oxygen people breathe. How important seawater is! Each plant or animal in our seas and oceans is an important link in a food chain. The algae are eaten in large amounts by microscopic animals, which are in turn consumed by larger animals. These food chains are delicately balanced. The bad news about the food chains in the oceans is that they are under threat because of man. People once thought that the oceans were so big that it didn't matter if we dumped rubbish into them or caught huge quantities of fish and whales for food. But we now know this is not true and fish stocks in the oceans have started to drop. Thankfully, the world is taking steps to protect the future of our oceans by introducing international agreements to protect marine habitats. Most countries have introduced fishing restrictions to protect fish stocks in the oceans and new techniques are being pioneered to cope with pollution. Finally, the importance of protecting oceans is being made known to more people. This is just the beginning of a long process to protect the oceans for our future. We depend on the oceans for fish which are an important part of the human diet. How important seawater is!","response":"Which statement best describes the role of algae in the ocean ecosystem?

But as a corporate raider, he shipped jobs to China and Mexico. As governor, he did the same thing: Outsourcing state jobs to India.” — Voiceover of new Barack Obama campaign ad The Obama campaign apparently loves to ding former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney with the charge of “outsourcing.” On several occasions, we have faulted the campaign for its claims, apparently to little avail. Now, all of the claims have been combined in one 30-second ad, with the added incendiary charge that Romney was a “corporate raider.” Let’s look anew at this material. The Facts The phrase “corporate raider” has a particular meaning in the world of finance. Here’s the definition on Investopedia: “An investor who buys a large number of shares in a corporation whose assets appear to be undervalued. The large share purchase would give the corporate raider significant voting rights, which could then be used to push changes in the company’s leadership and management. This would increase share value and thus generate a massive return for the raider.” In other words, this is generally an adversarial stance, in which an investor sees an undervalued asset and forces management to spin off assets, take the company private or break it up. In a previous life, The Fact Checker covered renowned corporate raiders such as Carl Icahn and his ilk. We also have closely studied Bain Capital and can find no examples that come close to this situation; its deals were done in close association with management. Indeed, Bain generally held onto its investments for four or five years, in contrast to the quick bust-em-ups of real corporate raiders. So calling Romney a “corporate raider” is a real stretch. So how does the Obama campaign justify this phrase? It cites a single Reuters story from last August, about a campaign stop in New Hampshire, written by a stringer. Buried in the article is a reference to Romney as a “former corporate raider.” “Reuters typically refers to Romney as a ‘former private equity executive’ or something along those lines,” said Ros Krasny, the Boston bureau chief. “Of the hundreds of times we have referenced Romney over the past year or more, honestly, that example from [the stringer] must have just slipped through the net — 10 months ago.” A better source for Romney’s behavior as an investor might be someone who actually worked on Wall Street, such as former Obama auto czar Steven Rattner. “Bain Capital is not now, nor has it ever been, some kind of Gordon Gekko-like, fire-breathing corporate raider that slashed and burned companies, immolating jobs wherever they appear in its path,” Rattner wrote in Politico this year. Regarding the outsourcing claims, we have frowned on these before. The Obama campaign rests its case on three examples of Bain-controlled companies sending jobs overseas. But only one of the examples — involving Holson Burns Group — took place when Romney was actively managing Bain Capital. Regarding the other claims, concerning Canadian electronics maker SMTC Manufacturing and customer service firm Modus Media, the Obama campaign tries to take advantage of a gray area in which Romney had stepped down from Bain — to manage the Salt Lake City Olympics — but had not sold his shares in the firm. We had previously given the Obama campaign Three Pinocchios for such tactics. The Modus Media case is also not an example of shipping jobs overseas. The company closed one plant in California and transferred the jobs to North Carolina, Washington and Utah. At the same time, it opened an unrelated plant in Mexico. The Obama campaign once trumpeted the fact that we had dinged a conservative Super PAC for making the same leap in logic. The claim that Romney outsourced jobs as governor is equally overblown. This concerns Romney’s veto of a bill that would have prohibited Massachusetts from contracting with companies that outsourced the state’s work to other countries. Lawmakers were especially concerned about a 160,000-a-month contract with Citigroup to operate a system of electronic food-stamp cards that included a customer phone service center in India. Both the liberal editorial page of the Boston Globe and conservative editorial page of the Boston Herald urged Romney to veto the amendment, saying it would cost the state money. Romney agreed, saying the measure did not protect state jobs — the call center might have moved from India to another state — but “had the potential of costing our citizens a lot more money.” The Democratic-dominated Massachusetts legislature did not override his veto, even though it overturned 117 others, suggesting that there was little real support for the measure. When the food-stamp contract expired, the Massachusetts Department of Transitional Assistance insisted that those jobs be returned to the United States. But they ended up in a call center based in Utah — just as Romney had predicted. As we mentioned, we recounted this ancient Massachusetts history before, giving the campaign Two Pinocchios. So we were very surprised that the Obama campaign cited that critical Fact Checker column as a source for the ad in its back-up materials. The ad also cites as a source a Boston Globe article from last month that merely reports on an earlier ad making similar charges. That’s highly circular reasoning — and is not fair play. Upon hearing this ad was under consideration for a tough rating, the Obama campaign supplied reams of additional SEC documents regarding Romney’s ownership in Bain after he left for the Olympics, most of which we had examined previously when we first looked at this question. The campaign also supplied SEC documents showing that two of these companies, Modus and SMTC, as well as one called Stream International (a predecessor of Modus), earned money in part by helping other companies subcontract work overseas. Some of this business predated Romney’s departure from Bain, but thus far it seems a slim case for this particular ad. “Romney can’t run from his record. At Bain and in Massachusetts, he had the chance to keep jobs in America and sent them overseas instead,” said Kara Carscaden, deputy press secretary for the Obama campaign. “Even while he was at the Olympics, Romney owned and profited from Bain, continues to profit from it today and cannot ignore what Bain did during that time. Whether it’s outsourcing public jobs to India or shipping private ones to Mexico and China, Romney’s record is clear.” The Pinocchio Test The Obama campaign fails to make its case. On just about every level, this ad is misleading, unfair and untrue, from the use of “corporate raider” to its examples of alleged outsourcing. Simply repeating the same debunked claims won’t make them any more correct.

For some incumbents, ‘Congress’ is a four-letter word ||||| Photograph by Eric Kayne/Getty Images. Mitt Romney was booed. It was a good day for Mitt Romney. John Dickerson John Dickerson is a Slate political columnist, the moderator of CBS’s Face the Nation, and author of Whistlestop and On Her Trail. When the Republican nominee told the NAACP that he was committed to eliminating Obamacare, audience members shouted out. The negative reception might have been momentarily jarring to the candidate, but the moment had a political upside. It offered a chance for a candidate criticized for his malleability to look principled in the face of opposition. That might not have mattered to the audience in the auditorium, but as Romney advisers explain, this speech was not just aimed at the people sitting in their seats or African American voters in general. Like Romney's contentious visit to the largely African-American school in West Philadelphia weeks ago, this speech was aimed at rounding out Romney's image. “I believe that if you understood who I truly am in my heart, and if it were possible to fully communicate what I believe is in the real, enduring best interest of African-American families, you would vote for me for president,” he said. Hearing this, swing voters might think Gov. Romney has a bigger heart than those mean Democratic ads claiming he sent jobs overseas. At the very least the speech, and the negative reaction it provoked, replaced the outsourcing of American jobs as the political topic of the day. That may be the biggest political benefit of all of Mitt Romney's NAACP speech: He changed the conversation. In an election that is so close, both campaigns seem less concerned about the substance of their argument than that the argument take place on favorable turf. On issues from health care to charges and counter-charges about outsourcing, both Romney and Obama are willing to endure boos, howls from fact-checkers, and even some cries of hypocrisy if it will keep the argument on the topics that do them the most political good. Advertisement Romney was also applauded by the NAACP audience, as his supporters were quick to point out. True, but it's in their candidate's interest to get booed and to have that booing reported. Quiet golf clapping and even sustained applause would rob Romney of explaining how steadfast he is going to be in the interviews that followed. It would weaken the Daniel in the Lion’s Den story. Big deal Daniel, the lion's just purred at you. This is why, when candidate Obama in 2008 told of being grumbled at by auto executives for his position on auto emissions, he left out the part about how they gave him a standing ovation at the end of the speech. Get Slate in your inbox. The boos are particularly helpful in building ties with conservatives who prize constancy in the face of opposition among all political attributes and who have specific concerns about Romney's commitment to repealing the president's health care plan. It should be noted that the appearance of bravery is distinct from actual bravery. This was not a Sister Soulja moment, named for Bill Clinton's comments at a conference sponsored by the Rainbow Coalition criticizing a popular rap artist for contributing to the coarsening of the culture. Jeb Bush talking about his party's strict views on immigration is the closest thing to a popular GOP official challenging his base. In this case, Romney was telling leaders of a community disproportionately lacking quality health care that legislation expanding the system is a bad thing. Romney asked the audience to see his heart, but after so quickly dismissing this policy that has deep consequences for the African-American community he offered no alternative health care vision or hint that he understood the depth of the need that Obamacare—as flawed as it may be—was trying to meet. (When Romney later suggested those who had booed simply wanted more \\"free stuff,\\" that probably made it harder to see his heart.) Advertisement Gov. Romney was also willing to endure a few uncomfortable moments when he recently declared that the individual mandate in the Affordable Care Act was a tax. That statement contradicted a senior aide who had labeled it a penalty and contradicted Romney's position as governor of Massachusetts. But it put him in sync with GOP Congressional leaders accusing President Obama of advocating a new tax. As one Republican official argued, the Romney campaign was happy to have an extended debate about the tax issue, even if it momentarily touched on Romney's possible lack of conviction, because all voters would hear was a debate about taxes. Any time the debate is about taxes, argue strategists for both parties, it's a good argument for the Republican candidate. Voters just tend to trust Republicans to give them lower taxes, which they'd prefer. Also, for Romney his pitch to independent voters who don’t like the law is that if he’s elected the tax will disappear. If Obama stays, it won’t. President Obama is also willing to take his own hits to keep the argument on his turf. His campaign is running a variety of ads charging Romney with outsourcing jobs while the head of Bain Capital. A variety of fact-checking organizations have called the president on it, giving him the most negative ratings possible, challenging his assertions, and saying his campaign can’t back up its claims. Yet, the ads are still running. The Obama campaign is convinced the TV attacks are working because any conversation about outsourcing is one Democrats think they are going to win. The idea is unpopular and voters are likely to believe that the candidate who sells himself as a business guy and whose firm sometimes shuttered factories was the one involved in outsourcing. When Mitt Romney retaliates that Obama is the \\"outsourcer-in-chief,\\" it's not likely to be that effective because voters are not predisposed to believe that of President Obama. (In addition to the fact that the charge is pretty weak.) The Obama campaign is also running an ad making a claim about Romney’s position on abortion that is wafer-thin, as Time's Michael Scherer demonstrates. But a fight about women's reproductive issues is a fight Democrats are happy to have; it is more than worth enduring a few boos from the crowd. Though the president makes it sound like he is the overwhelming victim of negative ads, that's not so. President Obama is a long way from the 2008 candidate who used to inveigh against political game playing. Though, even at the time, Obama was willing to say one thing and do another, and his campaign ran more negative ads than any in history. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","response":"In an election that is very close, both President Obama and Mitt Romney may be seen as willing to endure boos, howls from fact-checkers, and even some cries of hypocrisy if it will keep the argument on the topics that do them the most political good.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","response":"The perturbation hypothesis you mentioned assumes that the purified water will contain more trace impurities. To analyze the potential effects on the water purifier's performance, we must consider both direct and indirect impacts on the process. Direct Effect: The presence of more trace impurities in the purified water indicates that the filter is not working at its optimal efficiency. This could be due to various reasons, such as clogging of the pores with accumulated pollutants, degradation of the filter material over time, or manufacturing defects in the filter. As a result, the overall performance of the water purifier will be negatively impacted, as it will not be able to remove contaminants effectively. Indirect Effect: The presence of more impurities in the purified water could also lead to increased scaling or fouling of the downstream components of the water purifier or connected systems if used for an extended period. This can indirectly impact the water purifier by increasing the overall maintenance costs due to eventual component replacement or cleaning. To ensure the water purifier continues to work efficiently, it is essential to monitor the quality of the purified water and take corrective actions when deviations from the desired levels of purity are observed. This could include replacing or cleaning the filter, investigating manufacturing defects if any, and conducting regular maintenance of the water purifier. By doing so, the effects of the perturbation can be mitigated effectively, and the system will be able to maintain its intended performance levels."},{"question":"Given the question: Answer this question: how long can you be in the supreme court?

These vocalizations are produced in the bat's larynx, or voice box, and are emitted through its mouth or nose, depending on the species. The frequency of these calls often ranges between 20 to 200 kHz, well beyond the range of human hearing, which is typically limited to 20 Hz to 20 kHz. These ultrasonic calls serve as the primary source of the sound waves that will later interact with objects in the environment, forming the basis for echolocation. During this initial stage, bats produce calls with specific frequency, intensity, and duration to optimize the detection and localization of potential prey, obstacles, and other environmental features.

Writing involves using a tool to create characters or symbols to convey meaning or information. - Conclusion: It is not possible to write text or answers on a test with a stapler, as it is designed for a completely different purpose. Sentence B: \\"He used a pencil to write his answers on the test.\\" - Analysis: A pencil is a writing instrument with a thin graphite core that leaves marks (in the form of lines or text) on paper when pressure is applied. Writing a test typically involves answering questions or providing information in a written form. - Conclusion: It is completely logical and reasonable to use a pencil to write answers on a test, as it is a common writing instrument. Therefore, Sentence A (\\"He used a stapler to write his answers on the test\\") is the sentence that doesn't make sense because using a stapler for writing is not possible."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Given the following passage \\"Insect respiration is accomplished without lungs. Instead, the insect respiratory system uses a system of internal tubes and sacs through which gases either diffuse or are actively pumped, delivering oxygen directly to tissues that need it via their trachea (element 8 in numbered diagram). Since oxygen is delivered directly, the circulatory system is not used to carry oxygen, and is therefore greatly reduced. The insect circulatory system has no veins or arteries, and instead consists of little more than a single, perforated dorsal tube which pulses peristaltically. Toward the thorax, the dorsal tube (element 14) divides into chambers and acts like the insect's heart. The opposite end of the dorsal tube is like the aorta of the insect circulating the hemolymph, arthropods' fluid analog of blood, inside the body cavity.:61–65 Air is taken in through openings on the sides of the abdomen called spiracles.\\", answer the following question.

A lengthy story describes their relations as of the \\"Cold War\\" variety, and it says the two men haven't spoken since a phone call on Aug. 9 that devolved into a shouting match. CNN confirms the volatile nature of that call, with one of its sources saying that the president swore at the Senate majority leader. Both stories say Trump is not only peeved at the Senate's inability to repeal ObamaCare, but at McConnell's refusal to help shield the president from the Russia investigation. McConnell's wife, Elaine Chao, is Trump's transportation secretary, and earlier this month she navigated the rift as best she could publicly: \\"I stand by my man—both of them.\\" The Times story runs through in great detail the sources of friction, including that McConnell \\"expressed horror\\" to aides about the president's reaction to the Charlottesville violence. Maybe the most damning line of all: \\"McConnell has privately expressed uncertainty that Mr. Trump will be able to salvage his administration after a series of summer crises.\\" A White House official, however, downplays the feud to CNN and says it won't interfere with looming action on tax reform and government funding. But Ed Kilgore at New York isn't so sure. \\"If nothing else, the 'cold war' between Trump and McConnell could lead both men to a decision to go it alone at times when cooperation is essential to GOP goals.\\" Expand this summary.","response":"The relationship between President Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has become increasingly strained, with recent reports suggesting that the two have not spoken since a heated phone call on August 9. The tension between Trump and McConnell is not only a result of their disagreement over the Senate's failure to repeal ObamaCare, but also due to McConnell's unwillingness to protect the president from the ongoing Russia investigation. The rift between the two men has raised concerns over the potential impact on upcoming actions related to tax reform and government funding. The animosity between President Trump and Mitch McConnell has been evident in both public and private settings. In recent weeks, the two have exchanged criticisms and barbs, creating a \\"Cold War\\"-like environment around their relationship. According to the New York Times, the discord between Trump and McConnell has left many doubting whether the president's administration can recover from a series of summer crises. However, a White House official downplayed the feud to CNN, stating that it won't interfere with future collaborations on government initiatives. It is necessary to recognize the roles that both Trump and McConnell play in shaping the United States' policymaking and governance. As President and Senate Majority Leader, the collaborative relationship between the two is crucial in ensuring that their party's goals are advanced and that legislation is successfully developed and enacted. The rift between Trump and McConnell has been attributed to several points of contention. First, the president has expressed disappointment in the Senate's inability to repeal ObamaCare, a task that has proven to be more difficult than initially anticipated. The divide over healthcare reform has provoked frustration and anger from both Trump and McConnell, who have been at odds over the direction and strategy of their party's efforts. Additionally, Trump feels let down by McConnell's refusal to provide protection from the ongoing investigation into potential Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. As the administration faces mounting pressure and scrutiny from both the public and various political entities, Trump has become increasingly volatile in his response to perceived threats and criticisms. Furthermore, McConnell is said to have been horrified by Trump's reaction to the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, where the president's comments drew widespread condemnation for their perceived support of white supremacist groups. The conflict between Trump and McConnell over this issue has only served to widen the growing rift between the two and complicate their relationship. The discord between Trump and McConnell raises concerns for their cooperation in future policy initiatives, such as tax reform and government funding. A lack of communication and collaboration between the two powerful figures could hinder their ability to successfully navigate legislative challenges and implement important changes. As a result, the ongoing tension between the president and Senate Majority Leader may represent a potential obstacle in achieving their party's goals."},{"question":"A villain in the middle ages is a type of what?

Today, we are going to talk about two brothers named Ronde and Tiki Barber. They used to play a big and important game called football. Do you like football? It's so much fun! Ronde and Tiki Barber were really good at this game. They played it for many years and became very famous. Many people loved watching them play and cheered for them. Ronde played as a helper called a \\"defender\\" to stop the other team from scoring points. Tiki played as a runner called a \\"running back\\" who tried to run with the ball and score points for his team. One day, Tiki decided that he didn't want to play football anymore. He wanted to try new things and talk about football on TV instead. That's okay! Sometimes people want to do different things in their lives. It's good to try new activities, isn't it? But some people were not happy with Tiki's decision. They thought that he should keep playing football because he was so good at it. They even stopped loving him as much as they did before. Ronde, the good brother he is, wanted to help Tiki. He knew that his brother was a really nice person and a great football player. Ronde believed that one day, people would love Tiki again. He thought that if Tiki kept working hard and being a good person, people would remember how amazing he was and start loving him once more! So Ronde Barber keeps supporting Tiki, and Tiki keeps working hard and doing his best. We can learn something from the Barber brothers. We should never give up on our dreams and always believe in ourselves and each other. And guess what? Ronde was right! Tiki is now loved by many people again, just like before. Sometimes it takes time for people to see the good in others, but love and support can make a big difference! I hope you enjoyed learning about Ronde and Tiki Barber, two fantastic football players and brothers. Remember, kids, being a good friend and believing in each other is very important. And who knows?

The Ottoman sultan, pâdişâh or \\"lord of kings\\", served as the Empire's sole regent and was considered to be the embodiment of its government, though he did not always exercise complete control. The Imperial Harem was one of the most important powers of the Ottoman court. It was ruled by the Valide Sultan. On occasion, the Valide Sultan would become involved in state politics. For a time, the women of the Harem effectively controlled the state in what was termed the \\"Sultanate of Women\\". New sultans were always chosen from the sons of the previous sultan. The strong educational system of the palace school was geared towards eliminating the unfit potential heirs, and establishing support among the ruling elite for a successor. The palace schools, which would also educate the future administrators of the state, were not a single track. First, the Madrasa (Ottoman Turkish: Medrese‎) was designated for the Muslims, and educated scholars and state officials according to Islamic tradition. The financial burden of the Medrese was supported by vakifs, allowing children of poor families to move to higher social levels and income. The second track was a free boarding school for the Christians, the Enderûn, which recruited 3,000 students annually from Christian boys between eight and twenty years old from one in forty families among the communities settled in Rumelia or the Balkans, a process known as Devshirme (Devşirme).\\".

Chinese nationals were among the dead after Monday's blast at Erawan shrine in downtown Bangkok, which has left residents fearful of another attack and dealt a blow to the nation's vital tourism sector. On Thursday Thai Prime Minister Prayut Chan-O-Cha said he would not attend a memorial service for the victims at the shrine on Friday because of growing fears for his life. \\"I will not go there on the advice of my security.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","response":"If less coal is available for the steam engine, it will directly affect the power produced by the engine. Here's an explanation of how the process would be impacted: 1. With less coal loaded into the firebox, there will be less fuel to burn. This will result in a smaller fire and reduced heat generation. 2. As a consequence of the lowered heat production, the water in the boiler will not be heated to the same extent, causing less steam to be produced under high pressure. 3. With lower steam pressure available, the steam flowing into the cylinder will have less force to push the tight-fitting plunger (piston) forward. 4. As the piston receives less force, the connecting crank and rod system will not be able to push as hard, and the wheels will not turn as effectively. This will cause the locomotive to move at a slower pace (less power). 5. Consequently, the piston's ability to expel the steam back through the cylinder and up the chimney will also be affected, as there is less force and pressure to drive this process. In summary, the perturbation of having less coal directly impacts the steam engine's power output, as it leads to reduced heat generation, lesser steam pressure, and a consequent decrease in locomotive efficiency and power."},{"question":"The build-up has been years in the making. From the cartoons that many of us watched as children, we envisioned a world where machines and robots would penetrate every aspect of our lives, where each household would have a Rosie the Robot to cook, clean, and put the kids to bed. Well, for most of us that washed our own dishes last night, we know that we are not there yet. The questions are: why aren't we there yet and when will we get there? Well, the world of machines is real and it's coming. Many refer to it as Machine-to-Machine (M2M), the Internet of Things, or the Industrial Internet. All of these terms describe the same thing: automated technology that allows machines to exchange information with one another, resulting in a tangible benefit. This exchange of information is rapidly changing the way we work and live. You likely benefit from this technology every day without even knowing it. M2M applications are guiding you in your connected vehicles to the nearest Starbucks, or allowing you to remotely monitor your home from a smartphone. The applications bleed even more heavily into the enterprise space where companies are using M2M solutions to do everything from tracking the position of a high-value asset traveling through Europe to controlling the flow rate of an oil pipeline in North Dakota from an office in New York. Read related: 7 craziest things connected to the internet. So, with this technology available, why aren't we there yet? Why isn't M2M permeating every aspect of our business and personal lives yet? And, more importantly, why am I still doing my own dishes? Well, it is not due to lack of demand. Analysts and industry experts project that the Internet of Things will grow from connecting about 100 million devices today to more than two billion devices by 2021 -- representing a staggering 30% compound annual growth rate (CAGR). Do I think that this type of growth will become a reality? Yes, but there are a couple of complexities that will first need to be worked out. As a matter of fact, complexity is the first of two threats to M2M growth. Many enterprise M2M solutions require months, if not years, and a significant financial commitment to get to deployment. With those daunting hurdles facing many technology decision makers, and despite an average return on investment at around 40%, companies are deferring their M2M strategies. Obviously, this has to change in order for M2M to reach its immense promise. We need to get to a point where implementing an M2M strategy involves a matter of hours or days instead of months and years. When that is a reality, then we will start to see the realization of what M2M can be for both enterprise and consumer use. Read related: Cisco's new, smarter network for the Internet of things. The second threat to M2M growth has to do with the shift in the mobile industry towards 3G and 4G networks. At first glance, that seems a bit odd. How could enhancing the technology that M2M sits on pose a threat to its very future? As mobile carriers negotiate with limited spectrum to support 4G rollouts, 2G networks are often sacrificed. The problem created is that M2M applications not only lose support, but they face significant expenses to enter into a 3G or 4G system where their data usage does not come close to justifying the costs, not to mention the significant capital investment required for a pricey 3G or 4G compatible device. Although I believe that M2M applications will evolve to a point where a 4G network will make sense, I don't believe that we are there yet, nor will we be there for at least a couple more years. Thus, 2G will have to remain an integral part of the growth of the industry for the time being, and fortunately there are carriers that have pledged ongoing support for 2G. As momentum for the proliferation of the Internet of Things builds to forecasted levels and enterprises and individuals enter this brave new world, there will be some bumps along the road. However, it will be a much smoother and quicker ride into the future if application providers can find easy-to-implement solutions supported by networks that meet their tactical and financial objectives. When we get to that point, then you might just be able to kick back a little and let Rosie handle things. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Horn. What are highlight points for this article?","response":"1. The world of machines, or Machine-to-Machine (M2M) technology, is evolving rapidly, allowing machines to exchange information with one another, resulting in a tangible benefit in daily life and work. 2.

Implementing an M2M strategy currently takes months or years, but when this is reduced to hours or days, the potential of M2M will be realized for enterprise and consumer use. 4. The shift to 3G and 4G networks creates a problem for M2M applications, as they face significant expenses and lose support in this transition. 5.

This likely means that they were set on fire or severely damaged as a result of the intense clashes and chaos that ensued during the protest. The passage does not provide further details on the extent of the damage to the vehicles or if any were completely destroyed, but it does indicate that the situation escalated to a point where vehicles belonging to these significant international organizations were targeted and vandalized amidst the turmoil."},{"question":"How is \\"Supply and demand ratio in sell real estate Winnipeg is continuing to drive up prices.\\" said in Russian?","response":"In Russian, the sentence \\"Supply and demand ratio in sell real estate Winnipeg is continuing to drive up prices\\" would be \\"Соотношение предложения и спроса на продажу недвижимости в Виннипеге продолжает поднимать цены\\". Now, let me explain it like a story for a 5-year-old. Imagine you're playing with cars. If you have one car (which is your favourite) and all your friends want it, you might start asking for more sweets for it because everyone wants your car. This is demand. Now imagine you have many cars, but your friends don't want them so much. You might then start asking fewer sweets for each car. This is supply. So in this story, it's like if you had one super cool car (that's the houses in Winnipeg) and all your friends want it (that's people who want to buy houses). This means you can ask for lots, lots of sweets for it - which is like the prices going up in Winnipeg's real estate market."},{"question":"Question. In a national park, the number of redwoods is 20% more than the number of pines. If there are 600 pines in the national park, calculate the total number of pines and redwoods that are there. Answer. 1320 What step-by-step reasoning justifies that answer?","response":"Step 1: Determine the number of redwoods in the national park. Since the number of redwoods is 20% more than the number of pines, we'll first calculate 20% of the total number of pines. 20% of 600 pines = (20/100) * 600 = 0.2 * 600 = 120 This means there are 120 more redwoods than pines in the national park. Step 2: Add the additional redwoods to the number of pines to determine the total number of redwoods. Since there are 600 pines and 120 more redwoods, the total number of redwoods is: 600 (pines) + 120 (additional redwoods) = 720 redwoods Step 3: Calculate the total number of pines and redwoods by adding the number of pines and redwoods. So, the total number of pines and redwoods in the national park is: 600 pines + 720 redwoods = 1320 Hence, there are a total of 1320 pines and redwoods in the national park."},{"question":"Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: When you need a job very much, you may end up taking one for which you are over qualified.

Simpson's Former Agent Will Sell the White Bronco Now if Price is Right EXCLUSIVE The white Ford Bronco from O.J. Simpson's car chase stands to make its current owner a ton of dough ... if a buyer steps up to the plate. O.J.'s former sports agent, Mike Gilbert, owns the Bronco -- he bought it from A.C. Cowlings -- and sources close to him tell us he's never really been interested in selling, but only because the offers weren't good enough. We're told he's always considered it an investment, and this might be the perfect time to -- as they say -- sell high. Our sources tell us Mike's been offered 250k for the white Bronco in the past but turned it down right away. His target price is more in the 750k to 1 million range, and now that Juice's parole's been granted ... Gilbert can probably get it. We're told Mike has no emotional attachment to the Bronco, but he'll hold onto it unless he gets what he wants. If not, he'll pass it down to his kids. One more thing -- we're told there's one person he will NOT sell to ... and that's O.J. The white Bronco's currently sitting in the Alcatraz East Crime Museum in Pigeon Forge, TN. ||||| It's hard to believe, but it's now been 23 years since the most famous car chase in American history. Back on June 17, 1994, O.J. Simpson led Los Angeles police on a two-hour chase through Southern California that didn't end until the former NFL running back surrendered himself at his home in Brentwood. An estimated 95 million people across the country watched some or all of the car chase, which gives you an idea of just how big the Simpson case was back then. (To put that viewership number in perspective, 111.3 million people watched Super Bowl LI.) Of course, if you were watching the chase at home, you didn't actually get to see much of Simpson. What those 95 million viewers saw instead was 120 minutes of a white Ford Bronco being driven by Al Cowlings on Interstate 405 in Southern California. Ford's best marketing spokesman turned out to be OJ Simpson. 95 million watched his white Bronco for hours. #OJSimpson pic.twitter.com/rs2qQLIkzi — Yankees Hound (@jasphil) June 17, 2017 Thanks to the chase, the white Bronco quickly became the most infamous car in America. The white Bronco has become so ubiquitous in American culture that people still joke and talk about it to this day. Whose white Ford Bronco is that? pic.twitter.com/IQ2R8jINfJ — Tracy Gamble (@TracyGamble) June 5, 2017 Believe it or not, 23 years after the chase, the white Bronco once owned by Cowlings is still in nearly perfect shape. In an interview with ESPN.com's Darren Rovell, Simpson's former agent Mike Gilbert revealed where the car's been for the past 23 years and where it is now. Shortly after the chase, a company in Minnesota offered to buy the car, but Cowlings ended up turning the deal down because of what the company wanted to do with the Bronco. \\"We found out that the company was going to rent the vehicle to a company in L.A. called Grave Line Tours that visited famous graves,\\" Gilbert said. \\"They were going to re-enact the chase with the Bronco and then take people to Nicole's grave. The trial hadn't taken place yet, and we didn't want people thinking anyone associated with O.J. did this.\\" After that deal fell through, Gilbert and two other men decided to buy the car from Cowlings for 75,000. After Gilbert's purchase, the car ended up sitting in a parking garage for the next 17 years (1995-2012), where it was rarely used. According to Gilbert, there's only been 20 miles added to the odometer since the O.J. chase in 1994. Gilbert did get a few offers from people who wanted to buy the car -- one offer was as high as 275,000 -- but he turned them all down, because he couldn't justify selling one of the most famous cars in American history. \\"After the limo that JFK was shot in, this is the second-most-viewed car in American history,\\" Gilbert said. After 17 years in storage, a man representing the Luxor Hotel in Las Vegas found out about the Bronco and immediately wanted to use it in a memorabilia show. The two sides worked out a deal, and at some point in 2012, the Bronco went on display for the first time since O.J.'s chase. The Bronco stayed in Vegas until last year, when Gilbert finally had it moved back to his garage in California. For anyone out there hoping to see the Bronco one day, you actually can do that right now. The car is currently on display at the Alcatraz East Crime Museum in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee. \\"When I was working with ESPN on the documentary 'O.J.: Made in America,' I knew there would be an increased curiosity surrounding this case,\\" Gilbert said in a statement provided to CBS Sports by the museum. \\"Not only would people learn details they never heard, but there would also be a new generation learning about it for the first time. This partnership with Alcatraz East has been important to me. I wanted the Bronco in a place where it would be protected, as well as be part of a bigger story- a part of history.\\" The fact that the Bronco is on display again this year is almost ironic, because this could also be the year that the man who made it famous could get released from jail. Simpson is scheduled to have a parole hearing in July and many legal experts believe that he actually has a chance of being released. Simpson has been in jail since 2008 when he was convicted of several charges -- including kidnapping and armed robbery -- following an incident in Vegas. The Hall of Fame running back could spent as many as 33 years in jail if he doesn't get parole. By the way, Simpson also owned a white Ford Bronco, but that wasn't the one involved in the chase. Simpson's Bronco was seen as a key piece of evidence after investigators found blood spats smeared on the \\"console, door, steering wheel and carpeting.\\" As ESPN notes, Simpson's Bronco was destroyed shortly after the trial. Anyway, if you're feeling nostalgic for the nationwide viewing event of the '90s, you can relive the O.J. Simpson chase below. |||||","response":"Former sports agent of O.J.

Since the created electromagnet has a magnetic field with the ability to attract or repel other magnetic materials, it can be used in numerous applications, such as lifting heavy objects, electric motors, generators, transformers, and magnetic switches, among others. In order to optimize the efficiency and performance of the electromagnet, it may be necessary to adjust the strength of the magnet. This can be done by controlling the power source, modifying the current, or altering the number of wire turns and the core material. Once the desired performance is achieved, the electromagnet can be implemented to complete the designated task. When the electric current is turned off or disconnected from the power source, the magnetism ceases, and the electromagnet returns to a non-magnetized state, allowing for easy and safe handling."},{"question":"Article: Visit the Facebook website using any web browser.

There may be a mix of joy and confusion, considering both doctors previously ruled out pregnancy as a cause for her stomach pains. It would be reasonable for the couple to seek medical advice again, considering the conflicting information they had received earlier. They may want to confirm the pregnancy with a doctor or through further tests and have a more accurate assessment of her condition. In addition, they could discuss her previous diagnosis (gall bladder issues and gastritis) with the doctor to understand if the pregnancy could be related to her earlier symptoms. The couple may also need to consider dietary and lifestyle changes recommended for a healthy pregnancy, avoiding certain foods and habits that may trigger pain or affect the growing fetus. Overall, after taking the pregnancy test and receiving a faint positive result, the couple may need to reassess their initial medical advice, seek confirmation of the pregnancy, and make adjustments in their lives to ensure the health and well-being of both the mother and the unborn child. This could involve attending prenatal appointments, alter their daily routines, and seek support from friends, family, or healthcare professionals as they navigate the unexpected pregnancy journey."},{"question":"Until the rain clouds moved in, I was watching the juxtaposition of two planets that appeared to be converging on the same spot in the early-morning eastern sky.

A step-by-step solution is:","response":"While we cannot definitively conclude that \\"The man is cooking Thanksgiving dinner,\\" we can ascertain the probability based on the available information. Here's our step-by-step reasoning: 1. The sentence tells us that a man is stuffing a fowl, which is a type of bird. On Thanksgiving, it's traditional to serve a stuffed bird, usually a turkey. The fact that the man is stuffing a bird aligns with the possibility of preparing a Thanksgiving dinner. 2. The man is using ingredients from a blue bowl. While the color of the bowl is irrelevant, using ingredients for the stuffing again suggests that he may indeed be preparing a Thanksgiving dinner. However, we must consider that the information provided does not explicitly mention \\"Thanksgiving\\" nor specify the type of bird (e.g., turkey versus chicken). Further, it's possible that the man could stuff a bird on occasions other than Thanksgiving.

Modeled after the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin – and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 — the ADA is an “equal opportunity” law for people with disabilities. More than a quarter-century on, and despite further work to be done, the ADA has so positively affected how people with disabilities are treated and perceived in America that the notion that laws once existed to keep physically and cognitively challenged people indoors and out of sight seems scarcely believable. But it was the case — and not so long ago. Beginning in the late 1800s, statutes known as “unsightly beggar ordinances,” aka “ugly laws,” were enacted in some American cities to rid public spaces of what Chicago Alderman James Peevey euphemistically referred to as “street obstructions”: By street obstructions, Peevey didn’t mean food carts, construction materials, roadblocks or potholes. He meant beggars, such as the ones described in the Tribune as “the one-legged individual who, with drooping eye and painfully lugubrious countenance, holds forth his hat for pennies” or “the fellows who yell ‘ba-na-naas'” and “the woman with two sick children who was drawn through the carding-machine in a woolen mill, and who grinds ‘Mollie Darling’ incessantly on a hurdy-gurdy on a street corner.” Following the example of San Francisco, which had pioneered the legislation in 1867, Peevey helped pass a law in 1881 imposing fines (or stints in the poorhouse) on all who were “diseased, maimed, mutilated, or in any way deformed, so as to be an unsightly or disgusting object,” yet dared beg, panhandle, or otherwise make nuisances of themselves in public. Among other cities, Omaha, Columbus, Cleveland, and Portland, Oregon followed suit, all passing ugly laws using virtually identical language. In a discussion of Susan M. Schweik’s The Ugly Laws: Disability in Public (2009), reviewer Shannon Sommer encapsulates the social and economic developments leading up to these measures: Schweik discusses in detail several factors which combined to create the perfect storm for the emergence of ugly law in America at this time. These include: the formation of Charity Organization Societies, the rise or eugenics and state institutions, an increasing focus on using urban planning to create beautiful cities, increasing immigration at a time when there were few restrictions placed on immigration, the large number of soldiers injured in the Civil War which had ended just a few years earlier, temperance and prohibition, and the increasing industrialization of society with resulting industrial-related injuries. Schweik notes that though the passage of new ugly laws ceased by the beginning of World War I and enforcement of existing statutes dwindled thereafter, they remained on the books until well into the latter half of the 20th century: Schweik found that the last known arrest under an ugly law occurred in Omaha, NE in 1974 when a policeman wanted to arrest a homeless man but had no basis for arrest. After searching the city code and finding that Omaha’s Ugly Law was still on the books he was able to take the man into custody on the basis that the man had “marks and scars on his body.” Prosecutors refused to press charges in this case. Schweik recounts one prosecutor pointing out that “criminal prosecution under this law would require the impossible: courtroom proof “that someone is ugly.” Solution:","response":"The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), passed in 1990, is a comprehensive civil rights legislation that prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities and guarantees equal opportunities in employment, access to goods and services, and participation in state and local government programs."},{"question":"Given the question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: Alec Ramsey is aboard the steamer Drake off the coast of North Africa, where he sees a wild black stallion being forced into a makeshift stable and heavily restrained by ropes leading to his halter. Captivated by the horse, Alec later sneaks to the horse to feed him some sugar cubes, but he is caught by the horse's supposed owner, who tells him in Arabic to stay away from Shetan and shoves the boy away. Later in his bunk, Alec's father shows Alec his winnings from a card game and gives him a pocket knife and a small statue of Bucephalus, and tells the story of how Alexander the Great became Bucephalus' master. Later that night, Alec is thrown out of his bunk; the ship has started to capsize. In the chaos, Alec grabs his knife and his Bucephalus statue, and makes his way to the black stallion and manages to free him. The stallion then jumps into the sea. Alec himself is swept overboard by a gigantic wave. Once in the water, he swims toward the stallion and managed to grab hold of the ropes of the stallion's restraints. Alec wakes on the shore of a deserted island and starts to explore. He finds the stallion caught in his restraints with the ropes stuck between the rocks. With his knife, Alec manages to free the stallion once again and the stallion runs away. For a time, the two keep their distance. Alec discovers means to survive by catching fish and seaweed. As Alec suddenly faces a cobra eye to eye, the Black comes to the rescue and kills the snake, only to run off again. By now, Alec decides to try to get closer to the horse and offer him some seaweed. The hungry stallion finds himself unable to resist, but visibly struggles with his distrust for humans. Eventually, the hunger wins and he takes Alec's offer; their bond has been sealed and the two are now inseparable. Alec even manages to ride the unbroken horse, after many times falling off the horse. One day, a fishing ship arrives, rescuing both Alec and the stallion. Back home, Alec is given a hero's welcome. The Black has a temporary home in Alec's back... The answer is:","response":"What challenges does Alec face in developing a relationship with the wild black stallion, Shetan, and how does their bond eventually form while stranded on a deserted island?"},{"question":"1.

The word galaxy is derived from the Greek \\"\\", literally \\"milky\\", a reference to the Milky Way. Galaxies range in size from dwarfs with just a few billion stars to giants with one hundred trillion stars, each orbiting its galaxy's center of mass. Galaxies are categorized according to their visual morphology as elliptical, spiral and irregular. Many galaxies are thought to have black holes at their active centers. The Milky Way's central black hole, known as Sagittarius A*, has a mass four million times greater than the Sun. As of March 2016, GN-z11 is the oldest and most distant observed galaxy with a comoving distance of 32 billion light-years from Earth, and observed as it existed just 400 million years after the Big Bang. - In astronomy, minimum mass is the lower-bound calculated mass of observed objects such as planets, stars and binary systems, nebulae, and black holes. - A star is a luminous sphere of plasma held together by its own gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth. Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the brightest of which gained proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. However, most of the stars in the Universe, including all stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way, are invisible to the naked eye from Earth. Indeed, most are invisible from Earth even through the most powerful telescopes. - HD 101930 is a dim 8th magnitude star located approximately 95 light years away in the constellation of Centaurus.

One of the largest constellations, Centaurus was included among the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer Ptolemy, and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations. In Greek mythology, Centaurus represents a centaur; a creature that is half human, half horse (another constellation named after a centaur is one from the zodiac: Sagittarius). Notable stars include Alpha Centauri, the nearest star system to the Solar System, its neighbour in the sky Beta Centauri, and V766 Centauri, one of the largest stars yet discovered.

Tom and Eva have 4 children, so there are 6 people in their family (Tom, Eva, and their 4 children). In total, there are 8 + 6 = 14 people in the beach house. Step 2: Determine the number of people in the pool. There are 16 legs in the pool. Since each person has 2 legs, there are 16 / 2 = 8 people in the pool. Step 3: Determine how many people are NOT in the pool. To find the number of people not in the pool, we subtract the number of people in the pool from the total number of people in the beach house. 14 people (total) - 8 people (in the pool) = 6 people So, there are 6 people not in the pool."},{"question":"Remove the spaces from the following sentence: The mower always returns to its working position immediately as a result of its own weight.","response":"To remove the spaces from the provided sentence, we simply need to remove the separation between each word. After removing the spaces, your sentence transforms as mentioned: \\"Themoweralwaysreturnstoitsworkingpositionimmediatelyasaresultofitsownweight.\\" In this version, all letters from different words join together to form a single group of characters. While this doesn't lend itself to easy reading in English as we're used to separate words by spaces, it helps in certain computer science contexts. For instance, URL structures commonly exclude spaces, as do many programming languages. So in the context of creating a URL or identifier that represents your sentence, this version would be much more appropriate. Remember, manipulating spaces like this isn't always the best idea if things need to be legibly read by humans. In programming, URLs, or data encryption contexts this is fine, but it's generally not a good idea for everyday writing or website content.

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"European comics studies began with Töpffer's theories of his own work in the 1840s, which emphasized panel transitions and the visual–verbal combination. No further progress was made until the 1970s. Pierre Fresnault-Deruelle then took a semiotics approach to the study of comics, analyzing text–image relations, page-level image relations, and image discontinuities, or what Scott McCloud later dubbed \\"closure\\". In 1987, Henri Vanlier introduced the term multicadre, or \\"multiframe\\", to refer to the comics a page as a semantic unit. By the 1990s, theorists such as Benoît Peeters and Thierry Groensteen turned attention to artists' poïetic creative choices. Thierry Smolderen and Harry Morgan have held relativistic views of the definition of comics, a medium that has taken various, equally valid forms over its history. Morgan sees comics as a subset of \\"les littératures dessinées\\" (or \\"drawn literatures\\"). French theory has come to give special attention to the page, in distinction from American theories such as McCloud's which focus on panel-to-panel transitions. Since the mid-2000s, Neil Cohn has begun analyzing how comics are understood using tools from cognitive science, extending beyond theory by using actual psychological and neuroscience experiments. This work has argued that sequential images and page layouts both use separate rule-bound \\"grammars\\" to be understood that extend beyond panel-to-panel transitions and categorical distinctions of types of layouts, and that the brain's comprehension of comics is similar to comprehending other domains, such as language and music.\\"?

Now, scientists have uncovered evidence that they say indicates the 8-foot wall of water was dwarfed by one as much as 30 feet high that came centuries before. The discovery of the Makauwahi sinkhole on Kauai in the late '90s ultimately led to the new theory: A little more than 6 feet below the surface of the collapsed limestone cave was a sediment layer flavored by the sea: It contained bits of coral, mollusk shells, and sand. Its mouth, however, was about 325 feet from shore and blocked by a 23-foot wall, according to a press release. The paleoecologist who found it couldn't reconcile those figures with Hawaii’s current tsunami evacuation maps, which were based on the 1946 tsunami. That one was triggered by an 8.6-magnitude quake in the Aleutian Islands and would have sent water only about 8 feet up the sinkhole's wall. But Japan's devastating 2011 earthquake led scientists to do some new modeling. Per the study, they determined that an Aleutian quake with a \\"moment magnitude of ~9.25\\" could create a wall of water between 26 and 30 feet—enough to make its way into the sinkhole. Radiocarbon dating of marine deposits from the sinkhole, Sedanka Island in the Aleutians, and along the West Coast indicate a tsunami occurred between 350 and 575 years ago, though the dating doesn't prove it was a single tsunami. Still, geophysicist Gerard Fryer says he's \\"absolutely convinced it's a tsunami, and it had to be a monster tsunami\\"; he has worked with Honolulu to update its evacuation maps to account for such a monster. \\"The revisions to maps are extensive, in some cases twice as far inland,\\" the study's lead author tells Scientific American. (An amazing tsunami story: Family finds girl lost decade ago in a tsunami.) Expand this summary.","response":"A long time ago in Hawaii, there was a really big and scary wave called a tsunami. This tsunami was much bigger than any other one we know about in Hawaii's history. It was so powerful that it created a big hole, called the Makauwahi sinkhole, which is now filled with bits of coral, seashells, and sand. Scientists wanted to know how such a big wave could have happened and how high the water went during the tsunami. They looked at some other big earthquakes and tsunamis that happened in the past, like the one in Japan in 2011, and learned a lot about how big tsunamis happen. They figured out that a huge earthquake with a strength of around 9.25 might have happened in the Aleutian Islands (a group of islands far away), and that could have made the big scary wave that hit Hawaii. To find clues about when this tsunami happened, they did a special test called \\"radiocarbon dating\\" on the stuff they found in the sinkhole. This test helps them to know how old these things are. The test suggested that the giant tsunami happened between 350-575 years ago. Because of this discovery, scientists and people who help keep everyone safe have changed the maps that show where it's safe to be during a tsunami. They have made sure that people can now go further away from the ocean to be safe if a big tsunami were to happen again. So, we learned that a long time ago, a big earthquake created a huge and scary tsunami in Hawaii, and this discovery helps us know where it's safe to be if another big tsunami happens in the future."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: What is the final step of the following process: - Water comes into contact with something made of iron - The water combines with carbon dioxide in the air to form carbonic acid - As the acid is formed, the iron starts to dissolve - Some of the water breaks down into hydrogen and oxygen - The free oxygen and dissolved iron bond together Answer:","response":"The final step of the process described is the formation of iron oxide, commonly known as rust. To better understand this process, let's break down the individual steps mentioned and examine them more closely: 1. Water comes into contact with something made of iron: When water, either in the form of liquid, vapor, or droplets, comes into contact with an iron surface, it sets the stage for a chemical reaction to occur. This reaction is the first step towards the formation of rust. 2. The water combines with carbon dioxide in the air to form carbonic acid: As water is exposed to the surrounding air, it absorbs carbon dioxide. This dissolved carbon dioxide then reacts with water to form carbonic acid (H2CO3). This weak acid is now present on the iron surface and starts reacting with it. 3. As the acid is formed, the iron starts to dissolve: The carbonic acid reacts with the iron, causing it to dissolve slowly. The dissolution of iron leads to the formation of ferrous ions (Fe2+). 4. Some of the water breaks down into hydrogen and oxygen: In the presence of carbonic acid and dissolved iron, water molecules can break down into their constituent elements: hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2). The hydrogen may either escape as gas, or it may react with other species present, such as oxygen to form water again. 5. The free oxygen and dissolved iron bond together: The free oxygen present reacts with the dissolved iron (Fe2+) to form iron oxide or rust (Fe2O3·nH2O). This compound is reddish-brown and is typically what we associate with rust. In conclusion, the final step of this process is the formation of iron oxide (Fe2O3·nH2O) or rust, which is a result of the reaction between free oxygen and dissolved iron (Fe2+) on the iron surface. This process, known as oxidation, causes the iron to corrode and weaken over time, and is a major concern for the maintenance and preservation of iron structures and objects."},{"question":"Write a \\"(2).\\" movie review ( (1). negative.

The range of evolutionary theories during \\"the eclipse of Darwinism\\" included forms of \\"saltationism\\" in which new species were thought to arise through \\"jumps\\" rather than gradual adaptation, forms of orthogenesis claiming that species had an inherent tendency to change in a particular direction, and forms of neo-Lamarckism in which inheritance of acquired characteristics led to progress. The minority view of August Weismann, that natural selection was the only mechanism, was called neo-Darwinism. It was thought that the rediscovery of Mendelian inheritance invalidated Darwin's views. Question: What was meant by the term saltationism?","response":"Saltationism is an evolutionary theory that posits that new species arise through sudden, large-scale changes or \\"jumps\\" rather than gradual adaptation through small, incremental variations. The term is derived from the Latin word \\"saltus,\\" which means \\"leap\\" or \\"jump.\\" This theory emerged during the period referred to as \\"the eclipse of Darwinism\\" in the late 19th and early 20th centuries when several alternative theories to Charles Darwin's natural selection gained prominence. In contrast to Darwin's theory of gradualism, which emphasizes the slow, continuous, and cumulative process of evolution through the accumulation of small inherited variations, saltationism proposes that evolution can happen rapidly. Proponents of saltationism believed that these significant leaps or jumps led to the formation of new species, often in response to environmental changes and pressures. During the eclipse of Darwinism, saltationism was one of the several alternative theories of evolution that sought to challenge Darwin's original ideas. Other theories included orthogenesis, which proposed that species had an inherent tendency to change in a particular direction regardless of environmental influences, and neo-Lamarckism, which supported the idea that the inheritance of acquired characteristics could lead to evolutionary progress. It is crucial to note that although saltationism offered a different perspective on the mechanisms of evolution, it did not entirely reject the principle of evolution itself. The saltationist viewpoint mainly questioned the dominance of natural selection as the primary driving force behind evolution, rather than opposing the concept of species change over time. With the rediscovery of Gregor Mendel's work on genetics and the establishment of the modern synthesis of evolutionary theory in the mid-20th century, saltationism and other alternative theories lost prominence. The integration of genetics and Darwin's theory of natural selection into a cohesive framework known as neo-Darwinism ultimately superseded them."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Give me the correct facts to answer this: where was avril lavigne born?

It is the zone of a church accessible by the laity. - A parish is a church territorial unit constituting a division within a diocese. A parish is under the pastoral care and clerical jurisdiction of a parish priest, who might be assisted by one or more curates, and who operates from a parish church. Historically, a parish often covered the same geographical area as a manor (its association with the parish church remaining paramount). - Minor basilica (in plural) is a title given to some Roman Catholic church buildings. According to canon law, no church building can be honoured with the title of basilica unless by apostolic grant or from immemorial custom. Presently, the authorising decree is granted by the Pope through the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments. - The Roman Catholic Diocese of Orlando is a Roman Catholic diocese in Florida. It was established on June 18, 1968. Prior to that the Central Florida area was part of the Diocese of St. Augustine. Today the diocese encompasses nine counties including Orange, Osceola, Seminole, Marion, Lake, Volusia, Brevard, Polk, and Sumter, a total of about . William Borders, the first Bishop of the diocese, claimed in 1969 to Pope Paul VI that the then-active 1917 Code of Canon Law placed newly explored territory under the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the port of departure, making the Diocese of Orlando responsible for the moon following the flight of Apollo 11. If true, the total area of the diocese would be , making it the largest Catholic diocese in existence. In 2010, the diocese contained 81 parishes, 10 missions, and 37 schools. St. James Cathedral serves as the seat of the diocese. Within the diocese are two minor basilicas, Mary, Queen of the Universe Shrine, a basilica which ministers to Catholic tourists, and St. Paul's in Daytona Beach. - The Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments is the congregation of the Roman Curia that handles most affairs relating to liturgical practices of the Latin Church as distinct from the Eastern Catholic Churches and also some technical matters relating to the Sacraments. Its functions were originally exercised by the Sacred Congregation of Rites, set up in January 1588 by Pope Sixtus V. - A pastor is usually an ordained leader of a Christian congregation. When used as an ecclesiastical styling or title, the term may be abbreviated to \\"Pr\\" (singular) or \\"Ps\\" (plural). A pastor also gives advice and counsel to people from the community or congregation. - A parish church (or parochial church) in Christianity is the church which acts as the religious centre of a parish. In many parts of the world, especially in rural areas, the parish church may play a significant role in community activities, often allowing its premises to be used for non-religious community events. The church building reflects this status, and there is considerable variety in the size and style of parish churches. Many villages in Europe have churches that date back to the Middle Ages, but all periods of architecture are represented. - The Basilica of the National Shrine of Mary , Queen of the Universe is a Latin Rite basilica located in Orlando , Florida at 8300 Vineland Avenue . It was built to service the large number of Catholic tourists who visit the attractions in the Greater Orlando area . While it is a 2,000 seat church of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Orlando and provides Mass for the faithful , it has also become a regional tourist attraction . In 2009 , it was designated as the 63rd minor basilica in the United States . Since it is not a parish , no regular sacraments are performed , and no weekly bulletins are distributed . The Shrine consists of the main church , the Rosary Garden , the Mother & Child Outdoor Chapel , the Blessed Sacrament Chapel , the Shrine Museum , and a gift shop . - The Latin word basilica (derived from Greek , lit. \\"royal stoa\\", serving as the tribunal chamber of a king) has three distinct applications in modern English. The word was originally used to describe an ancient Roman public building where courts were held, as well as serving other official and public functions. To a large extent these were the town halls of ancient Roman life. The basilica was centrally located in every Roman town, usually adjacent to the main forum. These buildings, an example of which is the Basilica Ulpia, were rectangular, and often had a central nave and aisles, usually with a slightly raised platform and an apse at each of the two ends, adorned with a statue perhaps of the emperor, while the entrances were from the long sides. - The pope (from \\"pappas\\", a child's word for \\"father\\") is the Bishop of Rome and, therefore, the leader of the worldwide Catholic Church. The primacy of the Roman bishop is largely derived from his role as the traditional successor to Saint Peter, to whom Jesus is supposed to have given the keys of Heaven and the powers of \\"binding and loosing\\", naming him as the \\"rock\\" upon which the church would be built. The current pope is Francis, who was elected on 13 March 2013, succeeding Benedict XVI. - The word diocese is derived from the Greek term \\"\\" meaning \\"administration\\". When now used in an ecclesiastical sense, it refers to a territorial unit of administration. In the Western Church, the district is under the supervision of a bishop (who may have assistant bishops to help him or her) and is divided into parishes under the care of priests; but in the Eastern Church, the word denotes the area under the jurisdiction of a patriarch and the bishops under his jurisdiction administer parishes.

While attending Tufts, the band lived at 139 College Avenue in Somerville, Massachusetts., Alternative rock (also called alternative music, alt-rock or simply alternative) is a genre of rock music that emerged from the independent music underground of the 1980s and became widely popular in the 1990s and 2000s. In this instance, the word \\"alternative\\" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream rock music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, \\"alternative\\" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk)., Tufts University is a private research university incorporated in the municipality of Medford, Massachusetts, United States.

Known in Latin as Pectinatella magnifica, it’s OK if you call the bryozoan found in a pond near Lost Lagoon by its less formal name — a “chunk of goo.” article continues below Or at least that’s how Kathleen Stormont of the Stanley Park Ecology Society describes the bryozoans that were discovered a couple of weeks ago in the biofiltration pond a few metres away from the causeway. “It’s kind of like three-day-old Jello — a bit firm but gelatinous,” she says. If you don’t want to be freaked out, think of it as a peeled giant lychee fruit that can grow to the size of a deflated basketball. For those who aren’t queasy, let your thoughts turn to what a brain or kidney might look like if it had evolved under water. Only one scientific journal mentions bryozoan found in British Columbia, and that was in the Gulf Islands, the society says. More recently, a bryozoan was chanced upon in Lake Okanagan. “They’re a colony of tiny organisms that like to hang out together,” Stormont says. “They have a very ancient lineage that hasn’t changed for hundreds of thousands of years.” A single organism on its own is easy prey. Stick together and you’re not as likely to be eaten. “If you have a predator there’s safety in numbers,” she says. Someone “stumbled upon” a bryozoan in the pond during a recent 24-hour Bio-Blitz, when a mass of amateur nature lovers helped a group of experts catalogue all manner of species living in the park. “We looked at things we don’t normally look at,” says Celina Starnes, the ecology society’s public education and outreach manager. Bryozoans are hard to spot because they are camouflaged in the murky water. Once one was noticed, however, the pond was found to be full of them. “It’s kind of like three-day-old Jello — a bit firm but gelatinous.\\" - Martha Perkins Starnes says bryozoans are fresh-water animals that are believed to have originated in the Mississippi. They’ve been migrating westward ever since. The biofiltration pond is obviously a perfect habitat for them. It was created a dozen years ago to filter the pollutants found in the runoff from the traffic-congested causeway before they hit Lost Lagoon. “What the bryozoans like is that there is little to no current and high nutrient levels,” she says. Another fun find during the Bio-Blitz was goblin moss. “It looks like any old moss until you turn the lights off,” Starnes says. “It has a green luminescence.” Stormont says the discovery of the bryozoan has been “a great education for us. There are these weird and wonderful things that exist and aren't commonly encountered.” The results from the Bio-Blast, which was part of the Canada 150 celebration, will be uploaded to the iNaturalist.org database. ||||| The interactive transcript could not be loaded.

Recently, one such blob was found near the Lost Lagoon in Stanley Park, Vancouver. While it might not look like something from Earth, the Blob is very much alive—and it contains multitudes. According to the Vancouver Courier, the Stanley Park Ecology Society found the alien-looking lumps—which are actually colonies of tiny marine invertebrates called Pectinatella magnifica—in the pond back in mid-August. Upon further inspection, the team found the pond was actually rife with these weirdos. Advertisement Pectinatella magnifica are members of the phylum Bryozoa, which dates back roughly 500 million years. Here’s how the Blob forms: one tiny Pectinella magnifica will reproduce asexually, and the process will keep repeating itself until there’s an entire colony. Since Pectinella magnifica are kind of gross and no one wants to be their friend, they have to make their own. Gross as it may look, the Blob is Actually Good. It eats microscopic organisms in the water, filtering it as it feeds. According to the Missouri Department of Conservation, a freshwater Bryozoan presence “usually indicates good water quality.” Advertisement Sure, this living fossil of a Blob may not be a puppy. Still, it plays an important role in its ecosystem and we should all respect it. From afar.

The answer is:","response":"Amédée-François Frézier was a prominent French polymath born in 1682 in Chambéry, Savoy, France. He was an accomplished engineer, mathematician, explorer, and spy throughout his life. Born to parents Pierre-Louis Frézier, Amédée-François was introduced to the academic world early on. With a strong foundation in these distinct fields, Frézier made invaluable contributions to his country throughout his lifetime. His expertise in the field of engineering enabled him to design and construct remarkable structures, many of which still exist today. As a mathematician, Frézier advanced the field, contributing significantly to the development of analytical geometry. In addition to his skills in engineering and mathematics, Amédée-François Frézier was also an intrepid explorer. His journeys took him far and wide, where he ventured on daring expeditions to uncharted territories like the South Pacific. As an explorer, Frézier developed a reputation as a skilled cartographer, drawing remarkably accurate maps of the places he visited. In fact, his work was highly regarded and used by fellow travelers and navigators during the era. His final and perhaps most intriguing occupation was that of a spy. Frézier put his exceptional skills to good use, gathering intelligence for the French government and reporting on military, economic, and political matters. This expertise proved invaluable in an age of increasing international political and military strife across Europe. Frézier's life was marked by his ability to balance numerous professions, ultimately leading to a successful and impactful career. Amédée-François Frézier passed away on October 26, 1773, in Brest, Britanny, France.
