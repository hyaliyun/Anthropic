Most of what you see in these movies is false. What you don't know is that cloning could be dangerous, to the clone and to our society as a whole. I think human cloning is wrong mainly for four reasons. What about identity? Humans are promised the right to their own personalities. What would happen if we ignore those rights by giving them someone else's genetic identity? True, Cloning may prevent people from possessing their identities. Also, these is a large power struggle here. Cloning means a degree of power and controls over another person's physical identity and that ignores their rights and their only personalities. The person doing the cloning would have more power than any parent would have. Cloning would also deal with killing embryos . You might not have known, but Dolly, the sheep that was cloned in 1996, was one of over 200 sheep embryos and hers was the only embryo that survived. The rest died or were thrown away. Imagine if the failure rate was that high when we started to clone humans. cloning means running the risk of wasting too much effort Cloning someone, at this present time, would be extremely dangerous to the birth mother and the clone. In studies done on cows, 4 out of 12 birth mothers died. There is a very high failure rate, which is shown in the cloning of Dolly. Even if you had a few good embryos, failures have been noticeable in animal tests. So, should we work ahead in the world of cloning? I say no. the risks are greater than the benefits.

Bobby recently received a large order of potatoes from a neighboring city. Because of this order, Bobby has dramatically increased the amount of fertilizer he is using on his farm. Kenny mainly grows tomatoes, which are not in season right now, so his use of fertilizer is currently low. Over the past month there has been a large amount of rain falling on both Bobby and Kenny's farms. and a hint : Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf. Please answer this question : Who will ultimately cause less oxygen to be used up in the ponds near their farm? The answer is:","response":"Kenny will ultimately cause less oxygen to be used up in the ponds near their farm. Step 1: Understand the situation Bobby and Kenny are farmers with ponds downstream. Bobby recently increased fertilizer usage due to a large potato order. Kenny's fertilizer usage is low since his tomato crop isn't in season. There has been a lot of rain on both farms. Step 2: Consider the hint The hint suggests that rain dissolves fertilizer into the soil, and runoff carries it to bodies of water like ponds. Nitrogen in the fertilizer causes algae to grow, which uses up carbon dioxide in the water. Decomposers consume the dead algae and use up oxygen, creating dead zones with low oxygen levels. Step 3: Compare fertilizer usage Bobby's fertilizer usage has increased, leading to more nitrogen in the runoff and likely more algae growth. Kenny's fertilizer usage is low, meaning less nitrogen in the runoff and less algae growth. Step 4: Determine the impact on oxygen levels More algae growth means more oxygen is consumed by decomposers when they break down the dead algae. Therefore, Bobby's increased fertilizer usage results in more oxygen being used up in the ponds downstream. Since Kenny is using less fertilizer, his farm contributes less to the depletion of oxygen in the ponds. Conclusion: Kenny will cause less oxygen to be used up in the ponds near their farm due to his low fertilizer usage."},{"question":"Premise: \\"A man is performing in front of a crowd.\\" Hypothesis: \\"The people are enjoying a performance.\\" Do we know that the hypothesis entailed by the premise?

In July 1999, Jaojoby was named Goodwill Ambassador to the United Nations Population Fund and supported the United Nations' activities in Madagascar related to raising awareness of sexually transmitted diseases, unintended pregnancy, and other concerns relevant to the Malagasy youth population. The lyrics of his songs commonly address social issues, typified by a track on E! Tiako that encourages the use of condoms to avoid contracting HIV/AIDS.Aza Arianao was recorded over five days in the summer of 2000 and released the following year. In the wake of its success, Jaojoby performed at a political rally to an audience of 50,000 partisans of candidate Marc Ravalomanana less than a month before the divisive 2001 presidential elections that nearly resulted in the secession of the island's coastal provinces. Jaojoby's 2004 follow-up album Malagasy, which was recorded in semi-live conditions on the island of Réunion in a small venue before an audience of the artist's friends, featured lyrics that sought to promote optimism and national reconciliation; the artist announced that he would not involve himself in national politics in the future.

The hydrogen bonds in liquid water constantly break and reform as the water molecules tumble past one another. As water cools, its molecular motion slows and the molecules move gradually closer to one another. The density of any liquid increases as its temperature decreases. For most liquids, this continues as the liquid freezes and the solid state is denser than the liquid state. However, water behaves differently. It actually reaches its highest density at about 4°C. Please answer this question : Which person's beer has molecules farther apart? A:","response":"A: Joe's beer has molecules farther apart. Step1: Understanding the given situation. In the given situation, Joe has been carrying around a can of beer for a while and Sally just got a fresh cold beer from the refrigerator. It is implied that since Joe has been holding the beer for some time, it is not as cold as Sally's freshly grabbed one. Step 2: Analyzing the properties of water and using the provided hint. According to the hint, the density of water increases as its temperature decreases until it reaches its highest density at around 4°C. Consequently, as the temperature of water in the beer decreases, the distance between molecules gets shorter. Step 3: Comparing the temperatures of Joe's and Sally's beers. Supposing that the party is held indoors at room temperature, Joe's beer is warmer than Sally's freshly taken cold beer. Step 4: Applying the properties of water to the present situation.

Whilst they are ridiculously expensive compared with most other nail polishes (AU39), they are still much more affordable than the AU1,000,000,000 a handbag costs (or so I estimate as I have never actually priced one). After seeing swatches of Peridot online, I knew that baby would one day be mine. The other two polishes in the collection - Quartz and Graphite - did not excite me the way Peridot did. That was until I read this review of Graphite on the Polish Police. Suddenly, Graphite was on my radar. It was stuck in my head like an ear worm; another baby, soon to be adopted. I argued with myself for about a month on whether to get these polishes or not. Could I really spend nearly 80 on nail polish. It did seem rather excessive to me. Then, Myers sent me a 10 voucher for my birthday and I got a 30 voucher for doing a survey so the decision was made. For 38 of my own money (less than the cost of two OPI's!) I became the proud owner of Peridot and Graphite. Here is my review of Graphite. Graphite is the most stunningly intriguing nail polish I have ever owned. In the bottle it looks a little bit dull and boring - grey and bland. But on the nail it is completely different. In some lights it is silvery, others a more gun metal grey, and in others it has almost a goldish tone to it. It is super sparkly, yet is not a glitter polish - though in saying that it appears more glitter than shimmer. It is quite opaque. Two coats and you can't see the nail line. In the photos below I have actually applied three coats (plus an addition two top coats of clear) because I was going to a wedding and I wanted it to be perfect. But ordinarily two would be sufficient. Question: After this story, the writer probably: Options: - not enough information - Adopts a baby with an ear worm - Uses three coats of nail polish all the time - Looks for more surveys on brands she likes Answer:","response":"Looks for more surveys on brands she likes"},{"question":"Given the question \\"What is Julie's opinion about going by sea?\\" and the answer \\"Though it isn't fast, it is relaxing.\\", write a conversation that might have happened.

Yes; Given those answer options, answer the question: Question: when was the first nfl madden game released? Would \\"Among the game's realistic features include sophisticated playbooks and player statistics, and voice commentary that allows players to hear the game as if it were a real TV broadcast.\\" be a reasonable answer? A:","response":"Given the two answer options provided, neither \\"no\\" nor \\"yes\\" can sufficiently provide the information requested in the question. However, I will answer the question in a more detailed manner to provide a better understanding of the context. The first NFL Madden game, known as John Madden Football, was released in 1988. It was developed by Electronic Arts (EA) and marked the beginning of the long-running and popular video game franchise. The game was initially released on the Apple II computer, which was followed by releases on other platforms over the years. The statement \\"Among the game's realistic features include sophisticated playbooks and player statistics, and voice commentary that allows players to hear the game as if it were a real TV broadcast\\" can be considered a reasonable answer as it sheds light on some key features that NFL Madden games are known for. These characteristics demonstrate the franchise's commitment to being an accurate and immersive simulation of American football, ensuring that fans of the sport can have an enjoyable and authentic gaming experience. Since its beginnings in 1988, the Madden NFL series has evolved significantly, with yearly releases introducing enhanced graphics, gameplay mechanics, and new features to keep the franchise fresh and exciting.

The Sheriff's gang attempts to intimidate the squatters, but once The Preacher learns of the Sheriff's and The Colonel's dealings, he visits the squatters, who tell him they paid for the land but never got the deed. A few days later the Sheriff's posse burns down a few of the squatter's tents. The Preacher attempts to negotiate peacefully with the Sheriff, and so visits Cusack. Cusack tries to persuade The Preacher to join his mob, which he refuses. The Sheriff then sends a message to The Preacher by having some of his men rough up Maggie. Unarmed still because of his agreement with Maggie, The Preacher catches the gang in the act and overcomes one of the men's guns, scaring the men off. The Preacher gets his gun back from Maggie and sets out to visit the Squatters again, and is met by the Sheriff and some of his gang.

There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody). - Very Hard Choices is a science - fiction / suspense - mystery novel from Canadian science fiction author Spider Robinson , released in June 2008 . The novel , set in British Columbia , is a sequel to Very Bad Deaths and continues the story of the reclusive telepath known as Smelly . - The supernatural (Medieval Latin: \\"superntrlis\\": \\"supra\\" \\"above\\" + \\"naturalis\\" \\"natural\\", first used: 15201530 AD) includes all that cannot be explained by science or the laws of nature, including things characteristic of or relating to ghosts, gods, or other supernatural beings, or to things beyond nature. - The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east. - The Canadian titles debate has been ongoing since the presentation to the Canadian House of Commons of the Nickle Resolution in 1917. This resolution marked the earliest attempt to establish a Canadian government policy requesting the sovereign not to grant knighthoods, baronetcies, and peerages to Canadians and set the precedent for later policies restricting Canadians from accepting titles from foreign countries. Dissatisfaction with the British honours system led to the gradual creation of a separate system for Canada. - Speculative fiction is a broad umbrella genre denoting any narrative fiction with supernatural or futuristic elements; this encompasses the genres of science fiction, fantasy, horror, alternative history, magic realism, and superhero fiction, as well as combinations of the previous genres. It typically strays strongly from reality and so may feature fictional types of beings like mythical creatures and supernatural entities, technologies that do not exist in real life like time machines and interstellar spaceships, or magical or otherwise scientifically inexplicable elements. The term's popularity is sometimes attributed to Robert Heinlein, who referenced it in 1947 in an editorial essay, although there are prior mentions of speculative fiction, or its variant \\"speculative literature\\". - The Rocky Mountains, commonly known as the Rockies, are a major mountain range in western North America. The Rocky Mountains stretch more than from the northernmost part of British Columbia, in western Canada, to New Mexico, in the southwestern United States. Within the North American Cordillera, the Rockies are somewhat distinct from the Pacific Coast Ranges and the Cascade Range and Sierra Nevada which all lie further to the west. - Science fiction (often shortened to SF, sci-fi or scifi) is a genre of speculative fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a \\"literature of ideas.\\" It usually avoids the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have a grounding in science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection is now limited to hard science fiction. - British Columbia (BC) is the westernmost province of Canada, with a population of more than four million people located between the Pacific Ocean and the Rocky Mountains. British Columbia is also a component of the Pacific Northwest and the Cascadia bioregion, along with the U.S. states of Idaho, Oregon, Washington and Alaska. - A baronet (or ; abbreviated Bart or Bt) or the rare female equivalent, a baronetess (, or ; abbreviation \\"Btss\\"), is the holder of a baronetcy, a hereditary title awarded by the British Crown. The practice of awarding baronetcies was originally introduced in England in the 14th century and was used by James I of England in 1611 as a means of raising funds. - The Pacific Northwest (in the United States, commonly abbreviated as PNW), sometimes referred to as Cascadia, is a geographic region in western North America bounded by the Pacific Ocean to the west and loosely, by the Rocky Mountains on the east. Though no agreed boundary exists, a common conception includes the U.S. states of Oregon and Washington and the Canadian province of British Columbia. Broader conceptions reach north into Alaska and Yukon, south into far northern California and east to the Continental Divide, thus including Idaho, Western Montana, and western Wyoming. Narrower conceptions may be limited to the northwestern US or to the coastal areas west of the Cascade and Coast mountains. The variety of definitions can be attributed to partially overlapping commonalities of the region's history, geography, society, and other factors. - Canada (French: ) is a country in the northern half of North America. Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering , making it the world's second-largest country by total area and the fourth-largest country by land area. Canada's border with the United States is the world's longest land border. The majority of the country has a cold or severely cold winter climate, but southerly areas are warm in summer. Canada is sparsely populated, the majority of its land territory being dominated by forest and tundra and the Rocky Mountains. About four-fifths of the country's population of 36 million people is urbanized and live near the southern border. Its capital is Ottawa, its largest city is Toronto; other major urban areas include Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Quebec City, Winnipeg and Hamilton. - Time travel is the concept of movement (such as by a human) between certain points in time, analogous to movement between different points in space, typically using a hypothetical device known as a time machine, in the form of a vehicle or of a portal connecting distant points in time. Time travel is a recognized concept in philosophy and fiction, but traveling to an arbitrary point in time has a very limited support in theoretical physics, and usually only in conjunction with quantum mechanics or wormholes, also known as Einstein-Rosen bridges. In a more narrow sense, one-way time travel into the future via time dilation is a well-understood phenomenon within the frameworks of special relativity and general relativity, but advancing a large amount of time is not feasible with current technology. The concept was touched upon in various earlier works of fiction, but was popularized by H. G. Wells' 1895 novel \\"The Time Machine\\", which moved the concept of time travel into the public imagination, and it remains a popular subject in science fiction. - Spider Robinson (born November 24, 1948) is an American-born Canadian Hugo Award- and Nebula Award-winning science fiction author. - A knight is a person granted an honorary title of \\"knighthood\\" by a monarch or other political leader for service to the monarch or country, especially in a military capacity. Historically, in Europe, knighthood was conferred upon mounted warriors. During the High Middle Ages, knighthood was considered a class of lower nobility. By the Late Middle Ages, the rank had become associated with the ideals of chivalry, a code of conduct for the perfect courtly Christian warrior. Often, a knight was a vassal who served as a fighter for a lord, with payment in the form of land holdings. The lords trusted the knights, who were skilled in battle on horseback. Since the early modern period, the title of knight is purely honorific, usually bestowed by a monarch, as in the British honours system, often for non-military service to the country. The modern female equivalent in the United Kingdom is Dame. - Very Bad Deaths (Baen Books, 2004, ISBN 0-7434-8861-X), is a science-fiction/suspense-mystery novel from Canadian science fiction author Spider Robinson. The book was followed in 2008 by a sequel, \\"Very Hard Choices\\". It explores the personal implications of uncontrolled telepathy, social responsibility, and the idea of evolutionary, biological evil, while, as usual, expounds on Spider's own political and social views. - Baen Books is an American publishing house for science fiction and fantasy. In science fiction, it emphasizes space opera, hard science fiction, and military science fiction. The company was established in 1983 by science fiction publisher and editor Jim Baen. After his death in 2006, he was succeeded as publisher by long-time executive editor Toni Weisskopf. - Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction. - Alaska is a U.S. state located in the northwest extremity of North America. The Canadian administrative divisions of British Columbia and Yukon border the state to the east; its most extreme western part is Attu Island; it has a maritime border with Russia to the west across the Bering Strait. To the north are the Chukchi and Beaufort seasthe southern parts of the Arctic Ocean. The Pacific Ocean lies to the south and southwest. Alaska is the largest state in the United States by area, the 3rd least populous and the least densely populated of the 50 United States. Approximately half of Alaska's residents (the total estimated at 738,432 by the U.S. Census Bureau in 2015) live within the Anchorage metropolitan area. Alaska's economy is dominated by the fishing, natural gas, and oil industries, resources which it has in abundance. Military bases and tourism are also a significant part of the economy.

Question: what types of places are mentioned last? Context: In 1931, RCA Victor introduced their vinyl-based Victrolac compound as a material for some unusual-format and special-purpose records. By the end of the 1930s vinyl's advantages of light weight, relative unbreakability and low surface noise had made it the material of choice for prerecorded radio programming and other critical applications. When it came to ordinary 78 rpm records, however, the much higher cost of the raw material, as well as its vulnerability to the heavy pickups and crudely mass-produced steel needles still commonly used in home record players, made its general substitution for shellac impractical at that time. During the Second World War, the United States Armed Forces produced thousands of 12-inch vinyl 78 rpm V-Discs for use by the troops overseas. After the war, the wider use of vinyl became more practical as new record players with relatively lightweight crystal pickups and precision-ground styli made of sapphire or an exotic osmium alloy proliferated. In late 1945, RCA Victor began offering special transparent red vinyl De Luxe pressings of some classical 78s, at a de luxe price. Later, Decca Records introduced vinyl Deccalite 78s, while other record companies came up with vinyl concoctions such as Metrolite, Merco Plastic and Sav-o-flex, but these were mainly used to produce \\"unbreakable\\" children's records and special thin vinyl DJ pressings for shipment to radio stations.

A young child walks across the black top and is held by her brother. a group of kids","response":"A group of kids, varying in age and size, all huddled together by the jungle gym, quickly glance over and notice the young child and her brother approach. The sun casts elongated shadows on the ground as the excited voices of the spirited kids fill the air, making the playground sound like a symphony of laughter and chatter. The brother, sensing his younger sibling's apprehension, gently squeezes her hand and offers an encouraging smile, striving to comfort and empower her, as they prepare to engage in the intriguing world of playground politics. Among the myriad of children lies a fascinating collection of personalities, each with a distinctive backstory and set of talents. There's Lucy, who has a penchant for storytelling and can captivate the imagination of anyone within earshot with her extraordinary tales. There's Max, the athletic prodigy, who can outrun, out-jump, and out-climb everyone. Then there's Asha, the empath of the group, who always seems to know the right thing to say to cheer someone up. As the siblings draw closer, the rambunctious nature of the group is momentarily subdued, with all eyes on the newcomers. The young child hesitates at the threshold, her fingers trembling inside her brother's grasp. She glances up at her brother for reassurance and finds his eyes gleaming with a warmth that only siblings share. He nods, showing her that he believes in her ability to break through this daunting barrier. Taking a deep breath, the young girl clutches her brother's hand even tighter and steels herself to take that first brave step towards the heart of the playground pandemonium. As she does, the children look into her eyes and can almost taste the courage that lives within her, allowing them to let down their guard and smile at the newcomers as if they have always been there. Without hesitation, Max, the athletic prodigy, saunters forward, extends a hand to the young child, and offers an invitation. \\"Hey, come join us - we're about to start a game of tag!\\" The young girl's eyes sparkle with delight, and she beams at her brother before letting go of his hand and allowing herself to be welcomed into the chaotic world of their new playground family. Throughout the day, the young child learns to navigate this invigorating, challenging, and rewarding universe, discovering her own strengths and learning that her new friendships will help her overcome her fears. As the sun dips below the horizon and the playground empties, she walks back to her brother, her hand reaching for his once more - not out of apprehension this time, but out of excitement.

All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy is an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters. Rarely, they may move as much as a few meters. Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur ( Figure below ). Tim the seismologist studied data from two cities: Tokyo and Kansas City. Tokyo experienced many more earthquakes than Kansas City. Which city experiences more energy release because of rocks breaking? Answer:","response":"Based on the given information, Tokyo experiences more energy release because of rocks breaking. This is due to the fact that Tokyo experiences many more earthquakes than Kansas City. Since the sudden release of energy from rocks breaking is what causes earthquakes, the higher frequency of earthquakes in Tokyo is indicative of a greater amount of energy being released from the rocks breaking in that region."},{"question":"Sound waves are mechanical waves. They can travel only through matter. They cannot travel through empty space. This was demonstrated in the 1600s by a scientist named Robert Boyle. Boyle placed a ticking clock in a sealed glass jar. The clock could be heard ticking through the air and glass of the jar. Then Boyle pumped the air out of the jar. The clock was still running, but the ticking could not be heard. Thats because the sound couldnt travel without air particles to transfer the sound energy. Is there any other place where sound cannot be heard? Here is a hint: is there any other place that does not have air molecules? Thats right, in space sound cannot be transferred. So can astronauts hear each other? Yes, they can, because they are in enclosed space stations or pressurized suits.In both cases, they are surrounded by air molecules. If they left their space ship and did not use their electronics, they would not be able to hear each other. Next time you watch a science fiction movie, think about this factoid.

However, some antibiotics have been associated with a range of adverse side effects. Side-effects range from mild to very serious depending on the antibiotics used, the microbial organisms targeted, and the individual patient. Side effects may reflect the pharmacological or toxicological properties of the antibiotic or may involve hypersensitivity reactions or anaphylaxis. Safety profiles of newer drugs are often not as well established as for those that have a long history of use. Adverse effects range from fever and nausea to major allergic reactions, including photodermatitis and anaphylaxis. Common side-effects include diarrhea, resulting from disruption of the species composition in the intestinal flora, resulting, for example, in overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria, such as Clostridium difficile. Antibacterials can also affect the vaginal flora, and may lead to overgrowth of yeast species of the genus Candida in the vulvo-vaginal area. Additional side-effects can result from interaction with other drugs, such as elevated risk of tendon damage from administration of a quinolone antibiotic with a systemic corticosteroid. Some scientists have hypothesized that the indiscriminate use of antibiotics alter the host microbiota and this has been associated with chronic disease. What negative effects can antibiotics have on the vaginal area?","response":"Antibiotics can have several negative effects on the vaginal area, mainly due to their impact on the delicate balance of the microbial flora residing there. The primary issue arises from the disruption of the normal balance of bacterial species, which can lead to an overgrowth of certain organisms and result in various adverse outcomes. Some of the notable negative effects on the vaginal area include: 1. Yeast Infections: One of the most common side effects of antibiotics on the vaginal area is the overgrowth of yeast species, particularly those belonging to the genus Candida. This occurs because antibiotics not only target harmful bacteria but can also eliminate beneficial bacteria that help maintain the balance of microbial flora in the vagina. When these beneficial bacteria are diminished, yeast species, such as Candida, can proliferate and cause a yeast infection, leading to symptoms like itching, burning, vaginal discharge, and discomfort during sexual intercourse or urination. 2. Bacterial Vaginosis: Another potential negative effect of antibiotic use on the vaginal area is the increased risk of developing bacterial vaginosis (BV). This condition arises when the balance of normal bacterial species in the vagina is disrupted, leading to an overgrowth of certain types of bacteria. BV is characterized by symptoms such as vaginal discharge, odor, itching, and discomfort. Although antibiotics are often prescribed to treat BV, inappropriate or prolonged use of antibiotics can disrupt the vaginal flora further and increase the chances of recurrence. 3. Increased Susceptibility to STIs: The disruption of normal vaginal flora caused by antibiotics can also make the individual more susceptible to sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A healthy balance of beneficial bacteria in the vagina provides a protective barrier against harmful pathogens. When this balance is disrupted by antibiotics, it may create an environment more conducive to the transmission and acquisition of STIs like chlamydia, gonorrhea, and human papillomavirus (HPV). 4. Altered Microbiota and Potential Link to Chronic Diseases: Some scientists have hypothesized that the indiscriminate use of antibiotics can lead to long-lasting alterations in the host microbiota, including the vaginal area. This disruption of the microbial ecosystem has been associated with chronic diseases, although further research is needed to establish a definitive link. In conclusion, antibiotics can have several negative effects on the vaginal area, primarily due to their impact on the microbial flora. These effects include increased likelihood of yeast infections and bacterial vaginosis, as well as heightened susceptibility to STIs and potential associations with chronic diseases. To minimize these risks, it is essential to use antibiotics judiciously and adhere to the prescribed course of treatment, while also engaging in practices that maintain optimal vaginal health, such as proper hygiene, wearing breathable clothing, and avoiding irritants."},{"question":"Question: Read the following article and select the best answer.

Instead of worrying about sex, you and your partner can focus on emotional intimacy. Many sexual disorders occur because of various emotions or stressors that end up affecting the couple's sex life. Focusing on the relationship can help you strengthen your connection, which can lead to improved sex. For example, you may want to go for walks together, go to dinner, or do other activities. You may want to spend an entire evening talking to one another. You also may want to spend time touching in non-sexual ways, such as holding hands, holding one another, and kissing for the sake of kissing. You may have relationship problems because of the sexual disorder. You and your partner may have had some misunderstandings because of your actions, and you may have developed trust issues. There may be outside stressors that are affecting your relationship. You should work on these issues with your partner to move your relationship past this small bump in the road. Clearing up relationship problems can help lead the way to improved sex. Removing miscommunication, anxieties, and any underlying anger or feelings of resentment can make it easier to feel closer and intimate with your partner. You may decide to go see a sex therapist or couples counselor. Going to see a therapist or counselor doesn't mean that something is wrong with your relationship. Sexual disorders can cause a strain on both partners and the relationship. A sex therapist may help you learn how to build intimacy and work on techniques to address the disorder, while a couples counselor may be able to help you work through any relationship issues that have arisen due to the disorder. If your partner suggests going to counseling, don't get angry. See it as a way your partner is trying to support you and work on your relationship. Don't get discouraged if you want to go to counseling but your partner doesn't. You can search the internet for certified sex therapists and couples counselors in your area. You may also talk to your doctor or specialists about a referral. One way you can help boost your sexual function is to spend more time focusing on foreplay instead of heading straight for intercourse. Foreplay helps both partners enjoy the experience more. Foreplay can help a woman feel aroused and help a man get an erection. Foreplay includes a lot of different things. Take time to explore each other's bodies and focus on your partner's pleasure. Don't rush towards orgasm. Slow down the sexual experience, which can help you overcome your sexual disorder. During foreplay, you may want to use your hands and your mouth. Try touching different parts of the body, not just the penis or vagina. Make the foreplay experience an emotionally intimate experience as well as a physical one. Lack of stimulation before intercourse can lead to problems such as a reduced level of arousal, inability to get or hold an erection, lack of lubrication, and inability to reach orgasm. Some people may need some sort of stimulation for up to an hour before they are ready for intercourse. Due to your sexual disorder, you and your partner may need some extra help. That's fine. For women who have trouble with lubrication or painful sex, consider using lubricants or vaginal creams to help with dryness. Use toys to help enhance your sexual experience. Sexual toys may help increase stimulation during foreplay. You can use vibrating toys to stimulate the clitoris to help with female arousal problems, while the vibration may help a man get and maintain an erection. You may also want to try an erotic video or erotic literature. Watch the video together or read the literature to each other to help increase your physical and emotional intimacy. Some people have never been open or honest about what they like during sex. Take this time to tell your partner what you like or don't like during sex. Talk about things you'd like to try and experiment with. Try to be as specific as possible for your partner. Consider showing your partner what you like, or walking him or her through what to do for you. Men who experience erectile problems or women who have trouble getting aroused may need more manual stimulation than his or her partner. Tell your partner that you need this so he or she knows how to help you during sex. Remember to keep your words focused on your and not your partner. Don't accuse your partner of not satisfying you. Instead, say things like, “I really like when you touch my hair” or “My breasts are really sensitive. I would like you to touch them more.” Sometimes, couples get in a rut. They just do the same thing, and that doesn't lead to arousal or desire anymore. If this is the case for you and your partner, try experimenting. You may want to try different positions, participate in role play, or share fantasies that you both can act out. For women who experience pain during sex, trying new positions may help make intercourse a more pleasurable experience. For example, try being on top so you can control the movement and position. When talking about role play or fantasies, make sure to remember that each partner may not feel comfortable with everything. You want to try new things your partner wants to try, but don't feel bad if there are things your partner suggests that you are not willing to do. Find a compromise on both sides where you both willingly engage in situations and fantasies your partner wants to try while still being comfortable.","response":"Taking a break from sex can be beneficial for addressing sexual disorders, allowing couples to focus on emotional intimacy and strengthen their connection.

Step 4: Collect quotes and opinions Get input from team members, management, analysts, and fans to add color and authenticity to the article. Step 5: Organize the content Organize the researched content in a way that flows smoothly, building up to the main conclusion that the Cincinnati Reds have quietly won at the winter meetings. --- Introduction While the winter meetings of Major League Baseball tend to be filled with blockbuster deals and headline-grabbing moves, the Cincinnati Reds have quietly emerged as winners, strengthening their team for the upcoming season. With calculated moves and strategic signings, the Reds have been able to address their needs and improve their roster without drawing too much attention. Keys moves during the winter meetings The Reds were diligent in identifying and addressing their needs during the winter meetings. One of the critical moves they made was acquiring outfielder Tyler Naquin, who had a breakout 2021 season with the Cleveland Guardians. Naquin’s offensive capabilities will undoubtedly be an asset to the team, providing depth and power in their lineup. Furthermore, the Reds strengthened their pitching staff with the addition of veteran reliever Hunter Strickland. Strickland brings both experience and a dominant arm to the bullpen, which will help alleviate some of the pressure on the starting rotation. One of the more low-key trades included sending prospects to the Miami Marlins in exchange for versatile infielder Jonathon India. India's defensive abilities and potential for growth made this an intelligent move on the Reds' part, providing them with added depth and flexibility on the field. Quotes and opinions Reds' manager, David Bell, commented on the team's moves at the winter meetings, saying, \\"We feel like we've improved our team and added depth in important areas. The additions we've made may not have generated the same headlines as some other teams, but we believe they will have a significant impact on our chances this season.\\" Fan reactions to the Reds' winter meetings have been positive, with many acknowledging that the smaller moves made demonstrate a focus on building a well-rounded team. \\"I like the moves they made. They addressed key areas without over-spending and maintained flexibility for the future,\\" said lifelong Reds fan, John Davis. Conclusion The Cincinnati Reds may not have stolen the show at the winter meetings, but they made purposeful moves that addressed their pressing needs. With a bolstered outfield, improved pitching staff, and a versatile infield, the Reds have quietly placed themselves in a strong position for the upcoming season. Sometimes, it isn't the loudest moves that make the most significant difference - and the Cincinnati Reds have certainly proved that at this year's winter meetings."},{"question":"I know that the answer to the question \\"Who was split?\\" is in \\"The principal fighting occurred between the Bolshevik Red Army and the forces of the White Army.

However, there is also an increased risk of loss of control in such conditions. This is especially so when taking into account the large number of riders who ride brakeless. These riders must brake entirely through the drivetrain. Ideally this is done by resisting the forward motion of the pedals, shedding speed while the bike is still moving. Alternatively, though far less efficiently, one can brake by stopping the motion of the pedals in mid-rotation, causing the rear wheel to lock in place, allowing the bicycle to skid and slow down from kinetic friction (see below).[22] Descending any significant gradient is more difficult as the rider must spin the cranks at high speed (sometimes at 170 rpm or more), or use the brakes to slow down. Some consider that the enforced fast spin when descending increases suppleness or flexibility, which is said to improve pedalling performance on any type of bicycle; however the performance boost is negligible compared to the benefits of riding a free wheel.[23] and the situation: Two brothers had bike repair shops in neighboring towns. Bob's was located in a hilly area, with more precipitation and full of bike trails, while Rob's was in the valley, near the parks. Answer the following question: Which bike shop completed more brake repairs? A:","response":"Based on the information provided, it is likely that Bob's bike shop in the hilly area with more precipitation and bike trails completed more brake repairs. The terrain and weather conditions in Bob's location would cause more wear and tear on brakes, leading to a higher demand for brake repairs."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Johnathan is trying to find two blocks of wood with the same mass for a project he is working on. He doesn't have a balance, so he makes a crude one out of materials he has on hand. He put a block of wood on either side and the block on the left side was at a lower level than the block on the right. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: If Johnathan put two new blocks of wood on the balance and their levels are equal is their mass uneven or the same? Hint: Mass is a measure of the amount of matter in a substance or an object. The basic SI unit for mass is the kilogram (kg), but smaller masses may be measured in grams (g). To measure mass, you would use a balance. In the lab, mass may be measured with a triple beam balance or an electronic balance, but the old-fashioned balance pictured below may give you a better idea of what mass is. If both sides of this balance were at the same level, it would mean that the fruit in the left pan has the same mass as the iron object in the right pan. In that case, the fruit would have a mass of 1 kg, the same as the iron. As you can see, however, the fruit is at a higher level than the iron. This means that the fruit has less mass than the iron, that is, the fruit's mass is less than 1 kg. A:","response":"Based on the given information, if Johnathan put two new blocks of wood on the balance and their levels are equal, it indicates that their mass is the same. Since a balance works by comparing the mass of two objects, if both sides are at equal levels, it means the objects have equal mass. Therefore, in this scenario, the mass of the two new blocks of wood is the same."},{"question":"Available choices: (A). hydrogen and oxygen. (B). preserved meals. (C). solid, liquid, gas.

When it comes to your friends, you want to be able to support and comfort them during their times of need. However, it can sometimes be difficult to know the best way to help and provide that support. Not to worry! We have created a guide with four simple strategies on how to help a friend through rough times. By following these tips, you can be an empathetic and attentive companion who can provide solace and reassurance in their moments of strife. 1. Don't Be Afraid to Console Them Especially during tough times, people need someone who can listen and provide emotional support. As a friend, it's important to let your loved one know that you are there for them. Remember, consoling someone doesn't mean that you need to fix their problems. It simply means being available and providing a safe space for them to unburden their feelings. When offering consolation, keep the following tips in mind: - Be empathetic: Put yourself in your friend's position and consider how he or she might be feeling. This will help you to offer genuine comfort and understanding. - Listen actively: Make eye contact, nod, and affirm that you are listening without interrupting. - Offer reassuring words: Let your friend know that they're not alone, and that you're there to help. 2. Pray or Meditate with Them Prayer and meditation can offer tremendous solace during difficult times. By engaging in these activities with your friend, you promote a sense of connection and understanding between both of you. If your friend is open to it, consider the following: - Attending a religious service or study group together - Offering to pray together at home or in a sacred space - Turning to scriptural texts for wisdom and comfort - Meditating together quietly or through guided meditation exercises Even if your friend isn't religious or spiritual, sometimes the simple act of focusing on a higher power or inner self can encourage relaxation and healing. 3. Release Some Physical Energy Stress can build up in our bodies during challenging times. Engaging in physical activities can help relieve this tension and promote mental clarity. Here are a few ways to encourage your friend to release some physical energy: - Go for a walk or a jog together outside - Participate in group sports or fitness classes - Practice yoga or stretching exercises - Dance, either informally at home or in a group class These activities not only help with stress relief but also provide an opportunity for social interaction and bonding. Plus, physical exercise can boost mood and improve overall well-being. 4. Distract Your Friend While it's important to provide a space for your friend to express their feelings, sometimes a temporary distraction from their worries can be beneficial. Introducing enjoyable activities can help to improve their mood and reduce feelings of stress or sadness. Here are some ideas for light-hearted distractions: - Watch a feel-good movie or a favorite TV show together - Try a new hobby or craft - Cook or bake together and enjoy the fruits of your labor - Play board games or video games together - Attend a local event, such as a fair, concert, or festival Remember, the goal isn't to ignore or dismiss their concerns, but rather to provide a momentary escape that allows for a break from negative thoughts. Conclusion Supporting a friend during difficult times can be challenging, but by following these four steps – consoling them, praying or meditating together, releasing physical energy, and providing distractions – you can be a supportive and helpful companion. Your friend will appreciate the time and effort you put into being there for them and you'll strengthen the bond of your friendship by weathering this storm together. Remember, your care and understanding can make all the difference in helping your friend find solace and healing during their time of need."},{"question":"Write a question about the following article: By early 1799, the French Directory had become impatient with stalling tactics employed by Austria. The uprising in Naples raised further alarms, and recent gains in Switzerland suggested the timing was fortuitous to venture on another campaign in northern Italy and southwestern Germany. At the beginning of 1800, the armies of France and Austria faced each other across the Rhine. Feldzeugmeister Pál Kray led approximately 120,000 troops. In addition to his Austrian regulars, his force included 12,000 men from the Electorate of Bavaria, 6,000 troops from the Duchy of Württemberg, 5,000 soldiers of low quality from the Archbishopric of Mainz, and 7,000 militiamen from the County of Tyrol. Of these, 25,000 men were deployed east of Lake Constance to protect the Vorarlberg. Kray posted his main body of 95,000 soldiers in the L-shaped angle where the Rhine changes direction from a westward flow along the northern border of Switzerland to a northward flow along the eastern border of France.

A woman is seen turning on a hose to pour water in and walks over to another bucket and sits down. the woman","response":"Based on the given information, the next most logical event would be: Step 1: The woman picks up the hose in her hand after she has turned it on, ensuring a steady flow of water is coming out so that she can effectively fill the bucket. Justification: The woman needs to have control over the flow of water and direct it into the bucket. Step 2: The woman walks over to the empty bucket with the hose in her hand, carefully aiming the hose towards the opening of the bucket. Justification: To fill the bucket with water, the woman needs to be close enough and properly position the hose to pour water into it. Step 3: The woman starts filling the bucket with water from the hose, monitoring the water level to make sure it doesn't overflow. Justification: Since her intention is to fill the bucket, she needs to check when the water has reached a sufficient level in the bucket to prevent any water spillage. Step 4: The woman turns off the hose once the water has reached the desired level in the bucket. Justification: After completing her task, it's essential to conserve water and to prevent any potential accidents by ensuring the hose is turned off.

Options: a ) 515 , b ) 545 , c ) 618 . , d ) 644 . , e ) 666 A:","response":"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of students who study either numeric methods, or automatic control of airborne vehicles or both. We are given that there are 226 students studying numeric methods, 423 students studying automatic control, and 134 students studying both. First, we find out how many students don't have any overlapping subjects (i.e., students who are not counted twice): Number of students studying only numeric methods = 226 - 134 = 92 Number of students studying only automatic control = 423 - 134 = 289 Now, we'll find the total number of unique students in the second year: Total second year students = 92 (numeric only) + 289 (control only) + 134 (both) = 515 The problem states that the second year students are approximately 80% of the total number of students in the faculty. To find the total number of students in the faculty, we set up a proportion: 515 (second year students) / X (total students) = 80% or 0.8 Now, we solve for X: X = 515 / 0.8 = 643.75 Since the number of students needs to be a whole number, we can round up to 644. Therefore, there are approximately 644 students in the faculty.

He puts a napkin under it to avoid leaving what? Here are possible answers to this question: - noise - knocking over - put down - doesn - water mark I believe the correct choice is \\"water mark\\", here's why: A:","response":"Bill is using a napkin under his cup as a form of protection for his table. The possible nuisances he wants to avoid could be noise, knocking over, putting down, or just simply does not want to. However, each of these reasons does not align precisely with the action of placing a napkin under a cup. Let's look at each of these potential answers one by one: 1. Noise: While friction between the cup and table might produce some noise, this is typically negligible and not something most people consider when setting a cup on a table. Therefore, using a napkin to reduce noise seems unlikely. 2. Knocking over: This is also an irrelevant point because a napkin does not prevent a cup from being knocked over. It can even make it more unstable due to the lack of direct contact with the table's surface. 3. Put down: This point may seem logical, but it is vague. \\"Put down\\" could mean numerous things. It does not directly connect with the need for a napkin under a cup. 4. Doesn't: This point is also irrelevant. The term \\"doesn't\\" is not an action or result. It's a contraction of \\"does not,\\" indicating the absence of an action. Again, it does not seem to relate to why someone would place a napkin under their cup on a table. Now, let's move to the final possible answer, Water Mark. A water mark is a stain left on a surface by a cold glass or cup. When a cold cup is set on a table, condensation often forms on the outside of the cup. This moisture can drip down and create a ring of water on the table's surface. Over time, if this happens frequently, it can cause more permanent water marks or stains. By placing a napkin under his cup, Bill is providing a shield between the condensation on the cup and the table surface. The napkin effectively absorbs the moisture, protecting the table from these unsightly water marks or potential damage. Therefore, the correct choice in this context is \\"water mark\\". By placing a napkin under his cup, Bill is preventing a water mark from appearing on his table. This shows clear foresight on Bill's part to maintain the quality and aesthetics of his table surface. It's a small, yet smart action that helps preserve the furniture. This understanding falls entirely in line with the practice of using coasters or napkins under cups, particularly those containing cold liquids."},{"question":"New York was created as the junction of three rail branches , the Jamesburg division of the Pennsylvania Railroad , the Rocky Hill and the Monmouth Junction and Freehold .

Due to Carpal tunnel syndrome, Barbara cannot use her left hand for a while so her typing speed is now 40 words less per minute. If she is supposed to type a document with 3440 words, how many minutes will it take her to finish typing the document? Give me reasons, before answering the question","response":"To determine how many minutes it will take Barbara to finish typing the document, we need to consider the following steps: 1. Determine her current typing speed: Barbara's original typing speed is 212 words per minute (wpm). Due to Carpal tunnel syndrome, she now types 40 wpm less than her original speed. To find her current typing speed, we simply subtract 40 wpm from her original speed: 212 wpm - 40 wpm = 172 wpm So, Barbara's current typing speed is 172 words per minute. 2. Calculate the time it takes to type the document: The document she needs to type contains 3440 words. To find out how long it will take her to type the entire document at her current speed, we will divide the total number of words by her typing speed: 3440 words ÷ 172 wpm = 20 minutes This calculation shows that it will take Barbara 20 minutes to finish typing the document at her current typing speed.

According to the Kabul-based official, a joint US-Afghan force operating in the mountainous Afghan frontier province of Kunar was the first to come under attack in the early hours of Saturday morning, forcing them to return fire. The high death toll from an incident between two supposed allies suggests Nato helicopters and jets strafed Pakistani positions with heavy weapons. The deadliest friendly fire incident since the start of the decade-long war also prompted Pakistan to ban Nato supply trucks from crossing into Afghanistan and to issue an order demanding the US quit the remote Shamsi airbase, from which the US has operated some unmanned drone aircraft. At border crossings, hundreds of supply trucks are reportedly stranded by the ban, with drivers fearing insurgents will take the opportunity to attack if they are not allowed to move. A spokesman for Nato's International Security Assistance Force (Isaf) said it was \\"highly likely\\" that aircraft which had been called into the area to provide \\"close air support\\" to troops on the ground was responsible for causing casualties among the Pakistani soldiers. For their part, a statement by the Pakistani military claimed that it was they who were attacked first, forcing them to respond to Nato's \\"aggression with all available weapons\\". According to Pakistani officials the 40 or so soldiers stationed at the outposts were asleep at the time of the attack. Government officials said the two border posts that were attacked had recently been established to try to stop insurgents who use bases in Afghanistan to attack Pakistan from crossing the border and launching attacks. Afghan intelligence say the US-Afghan force was conducting operations against suspected Taliban training camps in the area. The Obama administration promised a full investigation. Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state, and Leon Panetta, the defence secretary, issued a joint statement saying they had each spoken to their Pakistani counterparts to express their condolences for the loss of life. Pakistan was blunt that the killings represented a serious setback for the two countries' tattered alliance. The prime minister's office said the foreign minister, Hina Rabbani Khar, told Clinton on Sunday that the attack was unacceptable, showed complete disregard for human life and had sparked rage within Pakistan. The vagueness of the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan is one potential, and relatively innocent, explanation for the incident. Drawn up by the British Raj in 1893, there is little agreement on where the so-called Durand Line actually falls, meaning troops from either side of the border can wander into the neighbouring country without realising it. One senior military official said that, in places, rival maps have discrepancies of \\"multiples of kilometres – sometimes as much as five kilometres\\". Much of the fighting in Afghanistan is conducted by guerrillas based a short distance inside Pakistan. Nato forces are not allowed to cross the border and militants sometimes fire artillery and rockets across the line from locations close to Pakistani army posts. And yet both sides have worked hard to try and minimise any confusion. The attack happened just a day after John Allen, the US commander of Nato forces in Afghanistan, met with Ashfaq Pervez Kayani, the Pakistani army chief, to discuss enhanced co-operation on the border. But a more troubling explanation would be that insurgents in the area were operating under the nose of Pakistani security forces. Many Afghan officials believe Pakistan helps the Taliban with cross-border operations. Edrees Momand of the Afghan Border Police said that a US-Afghan force in the area near the Pakistani outposts detained several militants on Saturday morning. \\"I am not aware of the casualties on the other side of the border but those we have detained aren't Afghan Taliban,\\" he said, implying they may have been Pakistani or other foreign national Taliban operating in Afghanistan. Whatever the outcome of investigations, the incident is likely to do yet more damage to the critical relationship between the US and Pakistan. The alliance between the two countries has been repeatedly battered in the past year, first by the jailing of a CIA contractor and then by US special forces who raided deep inside Pakistani territory and killed Osama bin Laden. More recently the US has accused Pakistan of backing a militant group who launched a 20-hour attack on the US embassy in Kabul. Washington believes Pakistan continues to support the Taliban, a movement it publicly backed in the 1990s, in order to have influence in Afghanistan. But at the same time as supporting the enemies of the US, Pakistan remains crucial to the military mission in Afghanistan. John Allen was quick to release a statement saying the incident had his \\"highest personal attention\\". \\"My most sincere and personal heartfelt condolences go out to the families and loved ones of any members of Pakistan security forces who may have been killed or injured,\\" he said. Islamabad reacted with fury to the attack. \\"This is an attack on Pakistan's sovereignty,\\" said Pakistan's prime minister, Yousuf Raza Gilani. \\"We will not let any harm come to Pakistan's sovereignty and solidarity.\\" In a statement General Kayani promised \\"all necessary steps be undertaken for an effective response to this irresponsible act. \\"A strong protest has been launched with Nato/Isaf in which it has been demanded that strong and urgent action be taken against those responsible for this aggression.\\" A cabinet committee convened by Gilani said the government would launch a complete review of its diplomatic, political, military and intelligence relationships with the US. The vast bulk of Nato supplies arrive in Afghanistan by trucks that haul equipment up from the port of Karachi to the Khyber Pass, a key crossing point over the mountainous border into Afghanistan. The shutting down of the border to Nato traffic has happened in the past during periods of Pakistani displeasure with Afghanistan and its foreign backers. A similar incident last year in which two Pakistani troops were killed led to the closure of one of Nato's supply routes for ten days. However, in recent years the alliance has opened up alternative supply routes through Central Asia, reducing its reliance on the route through Pakistan. ||||| Image caption Lorries carrying supplies to Nato have been stopped at the Torkham border crossing Pakistan has ordered a review of all co-operation with the US and Nato after the alliance struck a Pakistani army checkpoint, killing at least 24 people. A committee chaired by Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani also decided to cut supply lines to Nato in Afghanistan. A Nato spokesman admitted it was \\"highly likely\\" that Nato aircraft were behind the strike at the Afghan border. The US has stressed the importance of its relationship and said it fully backed Nato's plan to investigate. Nato's Brig Gen Carsten Jacobson sent condolences to Pakistan and said the alliance was investigating how the incident occurred. Ambassador summoned Mr Gilani called the attack a \\"grave infringement of Pakistan's sovereignty\\". The BBC's Orla Guerin in Islamabad says this could be a very costly mistake by Nato, which relies heavily on the route through Pakistan to supply its personnel involved in the war in Afghanistan. A meeting of the cabinet's defence committee, convened by Mr Gilani, decided the government would \\"revisit and undertake a complete review of all programmes, activities and co-operative arrangements with US/Nato/Isaf, including diplomatic, political, military and intelligence\\". ANALYSIS There is a lot of anger in Pakistan at what has happened. Anti-American feeling among the general public is high normally, and these kinds of incidents increase that feeling. There is anger also because, unlike similar incidents in the past, there has been no explanation yet of what happened. For the moment, Pakistan has suspended supply lines into Afghanistan and asked the US to vacate the air base from where it has in the past launched drone strikes against tribal areas. In addition, Pakistan has also indicated that it may carry out a wider review of its relationship with the US and Nato, covering intelligence sharing and diplomatic ties etc. It \\"decided to close with immediate effect Nato/Isaf logistics supply lines\\", according to a statement issued by Mr Gilani's office. Reports appeared to confirm that Nato traffic was not being allowed through Pakistan's two border crossings with Afghanistan, at Torkham and Chaman. The committee also said the United States would be asked to vacate, within 15 days, the Shamsi air base, which the US has used to launch drones. However, our correspondent notes that Pakistan has made a similar demand before and the base may already be empty. Pakistan's government also summoned the US ambassador. Late on Saturday, US Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton released a statement saying they offered their \\"deepest condolences for the loss of life and support fully Nato's intention to investigate immediately\\". They stressed the \\"importance of the US-Pakistani partnership, which serves the mutual interests of our people\\" and pledged to remain in close contact with their Pakistani counterparts, the AFP news agency quoted the statement as saying. Special forces The night-time attack took place at the Salala checkpoint, about 1.5 miles (2.5 km) from the Afghan border, at around 02:00 on Saturday morning local time (21:00 GMT Friday). The Pakistani army said helicopters and fighter aircraft hit two border posts, killing 24 people and leaving 13 injured. Local officials said the two posts were about 300m apart on a mountain top. Pakistani officials said there had been no militant activity in the area, and most of the Pakistani soldiers were asleep. They also said Nato had the grid references of the posts and therefore should not have fired. Gen Jacobson said a combined force of Afghan and Nato troops were in the area when \\"a tactical situation developed on the ground\\", though he gave no more details. He said close air support was called in, and \\"we're aware it's highly likely this caused casualties\\". Military sources told the BBC's Quentin Sommerville in Paktika province in Afghanistan that a US-Afghan special forces mission had been in the area, where they believed a Taliban training camp was operating. They said the mission came under fire from a position within Pakistan, and they received permission from the headquarters of Nato's Isaf mission to fire back.

Pakistani troops are involved in fighting the Taliban in the crucial border region area. Hundreds of militants have been resisting attempts by the security forces to clear them from southern and south-eastern parts of the district. In October, Pakistan's army chief Ashfaq Kayani warned the US against taking unilateral action in nearby North Waziristan. Washington has for many years urged Islamabad to deal with militants in the area. ||||| Pakistan has blocked vital supply routes for U.S.-led troops in Afghanistan and demanded Washington vacate a base used by American drones after coalition aircraft allegedly killed 24 Pakistani troops at two posts along a mountainous frontier that serves as a safe haven for militants. The incident Saturday was a major blow to American efforts to rebuild an already tattered alliance vital to winding down the 10-year-old Afghan war. Islamabad called the bloodshed in one of its tribal areas a \\"grave infringement\\" of the country's sovereignty, and it could make it even more difficult for the U.S. to enlist Pakistan's help in pushing Afghan insurgents to engage in peace talks. A NATO spokesman said it was likely that coalition airstrikes caused Pakistani casualties, but an investigation was being conducted to determine the details. If confirmed, it would be the deadliest friendly fire incident by NATO against Pakistani troops since the Afghan war began a decade ago. The White House said senior U.S. civilian and military officials extended condolences to their Pakistani counterparts following the airstrike. The unidentified officials also expressed a desire to work with Pakistan to investigate the deaths. Video: US-Pakistani relations severely damaged (on this page) Supply 'contigencies' Col. Gary Kolb, spokesman for the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force in Kabul, said the aircraft were taking part in a strike that was a coordinated effort with ISAF, Pakistani military and the Pakistani border authorities, NBC News reported. He said they had responded to small arms fire, according to NBC News. Asked to confirm that it was retaliatory, he said yes. ISAF was still determining the exact circumstances. \\"This has the highest priority to ensure that we get all the facts straight,\\" Kolb said, NBC News reported. A prolonged closure of Pakistan's two Afghan border crossings to NATO supplies could cause serious problems for the coalition. The U.S., which is the largest member of the NATO force in Afghanistan, ships more than 30 percent of its non-lethal supplies through Pakistan. The coalition has alternative routes through Central Asia into northern Afghanistan, but they are costlier and less efficient. Kolb noted that even if some of supply routes through Pakistan were closed, there were \\"contingencies built into the system\\" to deal with these types of disruptions. Pakistan temporarily closed one of its Afghan crossings to NATO supplies last year after U.S. helicopters accidentally killed two Pakistani soldiers. Suspected militants took advantage of the impasse to launch attacks against stranded or rerouted trucks carrying NATO supplies. The government reopened the border after about 10 days when the U.S. apologized. NATO said at the time the relatively short closure did not significantly affect its ability to keep its troops supplied. But the reported casualties are much greater this time, and the relationship between Pakistan and the U.S. has severely deteriorated over the last year, especially following the covert American raid that killed Osama bin Laden in a Pakistani garrison town in May. Islamabad was outraged that it wasn't told about the operation beforehand. Losing air base for drones? The government announced it closed its border crossings to NATO in a statement issued after an emergency meeting of the Cabinet's defense committee chaired by Pakistani Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani. It also said that within 15 days the U.S. must vacate Shamsi Air Base, which is located in southwestern Baluchistan province. The U.S. uses the base to service drones that target al-Qaida and Taliban militants in Pakistan's tribal region when they cannot return to their bases inside Afghanistan because of weather conditions or mechanical difficulty, said U.S. and Pakistani officials, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive strategic matters. The government also plans to review all diplomatic, military and intelligence cooperation with the U.S. and other NATO forces, according to the statement issued after the defense committee meeting. Video: White House treads lightly around Pakistan situation (on this page) The White House said that senior U.S. civilian and military officials had expressed their condolences to their Pakistani counterparts. The White House statement said the officials expressed \\"our desire to work together to determine what took place, and our commitment to the U.S.-Pakistan partnership which advances our shared interests, including fighting terrorism in the region.\\" The White House statement did not address Pakistan's decision to block supply routes for the war in Afghanistan or its demand that the U.S. vacate the drone base. 'Blatant and unacceptable' The Pakistani army said Saturday that NATO helicopters and fighter jets carried out an \\"unprovoked\\" attack on two of its border posts in the Mohmand tribal area before dawn, killing 24 soldiers and wounding 13 others. The troops responded in self-defense \\"with all available weapons,\\" an army statement said. Pakistan army chief Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani condemned the attack, calling it a \\"blatant and unacceptable act,\\" according to the statement. A spokesman for NATO forces, Brig. Gen. Carsten Jacobson, said Afghan and coalition troops were operating in the border area of eastern Afghanistan when \\"a tactical situation\\" prompted them to call in close air support. It is \\"highly likely\\" that the airstrikes caused Pakistani casualties, he told BBC television. \\"My most sincere and personal heartfelt condolences go out to the families and loved ones of any members of Pakistan security forces who may have been killed or injured,\\" Gen. John Allen, the top overall commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan, said in a statement. The border issue is a major source of tension between Islamabad and Washington, which is committed to withdrawing its combat troops from Afghanistan by the end of 2014. Much of the violence in Afghanistan is carried out by insurgents who are based just across the border in Pakistan. Coalition forces are not allowed to cross the frontier to attack the militants. However, the militants sometimes fire artillery and rockets across the line, reportedly from locations close to Pakistani army posts. American officials have repeatedly accused Pakistani forces of supporting — or turning a blind eye — to militants using its territory for cross-border attacks. But militants based in Afghanistan have also been attacking Pakistan recently, prompting complaints from Islamabad. Mountaintop posts The two posts that were attacked Saturday were located about 1,000 feet apart on a mountain top and were set up recently to stop Pakistani Taliban militants holed up in Afghanistan from crossing the border and staging attacks, said local government and security officials. There was no militant activity in the area when the alleged NATO attack occurred, local officials said. Some of the soldiers were standing guard, while others were asleep, they said, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media. Pakistan army spokesman Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas said map references of all of the force's border posts have been given to NATO several times. Video: Pakistan blaming NATO for soldiers' deaths (on this page) Pakistan's prime minister summoned U.S. Ambassador Cameron Munter to protest the alleged NATO strike, according to a Foreign Ministry statement. It said the attack was a \\"grave infringement of Pakistan's sovereignty\\" and could have serious repercussions on Pakistan's cooperation with NATO. Munter said in a statement that he regretted any Pakistani deaths and promised to work closely with Islamabad to investigate the incident. The U.S., Pakistan, and Afghan militaries have long wrestled with the technical difficulties of patrolling a border that in many places is disputed or poorly marked. Saturday's incident took place a day after a meeting between NATO's Gen. Allen and Pakistan army chief Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani in Islamabad to discuss border operations. The meeting tackled \\"coordination, communication and procedures ... aimed at enhancing border control on both sides,\\" according to a statement from the Pakistani side. The U.S. helicopter attack that killed two Pakistani soldiers on Sept. 30 of last year took place south of Mohmand in the Kurram tribal area. A joint U.S.-Pakistan investigation found that Pakistani soldiers fired at the two U.S. helicopters prior to the attack, a move the investigation team said was likely meant to notify the aircraft of their presence after they passed into Pakistani airspace several times. A U.S. airstrike in June 2008 reportedly killed 11 Pakistani paramilitary troops during a clash between militants and coalition forces in the tribal region. NBC News' Atia Abawi in Kabul, The Associated Press and Reuters contributed to this story. |||||Summary:","response":"A friendly fire incident, which is when soldiers from the same team accidentally attack each other, happened between the forces of NATO (a group of countries working together for peace and security) and Pakistan, and it has caused a lot of trouble. NATO forces were in an area near the border of Afghanistan and Pakistan, and were there because they believed there were people from a bad group called the Taliban hiding out there. During their mission, they ended up attacking the troops from Pakistan by mistake, which led to many deaths. In response, Pakistan got very mad and asked NATO to stop sending supplies through their country to Afghanistan. This could make things very tough for NATO, because they need this route to get important items to their teams in Afghanistan. Both sides are saying the other one started the aggression, and it's hard to figure out what really happened because the border line between the two countries is not very clear. Investigations are being done to find out more details about the situation. In the end, this event could make the relationship between the U.S. and Pakistan even more strained or difficult."},{"question":"For example, in October 2004, 1 was valued at 33,000 lei and 1 euro at 41,000 lei.

He says the closure of the San Francisco consulate will be an inconvenience. Russian entrepreneur Daniel Kravtsov works on his computer late at night at his home in Hayes Valley. He says the closure of the San Francisco consulate will be an inconvenience. Stuck in the middle of the tit-for-tat closure of the Russian Consulate in San Francisco Thursday are Bay Area entrepreneurs like Daniel Kravtsov, who rely on easy access to a consulate to keep their companies running. Kravtsov, who lives in the U.S. on an O-1 visa, has needed to make two trips to the consulate in the last year alone: once to get some business documents verified, and again when money in his Russian bank account got stolen. “It’s very inconvenient. ... Now we need to go to another city,” Kravtsov, founder of data aggregation startup Improvado, said of the sudden closure, which leaves Seattle as the only city with a Russian consulate on the West Coast. “I’m upset that everything is going in this direction.” The Trump administration ordered the Russian Consulate in San Francisco to shut down by Saturday, a few weeks after Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the reduction of U.S. personnel in the U.S. Embassy in Moscow in response to sanctions passed by Congress and approved by President Trump. In addition to the San Francisco closure, State Department officials said the U.S. would scale back the Russian diplomatic presence in Washington and New York. The consulate in San Francisco was a hub for Russians on the West Coast, with some flying in from as far away as Los Angeles and Phoenix to use it. While Russians don’t need to interact with the consulate frequently, when they do, it is typically for pressing reasons: a passport renewal, a birth certificate request or a background check for police. Getting an appointment at the Russian Consulate on Green Street was already a time-consuming process. When the San Francisco consulate closes, experts worry U.S.-Russia business relations will suffer as obtaining travel documents gets harder. “If they were to renew a passport, they would have to wait three months just to get an appointment — but now it’s hard to predict what will happen,” said Andrei Romanenko, a Bay Area immigration attorney who frequently deals with Russian clients. What’s worse, he said, are the wait times in Russia. Now that staffing in the U.S. Embassy in Moscow has been significantly reduced, Romanenko said some of his clients are struggling to get their visas approved to enter the U.S. And for students on an F-1 visa who need to start school in the next few weeks, and those on H-1B work visas who need to start their jobs in the U.S. soon, the clock is ticking. Eugenia Kuyda, a Russian entrepreneur and co-founder of artificial intelligence messaging startup Luka, has many friends stuck in that line. “It’s impossible to get anything done there,” she said. “It’s just disappointing where we are going. We grew up in Moscow when everything American was welcome ... and now, all of a sudden, instead of going forward, we’re going backward.” Trisha Thadani is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

The United States is retaliating against Russia by forcing closure of its consulate in San Francisco and scaling... (Associated Press) WASHINGTON (AP) — Russia on Friday promised a \\"tough response\\" to a U.S. order to shut the Russian consulate in San Francisco and offices in Washington and New York, the latest round in a diplomatic tit-for-tat. The U.S. issued its order Thursday and gave Russia 48 hours to comply, intensifying tensions between the two countries. President Donald Trump's administration described its action as retaliation for the Kremlin's \\"unwarranted and detrimental\\" demand earlier this month that the U.S. cut its diplomatic staff in Russia. \\"The United States is prepared to take further action as necessary and as warranted,\\" State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said. Still, she said the U.S. hoped both countries could now move toward \\"improved relations\\" and \\"increased cooperation.\\" Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Friday that Moscow will reply with firmness but still must decide on the precise response. \\"We will have a tough response to the things that come totally out of the blue to hurt us and are driven solely by the desire to spoil our relations with the United States,\\" he said in a televised meeting with students at Russia's top diplomacy school. American officials argued that Russia should refrain from retaliation, noting that Moscow's ordering of U.S. diplomatic cuts was premised on bringing the two countries' diplomatic presences into \\"parity.\\" \\"The United States hopes that, having moved toward the Russian Federation's desire for parity, we can avoid further retaliatory actions by both sides,\\" the State Department's Nauert said. Both countries now maintain three consulates on each other's territory and ostensibly similar numbers of diplomats. Exact numbers are difficult to independently verify. Lavrov on Friday also defended Trump, saying that the new package of sanctions against Russia that Congress adopted last month not only hits Russia but also is designed to \\"tie Trump's hands, not let him use his constitutional powers to the full to make foreign policy.\\" Several hours after the U.S. announcement, new Russian Ambassador Anatoly Antonov arrived in Washington to start his new posting. At the airport, Antonov cited a maxim of former Soviet leader Vladimir Lenin as he urged caution and professionalism. \\"We don't need hysterical impulses,\\" Russian news agencies quoted Antonov as saying. The closures on both U.S. coasts marked perhaps the most drastic diplomatic measure by the United States against Russia since 1986, near the end of the Cold War, when the nuclear-armed powers expelled dozens of each other's diplomats. And it comes amid some of the broadest strains in their relationship ever since. The two countries have clashed over the wars in Ukraine and Syria, but most significantly over American allegations that Russia meddled in the 2016 U.S. election to boost Trump's chances of victory. Investigations continue into whether Trump's campaign colluded with Moscow. By Saturday, the Russians must close their consulate in San Francisco and an official residence there. Though Russia can keep its New York consulate and Washington embassy, trade missions housed in satellite offices in both of those cities must shut down, a senior Trump administration official said. The official briefed reporters on a conference call on condition of anonymity. Outside the consulate building high atop a hill overlooking the San Francisco Bay, there were no visible signs of an exodus Thursday. Consular officials walked in and out of the stately building, and Russian citizens who had scheduled appointments said they were able to pick up or renew their passports. American counterintelligence officials have long kept a watchful eye on Russia's outpost in San Francisco, concerned that people posted to the consulate as diplomats were engaged in espionage. The U.S. late last year kicked out several Russians posted there, calling it a response to election interference. The U.S. isn't expelling any Russian officials this time. Those who work at the shuttered offices can be reassigned elsewhere in the United States, the senior official said. One of the buildings is believed to be leased, but Russia will maintain ownership over the others, said the official, adding that Moscow can determine if it wants to sell them or otherwise dispose of the properties. The forced closures are the latest in an intensifying exchange of diplomatic broadsides. In December, President Barack Obama kicked out dozens of Russian officials, closed Russian recreational compounds in New York and Maryland, and imposed sanctions on Russian people and businesses. Russian President Vladimir Putin withheld from retaliating. The next month, Trump took office after campaigning on promises to improve U.S.-Russia ties. But earlier this month, Trump begrudgingly signed into law stepped-up sanctions on Russia that Congress pushed to prevent him from easing up on Moscow. The Kremlin retaliated by telling the U.S. to cut embassy and consulate staff down to 455 personnel, from a level hundreds higher. Russia said 755 personnel in all would have to go to reach the new limit. The U.S. never confirmed how many diplomatic staff it had in the country at the time. As of Thursday, the U.S. has complied with the order to reduce staff to 455, officials said. The reductions are having consequences for Russia. The U.S. has temporarily suspended non-immigrant visa processing for Russians seeking to visit the United States and was scheduled to resume it on Friday at a \\"much-reduced rate.\\" The U.S. will process visas only at the embassy in Moscow, meaning Russians can no longer apply at U.S. consulates in St. Petersburg, Yekaterinburg and Vladivostok. Despite the exchange of penalties, there have been narrow signs of U.S.-Russian cooperation that have transcended the worsening ties. In July, Trump and Putin signed off on a deal with Jordan for a cease-fire in southwest Syria. The U.S. says the truce has largely held. ___ Vasilyeva reported from Moscow.

Activities at consular annexes in Washington D.C. and New York would also have to be scaled down, the announcement said. On Friday, the consulate in San Francisco said it would stop operations a day early. A Foreign Ministry statement published on Thursday said Russia would first “review” the U.S. move before announcing its own response. Speaking to MGIMO students, Lavrov said Russia would “of course be tough in its response” to what he called \\"harmful actions dictated only by the desire to spoil our relations with the United States.\\" |||||","response":"A Russian consulate in San Francisco has closed, leaving some entrepreneurs like Daniel Kravtsov, who rely on easy access to a consulate to keep their companies running, feeling inconvenienced.

(September 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) As an old man, Adso, son of the Baron of Melk recounts how, as a young novice in 1327, he joined his mentor, Franciscan friar William of Baskerville on a journey to a Benedictine abbey in Northern Italy where the Franciscans were to debate with Papal emissaries the poverty of Christ. The abbey also boasts a famed scriptorium where scribes copy, translate or illuminate books. The suspicious recent death of the monk Adelmo of Otranto âa young but famous manuscript illuminatorâ has stirred fears among the abbey's inhabitants. The Abbot seeks help from William, known for his deductive powers. Adelmo's death cannot be a suicide because his body was found below a tower with only a window which cannot be opened. William is reluctant, but also drawn by the intellectual challenge and his desire to disprove fears of a demonic culprit. William also fears the abbot will summon officials of the Inquisition if the mystery remains unsolved. William soon concludes that Adelmo's death was indeed suicide; he fell from a different tower. Nevertheless, Venantius, a Greek translator âand the last to speak with Adelmoâ is found dead in a vat filled with the blood of slaughtered pigs. The translator's corpse bears a black stain on a finger and his tongue. At a loss, William insists that Adelmo killed himself and that the translator's death can be reasonably explained. The other monks suspect a supernatural cause, fears reinforced when the saintly Fransciscan monk Ubertino of Casale warns that the deaths resemble signs mentioned in the Book of Revelation.

The two men, catalysts for political convulsions on both sides of the Atlantic, discussed \\"freedom and winning,\\" UKIP sources said. Their meeting was an embarrassment for Downing Street and stellar political theatre - but perhaps only that. Nigel Farage knows Mr Trump, but wields no power. The challenge for the UK government now is to build bridges with a new American administration it didn't want, and didn't expect to win. Mr Trump's call for a ban on Muslims entering the US at the end of 2015 led to a debate in Parliament on whether he should be barred from the UK while Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, who was then Mayor of London, said Mr Trump must be \\"out of his mind\\". Mr Trump's spokeswoman Kellyanne Conway said Saturday's meeting between the two men in Trump Tower had been \\"very productive\\" and that they had talked about \\"freedom and winning and what all this means for the world\\". Mr Farage, who said Mr Trump \\"was relaxed, and full of good ideas\\", had joked on the way to the encounter that he was \\"just a tourist\\". A UKIP spokesman had previously confirmed that Mr Farage asked Mr Trump to return a bust of Sir Winston Churchill to the White House Oval Office. Mr Farage said he had been \\"especially pleased\\" by Mr Trump's \\"very positive reaction\\" to the idea. A UKIP source said the meeting, held on 12 November, had \\"made the prime minister look very foolish\\". Mrs May plans to visit Mr Trump in the first three months of next year after his inauguration. The prime minister has said she hopes the two will be able to work on areas of mutual interest to enhance the special relationship between the two countries although some have said the government has no links with the Trump camp and will have to \\"start from scratch\\". Crispin Blunt, chairman of the foreign affairs select committee, described as \\"completely implausible\\" the idea that Mr Farage would have an ambassadorial role in a Trump administration, telling the BBC there was \\"no need for Nigel\\". Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he understood the appeal of Mr Trump's rhetoric to people angry at being \\"left behind\\" by globalisation but he said the president-elect needed to \\"grow up\\" when it came to his views on immigration. Mr Corbyn, whose wife is Mexican, said the US economy was reliant on migrant labour and plans to build a wall on the border had caused \\"anger and outrage\\". \\"I think the treatment of Mexico by the US, just as much as the absurd, abusive language to Muslims, is something that should be challenged and has to be challenged,\\" he told the BBC's Andrew Marr show. Summary:","response":"Nigel Farage, a UK politician, met with President-elect Donald Trump. He said that Trump is a supporter of the UK and wants to be good friends with them. Trump, who will start his job as President in January, has said the UK is a \\"special place\\". Farrell also said that Trump's team likes the UK and they should all work together.

Question: suppose if bats are in a closed space happens, how will it affect LESS EXTENSIVE flooding. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","response":"When considering the effect of bats in a closed space on less extensive flooding, it is essential to first evaluate the overall role of bats in a given ecological system. Bats are known to play an essential role in controlling insect populations. They consume vast quantities of insects, which can aid in reducing the number of potential disease carriers like mosquitos, as well as pest species that could damage agricultural crops. Now, let's examine how the presence of bats in a closed space may interact with less extensive flooding. 1. Water levels rise due to heavy rainfall or a dam breach: In this stage, the presence of bats in a closed space has no direct influence on the water levels of a river or lake. Their effect on less extensive flooding is not significant at this point. 2. Water builds up on the ground and covers streets: Bats have less of an impact on water build-up on the ground. Their confined presence may moderately influence the insect population in the immediate area, but this does not play a significant role in mitigating less extensive flooding in the overall vicinity. 3. Water gets deep in some places and goes into houses and other buildings: The presence of bats in a closed space may have some minor impact on the damages caused by less extensive flooding. As bats consume insects, they can theoretically reduce the number of disease-carrying insects that might proliferate in the floodwaters. However, this effect is mostly minimal, as the presence of water in houses and buildings still poses a more significant threat to public health. 4. The rain stops or the dam is repaired, and water flows into streams: Here, the presence of bats in a closed space does not have any direct influence on the receding floodwaters. The bats can continue to play their indirect role in insect control, but they do not significantly affect this stage of less extensive flooding. 5. The rest of the floodwater evaporates: The presence of bats in a closed space again plays a minimal role. Their impact on less extensive flooding remains small during the evaporation process. In conclusion, the presence of bats in a closed space has a minor impact on less extensive flooding. While they do contribute to controlling insect populations—which could decrease the spread of disease and damage to vegetation—their effect on the actual flooding process is minimal. The perturbation of bats being in a closed space has a less significant influence on the second effect mentioned, i.e., water levels of a river or lake getting higher. Hence, the supposed perturbation's influence on less extensive flooding can be considered to have a less significant effect overall."},{"question":"Question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the full name of the drummer that finished the arena tour after health issues cause the touring drummer to drop out?

Since the previous tour five years earlier, much of the band had moved on in their careers, and only drummer Jerome Dillon rejoined. To find replacements, Reznor held auditions during December 2004. He stated that keyboardist Alessandro Cortini \\"fit in immediately\\", though he had trouble finding a guitarist to replace Robin Finck until auditioning Aaron North. The tour began with a series of small-club performances early in 2005. The band told journalists they were \\"pleasantly surprised by the interest\\" of fans despite their lengthy absence. This initial leg of the tour also included a headlining performance at Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. The band followed with a North American arena tour in autumn 2005, supported by Queens of the Stone Age, Death From Above 1979, Autolux, and Saul Williams. Williams performed on stage with Nine Inch Nails at the Voodoo Music Experience festival during a headlining appearance in hurricane-stricken New Orleans, Reznor's former home.

The gruesome find was uncovered behind a 'false wall' in the basement of the home the woman had shared with her late husband, police said. Joann Nichols' remains were found inside a large plastic bin, inside a plastic bag and wrapped in a sheet, said Dr. Kari Reiber, the Dutchess County Medical Examiner. \\"The body was skeletonized and the hands were tied with rope. ... A large area of the right side of the skull was also missing,\\" Reiber said. Sealing the body in the plastic bin behind a false wall might have been enough to mask the smell as the body decomposed, she said. Members of the medical examiner's office removed the body after it was found Friday and were able to identify Nichols through dental records. An autopsy showed the cause of death was blunt force trauma to the head, according to Reiber. Nichols, a 55-year-old former first-grade teacher at Gayhead Elementary School in Hopewell Junction New York, was reported missing on December 21, 1985, by her husband, James Nichols. Police said he called in the report after his wife didn't show up for a hair appointment at a beauty parlor earlier that day. The next day the couple's vehicle was discovered in the parking lot of a shopping center in the town. Police Chief Thomas Mauro said an intensive investigation followed, but the woman was never located. The case had remained open since 1985 and was reviewed annually by police, he said. James Nichols was found dead in the home on December 27 after concerned neighbors called police because they had not seen him in several days. He was 82 and died of natural causes, police said. Officers said they found the house filled with personal items, debris and garbage. No one in Nichols' family came forward to claim his body or take control of his estate, so Dutchess County Commissioner of Finance Pamela Barrack was appointed as temporary administrator, according to Barrack's attorney, Kelly Traver. \\"We were only able to locate two family members of Mr. Nichols, but they were not able to claim his body,\\" Traver said. Nichols was buried by the Dutchess County Department of Community and Family Services in an unknown location, Traver said. The Town of Poughkeepsie Police Department said it has not closed the case and will continue to examine the new forensic evidence. \\"It's now safe to say James Nichols is a suspect in this case,\\" said police Capt. Paul LeComte. The Town of Poughkeepsie surrounds the City of Poughkeepsie in southeastern New York State, about 70 miles north of New York City.

Montreal, on the other hand, produces a large percentage of their electricity through the use of nuclear fission thanks to the large number of nuclear power pants in that state. and a hint : In the U.S., the majority of electricity is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels. This causes air pollution, acid rain, and global warming. Fossil fuels are also limited and may eventually run out. Like fossil fuels, radioactive elements are limited. In fact, they are relatively rare, so they could run out sooner rather than later. On the other hand, nuclear fission does not release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with burning fossil fuels. This is the major advantage of using nuclear fission as a source of energy. Please answer this question : Which city, Seattle or Montreal, will experience fewer environmental problems? Answer:","response":"Montreal will experience fewer environmental problems. Step 1: Compare the sources of electricity production in both cities. - Seattle: Primarily relies on burning fossil fuels, particularly coal. - Montreal: Primarily relies on nuclear fission through the presence of nuclear power plants. Step 2: Evaluate the environmental impact of each energy source. - Burning fossil fuels: Causes air pollution, acid rain, and global warming. These resources are limited, and their impact on the environment is significant. - Nuclear fission: Does not release air pollution, nor does it cause environmental problems like those associated with burning fossil fuels. The major advantage of nuclear fission is the reduced environmental impact compared to fossil fuels. However, radioactive elements used for nuclear fission are also limited and may run out. Step 3: Determine which city will likely experience fewer environmental problems based on their sources of electricity production. - Since Montreal primarily relies on nuclear fission, which has fewer environmental impacts than burning fossil fuels, it is likely to experience fewer environmental problems compared to Seattle, which primarily relies on burning fossil fuels."},{"question":"With the growth of the Internet and the ease of publishing content, more and more creative minds are coming online to share videos, music, software, products, services, opinions, and more. While the technology has empowered a generation to build new audiences and share interesting things, an unfortunate side-effect has been a culture in which some consumers of this content have provided feedback in a form that is personalized, mean-spirited, disrespectful, and in some cases, malicious. We have all seen it…the trolls, the haters, the comment boxes filled with venom and vitriol, typically pointed at people just trying to do good and interesting things. Unfortunately, this conduct can be jarring for many people, with some going as far to give up sharing their creative endeavours so as not to deal with the “wrath of the Internet”. As some of you will know, this has been bothering me for a while now. While there is no silver bullet for solving these issues, one thing I have learned over the years is how to put negative, anti-social, and non-constructive comments and feedback into perspective. To help others with this I have written a free book called Dealing With Disrespect. Dealing With Disrespect is a short, simple to read, free book that provides a straight-forward guide for handling this kind of challenging feedback, picking out the legitimate criticism to learn from, and how to not just ignore the haters, but how to manage them. The book helps put all communication, whether on or offline, into perspective and helps you to become a better communicator yourself.

Presuming he denies the charge, Costa will find out his fate before the game against the champions. VIDEO Scroll down for Chelsea vs Manchester City preview: Stats, facts and betting odds. Diego Costa was training with Chelsea on Thursday after being charged by the FA for stamping on Emre Can. Costa has scored 17 goals this season but looks set to miss out on the game against Manchester City. Costa took part in full training but Cesc Fabregas was a notably absentee for the Blues. Andre Schurrle was put through his paces at Cobham but looks set to leave Chelsea before February 2. John Terry fends of Ramires (with Oscar watching on) as Chelsea play keep-ball during training. Loic Remy performs a drill in training under the watchful eye of Chris Jones and manager Jose Mourinho. That's down to the Premier League's fast-track protocol with retrospective punishment if officials miss incidents on the field of play. Michael Oliver didn't spot Costa plunging his studs into the ankle of Can at Stamford Bridge and thus the FA were able to act with the referee's blessing. Costa has since contested the charge and is set to find out his fate on Friday afternoon. Thibaut Courtois gets down to a low shot during a one-on-one goalkeeping session. Terry attempts to nip the ball away from Costa with Willian and Eden Hazard close by. Cesar Azpilicueta is set to start at left back as Manchester City arrive at Stamford Bridge this weekend. Costa shares a joke with Brazilian Oscar as Hazard laughs towards the back of the group. The 17-goal man is almost certain to watch from the stands against City; it looks that Cesc Fabregas will as well after sustaining a hamstring injury on Tuesday night.

Questions: Many random citizens would use an entrance hall to enter this sort of building. What is it? Options: - school - public building - large building - auditorum - convention center A:","response":"The best option that aligns with common sense to answer the question is a public building. A public building is one that is designed for use by the general public, such as a library, government office, or community center. It is most likely that many random citizens would use an entrance hall to enter into a public building as it caters to different people and serves various purposes for the community. While it is true that schools, large buildings, auditoriums, and convention centers may also have entrance halls, these types of buildings typically serve a more specific group of people or purpose. For example, schools are primarily for students and staff, large buildings might contain private offices or apartments, auditoriums are mostly used for events or performances, and convention centers generally host special events or conferences. While these buildings may have an entrance hall, they might not necessarily have as many random citizens pass through their halls as a public building would. Therefore, considering the nature of the question and options provided, a public building best fits the scenario where many random citizens would use an entrance hall to enter the building."},{"question":"You are given a sentence in Galician.

Solve 164*l + 90*l + 4277 + 8125 = 20*l for l.","response":"To solve the given equation, 164*l + 90*l + 4277 + 8125 = 20*l for l, we need to follow these steps: Step 1: Combine like terms. We need to group all the terms that have the variable l and all the constants together. We have two terms with the variable l on the left-hand side (LHS) of the equation: 164*l + 90*l When we add these together, we get: 254*l Now, let's take care of the constants on (LHS): 4277 + 8125 When we add these together, we get: 12,402 So, the equation becomes: 254*l + 12,402 = 20*l Step 2: Move all the terms with the variable to one side and the constants to the other. We want to get the variable l alone on one side of the equation, so we need to eliminate the 20*l term from the right-hand side (RHS): To do this, subtract 20*l from both sides: 254*l - 20*l + 12,402 = 20*l - 20*l This simplifies to: 234*l + 12,402 = 0 Now, we need to eliminate the constant 12,402 from the left-hand side. We do this by subtracting it from both sides: 234*l = -12,402 Step 3: Solve for l. Now that we have isolated the variable term, we can solve for l by dividing both sides by the coefficient of l, which is 234: l = -12,402 ÷ 234 l ≈ -53 So, the solution for the given equation is l ≈ -53."},{"question":"Translate the following sentence to Finnish: Suspicions that the Egyptian authorities turned a blind eye to or even encouraged religious violence should be dispersed by a firm undertaking that the Christian community will be safe in Egypt.","response":"Epäilykset siitä, että Egyptin viranomaiset eivät ole puuttuneet tai ovat jopa kannustaneet uskonnolliseen väkivaltaan, tulisi hälventää sitoutumalla vankasti siihen, että kristitty yhteisö voi elää turvallisesti Egyptissä."},{"question":"As the Universe expands, galaxies move further and further apart.

Imagine that the given text is a social media post, and you have to write the title of the post, so the users can decide to read the main text or not. Throwaway account, posting via mobile, I’m going to try to give enough information. This happened today. I work at a daycare. My job is incredibly diverse, and we have kids, parents and staff of all walks of life. My bosses realize we all have lives outside of work, and as long as it doesn’t not affect our work, they don’t really judge what we do outside of our scheduled hours. I have a 20 year old coworker who lives with her 20 year old boyfriend and their 2 1/2 year old son. Since we work at a daycare, her son is enrolled and is in my classroom, while she teaches in a different room. Both her and her boyfriend smoke weed. Her boyfriend more so than her, and is someone who smokes multiple times a day (no judgement here, my boyfriend is the same way). However, the issue is, her son, or specifically her son’s lunchbox will sometimes smell like weed. I know she has been talked to about this three times: once by me, once by the other teacher in my room and once by another coworker who she is close with. None of these times management has been involved, however I do not know if outside of these three instances she has been talked to about it as well. We keep all our kids lunchboxes in a locked floor cabinet. Today when I walked passed it I got a hint of something that smelt like weed. When I opened the cabinet the smell was definitely there and my coworker’s son’s lunchbox reeked. So today I went to the boss in private and said “hey the cabinet where we keep our lunchboxes smells like weed. I’d rather be the one to tell you before another parent says something. You can tell who’s lunchbox it’s coming from.” My boss proceeded to remove the lunchbox from the cabinet and store it in the office. I’m not sure if anything else was done. At the time I was genuinely thinking it would be bad if another parent reported it. Now, after the fact, I’m feeling guilty and as though I snitched. I’m truly conflicted.

In 1928 the Baird Television Development Company achieved the first transatlantic television transmission. Baird's early technological successes and his role in the practical introduction of broadcast television for home entertainment have earned him a prominent place in television's history. Context: Baird made many contributions to the field of electronic television after mechanical systems had taken a back seat. In 1939, he showed a system known today as hybrid colour using a cathode ray tube in front of which revolved a disc fitted with colour filters, a method taken up by CBS and RCA in the United States. As early as 1940, Baird had started work on a fully electronic system he called the \\"Telechrome\\". Early Telechrome devices used two electron guns aimed at either side of a phosphor plate. The phosphor was patterned so the electrons from the guns only fell on one side of the patterning or the other. Using cyan and magenta phosphors, a reasonable limited-colour image could be obtained. He also demonstrated the same system using monochrome signals to produce a 3D image (called \\"stereoscopic\\" at the time). In 1941, he patented and demonstrated this system of three-dimensional television at a definition of 500 lines. On 16 August 1944, he gave the world's first demonstration of a practical fully electronic colour television display. His 600-line colour system used triple interlacing, using six scans to build each picture. Similar concepts were common through the 1940s and 50s, differing primarily in the way they re-combined the colours generated by the three guns. One of them, the Geer tube, was similar to Baird's concept, but used small pyramids with the phosphors deposited on their outside faces, instead of Baird's 3D patterning on a flat surface. In 1943, the Hankey Committee was appointed to oversee the resumption of television broadcasts after the war. Baird persuaded them to make plans to adopt his proposed 1000-line Telechrome electronic colour system as the new post-war broadcast standard. The picture resolution on this system would have been comparable to today's HDTV (High Definition Television). The Hankey Committee's plan lost all momentum partly due to the challenges of postwar reconstruction. The monochrome 405-line standard remained in place until 1985 in some areas, and the 625-line system was introduced in 1964 and (PAL) colour in 1967. A demonstration of large screen three-dimensional television by the BBC was reported in March 2008, over 60 years after Baird's demonstration. Question: did he face any other challenges?. Whats the answer?","response":"Yes, John Logie Baird faced several challenges throughout his career, both technical and externally imposed. Some of the key challenges he encountered include: 1. Technical limitations: During Baird's early experiments, he faced significant technical limitations with the mechanical systems. The image resolution and overall performance of these mechanical televisions were far from ideal, and improvements were slow and difficult. This ultimately led to the development of electronic television systems, which outperformed the mechanical systems and became the dominant technology. 2. Financial constraints: During his career, Baird struggled to find consistent financial support for his television experiments. He had to self-finance most of his projects and relied on occasional investments from friends, family, and wealthy patrons. These financial constraints often hampered his ability to pursue more advanced and ambitious projects. 3. Competition and skepticism: As an inventor working on a groundbreaking technology, Baird faced competition from other inventors who were also developing electronic television systems, such as Philo Farnsworth and Vladimir Zworykin. Furthermore, many in the scientific and engineering communities were skeptical of Baird's work, questioning whether television could ever become a viable technology for mass entertainment and communication. 4. World War II: The Second World War significantly disrupted Baird's work. His laboratory was destroyed during the London bombings in 1941, and the British government ceased television broadcasts in 1939 due to the fear that enemy aircraft could use the signals for navigational purposes. After the war, the Hankey Committee, which Baird had convinced to adopt his Telechrome electronic color system, lost momentum due to the challenges of post-war reconstruction, and the 405-line monochrome standard remained in place for years. 5. Health issues: Throughout his life, Baird suffered from numerous health problems. He contracted a severe case of the flu during World War I and remained in poor health for the rest of his life. These health issues often impeded his progress and limited his ability to work on his inventions. Despite these challenges, John Logie Baird remains a pioneer in the development of television technology. His contributions to the field, ranging from the first working television system to early color television and 3D imaging technology, have had a lasting impact and earned him a prominent place in television's history."},{"question":"Given the question: Pick the option in line with common sense to answer the question.

In applying statistics to, e.g., a scientific, industrial, or social problem, it is conventional to begin with a statistical population or a statistical model process to be studied. Populations can be diverse topics such as \\"all people living in a country\\" or \\"every atom composing a crystal\\". Statistics deals with all aspects of data including the planning of data collection in terms of the design of surveys and experiments. - An experiment is a procedure carried out to support, refute, or validate a hypothesis. Experiments provide insight into cause-and-effect by demonstrating what outcome occurs when a particular factor is manipulated. Experiments vary greatly in goal and scale, but always rely on repeatable procedure and logical analysis of the results. There also exists natural experimental studies. - Analysis is the process of breaking a complex topic or substance into smaller parts in order to gain a better understanding of it. The technique has been applied in the study of mathematics and logic since before Aristotle (384322 B.C.), though \\"analysis\\" as a formal concept is a relatively recent development. - In statistics , a generalized additive model ( GAM ) is a generalized linear model in which the linear predictor depends linearly on unknown smooth functions of some predictor variables , and interest focuses on inference about these smooth functions . GAMs were originally developed by Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani to blend properties of generalized linear models with additive models . The model relates a univariate response variable , Y , to some predictor variables , xi. An exponential family distribution is specified for Y ( for example normal , binomial or Poisson distributions ) along with a link function g ( for example the identity or log functions ) relating the expected value of Y to the predictor variables via a structure such as g ( operatorname ( E ) ( Y ) ) = beta_0 + f_1 ( x_1 ) + f_2 ( x_2 ) + cdots + f_m ( x_m ) . , ! The functions fi ( xi ) may be functions with a specified parametric form ( for example a polynomial , or a coefficient depending on the levels of a factor variable ) or may be specified non-parametrically , or semi-parametrically , simply as ' smooth functions ' , to be estimated by non-parametric means . So a typical GAM might use a scatterplot smoothing function , such as a locally weighted mean , for f1 ( x1 ) , and then use a factor model for f2 ( x2 ) . This flexibility to allow non-parametric fits with relaxed assumptions on the actual relationship between response and predictor , provides the potential for better fits to data than purely parametric models , but arguably with some loss of interpretability . - In statistics, a population is a set of similar items or events which is of interest for some question or experiment. A statistical population can be a group of actually existing objects (e.g. the set of all stars within the Milky Way galaxy) or a hypothetical and potentially infinite group of objects conceived as a generalization from experience (e.g. the set of all possible hands in a game of poker). A common aim of statistical analysis is to produce information about some chosen population. - Debt, AIDS, Trade, Africa (DATA) was a multinational non-government organization founded in January 2002 in London by U2's Bono along with Bobby Shriver and activists from the Jubilee 2000 Drop the Debt campaign. - A statistical model is a class of mathematical model, which embodies a set of assumptions concerning the generation of some sample data, and similar data from a larger population. A statistical model represents, often in considerably idealized form, the data-generating process. - In statistics, multicollinearity (also collinearity) is a phenomenon in which two or more predictor variables in a multiple regression model are highly correlated, meaning that one can be linearly predicted from the others with a substantial degree of accuracy. In this situation the coefficient estimates of the multiple regression may change erratically in response to small changes in the model or the data. Multicollinearity does not reduce the predictive power or reliability of the model as a whole, at least within the sample data set; it only affects calculations regarding individual predictors. That is, a multiple regression model with correlated predictors can indicate how well the entire bundle of predictors predicts the outcome variable, but it may not give valid results about any individual predictor, or about which predictors are redundant with respect to others. - The curse of dimensionality refers to various phenomena that arise when analyzing and organizing data in high-dimensional spaces (often with hundreds or thousands of dimensions) that do not occur in low-dimensional settings such as the three-dimensional physical space of everyday experience. The expression was coined by Richard E. Bellman when considering problems in dynamic optimization. - Nonparametric regression is a category of regression analysis in which the predictor does not take a predetermined form but is constructed according to information derived from the data. Nonparametric regression requires larger sample sizes than regression based on parametric models because the data must supply the model structure as well as the model estimates. - Model selection is the task of selecting a statistical model from a set of candidate models, given data. In the simplest cases, a pre-existing set of data is considered. However, the task can also involve the design of experiments such that the data collected is well-suited to the problem of model selection. Given candidate models of similar predictive or explanatory power, the simplest model is most likely to be the best choice. - A statistic (singular) or sample statistic is a single measure of some attribute of a sample (e.g., its arithmetic mean value). It is calculated by applying a function (statistical algorithm) to the values of the items of the sample, which are known together as a set of data. - In statistics and machine learning, one of the most common tasks is to fit a \\"model\\" to a set of training data, so as to be able to make reliable predictions on general untrained data. In overfitting, a statistical model describes random error or noise instead of the underlying relationship. Overfitting occurs when a model is excessively complex, such as having too many parameters relative to the number of observations. A model that has been overfit has poor predictive performance, as it overreacts to minor fluctuations in the training data. - In statistics, an additive model (AM) is a nonparametric regression method. It was suggested by Jerome H. Friedman and Werner Stuetzle (1981) and is an essential part of the ACE algorithm. The \\"AM\\" uses a one-dimensional smoother to build a restricted class of nonparametric regression models. Because of this, it is less affected by the curse of dimensionality than e.g. a \\"p\\"-dimensional smoother. Furthermore, the \\"AM\\" is more flexible than a standard linear model, while being more interpretable than a general regression surface at the cost of approximation errors. Problems with \\"AM\\" include model selection, overfitting, and multicollinearity. - In statistics, the generalized linear model (GLM) is a flexible generalization of ordinary linear regression that allows for response variables that have error distribution models other than a normal distribution. The GLM generalizes linear regression by allowing the linear model to be related to the response variable via a \\"link function\\" and by allowing the magnitude of the variance of each measurement to be a function of its predicted value. What is the relationship between 'generalized additive model' and 'statistical model'? A:","response":"The relationship between a generalized additive model (GAM) and a statistical model lies in the fact that a GAM is a specific type of statistical model. In other words, the generalized additive model is a subcategory within the broader range of statistical models. A statistical model is a class of mathematical models that represents a set of assumptions concerning the generation of sample data from a larger population. It captures the data-generating process in an idealized form to enable statistical inferences, predictions, and descriptions of the relationships between variables. A generalized additive model (GAM), on the other hand, is a specific kind of statistical model that blends properties of generalized linear models with additive models. In a GAM, the linear predictor depends on unknown smooth functions of predictor variables. It allows for more flexible and non-parametric relationships between the response and predictor variables, which can potentially lead to better fits to data than purely parametric models. This flexibility comes at the cost of some interpretability. In summary, the relationship between a GAM and a statistical model is that the GAM falls under the broader category of statistical models, where it represents a specific type of model that allows more flexibility in capturing relationships between variables."},{"question":"Available options: (i).

Understanding exactly the needs of his future students, he planned to open classes of the following profiles: platform PSP (one group), platform PC (three groups), platform GB (one) and platform Mac (cancelled due to a lack of interest). The school received an astonishing number of applications (four for each spot), which meant that many kids spent their days playing computer games and that many parents wanted time for themselves. To be accepted, young candidates had to demonstrate their social and psychological maturity and computer instincts, evaluated according to a patented method developed by Mr. Jedynak. The parents, on the other hand, had to pass an exam in using a joystick and provide a proof of income of at least 7000 zloty per month for a young family member. During the registration process was so competitive, it ended in violence. A disappointed father of a child who didn't get in, shouted that only VIP brats had been accepted, for which he got hit in the face by editor Furtok, in private - a father of a kid who got in to group B2/platform PC. Question: How did editor Furtok feel about the disappointed father to didn't get in the program? === The answer to the above question is A:","response":"(iv).

They \\"reconstituted the polity and established a constitutional form of self-government, complete with constitutions and laws, elections and representatives.\\" In other words, the micro-society set up within the lodges constituted a normative model for society as a whole. This was especially true on the Continent: when the first lodges began to appear in the 1730s, their embodiment of British values was often seen as threatening by state authorities. For example, the Parisian lodge that met in the mid 1720s was composed of English Jacobite exiles. Furthermore, freemasons all across Europe explicitly linked themselves to the Enlightenment as a whole. In French lodges, for example, the line \\"As the means to be enlightened I search for the enlightened\\" was a part of their initiation rites. British lodges assigned themselves the duty to \\"initiate the unenlightened\\". This did not necessarily link lodges to the irreligious, but neither did this exclude them from the occasional heresy.

Danish researchers have found evidence that suggests ancient cultures in Greenland were making tools from a meteorite they found on the ice more than 1,200 years ago. This was nearly 300 years before Norse settlers from Iceland arrived in Greenland and are thought to have brought iron with them made from ore on Earth. Prehistoric Eskimos made spears like the one above with a point made from iron mined from a meteorite. With no metal naturally accessible in Greenland, the discovery suggests that the meteorite was responsible for kickstarting the Iron Age in the country and allowing the native hunters to develop new metal technology. The meteorite is thought to have crashed into the Greenland ice sheet around the Cape York Peninsula in north west Greenland, around 10,000 years ago and split into at least eight large pieces. Greenland is one of the largest frozen landscapes in the world, with much of the land covered with giant ice sheets. The first humans are thought to have arrived in Greenland around 2500 BC, and was repeatedly colonised by waves of immigration from the islands north of Canada. The first Paleo=Eskimo cultures to arrive on Greenland were the Saqqaq culture, who appear to have intermittently inhabited the western reaches of the country island between 2500BC and 800BC. Two other unique cultures, known as the Independence Cultures also arose on Greenland over the same period until the Dorest Culture arrived in 700BC. They continued until 1300AD, although the early Inuit Thules began arriving around 1100AD. It is thought that the Thule's take over of the trade in meteorite iron is thought to have been partly responsible for the demise of the Dorset culture. The Norse began settling in the southern part of Greenland in around 980AD before spreading and bringing with them iron from elsewhere in Europe. Among them was an enormous lump of iron known as Ahighito, or the Tent, which weighs around 31 tons, a 22 ton piece called The Man, a 2.5 ton chunk called the Woman and the Dog, weighing half a ton. These are now all housed at the American Museum of Natural History after being transported there by arctic explorers in the 19th century. However, archaeologists from the National Museum of Denmark have now found evidence that the native 'Paleo-Eskimos' who lived in the area had been knocking fragments off these boulders for hundreds of years. They found piles of basalt stones weighing up to 40kg (88lbs) that had been carried to the locations where the meteorites were found where they were used to hammer pieces off the meteorites. The metal was then used to forge a knife or harpoon blade. Dr Martin Appelt, an archaeologist from the National Museum of Denmark, told online magazine Polarfronten: 'We knew the locations because what we have here are large scientific objects, but the story of the meteorites as the whole area's source of iron have sunk into oblivion.' Together with a team of archaeologists from Denmark and Greenland, Dr Appelt and his colleagues discovered huge piles of hammer stones. Mikkel Myrup, an archaeoloigst from the Greenland National Museum, measured the piles using a drone and estimates that they may contain up to 70 tonnes of hammer stones. The Ahnighito, or Tent, fragment of the Cape York meteorite, above, weighs 34 tons but was mined for iron. The Agpalilik fragment, also called the Man, of the meteorite now sits outside the Geological Museum in Copenhagen (seen above) but the iron rich space rock brought new material for weapons to Greenland. The 34 ton Ahnighito meteorite fragment was mined for centuries before it was moved by American polar explorer Robert Peary, seen above posing next to the meteorite in its original location, to the United States. This would suggest that huge amounts of iron had been mined from the meteorites over the years. 'They did a heck of a lot of hammering,' said Dr Jens Fog Jensen, another archaeologist involved in the research from the National Museum of Denmark. 'The blacksmiths would start by knocking off a small piece, thoroughly beating it flat and giving it a sharp edge, then hardening it further so that it could serve as an arrowhead or flensing knife.' Analysis on iron tools from the area show that it had come from these meteorites as they have a distinctive chemical signature that includes traces of nickel. The meteorite broke up over the Cape York Peninsula in north west Greenland, scattering on the ice sheet. Polar explorers transported the Ahnighito meteorite fragment to the American Museum of Natural History. It is through early Eskimos, also known as the Dorset people, began exploiting the iron in the meteorites in the mid eighth century. When the Thules, an early Inuit people, arrived in the 12th century, they took over the trade in meteorite iron. Weapons made from the meteorites have been found as far away as Canada. In southern Greenland, which was the first area to be occupied by the Norsemen, just one single fragment of the meteorite has been found. It is thought that they had no need to use the meteorite iron as they had access to iron from terrestrial ore. Dr Appelt added: 'It has been traded over large distances and testifies to the significance of the meteorites from the Thule as a source of iron in the Eastern Arctic.' Summarize the highlights of this article.","response":"Archaeologists from the National Museum of Denmark have discovered that prehistoric hunters in Greenland lived through a 'Meteorite Age', where they mined metal from fallen space rocks to make weapons.

We need to solve it for \\"a.\\" Let's work together step by step: 1. Firstly, we have two things with \\"a\\" in them: -56*a and 74*a. 2. We can add these together, just like how we would add apples. If we had -56 apples and then got 74 more apples, we would have 18 apples left, right? 3. So, now we have 18*a + 18 = 0. 4. Now it's like saying we have 18 sets of \\"a\\" and 18 extra things, and they all add up to zero. 5. To solve it, we need to cancel out the +18 on one side, so we subtract 18 from both sides of the equation: 18*a + 18 - 18 = 0 - 18 Here, on the left side: +18 and -18 cancel each other, so we have just 18*a left. On the right side: 0 - 18 gives us -18. 6. Now we have 18*a = -18. 7. To find what \\"a\\" is, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 18: (18*a) / 18 = -18 / 18 On the left side: 18 divided by 18 is 1, so we have just \\"1a\\" or \\"a\\" left.

Sir Henry Joseph Wood (3 March 1869 – 19 August 1944) was an English conductor best known for his association with London's annual series of promenade concerts, known as the Proms. He conducted them for nearly half a century, introducing hundreds of new works to British audiences. After his death, the concerts were officially renamed in his honour as the \\"Henry Wood Promenade Concerts\\", although they continued to be generally referred to as \\"the Proms\\". Born in modest circumstances to parents who encouraged his musical talent, Wood started his career as an organist. During his studies at the Royal Academy of Music, he came under the influence of the voice teacher Manuel Garcia and became his accompanist. After similar work for Richard D'Oyly Carte's opera companies on the works of Arthur Sullivan and others, Wood became the conductor of a small operatic touring company. He was soon engaged by the larger Carl Rosa Opera Company. One notable event in his operatic career was conducting the British premiere of Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin in 1892. From the mid-1890s until his death, Wood focused on concert conducting. He was engaged by the impresario Robert Newman to conduct a series of promenade concerts at the Queen's Hall, offering a mixture of classical and popular music at low prices. The series was successful, and Wood conducted annual promenade series until his death in 1944. By the 1920s, Wood had steered the repertoire entirely to classical music. When the Queen's Hall was destroyed by bombing in 1941, the Proms moved to the Royal Albert Hall. Wood declined the chief conductorships of the New York Philharmonic and Boston Symphony Orchestras, believing it his duty to serve music in the United Kingdom. In addition to the Proms, he conducted concerts and festivals throughout the country and also trained the student orchestra at the Royal Academy of Music. He had an enormous influence on the musical life of Britain over his long career: he and Newman greatly improved access to classical music, and Wood...","response":"In this provided article, Manuel Garcia's accompanist is Sir Henry Joseph Wood.

By mentioning the ground, it's clear that the woman is not on an elevated surface, such as a bed or bench, but rather directly on the earth or grass. 4. \\"Large\\": This adjective modifies the next word, \\"umbrella.\\" It emphasizes the size of the umbrella, illustrating that it is not just a standard or small umbrella. This detail becomes important when visualizing the overall scene, as it implies that the umbrella might be providing significant shade or covering a larger area. 5. \\"Umbrella\\": This word denotes an essential object in the sentence that influences the setting. The umbrella is likely providing shade or shelter for the woman lying on the ground, implying that there may be external factors such as sun or rain that led to its use.

Which student read more about protozoa preying upon single-celled organisms? Students learned about protozoa in school this week. Dan and Jim were interested and read more on the subject. Dan read more about predatory protozoa, while Jim read more about herbivore protozoa. Hint: Protozoa generally feed by engulfing and digesting other organisms. As consumers, they have various roles in food chains and webs. Some are predators. They prey upon other single-celled organisms, such as bacteria. In fact, protozoa predators keep many bacterial populations in check. Other protozoa are herbivores. They graze on algae. Still others are decomposers. They consume dead organic matter. There are also parasitic protozoa that live in or on living hosts. For example, the protozoan that causes malaria lives inside a human host. For their part, protozoa are important food sources for many larger organisms, including insects and worms. Answer:","response":"Dan read more about protozoa preying upon single-celled organisms, as he focused on predatory protozoa."},{"question":"Question: I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it.

Relevancy: The user appears to be reviewing an app, so in terms of relevancy, it is on point. Substantive content: The user has not actually used the app. The quality of a review often depends on the personal experience of the user. Therefore, it's problematic that this review lacks personal, firsthand experience with the app. Evidence-based opinion: Because the user has not used the app, their opinion is not evidence-based, and therefore, it lacks validity. For these reasons, the rating for this review would be a 1. The review lacks substance and an evidence-based opinion due to its absence of a firsthand user experience. It's also important to note that while the user suggests the app could be great, it's unclear why or what led them to this opinion.

The first points in the Cowboys' new home were scored by Tynes, whose 30-yard field goal in the first quarter was his first of four on the night. The Cowboys responded by scoring their first points on the ensuing drive&#8212;a 2-yard run by running back Marion Barber. Giants rookie cornerback Bruce Johnson scored his first career points returning a Tony Romo interception 34 yards. Cowboys tight end Jason Witten responded with a 1-yard touchdown pass in the second quarter. Later, Giants safety Kenny Phillips caught an odd interception off Witten's foot, setting up quarterback Eli Manning's 100th career touchdown pass&#8212;a 22-yard strike to Manningham. Romo ran a quarterback sneak to open the scoring in the second half, but the Giants sent wide receiver Steve Smith into the end zone in the fourth quarter. The Cowboys punched in one more touchdown on a 7-yard Felix Jones run, but Tynes' 37-yard field goal as time expired was enough to postpone the Cowboys' first home win in Arlington and boost the Giants to 2-0. The Giants lost two more notable players to injuries; defensive end Justin Tuck suffered a sprained shoulder and wide receiver Domenik Hixon sprained a knee. During the week, Phillips' season was brought to an end, as he was placed on injured reserve with patellofemoral arthritis. Which team scored more times during the first quarter?","response":"To determine the team that scored more times during the first quarter, let's go through their scores step by step: 1. The first points in the Cowboys' new home were scored by Tynes (Giants' player), whose 30-yard field goal in the first quarter was his first of four on the night. There is no mention of any other scoring during the first quarter. Based on the provided information, the Giants scored once during the first quarter while the Cowboys did not score in the first quarter.

It can be dangerous for a kitten to be fed cold milk when it is already cold. Feel the pads of the kitten's feet and place your finger in the kitten's mouth. Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? kittens will die if they drink cold milk when they're warm","response":"Step 1: Purchase commercial kitten milk replacer specifically designed for newborn kittens, as they require specific nutrients that cow's milk cannot provide. Step 2: Ensure that the milk replacer is properly stored at room temperature before feeding it to the kittens. Step 3: Test the kitten's temperature. It is essential to check the kitten's body temperature before feeding because feeding cold milk to a cold kitten can be dangerous. To test the kitten's temperature, gently feel the pads of its feet and place your finger in its mouth as mentioned. Step 4: If the kitten feels cold, warm it up by providing a heat source, such as a heating pad or a warm cloth. Monitor the kitten's temperature as you do this to prevent overheating. Step 5: Heat the milk replacer to a suitable temperature. Follow the instructions on the commercial milk replacer packaging, which typically recommends warming the milk to 100-105 degrees Fahrenheit (37.8-40.5 degrees Celsius). Step 6: Make sure the milk is not too hot before feeding the kitten. Test the milk temperature by placing a few drops on your wrist. It should feel slightly warm, not hot. Step 7: Feed the kitten using a bottle designed for feeding newborn kittens, or using a dropper or syringe in the absence of a kitten bottle. Gently place the nipple or dropper in the kitten's mouth and slowly release milk. The kitten should suck and swallow the warm milk. Step 8: Monitor the amount of milk consumed. A kitten typically needs to consume about 8 cc's (ml) of milk per ounce of body weight daily. Step 9: Feed kittens every 2 to 3 hours for the first 2 weeks of life, then gradually reduce the frequency as they grow. In conclusion, the mentioned sentence, \\"kittens will die if they drink cold milk when they're warm,\\" is an overgeneralization. While kittens should not drink cold milk and doing so can pose risks to their health, the statement does not specifically align with the preceding text. Instead, the focus should be on avoiding feeding cold milk to cold kittens and ensuring the proper care and feeding routine is followed for newborn kittens."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Facts: - othername: al fields - birth date: 10 june 1884 - name: a. roland fields - occupation: art director - yearsactive: 1942 - 1951 Based on these bullet points, write a short biography describing the life of a. roland fields .

Article: Beach volleyball is one of those sports that can be an exciting game to play and watch, or, can just be about some friends getting together to have a great time. It's really easy, and all you need is sand, a net and a group of people, of any age or fitness level, who want to have fun. Beach volleyball can be played with as few as two people on each team, making a total of four people. However, if you are less skilled and experienced in the game, it will be easier to play with a larger team. The more players you have, the less ground each person will be responsible for covering and the more time they will have to recover in between shots. If you only have a few players, each of you will get quite a workout running for the ball after each volley. If you are looking for that relaxing, fun, low-key experience, choose larger teams. Beach volleyball is similar to regular volleyball in its rules. However, even experienced volleyball players do not realize how much more difficult it is to run and jump on sand. Since it is harder to move quickly on sand than a hard ground, play will be much slower than regular volleyball on a playground. When a player trains for beach volleyball, he will focus on building lower body strength as well as upper body. While he needs to be able to hit the ball with a great deal of power and accuracy , strengthening his legs is extremely important. Whether you are in it for the competition, or just to have a great time with your friends, beach volleyball can be very exciting and fun. You may even start out with friends and fall in love with the sport. Question: The passage mainly tells us _ .

Lake Ontario, one of the five Great Lakes of North America, is situated in the eastern portion of the continent, primarily between the Canadian province of Ontario and the U.S. state of New York. It also shares smaller borders with the states of Pennsylvania and Ohio. The lake serves as a natural boundary between southeastern Ontario and the western part of Upstate New York. Lake Ontario is the easternmost and smallest of the Great Lakes in terms of surface area. It covers approximately 7,340 square miles (19,000 square kilometers) and boasts a maximum length of about 193 miles (311 kilometers) and a maximum width of about 53 miles (85 kilometers). The average depth of Lake Ontario is around 283 feet (86 meters), while its deepest point reaches about 802 feet (244 meters). The Great Lakes form a large part of the border between the United States and Canada, and they are interconnected by several channels and straits. Lake Ontario, in particular, is linked to Lake Erie by the Niagara River, and the two are separated by the impressive Niagara Falls. In addition, the St. Lawrence River connects Lake Ontario to the Atlantic Ocean, serving as an essential shipping route and means for commercial and recreational navigation. Several major cities and towns are situated on the shores of Lake Ontario. On the Canadian side, Toronto, the largest city of Canada, and Hamilton are two prominent urban centers. On the American side, Rochester and Oswego in New York can be found. The lake provides these cities and their surrounding regions with significant benefits, including drinking water, industrial uses, agricultural irrigation, and opportunities for recreational activities such as boating and fishing. In conclusion, Lake Ontario is a vital geographical feature situated between southeastern Ontario in Canada and western Upstate New York in the United States. It boasts a rich ecosystem and supports various economic, social, and recreational activities in the surrounding communities."},{"question":"Question: Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

Movie plot title: Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde Movie plot: In London, in 1887, prominent physician Henry Jekyll incurs the ire of his older colleagues because of his experiments and views on the possibility of separating the good and evil aspects of man's nature. Hanry is deeply in love with Beatrix Emery, the daughter of Sir Charles Emery, who likes Henry, but is concerned over his radical ideas and open display of affection for Bea. Henry throws himself into his work and has enough success experimenting with rabbits and guinea pigs to make him confident that the serun he has developed will work for humans. Hoping to try the serum out on Sam Higgins, a man who went mad after being in a gas works explosion, Henry rushes to the hospital but discovers that Higgins has just died. Henry then decides to take the serum himself and is briefly transformed, in both thought and countenance, into an evil alter ego. After taking an antidote to turn himself back to normal, Henry tells his butler, Poole, that strange voice he heard was a \\"Mr. Hyde\\".Just then, Sir Charles, accompanied by Bea, comes for a visit and announces that he will be taking Bea to the Continent to give Henry time to consider his position.

The islands are geographically part of the Virgin Islands archipelago and are located in the Leeward Islands of the Lesser Antilles. is the virgin island part of the us? Possible answers: [a]. no; [b]. yes;","response":"[b]. yes; The United States Virgin Islands (USVI) is indeed a part of the United States as an unincorporated and organized territory. Located in the Caribbean Sea, the USVI is part of the broader Virgin Islands archipelago, which also includes the British Virgin Islands and the Spanish Virgin Islands (part of Puerto Rico). The USVI is situated in the Leeward Islands of the Lesser Antilles, a chain of islands in the eastern Caribbean. With a total area of 133.73 square miles, the USVI is composed of three main islands – St. Croix, St. John, and St. Thomas, as well as many smaller islands and islets. St. Croix is the largest of the three main islands, while St. Thomas is home to the territory's capital, Charlotte Amalie. St. John, best known for its pristine natural beauty and national park, is largely undeveloped. The United States acquired the Virgin Islands from Denmark on March 31, 1917, under the terms of the Treaty of the Danish West Indies. The treaty was signed on August 4, 1916, but the U.S. Senate did not ratify it until December 17, 1916. The United States paid Denmark approximately 25 million in gold for the islands, and the transfer officially took place on March 31, 1917, when the U.S. flag was raised over the islands. The residents of the USVI hold U.S. citizenship and are represented in the U.S. Congress by a non-voting delegate, but they cannot vote in presidential elections. The USVI is governed by a locally elected governor and a unicameral legislature, but the ultimate authority of the islands rests with the U.S. President and the U.S. Congress. Since the USVI is an unincorporated territory of the United States, certain aspects of the U.S. Constitution do not fully apply to the islands, and their legal status remains a mixture of U.S. federal law and local law. The official currency of the USVI is the United States dollar, and English is the official language. The economy of the USVI is mainly driven by tourism, rum production, and some limited agricultural activity. The islands also benefit from financial aid from the United States. The rich cultural heritage of the USVI is influenced by various cultures, including African, European, and indigenous Caribbean peoples. This diverse heritage is reflected in local cuisine, music, and festivals celebrated on the islands. Overall, it can be clearly said that the United States Virgin Islands are a part of the United States as an unincorporated and organized territory, with a local government as well as federal oversight. While citizens of the USVI hold U.S. citizenship, there are some limitations to their rights and constitutional protections as a result of their status as an unincorporated territory."},{"question":"What is the final step of the following process: - The blood sugar drops in a body - Cells in the pancrease release glucagon - The liver in response turns the glucagon into glucose - And releases it into the blood","response":"The final step in this process is the restoration of blood sugar levels to a normal range, allowing the body to function properly again. This is achieved through the negative feedback mechanism when the increased blood glucose levels signal to the pancreas to stop secreting glucagon and resume the secretion of insulin. The process you've described is an essential component of glucose homeostasis in the body. When blood sugar levels drop (hypoglycemia), glucagon, a hormone secreted by the alpha cells in the pancreas, is released into the bloodstream. This hormone stimulates the liver to convert stored glycogen (a complex carbohydrate) into glucose (a simple sugar), which is then released into the bloodstream. This process is called glycogenolysis. In more extreme cases or when glycogen stores are depleted, the liver can also produce glucose from non-carbohydrate sources (such as amino acids and fat-derived glycerol) through a process called gluconeogenesis. In either case, the released glucose in the bloodstream gradually raises blood sugar levels to meet the body's energy needs and maintain normal body functions. Once blood glucose levels have returned to a normal range, the body's homeostatic mechanisms come into play. As glucose levels rise, the secretion of glucagon is reduced while insulin secretion by the beta cells in the pancreas is stimulated. Insulin is responsible for assisting cells in the body to uptake glucose from the blood, storing it as glycogen, and reducing the overall blood sugar levels. The balance between glucagon and insulin secretion ensures that blood sugar levels are maintained within a healthy range and prevent hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) or hyperglycemia (high blood sugar). This dynamic process is essential for overall metabolic health and the proper functioning of various organs, particularly the brain, which relies on adequate levels of glucose for energy production and optimal cognitive functioning. In conclusion, the final step of the described process is the restoration of blood sugar levels to a normal range through the decreased secretion of glucagon and the increased secretion of insulin by the pancreas. The intricate balance between these two hormones ensures that the body maintains proper glucose homeostasis and can respond effectively to fluctuations in blood sugar levels."},{"question":"Translate to Finnish: The consequences of the crisis are unemployment, poverty, lower incomes and less education.

It also enrolled only patients shown to have plaque in their brains using a new imaging technique. In some trials of other drugs, some of the patients turned out not to have plaque, which could have been a reason the trials were not successful. The results reported Friday were for 166 patients, who were randomly assigned to get one of several doses of the drug or a placebo. The drug not only slowed cognitive decline but also substantially reduced plaque in the brain, and higher doses were better than lower doses. Those are signs that the effects seen were from the drug. “It would be kind of hard to get those kind of results by chance,” said Dr. Rachelle S. Doody, director of the Alzheimer’s Disease and Memory Disorders Center at Baylor College of Medicine, who was not involved in the study but has been a consultant to Biogen and many other companies. On one measure of cognition, a 30-point scale called the mini-mental state exam or M.M.S.E., those receiving the placebo worsened by an average of 3.14 points over the course of a year. The decline at one year was only 0.58 points for those getting the highest dose and 0.75 points for a middle dose. The difference with a placebo was statistically significant for both doses. On another measure of both cognition and the ability to function in daily tasks, patients in the placebo group worsened by an average of 2.04 points at one year. Those getting the highest dose of the drug had a decline of only 0.59, a statistically significant difference. Image Amyloid plaque in the brain is widely believed to be a cause of the dementia in Alzheimer’s disease. The drug aducanumab is designed to get rid of the amyloid plaque. Credit Yankner Laboratory Some analysts said they would have been impressed if the drug had slowed the rate of cognitive decline by 20 or 30 percent. But the actual reduction for the high dose was above 70 percent. They said the drug’s effect was stronger than that of Lilly’s drug. A major side effect was a localized swelling in the brain, known as A.R.I.A.-E. This has been seen with other drugs in this class, though the rate for aducanumab seems higher. ||||| An experimental Alzheimer’s treatment being developed by biotechnology firm Biogen Idec seemed to slow patients’ inexorable cognitive decline in a small, preliminary study. The result will probably lead to greater hope for a new strategy for drug companies: Treat Alzheimer’s patients early, when the disease is mild, and use brain imaging to make sure that every patient already has the amyloid plaques that help cause the disease. The data, reviewed in a press release, appear to live up to the hype Biogen has created by teasing them at presentations at investor conferences over the past several months, several doctors say. But the study’s small size leaves big questions about whether the drug, known as BIIB037 or aducanumab, will prove effective in larger studies where several similar drugs have failed. More complete results will be presented this morning at the 12th International Conference on Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s Diseases and Related Neurological Disorders in Nice, France. The data are \\"convincingly encouraging,\\" says Samuel Gandy, an Alzheimer’s researcher at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine who has been skeptical of medicines that, like BIIB037, are purported to work by clearing plaques of the protein amyloid from the brain. \\"I’m willing to suspend disbelief.\\" A history of failure Several amyloid-clearing drugs have failed to show statistically significant benefits in large trials. Bapineuzumab, developed by Elan Pharmaceuticals, Pfizer , and Johnson & Johnson , failed in 2009. A similar drug from Eli Lilly, solanezumab, failed in 2012, although Lilly has pressed on, arguing that it may work in patients whose disease is at an earlier stage. A drug from Roche, gantenerumab, failed last year, although Roche is continuing with another amyloid-clearing medicine, crenezumab. Despite the huge sums of money drug companies were still willing to pour into Alzheimer’s treatments, skeptics have worried that their efforts at amyloid-clearing were simply starting too late, after the tangles that have been the hallmark of Alzheimer’s since the disease was first described by German psychiatrist Alois Alzheimer in the early 1900s had already started to do their work. \\"We thought nothing was going to work,\\" says Gandy. \\"I figured anything after conception was too late.\\" Clearing brain plaque But the results of the first 166 patients in Biogen’s early study, conducted to give the company an idea of the right dose to use and whether to continue at all, give reason for hope. For one thing, the drug clearly helped remove amyloid plaque from patients’ brains. The study used Eli Lilly’s Amyvid, a drug that makes amyloid light up on positron emission tomography (PET) scans, to look at levels of the plaque in six regions of the brain. In the placebo, levels of plaque measured using PET scans were virtually unchanged. In the lowest dose, where patients got 1 milligram of BIIB037 per kilogram of bodyweight, the standardized uptake value ration (SUVR), the measure of amyloid, decreased by 0.03, which was not significant. In the group that got 3 mg/kg, it decreased 0.087, which was significant. At 6mg/kg, it decreased 0.143, and at 10 mg/kg, it decreased by 0.205. This is what’s known as a dose response: give more drug, and more plaque gets removed. Better test scores What’s more exciting – and what investors and scientists will be arguing about – is that there also seems to be a dose response on tests of how well patients’ minds functioned. On one test, the Mini Mental State Examination, the placebo group’s score worsened by 3.14 points in one year. The decline was 2.21 in the 1 mg/kg arm, 0.75 in the 3 mg/kg arm, and 0.58 in the 10 mg/kg arm. Results in the 6 mg/kg arm are not ready. These results were statistically significant. The trend was similar on the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale. The placebo group decreased by 2.04 points, the 1 mg/kg group by 1.7, the 3 mg/kg by 1.33, and the 10 mg/kg by 0.59. Only the difference between the 10 mg/kg group and placebo was statistically significant. Even in a small study, seeing this pattern gives hope that the drug could prove effective later on. Biogen points out that this is the first drug ever to both reduce plaque and slow cognitive decline in patients with mild Alzheimer’s. Small numbers, big doubts The problem with this rosy story is that, once you get down to individual dose groups, only small numbers of patients were treated. There were 40 evaluable patients in the placebo group, 31 in the 1 mg/kg group, 33 in the 3 mg/kg group, 32 in the 10 mg/kg group, and 30in the 6mg/kg group. \\"I personally don’t put any stock in the clinical outcomes because the sample size is so small,\\" says Lon S. Schneider, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the University of Southern California’s Keck School of Medicine. He notes that just adding or subtracting a few patients from the placebo group could meaningfully change the result. Another problem is that the 40 patients in the placebo group were not really treated in parallel to the other groups (for instance, the 6 mg/kg group was started later), which could lead to differences. Schneider still thinks these data more than justify Biogen’s decision to push forward with BIIB037 into larger trials that Wall Street analysts predict could get the drug to market by 2020. But he’s much less comfortable that the cognitive data mean anything. If they don’t, there’s less reason to have increased confidence about Biogen’s drug or about other medicines being developed by Lilly or Roche, or related pills being tested by Lilly and Merck. Brain swelling and headaches Headaches occurred in 22% of patients given BIIB037, compared to 5% of the placebo-treated patients. But there was a more serious (and probably related) side effect as well: amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA), which can include edema, or swelling around the brain. The edema was more likely in patients who carry a variant of the gene APOE4, which increases a person’s risk of Alzheimer’s. These patients comprised about 2/3rds of the patient population, Biogen says. Edema was reported in 5% of the APOE4 patients in the 1 and 3 mg/kg groups; in 43% of those in the 6 mg/kg group; and in 55% of those in the 10 mg/kg group. Yes, to emphasize that: more than half the APOE4 patients had some degree of edema in the top dose group. In those without the APOE4 gene, edema was seen in 9%, 11%, and 17% of the 3, 6, and 10 mg/kg groups. Gandy said the edema could probably be managed; Schneider wanted to see more data. Both agreed that the edema might make it difficult to use the highest dose in future studies. Biogen said it was too early to talk about what dose it will use in its larger studies because it needs to talk with regulators. Picking the right patients If Biogen’s drug does work where other medicines have failed, it might be because the company has a better drug – or because it did a better job picking patients for its study. Al Sandrock, Biogen’s senior vice president and chief medical officer, says that BIIB037 was created by looking for antibodies in patients who survived into old age without getting Alzheimer’s. These patients had anti-amyloid antibodies, and one of them was turned into a drug. But this study also focused on treating early, when patients are only first starting to notice cognitive impairment, and on making sure that patients have amyloid plaque in their brains. Sandrock says that 30% of patients were rejected from the study because they didn’t have visible buildup of amyloid on PET scans. In general, investors have been doubtful that the amyloid-clearing drugs in clinical trials will prove effective. In a note to investors yesterday, analyst Timothy Anderson at Bernstein Research wrote that investors forecast only a 25% chance the drugs will reach the market and that analyst forecast no revenues for them. The Biogen Idec results seem almost too good to be true – but that’s partly because up until now the odds for amyloid-clearing Alzheimer’s treatments have seemed so bleak. Also on Forbes: ||||| A Biogen Idec Inc. drug that targets plaque buildup in the brain slowed cognitive decline in patients with early and mild forms of Alzheimer’s disease in a small, early-stage study, lifting the company’s stock to all-time highs and adding to the debate on how to treat the debilitating disease. The treatment still requires larger and longer drug trials, and may not be suitable for all patients. However, the results excited observers because of the consistency of the drug’s effects, which increased with higher doses. Analysts... ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","response":"Biogen is a company that is working on a special medicine for Alzheimer's disease.

(September 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) On January 1, 2008 at the Xcalibur Bowling Centre, a disco-themed bowling alley in Surrey, British Columbia, Egerton, the janitor, has allowed two groups of teenagers to bowl against one another after hours. The \\"prep\\", Steve, is still bitter after his best friend Jamie, the \\"jock\\", had sex with Lisa, a girl with whom Steve was smitten and even took to their senior prom. After Steve and his friends Joey, Patrick, and A.J. harass the \\"tranny\\", Sam, they are chastised by Jamie. This leads to a brawl between Steve's team and Jamie's. Lisa breaks up the fight by dropping a bowling ball on Steve's foot just as Steve is about to kick Jamie again. Egerton, brandishing a shotgun, tells the teenagers to leave and they can continue their tournament the following night. Lisa, having forgot her purse in the arcade, returns to find Steve and his friends waiting for her. Steve proceeds to violently rape Lisa while the others watch. Egerton is oblivious to Lisa's cries for help, as he is downstairs cleaning up the mess the teenagers made. After he is finished raping Lisa, Steve leaves the room. While Steve is gone, A.J. anally rapes Lisa on the pool table; then it's Joey who abuses her. Patrick, who believed the three were only going to \\"scare\\" Lisa, refuses to participate in the rape. Steve returns with a bowling pin and prepares to insert it into Lisa before Patrick intervenes. Steve retorts by giving Patrick the pin and ordering him to do it himself. Patrick refuses to do so at first but complies when Steve threatens to do the same to him. In the end Patrick penetrates Lisa with the bowling pin as she screams in pain. The four leave Lisa on the pool table, naked and barely conscious. The following night, the two groups arrive at the bowling alley to continue their tournament. Steve is joined by his...

(Associated Press) National Transportation Safety Board investigator Heidi Moats said Sunday that Sailor is \\"one remarkable young lady,\\" and she might be able to assist them in determining what brought the plane down. It is rare for someone to survive a small plane crash and Moats said they want to talk to Sailor about it. \\"Having someone that is a witness (is) always helpful in the investigation, it gives us kind of a story line,\\" Moats said. It's not clear when investigators might talk to Sailor, who despite being bloodied and suffering a broken wrist, pulled herself from the wreckage and walked to the nearest home. She was dressed for Florida, where her family had been visiting, and was wearing shorts, a short-sleeve shirt and only one sock when she found a home about a mile from the crash site. Authorities said she walked through thick woods and briar patches in near-freezing temperatures. \\"She absolutely went to the nearest house that she could have,\\" Kentucky State Police Lt. Brent White said. \\"But it was still a considerable feat for her to do that.\\" The remains of the Piper PA-34 plane were moved Sunday so officials with the NTSB can inspect it. They haven't discussed any possibilities of what brought the plane down or how Sailor survived the crash. The agency will issue a preliminary report in about 10 days, Moats said at a news conference in Eddyville. Sailor was treated at a hospital and released to a relative Saturday. After the Friday night crash, Sailor trekked to the home of 71-year-old Larry Wilkins, who answered her knock at the door and called police. Wilkins said the girl was crying and covered in blood. \\"She told me that her mom and dad were dead, and she had been in a plane crash, and the plane was upside down,\\" Wilkins said. Sailor was alert and able to point emergency workers looking for the plane in the right direction, said Lyon County Judge executive Wade White, who arrived at the crash site. The crash killed Sailor's parents, Marty Gutzler, 48; and his wife, Kimberly Gutzler, 46; Sailor's sister, Piper Gutzler, 9; and a cousin, Sierra Wilder, 14. All were from Nashville, Illinois. White said the father's body was \\"the last one they pulled out because of how deep he was buried.\\" Marty Gutzler was flying the plane, which reported engine trouble and lost contact with air traffic controllers around 5:55 p.m. CST, authorities said. Controllers tried to direct the pilot to an airport 5 to 7 miles from the crash scene. About 40 minutes later, 911 dispatchers received the call from Wilkins. The Gutzlers had been visiting family in Key West, Florida, and stopped in Tallahassee, Florida, on the way back to Mount Vernon, Illinois. Gutzler was a licensed commercial pilot and flight instructor, according to the FAA website. A woman who answered the telephone at Campagna Funeral Home in Nashville said Sunday that arrangements for Marty Gutzler, his wife and their 9-year-old daughter were pending. Sailor's family members said through a spokesman that they do not want to do any interviews at this time because they need time to grieve.

The sole survivor of the wreck was Sierra's cousin, Sailor Gutzler, 7, who managed to climb out of the plane and trek through woods and a creek to a nearby home to seek help. Sailor's father, Marty Gutzler, the pilot of the Piper twin-engine aircraft, also died in the crash along with his wife, Kimberly, and their daughter, 9-year-old Piper.

ACTION1: Not pitching in much on chores while renting a room in the landlord's house. - This action can be considered unethical in the sense that the tenant is not contributing fairly to the maintenance and cleanliness of the shared living space. While it may not cause direct harm to others, irresponsibility with shared responsibilities is unfair and can strain relationships between the landlord and tenant. ACTION2: Blocking my fiancee because of her lies. - This action can be seen as a response to a breach of trust in a relationship, which may make it justified for some. However, outright blocking someone instead of addressing the issue through proper communication could be seen as an avoidance of mature conflict resolution. This can lead to unnecessary strain on the relationship and not provide room for growth and understanding between both parties. Based on the analysis, both actions can be considered unethical in different ways, but it is not possible to conclusively identify which one is less ethical. The impact of each action might have various degrees of consequences depending on the specific circumstances. In this case, the answer is 'yes', as we cannot conclusively identify which statement is less ethical."},{"question":"Continue the following story. Saturday night William lost the blue denim jacket that he borrowed from Donald, so","response":"on Sunday morning William was feeling really worried. He knew he needed to find the blue denim jacket because it was very special to Donald. You see, a blue denim jacket is like a sweater made of a thick material called denim, and this one had a very cool design that made Donald very happy when he wore it. William thought and thought about where he could have lost the jacket. He remembered he went to the park, where kids play on swings and slides. Then he went to the ice cream shop, a place where you can buy yummy cold treats! Finally, he went to watch a movie, which is a place with a big screen where you can see and hear stories. So, William decided to go to each place and look for his friend's jacket. First, he went to the park and looked around the swings and slides, but he couldn't find it. Then, he went to the ice cream shop and asked the person who works there, called the cashier, if they found a blue denim jacket. Sadly, they didn't. Feeling a little bit sad, but still determined, William went to the movie theater. He asked the manager, who is like the boss of the movie theater, if they had found a blue denim jacket. The manager said, \\"Yes! We found it last night and kept it safe for you!\\". William was so relieved and happy that he found the jacket. He thanked the manager and rushed to Donald's house to return the blue denim jacket. Donald was so glad to have his special jacket back, and he was proud of William for being a good friend and looking for it. From then on, William always remembered to be more careful with his friends' things. And whenever Donald wore his blue denim jacket, he would smile and think of how lucky he was to have a helpful friend like William."},{"question":"The Mnet Asian Music Award for Best Collaboration is an award presented annually by CJ E&M Pictures (Mnet).

Erin was always trying to follow Sarah's correct grammar, because Available choices: (1). Erin was controlling and anal retentive.; (2). Sarah was controlling and anal retentive.;","response":"(2). Sarah was controlling and anal retentive. Sarah was a stickler for rules, a person whose meticulous attention to detail, especially in language, was almost alarming. She was the kind of woman who would tense up at the usage of present perfect tense when it should be past perfect, or visibly cringe at a misused semicolon. She had a flair for languages and a crisp, refined accent that accentuated her extensive vocabulary. Erin looked up to Sarah, she wanted to wield words with as much precision and poise. Sarah’s penchant for proper language wasn't just about enforcing rules either. She held an innate belief that words had a power, and using them incorrectly diminished that power. It was like using a scalpel as a butter knife; it might get the job done, but it completely wasted the potential of the tool. Grammar was crucial to Sarah because it was the structure that upheld the beauty and power of language. Erin found this mildly obsessive interest in grammar rather intriguing. Initially, Sarah’s grammar fixation seemed akin to a strange hobby, like a collection of rare stamps or an in-depth knowledge of bird species. Gradually, however, Erin started noticing how Sarah’s meticulousness was not just obsessive but also infectious. The more time Erin spent around Sarah, absorbing her explanations and corrections, the more Erin started caring about her own usage of language. For Erin, implementing Sarah's guidelines wasn't easy as she was someone who had always played loose and fast with language. She loved the idea of language as a playground, a place where rules were meant to be bent or even broken. Yet, seeing how Sarah’s command of language made her words impactful and persuasive, stirred a desire in Erin to understand and follow these rules more closely. Sarah’s presence in Erin's life was a powerful influence. Not only did she learn to appreciate the importance of proper language usage from Sarah, but also gained respect for the beauty and power of grammar rules. Erin used to consider grammar as a tedious set of conditions to be fulfilled, but Sarah showed her it was more like a complex puzzle with infinite possibilities, a tool to shape one's thoughts and feelings into precise, influential words. Erin started perceiving the transformation of her language, her vocabulary became richer, her expression more precise, and her communication more effective. In situations where Erin used to stumble or be misunderstood earlier, now she found herself being appreciated for her clear articulation. She noted the subtle changes in people’s reactions - their quiet admiration, their newfound respect. That's why she continued trying to follow Sarah's correct grammar. However, through it all, the challenge for Erin was to balance her newfound respect for grammar rules without completely losing her inherent style—a style that was free-flowing and full of personality. The influence of Sarah, obsessive and anal retentive with her language use, shaped Erin not just to become another Sarah, but to find a blend of both: the stringent guide of the language rules and the free spirit of language creativity. Erin continued to strive for this delicate equilibrium. She valued Sarah's correct grammar, but she also acknowledged the importance of her individual voice. After all, language was not just about correctness but also about expression and creativity."},{"question":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

How would the sentiment of this tweet be described?","response":"The sentiment of this tweet can be described as a blend of emotions that consists of fatigue, relief, and casual communication. Firstly, the fatigue and exhaustion aspect is evident from the phrase \\"this day was exhausting.\\" It implies that the individual had a long and challenging day at school, leaving them feeling drained, both mentally and physically. The sentiment associated with this emotion is primarily negative, as the person is expressing their weariness and discomfort after an exhausting day. Secondly, the relief aspect is conveyed through the words, \\"YeaH... im back from school.\\" This phrase shows that the individual is relieved to be home after a tiring day at school. They are now in a place where they can relax and recharge, no longer facing the demands of their school day. This sentiment can be considered as mildly positive since the person is expressing some contentment to be back home after enduring the exhausting day. Lastly, the casual communication is apparent from the informal language usage in the tweet (\\"YeaH,\\" \\"im\\"). It suggests that the person is trying to communicate their thoughts in a laid-back, conversational manner with their friends or followers on social media. This sentiment is neutral, as it neither conveys a negative nor a positive emotion, but rather a casual tone in which they are attempting to engage with their audience. In summary, the sentiment of this tweet can be described as a mix of negative (fatigue/exhaustion), mildly positive (relief), and neutral (casual communication) emotions. The person is expressing their feelings about a demanding day at school, sharing their relief upon returning home, and trying to engage in casual conversation with others on social media."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Given the following passage \\"Absent mothers and abusive fathers are another theme in the novel.

But the centres are standing empty, at a cost of £1m rent a month, because of problems with their computers and may now not all be needed. The coalition government has decided not to proceed with regionalisation. BBC Radio Four's Face the Facts also found that expensive equipment bought by fire brigades to replace current engines remained unused. The nine regional centres were built as part of plans to replace 46 local fire control rooms in England, with an original budget of £70m, and create a national interlinked service that could direct fire brigades to the scenes of large emergencies more easily. However, under new coalition government plans, the 46 local centres will still be replaced, but there will no longer be regionalised local fire brigades; instead they will remain under local control. The nine centres have been standing empty for up to three years because of problems in developing their computer systems. The monthly rent for the empty buildings is costing taxpayers £1m a month, and they will not be all in use until 2013, sending the programme more than £350m over budget. Defence contractor EADS was hired in 2007 to install the computer systems in the centres, as well as in 1,400 fire stations and 3,400 fire engines, providing an interlinked response service. Labour MP Clive Betts, the current chairman of the Commons communities and local government select committee that has investigated the delays, said the project had been \\"almost an unmitigated disaster throughout the course of its life\\". \\"But the reality was that, when you consider cancellation costs, it was less costly to continue with it than it was to cancel it,\\" he said. The select committee criticised the government for having a high turnover of staff working on the project and a reliance on consultants. John McDonnell MP, chairman of the Fire Brigades Union parliamentary group, agreed that the waste could have been prevented. The planned nine regional centres and the 46 local fire and rescue service control rooms to be regionalised: \\"It is almost Yes Minister-ish. It is very difficult for senior civil servants, ministers and secretaries of state to admit they have made a mistake,\\" he said. \\"What usually happens is rather than admit a mistake they throw more money at it and try to save the phenomenon.\\" EADS admitted the project had \\"birth pangs\\", but said it was now on course. As part of money-saving proposals, EADS has recommended that the project could be carried out using fewer regional centres. Its chief executive Robin Southwell said: \\"We believe the number can come down significantly, saving maybe hundreds of millions of pounds. \\"Any of those buildings not being used could be adapted for other uses.\\" The government has so far not responded to EADS' proposals. BBC Radio Four's Face the Facts also found that some brigades in the UK are selling unused, brand new fire engines. Central Scotland fire brigade bought two combined aerial rescue pumps (Carp engines) in 2008 at £400,000 each, which it later found were too heavy for UK roads. Chief fire officer for Central Scotland Kenny Taylor said: \\"Very early on it became clear there was a problem. When the engine became kitted it was substantially overweight.\\" Central Scotland has now put the engines up for sale on the internet at just under 300,000 euros (£246,000) each. The manufacturers are in dispute with the fire brigade, saying the vehicles were made to the right specification. They believe they are not being used because of internal problems in the fire brigade. They suggested a solution for the use of the vehicles, but have not had a response. But other brigades have had problems with this type of new vehicle, supplied by different manufacturers. Humberside fire brigade spent almost £60,000 converting its Carp engine back to a single rescue platform fire engine and does not know when it will come into service. South Yorkshire, which brought four Carps in 2008, has sent them to the Netherlands for £600,000 worth of remedial work. The manufacturers of its vehicles have gone into administration. The fire minister Bob Neill told Face the Facts: \\"The government is committed to ensuring value-for-money for the taxpayer and better procurement is vital.\\" The president of the Chief Fire Officers' Association, John Bonney, is frustrated, blaming the government and contractors. \\"There has got to be a bit of a knocking of heads together,\\" he said. \\"It is not just money but it's been investment of a lot of time and energy by the fire and rescue service. We feel exhausted and disappointed. \\"Unfortunately, certainly at the early stages... it became a discussion between the primary contractor and government officials rather than the professionals.\\" Listen to Face the Facts on BBC Radio 4 at 1230 BST, on Thursday, 26 August, repeated at 2100 BST on Sunday, 29 August, or on BBC iPlayer What was that article about?","response":"The article discusses a £423 million project in England to build nine new regional control rooms intended to replace 46 local fire control rooms and create a national interlinked fire service.

Early house music was generally dance-based music characterized by repetitive 4/4 beats, rhythms mainly provided by drum machines, off-beat hi-hat cymbals, and synthesized basslines. While house displayed several characteristics similar to disco music, it was more electronic and minimalistic, and the repetitive rhythm of house was more important than the song itself. House music initially became popular in Chicago clubs in 1984, pioneered by figures such as Frankie Knuckles, Phuture, Kym Mazelle, and Mr. Fingers, and was associated with African-American and gay subcultures. House music quickly spread to other American cities such as Detroit, New York City, Baltimore, and Newark all of which developed their own regional scenes. In the mid-to-late 1980s, house music became popular in Europe as well as major cities in South America, and Australia. - Science fiction (often shortened to SF, sci-fi or scifi) is a genre of speculative fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a \\"literature of ideas.\\" It usually avoids the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have a grounding in science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection is now limited to hard science fiction. - Killing Joke are an English rock band formed in October 1978 in Notting Hill, London, England. The original line-up included Jaz Coleman (vocals, keyboards), \\"Big\\" Paul Ferguson (drums), Geordie Walker (guitars) and Martin \\"Youth\\" Glover (bass). - Brian Peter George St John le Baptiste de la Salle Eno, RDI (born 15 May 1948 and originally christened Brian Peter George Eno) is an English musician, composer, record producer, singer, writer, and visual artist. He is best known for his pioneering work in ambient and electronic music as well as his contributions to rock, worldbeat, chance, and generative music styles. A self-described \\"non-musician\\", Eno has advocated a methodology of \\"theory over practice\\" throughout his career, and has helped to introduce a variety of unique recording techniques and conceptual approaches into contemporary music. He has been described as one of popular music's most influential and innovative figures. - Graphic design is the process of visual communication and problem-solving through the use of typography, photography and illustration. The field is considered a subset of visual communication and communication design, but sometimes the term \\"graphic design\\" is used synonymously.

In general, a distinction can be made between sound produced using electromechanical means and that produced using electronic technology. Examples of electromechanical sound producing devices include the telharmonium, Hammond organ, and the electric guitar. Purely electronic sound production can be achieved using devices such as the theremin, sound synthesizer, and computer. - Ambient music is a genre of music that puts an emphasis on tone and atmosphere over traditional musical structure or rhythm. Ambient music is said to evoke an \\"atmospheric\\", \\"visual\\", or \\"unobtrusive\\" quality.

Because of their trippy sound, the Orb developed a cult following among clubbers \\"coming down\\" from drug-induced highs. The Orb has maintained their drug-related and science fiction themes despite personnel changes, including the departure of Cauty and other Orb members Kris Weston, Andy Falconer, Simon Phillips, Nick Burton and Andy Hughes. Paterson has been the only permanent member, continuing to work as the Orb with the Swiss-German producer Thomas Fehlmann and, later, with Martin \\"Youth\\" Glover, bass player with Killing Joke. - Ambient house is a subgenre of house music that first emerged in the late 1980s, combining elements of acid house and ambient music.

EDM is generally produced for playback by disc jockeys (DJs) who create seamless selections of tracks, called a mix, by segueing from one recording to another. EDM producers also perform their music live in a concert or festival setting in what is sometimes called a live PA. In the United Kingdom and in continental Europe, EDM is more commonly called 'dance music' or simply 'dance'. - Kraftwerk (\\"\\"power station\\"\\") is a German electronic music band formed by Ralf Hütter and Florian Schneider in 1970 in Düsseldorf.

Amount of bird food fed per day: - 1/2 cup in the morning and 1/2 cup in the afternoon = 1 cup per day 4. Calculate the number of cups needed for all three months: - In a non-leap year: 90 days * 1 cup per day = 90 cups - In a leap year: 91 days * 1 cup per day = 91 cups So, Herman will need 90 cups of food for the three months in a non-leap year, and 91 cups in a leap year."},{"question":"Q: Indicate if the following Polish tweet contains cyber-bullying content with 'Yes'; otherwise, respond with 'No'.

The band has gone through several phases; its strongest commercial success occurred between 1978 and 1987. During that period, the band released a series of hit songs, including \\"Don't Stop Believin'\\" (1981), which in 2009 became the top-selling track in iTunes history among songs not released in the 21st century. Its parent studio album, Escape, the band's eighth and most successful, reached No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and yielded another of their most popular singles, \\"Open Arms\\". Journey's album sales did not improve and Columbia Records requested that they change their musical style and add a frontman, with whom keyboardist Gregg Rolie could share lead vocal duties. The band hired Robert Fleischman and transitioned to a more popular style, akin to that of Foreigner and Boston. Journey went on tour with Fleischman in 1977 and together the new incarnation of the band wrote the hit \\"Wheel in the Sky\\"; however, management differences resulted in Fleischman leaving within the year. In late 1977, Journey hired Steve Perry as their new lead singer. Herbie Herbert, the band's manager, also hired Roy Thomas Baker as a producer to add a layered sound approach as Baker had done with his previous band, Queen. With their new lead singer and talented new producer, Journey released their fourth album, Infinity (1978). This album set Journey on their road to stardom with their first RIAA-certified platinum album. This album, with their hit song \\"Wheel in the Sky\\" (#57 U.S.), set Journey on a new path with a more mainstream sound to make their highest chart success to date. In late 1978, manager Herbie Herbert fired drummer Aynsley Dunbar, who joined Bay Area rivals Jefferson Starship shortly thereafter. He was replaced by Berklee-trained jazz drummer Steve Smith. Perry, Schon, Rolie, Smith and Valory recorded Evolution (1979), which gave the band their first Billboard Hot 100 Top 20 single, \\"Lovin', Touchin', Squeezin'\\" (#16); and Departure (1980), which reached No. 8 on the album charts. Journey's newfound success brought the band an almost entirely new fan base. During the 1980 Departure world tour, the band recorded a live album, Captured. Keyboardist Gregg Rolie then left the band, the second time in his career he left a successful act. Keyboardist Stevie \\"Keys\\" Roseman was brought in to record the lone studio track for Captured, \\"The Party's Over (Hopelessly in Love),\\" but Rolie recommended pianist Jonathan Cain of The Babys as the permanent replacement. With Cain's replacement of Rolie's Hammond B-3 organ with his own synthesizers, the band was poised for a new decade in which they would achieve their greatest musical success. What musical singles were on the album Infinity?","response":"The album Infinity by Journey had some popular musical singles. One of the well-known singles from this album is \\"Wheel in the Sky\\" which reached number 57 in the U.S. charts. The album also included other songs like \\"Lights\\" and \\"Anytime,\\" which were popular among fans and helped Journey gain more mainstream success."},{"question":"How is \\"About 40 domestic and foreign actors are competing for the actors' award.\\" said in Turkish?","response":"To translate the sentence \\"About 40 domestic and foreign actors are competing for the actors' award.\\" into Turkish, I will follow these steps: 1.

The Domesday Survey of 1086 does not directly mention Ashton, perhaps because only a partial survey of the area had been taken. However, it is thought that St Michael's Church, mentioned in the Domesday entry for the ancient parish of Manchester, was in Ashton (also spelt Asheton, Asshton and Assheton). The town itself was first mentioned in the 12th century when the manor was part of the barony of Manchester. By the late 12th century, a family who adopted the name Assheton held the manor on behalf of the Gresleys, barons of Manchester. Ashton Old Hall was a manor house, the administrative centre of the manor, and the seat of the de Ashton or de Assheton family. With three wings, the hall was \\"one of the finest great houses in the North West\\" of the 14th century. It has been recognised as important for being one of the few great houses in south-east Lancashire and possibly one of the few halls influenced by French design in the country. The town was granted a Royal Charter in 1414, which allowed it to hold a fair twice a year, and a market on every Monday, making the settlement a market town.According to popular tradition, Sir Ralph de Assheton, who was lord of the manor in the mid-14th century and known as the Black Knight, was an unpopular and cruel feudal lord. After his death, his unpopularity led the locals to parade an effigy of him around the town each Easter Monday and collect money. Afterwards the effigy would be hung up, shot, and set on fire, before being torn apart and thrown into the crowd. The first recorded occurrence of the event was in 1795, although the tradition may be older; it continued into the 1830s.The manor remained in the possession of the Assheton family until 1514 when its male line terminated. The lordship of the manor passed to Sir George Booth, great-great grandson of Sir Thomas Ashton, devolving through the Booth family until the Earls of Stamford inherited it through marriage in 1758. The Booth-Greys then held the manor until the 19th century, whose patronage, despite being...

Title: Fun but not as safe as I would like. Review: I got this floater recently for my 6m baby girl. I really liked that the parent would be able to closely interact with the baby while floating in the pool, you can swim around pushing comfortably and \\"chatting\\" with your little one.Now the parent portion has much more air in it than the infant side. When you let go the parent side goes up and the infant side looks as though it may tip backwards (flipping upwards) So there is no time that you could just let go of the floater.Also, swimming and trying to be face-to-face with your child is hard since the toy bar is right in between the two of you, and you basically have a toy bar in your face while swimming obscuring your view of your child.Over all, I wouldn't buy this toy again. I ended up getting another one just for my daughter. Answer: OPTIONS: (i) No. (ii) Yes. Answer:","response":"(i) No. The product review is not positive. The title \\"Fun but not as safe as I would like\\" already shows some mixed feelings and reservations about the product. While the reviewer likes the concept of being able to closely interact with their baby in the pool, they raise several safety concerns and usability issues with the design of the floater. Firstly, they mention that once they let go of the floater, the imbalance of the air on the parent side makes it seem as though the infant side may tip backwards. This suggests a potential safety hazard that concerns the reviewer, and it's clear that they do not feel fully confident in using the product due to this issue. Secondly, the reviewer reports difficulty in interacting with their child when using the floater, as the toy bar blocks their view of the child. Although the intention of the toy bar is to provide entertainment for the infant and keep them occupied, it appears to hinder the parent's ability to maintain a clear line of sight with their child, which is a key feature the reviewer initially liked about the product. Lastly, the reviewer concludes the review with the statement, \\"Over all, I wouldn't buy this toy again,\\" which solidifies the notion that they are not satisfied with the product. They mention purchasing another floater specifically for their daughter, further implying that the reviewed floater did not meet their expectations and needs. Based on these points, it is clear that the product review is not positive, as the reviewer provides multiple criticisms and identifies limitations with the floater. The concerns about safety and limited visibility are likely to have a significant impact on potential buyers who prioritize these features when choosing a pool float for their child."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: Given a comment text in Tamil, classify the comment into one of these categories (i) Hope speech, if it contains encouraging, positive or supportive contents about equality, diversity or inclusion, (ii) Not Hope Speech or (iii) Not in Expected Language, if the text is not Tamil.

Why do some people like Fidel Castro, while others hate him to death? How are Fidel Castro and Che Guevara related? Options: a. no. b. yes.","response":"a. no. These two questions do not have the same meaning, as they deal with distinct aspects of Fidel Castro's life, public image, and relationships: 1. \\"Why do some people like Fidel Castro, while others hate him to death?\\" This question deals with the public perception of Fidel Castro and seeks to understand the reasons behind the mixed opinions about him. As a political figure, Fidel Castro's policies and actions have significantly affected the Cuban people and the global community. Throughout his life, Castro's political activities generated disparate reactions, with some people viewing him as a liberator and visionary, while others considered him a dictator and oppressor. There are several reasons why some people like Fidel Castro: - His role in overthrowing the US-backed Batista regime, which many Cubans viewed as a corrupt and oppressive government. - His commitment to socialism and anti-imperialism, which struck a chord with people who saw US capitalism as partly responsible for the suffering of the world’s poor. - His stance on social justice and equality, providing free education, healthcare, housing, and subsidies, which improved the lives of many Cubans despite economic hardship. Conversely, there are reasons why others hate him to death: - His authoritarian rule that suppressed political dissent and suppressed freedom of speech, religion, and assembly. - Human rights abuses carried out under his regime, including extrajudicial killings, imprisonment of political opponents, and forced labor camps. - The bureaucratic inefficiency and economic mismanagement that characterized his government, leading to a stagnant economy and widespread shortages of goods. 2. \\"How are Fidel Castro and Che Guevara related?\\" This question explores the nature of the relationship between Fidel Castro and another iconic figure of the Cuban Revolution, Ernesto \\"Che\\" Guevara. While the question does not specifically refer to the public opinion of these two individuals, it is relevant to understanding their partnership and their political ideologies, which is an essential aspect of examining their historical roles and impact. Fidel Castro and Che Guevara's relationship can be summarized as follows: - They first met in Mexico City in 1955, where they bonded over their shared vision of a socialist revolution in Latin America. - Guevara joined Castro's 26th of July Movement and accompanied him on the 1956 armed expedition to Cuba, which marked the beginning of the Cuban Revolution. - Guevara played an instrumental role in the revolutionary guerrilla warfare, leading several key battles and eventually becoming a high-ranking official in Castro's armed forces. His intellect, tactical prowess, and dedication to the cause made him one of Castro's most trusted allies. - After the Cuban Revolution's victory, Guevara held various positions in the new government, serving as Minister of Industries, president of the National Bank of Cuba, and advisor on diplomatic missions. - The two men's relationship became strained in the mid-1960s, as Guevara wanted to focus on spreading the revolution throughout Latin America, while Castro prioritized consolidating power in Cuba. Ultimately, Guevara left Cuba to engage in further revolutionary efforts, which led to his capture and execution in Bolivia in 1967. In conclusion, these two questions do not have the same meaning, as the first question examines public opinion about Fidel Castro, and the second question aims to elucidate the relationship between Fidel Castro and Che Guevara. However, both questions provide valuable insights into the aspects of Fidel Castro's life and his role as a central figure in Cuban history."},{"question":"I generally don't give worry much about violence in films, or a vast amount of philosophy, symbolism or psychology.

People have used resources on and around the Mono–Inyo Craters for centuries. Mono Paiutes gathered obsidian from the Mono–Inyo Craters to make sharp tools and arrow points. Unworked obsidian was carried by the Mono Paiutes over passes in the Sierra Nevada to trade with other Native American groups. Chips of Mono–Inyo obsidian can still be found at many ancient mountain campsites. Gold rush–related boomtowns sprang up near Mono Basin in the 19th century to exploit bonanzas. The largest of these, Bodie (north of Mono Lake), was founded in the late 1870s and grew large enough to need a tree mill, which was located at Mono Mills, immediately northeast of Mono Domes. Trees directly around the domes and on their slopes were felled to provide timber for the mill. As part of the California Water Wars, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power purchased large tracts of land in the 1930s within Mono Basin and Owens Valley in order to control water rights. Excavation of an 11.5-mile (18.5 km) water tunnel under the southern part of the Mono Craters dome complex started in 1934 and was completed in 1941. Tunnel workers had to deal with loose and often water-charged gravels, pockets of carbon dioxide gas and flooding. About one man was lost for each mile excavated. Water diverted from its natural outlet in Mono Lake passes through the tunnel on its way to the Los Angeles Aqueduct system. The United States Pumice Company, based in Chatsworth, California, has mined the area for pumice since 1941. The company markets the pumice in slabs for use in commercial scouring and in large irregular chunks sold as yard decoration.Apollo 16's John Young and Charlie Duke did some of their geologic training here in June 1971. William R. Muehlberger was one of the geology instructors.Exploratory drilling for geothermal power occurred near the Mono Craters on the south shore of Mono Lake in 1971.

A mall Santa had a heart attack at work and was rushed to the Emergency Room in full cardiac arrest. Let me explain that a person playing Santa is generally a certain age (white beard) and body type (round) that is predisposed to cardiac disease. We did everything we could but ultimately our efforts were futile. The mall Santa rode his sleigh into the great beyond. A mother, there to visit another patient, was insistent that her 7–8 year old son be allowed back to visit his grandmother. We had a strict 12 year old age limit visitation policy. I was called to speak with her. ”Why do you have such a stupid Draconian policy?” She insisted. “The Emergency Room is no place for a child ma’am. Besides, the germs and infections he may be exposed to, there are things he may see or hear that a child would have a hard time processing,” I explained. “Like what?” She argued. “Well, there are people in pain moaning,” I answered. “And drunks cursing at the staff. It’s a tough place.” “He’s fine,” she insisted. “I think I know how to parent. I don’t need you to worry about what my son is able to handle.” I caved in and allowed her back. As we passed the room with the dead Santa, a tech exited and opened the curtain. Her child looked in and saw Santa’s lifeless body, ET tube sticking out of his throat, boots still on but costume cut to shreds and strewn across the room. The child lost it! “Mom, Santa Claus is Dead!” He cried. “I’m not going to get anything for Christmas.” “Why would someone open the curtain?” The mother demanded. “I warned you,” I said. “That’s why we have a 12 years and above visitation policy.” She was not happy. Come to find out the child had his picture made with that very Santa a few days prior. Very ironic. According to the above context, answer the following question. When was the curtain that exposed Santa's body opened? Options are: (a). not enough information; (b). While the boy and his mother were passing by.; (c). Before Santa's suit was cut into shreds.; (d). Before the mother insisted she knew how to parent.; The answer is:","response":"(b). While the boy and his mother were passing by."},{"question":"The Scottish golf club said a recent consultation found that admitting women members was supported by over three-quarters of those who participated.

The pinnacle of the league season arrived at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in a 3–0 win over Real Madrid. It was Frank Rijkaard's second victory at the Bernabéu, making him the first Barcelona manager to win there twice. Ronaldinho's performance was so impressive that after his second goal, which was Barcelona's third, some Real Madrid fans gave him a standing ovation. In the Champions League, Barcelona beat the English club Arsenal in the final. Trailing 1–0 to a 10-man Arsenal and with less than 15 minutes remaining, they came back to win 2–1, with substitute Henrik Larsson, in his final appearance for the club, setting up goals for Samuel Eto'o and fellow substitute Juliano Belletti, for the club's first European Cup victory in 14 years.

Spanish sentence: \\"El elefante saltó sobre la luna mientras el sol sonreía en el cielo.\\" English translation: \\"The elephant jumped over the moon while the sun smiled in the sky.\\" In this sentence, the subject is \\"el elefante\\" (the elephant), followed by the verb \\"saltó\\" (jumped), which is the third person singular form of the past tense of the verb \\"saltar\\" (to jump). The preposition \\"sobre\\" (over) is used to connect the subject to the noun \\"la luna\\" (the moon), which is the object of the verb \\"saltar.\\" The second part of the sentence is a dependent clause that describes another action taking place simultaneously. The conjunction \\"mientras\\" (while) is used to introduce this clause. The subject in this clause is \\"el sol\\" (the sun), and the verb is \\"sonreía\\" (smiled), which is the third person singular form of the past imperfect tense of the verb \\"sonreír\\" (to smile). The preposition \\"en\\" (in) is then used to describe the location of the action – \\"el cielo\\" (the sky).

Every year thousands of wildebeests cross the Mara river. John went to see the migration last year. He noticed that the wildebeests crossed the the river in a very large group. He noted that as case A. His guide told him that is not the case in other times of the year. The wildebeests cross the river in smaller groups in other times. John noted that as case B. The guide added that in both cases on thing is constant, they are attacked by the lions. In which case wildebeests would have lower risk of attack from the lions, case A or case B? The answer is:","response":"Case A. Step by step justification: The task requires determining in which case wildebeests would have a lower risk of attack from lions, given two different scenarios - Case A where wildebeests cross the Mara river in a very large group, and Case B where they cross in smaller groups. Step 1: Understanding the scenario: In Case A, wildebeests travel in a large group, and in Case B, they travel in smaller groups. Both times, they are at risk of lion attacks. Step 2: Reasoning: Lions, being predators, tend to isolate and attack individual prey or smaller groups rather than large herds due to the difficulty and risk associated with attacking large groups. A large, closely packed herd can present a challenging target for lions as larger groups tend to have more potential for collective defense and it makes it harder for lions to isolate an individual. Step 3: Conclusion: Therefore, in Case A, where wildebeests cross the river as a large group, they would have a lower risk of attack from lions compared to Case B where they scatter into smaller groups making them easier targets for lions."},{"question":"Question: How does Kirina die?

Kirina is approached by Kinjo and two ninjas. Kirina shows no fear and Kinjo, the leader of a cult of ninja assassins and grants her final wish by showing his face. Paul returns and hides in the foyer while calling the police. When Kinjo decapitates Kirina, Paul tries to come to her defense and then tries to flee. Enraged that someone has seen his face, Kinjo's men stab Paul, hit him with a poisoned shuriken and slash his throat, leaving him for dead. Paul awakes in a hospital room, but his claims of seeing Kinjo are met with disbelief by the police. Lieutenant Wadakura dismisses the allegation and suspects that the murder is the work of a Yakuza syndicate. Paul is approached by Ijuro Takeda, an expert on the cult and Kinjo. Paul discovers that Takeda is the last in a samurai line and has a score to settle with Kinjo. The ninjas attempts to murder Paul at the hospital, killing several hospital staff and police officers, including Wadakura, but Paul escapes. Takeda and his wife Mieko subsequently take Paul to their family's stronghold, located on an island several hundred miles away.

Raising baby chickens is a rewarding experience, but it is not something you should jump into too quickly. Before you raise baby chickens, think long and hard about why you want to keep chickens and whether you have the time, money and space to provide for them. Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? A lot of people jump into this too fast","response":"Yes, the following sentence does follow and fits well with the preceding text. It reinforces the idea that raising chicks requires proper planning and resources, and that some individuals might rush into the process without giving it enough consideration. Here's an extended version of this paragraph: Raising baby chickens is a rewarding experience, but it is not something you should jump into too quickly. Before you raise baby chickens, think long and hard about why you want to keep chickens and whether you have the time, money, and space to provide for them. A lot of people jump into this too fast, without realizing everything that is involved in chicken-keeping. This could lead to various issues such as poor chick health and well-being, or a lack of personal satisfaction and enjoyment derived from the process. To successfully raise baby chicks, here are a few essential steps to follow: 1. Research Breeds: Start by researching different chicken breeds available. You will want to choose a breed that best fits your particular goals or preferences, whether that's for egg production, meat, showing, or simply having fun, friendly pets. 2. Prepare a Brooder: Before your chicks arrive, prepare a brooder, a warm, safe, and contained space for the baby chicks to grow and develop. A large plastic storage container, a cardboard box, or a specially-designed brooder can all serve this purpose. Add bedding, such as wood shavings or straw, for the chicks to rest on and insulate the brooder. 3. Provide Heat: Chicks require a heat source, as they cannot properly regulate their body temperature right away. You can use a heat lamp or a heating plate for this purpose. Monitor and maintain a temperature of approximately 95°F (35°C) for the first week, decreasing it by 5°F (3°C) each week until the chicks become fully feathered. 4. Offer Feed and Water: Provide clean water and specialized chick feed for your baby chickens. Choose a specifically-formulated starter feed with the right balance of nutrients to ensure proper growth. Make sure the chicks can easily access the water and food without the risk of drowning or knocking it over. 5. Keep the Brooder Clean: Cleanliness is essential when raising chicks, as they are susceptible to disease and infections. Regularly remove soiled bedding and replace it with fresh material. Keep the food and water containers clean as well. 6. Provide Socialization and Enrichment: Young chicks benefit from socializing with humans and other chicks. Spend time with them, offering gentle handling and interaction. Introduce age-appropriate enrichment activities or toys, like small perches, to promote healthy physical and mental development. 7. Transition to Coop and Outdoor Living: As your chicks grow and become more self-sufficient, begin preparing them for life in their permanent coop and outdoor habitat. Gradually acclimate them to the new environment, allowing supervised outdoor time during the day to encourage foraging. Continue monitoring their health and well-being, adjusting their environment and care routine as needed. Overall, raising chicks can be an enjoyable and satisfying experience when proper planning, care, and attention are given to the process. Being well-prepared and informed about chick care will ensure you achieve the best possible outcomes in terms of chick health and well-being, as well as personal satisfaction as a chicken owner."},{"question":"Through the encourage and direction of one of his relatives he was providentially led towards the Congregation of the Priests of the Sacred Heart.

Can you help me answer a few questions? If you can't, please say \\"No I can't\\". Question: Who wins the duel? Movie title: The Duellists Movie plot: \\"The Duellists\\" is based on a story written by Joseph Conrad, which, according to the author, was itself based on a true story whose origins sprang from a ten-line paragraph in a small Southern France local newspaper. That brief paragraph reported the fatal ending of a duel between two officers in Napoleon's Grand Army. The two officers had fought a series of duels in the midst of great wars on some futile pretext. As the pretext was never disclosed, Conrad invented one.We are in 1800, in the garrison town of Strasbourg, on the Rhine. There is a lull in the Napoleonic wars, and the French soldiers are enjoying a moment of peace before resuming the slaughters. As the film opens, a young girl driving a gaggle of geese happens upon two men dueling in a meadow. Lieutenant Gabriel Féraud (Harvey Keitel), from the 7th Hussar Regiment, is in the process of settling a score with an unknown man who soon ends up skewered on the Lieutenant's épée. We learn that this man is the nephew of the Mayor of Strasbourg, and is seriously wounded, when General Treillard (Robert Stephens), Commandant of the garrison, enters his officers quarters and makes inquiries about this Lieutenant Féraud. Lieutenant Armand d'Hubert (Keith Carradine), from the 4th Hussar Regiment, admits to vaguely knowing the gentleman, and he is immediately \\"volunteered\\" by his Commandant to find him and bring him back to the barracks, where he will be put under house arrest. General Treillard, who must see that his soldiers obey the Emperors rules prohibiting combat with civilians, needs to investigate what happened in the meadow. It is somewhat ironical that Bonaparte, who spent a large part of his life dueling with the rest of Europe on a rather grand scale, involving tens of thousand of participants on both sides (but was somewhat of a dilettante when judged by present day's standards), had little respect for the same tradition on an individual level.D'Hubert, after looking all over town, ends up at Féraud's private quarters, where he learns that the...","response":"The movie \\"The Duellists,\\" directed by Ridley Scott and released in 1977, does not actually have a clear winner in the series of duels between Lieutenant Gabriel Féraud (Harvey Keitel) and Lieutenant Armand d'Hubert (Keith Carradine). The two officers engage in a series of duels, spanning over 15 years, which are instigated when d'Hubert is ordered to arrest Féraud for fighting a duel with a civilian. Their rivalry is fueled by personal pride, misunderstandings, and stubbornness throughout the film. In the final scene, an aging d'Hubert and Féraud face off for the final time in a secluded area. However, after disarming Féraud, d'Hubert chooses not to kill him, demonstrating his desire to break free from the cycle of duels and live his life. Instead, he declares that he considers the matter settled and will no longer accept any further challenges from Féraud. In a way, d'Hubert can be considered the winner, not through fighting prowess, but rather by choosing to end the feud. It is worth mentioning that the overall plot explores themes of honor, obsession, and the futility of their personal conflicts, set against the backdrop of the Napoleonic Wars. The movie, despite not having a traditional \\"winner\\" in the duel, offers a substantial exploration of character depth and the human experience. It has been widely praised for its attention to historical detail, cinematography, and the performances of the lead actors. In deciding whether to invest in the film proposal, consider that \\"The Duellists\\" has achieved a cult following and critical acclaim since its release. It won the Best Debut Film award at the 1977 Cannes Film Festival and has been praised as one of Ridley Scott's best works.

In writing Young Modern, Johns tried to make the music sound very simple, despite a complex musical structure. The lyrics were written after the music was created, sometimes as late as the day of recording. As Johns dreads writing lyrics, he suggested that the band could produce an instrumental album at some stage in the future. Johns is the band's primary songwriter, and notes that while Joannou and Gillies do not have significant influence on what he writes, they are key to the band's overall sound. For that album, Hamilton co-wrote four songs with Johns including the APRA Award-winning \\"Straight Lines\\". Joannou believed that Young Modern was simpler than Diorama but \\"still as complex underneath with simple pop song elements\\".

During the Q & A session, a Chinese student asked the outgoing ambassador to compare the Chinese dream and the American dream. The ambassador said he didn't know much about the Chinese dream, so he talked instead about the American dream. Like Americans, the Chinese people also have their dreams -- a powerful country, a good education, a happy family, or a bountiful harvest. Yet the dreams of the ordinary Chinese have never been articulated as powerfully and eloquently as the American dream, until Xi Jinping came into power. OPINION: China's awkward 'banana' slip. Xi first mentioned the term \\"the Chinese dream\\" during his tour of an exhibit at the National Museum of China in November 2012, shortly after he became leader of the Chinese Communist Party. That exhibit is called the Road to National Rejuvenation, and Xi said the Chinese dream is the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. Then on March 17, 2013, Xi fully spelled out his thoughts about the Chinese dream in his first public speech as the newly elected president of China. \\"The Chinese dream is the dream of the whole nation, as well as of every individual,\\" he said. \\"The Chinese dream, after all, is the dream of the people. We must realize it by closely depending on the people, and we must incessantly bring benefits to the people.\\" Publicity campaign. After his speech, the Chinese dream has entered the daily discourse of both the Chinese government and the ordinary Chinese, thanks in no small part to the government's massive publicity campaign. There were countless speeches, contests, essay competitions, scholarly conferences, and TV shows that had the Chinese dream as the central theme. If there had been a contest for the most popular Chinese phrase in 2013, the Chinese dreams would probably have won the title. Apart from nationwide publicity, there are other reasons why the Chinese dream has become a household phrase. It is much less elusive than Mao Zedong's Thoughts, Deng Xiaoping's Theories, Jiang Zemin's Three Represents, or Hu Jintao's Harmonious Society; it is a term that can be understood by any Chinese. Besides, who doesn't have dreams? Thus it easily resonates with the Chinese people. Finally, Xi promised to realize the dream by depending more on the people and bringing more benefits to them. Thus Xi's dream, at least in its rhetorical form, is a dream for the people, by the people, and of the people. Who doesn't like such a dream? Reforms. And Xi meant what he said, at least in one area and that is corruption, the most urgent issue facing the Chinese community party. He has launched an unprecedented crackdown on corruption, and 20 high-ranking officials -- vice-minister level and above -- have been investigated or punished within a little more than year. He also signed two documents -- Eight Regulations and Six Bans -- that have significantly improved bureaucratic efficiency and sharply reduced public expenses on receptions, overseas travel, and vehicle purchases. Because of Xi's tough campaign, China's entertainment businesses, particularly top-end restaurants, clubs, and hotels, have suffered enormous losses, over which the ordinary Chinese are rightfully gloating. Rampant corruption, be it bribery, buying and selling offices, illegal land grabs, or abuse of power, is certainly the biggest scourge of China today, leading to rising discontent and unrest as well as declining public trust in government. Most importantly, corruption seems to have made it increasingly difficult for the ordinary Chinese to have their dreams come true. Restoring confidence. China is becoming economically and militarily much more powerful, and the average Chinese is living a much better life. Yet at the same time more and more Chinese seem to have lost faith in the government and the future of China. A prosperous and powerful China should be a land of opportunities for its people, but actually it appears to have become a land of anger and despair for an increasing number of Chinese. Thus Xi's articulation of the Chinese dream and his campaign against corruption can be viewed as the first steps by the new Chinese leadership to restore public confidence in the party and the government. Thus far, his policies have won enthusiastic support among most Chinese, and Xi has become arguably the most popular leader since Deng Xiaoping. If the dreams of the ordinary Chinese today -- like those of their ancestors in ancient China -- depend on the good luck of having a sage leader, however, that means China is still under the rule of man, not rule of law. When that leader steps down, or if that leader makes disastrous decisions, the dreams of the Chinese people will be in jeopardy. With immense popular support at the moment, President Xi should initiate institutional reforms that empower every Chinese to have dreams and to have those dreams come true. These reforms will not only set China on a path of sustainable political and economic development, but also enable the Chinese people to be truly proud of the Chinese dream, just as Americans are proud of the American dream. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Tao Xie.","response":"In a public speech by former U.S. ambassador to China, Gary Locke, the Chinese dream and the American dream were discussed.

After noting in the museum’s guestbook how “inspiring” it was to visit the home where Frank and her family hid from the Nazis for two years during World War II, he went on to opine that she “was a great girl. Hopefully she would have been a belieber.” Staff posted Bieber’s note to the museum’s Facebook page, prompting many to “cringe at the insensitivity and the sheer ego of” the counterfactual fan club invitation. Frank died in a Nazi concentration camp in 1945, so there is no way of knowing whether she would have enjoyed the nuanced strains of “Baby.” However, in addition to being one of the most important chroniclers of her time, Anne Frank was also a normal teenager. Was she a fan of pop culture? Somewhat. A few clues on this front can be found in the famous diary itself. In one of the earliest entries, dated Sunday, June 14, 1942, Frank imagines what it would be like to own a pet like Rin Tin Tin and writes of her and her classmates’ enjoyment of a movie featuring the dog on the occasion of her birthday party, a few weeks before the family was forced into hiding. Frank was also fond of the young adult novels of her era, particularly the books of Cissy van Marxveldt: “I’ve read The Zaniest Summer four times, and the ludicrous situations still make me laugh.” In these preferences, Frank was like most girls her age. Musically speaking, though, Frank’s tastes seem to have run highbrow. Along with the rest of her family, she enjoyed listening to classical music in private home performances before the war and later on the radio, and devotes much of a June 1944 entry to a loose review of a biography of Franz Liszt. Classical music also played into Frank’s nascent romantic life: “Sunday afternoon Peter came to see me at four-thirty, at my invitation. At five-fifteen we went to the front attic, where we stayed until six. There was a beautiful Mozart concert on the radio from six to seven-fifteen; I especially enjoyed the ‘Kleine Nachtmusik.’ I can hardly bear to listen in the kitchen, since beautiful music stirs me to the very depths of my soul.” Advertisement Frank did have a touch of tabloid fever however. She was so fond of collecting pictures of actors such as Greta Garbo and Ray Milland—she laments in a May 1944 entry that her “movie stars are in a terrible disarray and are dying to be straightened out”—that, according to Melissa Müller’s biography, at least one of her childhood friends found her “flightiness and fascination” with them annoying. But even as she drew some delight from celebrity culture, Frank resisted being lumped in with young girls who, as a contemporary polemic had put it, “occupy themselves with superficial things, without giving a thought to true beauty.” ||||| Focused crawls are collections of frequently-updated webcrawl data from narrow (as opposed to broad or wide) web crawls, often focused on a single domain or subdomain. ||||| What is a summary?","response":"A teenage star named Justin Bieber visited the Anne Frank House, a museum in Amsterdam.

Article:","response":"Title: Understanding Complex Numbers in Standard Form Hey there, little buddy! Today, we're going to talk about something called complex numbers. Don't worry, it's not as scary as it sounds. A complex number is just a fancy way of saying a number that has two parts. One part is normal, just like the numbers you're already used to, and the other part is just a little different. Together, they make a complex number! When we write complex numbers in what's called \\"standard form,\\" it looks like this: a + bi. The 'a' part is just a regular number, like 2 or -3. It's called the \\"real\\" part. The 'b' part is also a number, but it has an extra friend, 'i', tagging along with it. This part is called the \\"imaginary\\" part. Don't worry, it's not really imaginary, like a pretend friend. It's just a way to help us understand and work with these complex numbers. So, let's look at some examples of how to write complex numbers in standard form: Example 1: 3 + 4i In this example, the '3' is the real part, and the '4i' is the imaginary part. It already looks like standard form, doesn't it? That's because it is! Example 2: -5 - 2i This time, the '-5' is the real part and the '-2i' is the imaginary part. Even though the numbers are negative, it's still in standard form. Good job! Now, you might be wondering why we need to work with complex numbers. Well, they can be really useful in solving some tricky math problems that don't have normal number solutions. Plus, they're used in lots of cool things, like building bridges, designing video games, and even helping our cell phones work! So, the next time you see a complex number, remember that it's just a number with two parts: a real part and an imaginary part (a + bi). And when it's in standard form, it looks nice and neat, making it easier to understand and work with. I hope this helps you wrap your little head around complex numbers, buddy! Remember, math can be fun and exciting, just like going on an adventure. Keep exploring and learning about the world of numbers!"},{"question":"Premise: \\"A young boy in a red shirt is playing with a dollhouse.\\" Based on this premise, can we conclude that the hypothesis \\"A young boy in a green shirt picks his nose.\\" is true?

Agent Bart Langner finds Elsa Brinkmann, a would-be actress who looks and sounds just like Lylah Clare, a flamboyant star who fell to her death in suspicious circumstances 20 years ago. He persuades arrogant director Lewis Zarkan, who had been married to Lylah, to see her. The two men then convince brash studio head Barney Sheean, who is equally struck, to back a picture with her as Lylah. Besides coping with the tyrannical Zarkan and easy access to alcohol and drugs, Elsa also has to contend with other hazards of Hollywood like malicious journalist Molly Luther and lesbian admirer Rossella. As filming continues, her identification with her rôle gets more intense. She also begins to fall in love with Zarkan, who is happy to sleep with her but his priority is to get his film finished. By the last day of shooting, her personality seems to have merged with that of the outrageous Lylah whose fatal fall, we learn, was prompted by the jealous Zarkan. To antagonise him, she first lets him find her in bed with the gardener. Then, as he directs her in a circus scene, she leaps to her death from the high-wire. The resulting publicity makes his film a huge success. Tragedy later comes when Zarkan himself is shot and killed by Rossella.

Sam Vokes poked Burnley's second in off the post before Joe Lolley responded with a curled finish. Ben Mee nodded in the visitors' third from a Jones corner, while Jason Davidson hit the bar for the Terriers. Sean Dyche's Burnley have now taken 36 points from a possible 42 in a 14-game unbeaten league run, dating back to their loss at Hull City on 26 December. Second-placed Middlesbrough, who had head coach Aitor Karanka walk out on training on Friday, can move back to within four points of the summit if they beat second-from-bottom Charlton Athletic at The Valley on Sunday. Defeat leaves Huddersfield 18th in the table and six points above the relegation places. Jones, returning from a Achilles problem which kept him out of Tuesday's win at Fulham, created the game's first goal - finding Keane to nod into the path of Republic of Ireland defender Ward, who netted his first league goal for the Clarets. A neat touch from top scorer Andre Gray then afforded George Boyd space down the right-hand side, with Wales striker Vokes getting on the end of a piercing pass to net his 13th goal of the season from close range. With Huddersfield's first shot on goal, Lolley - making his 50th Terriers appearance - reduced the deficit, only for Mee to restore the two-goal advantage almost immediately. Huddersfield head coach David Wagner: \\"Burnley are the best team in the league and if you are to beat the best team you have to be brave, and we weren't. \\"At half-time I said we had to accept the situation.

Question: A snail and hummingbird both travelled a mile; did the (A) hummingbird take longer because it took more time to take the trip/ (B) snail Answer:","response":"Answer: B) Snail A hummingbird and a snail are two vastly different creatures with different speeds and modes of movement. Hummingbirds are small birds known for their incredible speed and agility in the air, while snails are slow-moving creatures that travel by crawling on various surfaces. When comparing the time it takes for each of these creatures to travel a mile, it is evident that the snail will take significantly longer than the hummingbird. The reason is that the average speed of a hummingbird can vary between 25 to 50 miles per hour (depending on the species), which allows it to cover a mile in a matter of minutes. On the other hand, a common land snail has an average speed of only 0.03 miles per hour, which means it would take the snail over 33 hours to cover a distance of 1 mile. Therefore, the snail took longer to travel the mile due to its significantly slower speed compared to the hummingbird."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you will be shown a prompt from a judicial decision and multiple holding statements derived from citations following text in a legal decision.

The Crimean War took place between October 1853 and February 1856, involving the Russian Empire and an alliance of the Ottoman Empire, France, Britain, and the Kingdom of Sardinia. It was primarily fought on the Crimean Peninsula but also involved conflicts in the Balkans, the Caucasus, and the Baltic Sea. The war had complex causes, significant events, and lasting consequences, which can be analyzed as follows: Causes: 1. Religious tensions: Disputes between the Russian Orthodox Church and the Roman Catholic Church over the control of religious sites in the Ottoman Empire, primarily in Jerusalem and the Holy Land, were one of the main causes of the Crimean War. Russia positioned itself as the protector of the Orthodox Christians living in the Ottoman territories. 2. The Eastern Question: The decline of the Ottoman Empire throughout the 18th and 19th centuries was a major concern for the European powers. Russia sought to expand its influence in the Balkans and the Black Sea, taking advantage of the weakening Ottoman state. Conversely, Britain and France worried that the collapse of the Ottoman Empire would enable Russian dominance in the region, threatening their interests. 3. Strategic importance: The Crimean Peninsula held great strategic importance due to its location, controlling access to the Black Sea and further the Mediterranean Sea. Control over the region would grant naval and commercial advantages, which the European powers were eager to secure. Significant Events: 1. Battle of Sinop (1853): The war began on a small scale, with the Russian Black Sea Fleet defeating the Ottoman fleet at the Battle of Sinop. This naval battle provoked Britain and France to intervene out of fear that Russia would dominate the Black Sea, tipping the regional balance of power. 2. Siege of Sevastopol (1854-1855): One of the most significant events of the Crimean War, the siege lasted for 11 months, with both sides suffering heavy casualties. The Allied forces eventually captured the city, which was the home port of the Russian Black Sea Fleet, dealing a severe blow to Russia's naval capabilities. 3. Battle of Balaclava (1854): This battle involved the famous \\"Charge of the Light Brigade,\\" a disastrous British cavalry charge that has since become a symbol of military folly. The battle ultimately ended indecisively with little change in the strategic position of either side. 4. Florence Nightingale's role: Although not a military event, her work at the military hospital in Scutari (today's Istanbul), where she organized medical care and highlighted the dire conditions faced by soldiers, led to significant reforms in military healthcare and sanitation practices. Consequences: 1. Treaty of Paris (1856): The Crimean War ended with the signing of the Treaty of Paris, which acknowledged the territorial integrity of the Ottoman Empire and neutralized the Black Sea, forbidding any warships to enter the area and limiting Russian expansion. 2. Power dynamics: The war exposed weaknesses in both the Russian and the Ottoman Empires, prompting social and political changes in Russia, such as the Emancipation of the Serfs in 1861. For the Ottoman Empire, the war was a temporary reprieve, as the \\"Sick man of Europe\\" continued to decline throughout the remainder of the 19th century and ultimately collapsed after World War I. 3. Influence on future conflicts: Technological advancements, such as the use of the telegraph and railroads, as well as innovations in weapon technology, were showcased during the Crimean War, setting the stage for future conflicts, including the American Civil War and World War I. 4. The emergence of war journalism and photography: The Crimean War was one of the first conflicts to be extensively covered by journalists and photographers, bringing the reality of war to the public and influencing public opinion and policy decisions. In conclusion, the Crimean War was a complex and influential conflict with various causes and consequences, shaped by the religious, political, and strategic dynamics of the time. It left a lasting legacy on European power relations, military tactics, and war journalism."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Fisherman Matt Boyd is fishing in Lake Victoria when a small earthquake hits, splitting the lake floor and causing a whirlpool.

How much does the discounted subscription cost if a subscription normally costs 80? Let's be accurate as possible.","response":"To find the cost of the discounted subscription, we'll follow these steps: 1. Calculate the discount amount by multiplying the normal price by the discount percentage. 2. Subtract the discount amount from the normal price to find the discounted price. Step 1: Calculate the discount amount Discount amount = Normal price * Discount percentage Discount amount = 80 * 45% Since the discount percentage is 45%, we'll convert it to a decimal by dividing by 100. 45% ÷ 100 = 0.45 Now, multiply the normal price (80) by the decimal. Discount amount = 80 * 0.45 Discount amount = 36 Step 2: Subtract the discount amount from the normal price Discounted price = Normal price - Discount amount Discounted price = 80 - 36 Discounted price = 44 So, the discounted subscription price is 44."},{"question":"Read the following article and answer the question. Article: I first came across the concept of pay-what-you-can cafes last summer in Boone, N.C., where I ate at F.A.R.M (Feed All Regardless of Means) Cafe. You can volunteer to earn your meal, pay the suggested price(10) or less, or you can overpay--paying it forward for a future customer's meal. My only regret after eating there was not having a chance to give my time. So as soon as Healthy World Cafe opened in York in April, I signed up for a volunteer shift . F.A.R.M and healthy World are part of a growing trend of community cafes. In 2003, Denise Cerreta opened the first in Salt Lake City. Cerreta now runs the One World Everybody Eats Foundation, helping others copy her pay-what-you can model. \\"I think the community cafe is truly a hand up, not a handout,\\" Cerreta said. She acknowledged that soup kitchens have a place in society, but people typically don't feel good about going there. \\"One of the values of the community cafe is that we have another approach,\\" she said. \\"Everyone eats here, no one needs to know whether you volunteered, overpaid or underpaid.\\" The successful cafes not only address hunger and food insecurity but also become necessary parts of their neighborhood -- whether it's a place to learn skills or hear live music. Some teach cooking to seniors; some offer free used books. Eating or working there is a reminder that we are all in this world together. My 10 am-1pm shift at World-Healthy-Cafe began with the cafe manager -- one of the two paid staff members. Our volunteer crew wasn't the most orderly, but we managed to prepare and serve meals with a lot of laughs in between. At the end of my shift, I ordered my earned meal at the counter, together with other volunteers. After lunch, I walked out the door, with a handful of new friends, music in my head and a satisfied belly and heart. Question: How did the author feel about working at Healthy World Cafe?

One foggy night in Devon, Gail, a working border collie Herding dog, gives birth to a litter of three puppies, cozy in a barn on Borough Farm. As she lies quietly with her newborn litter, her father, Sir Gregory, walks inside, not realizing she had her puppies until she summons his attention and he spots them curled up next to her. She has already named two of them Storm and Drift but she thinks Sir Gregory should name the third. He looks out of the window and names her Mist after the \\"misty\\" night she was born. All the other dogs, Swift, her son Ernie, and Jake, are delighted to meet the puppies at last but Fern doesn't seem to like puppies and is not happy to be their auntie.

Answer:","response":"The missing first step of the process is: \\"The owl enters its hunting mode and begins to search for prey, primarily at night due to their nocturnal nature.\\" To provide a more comprehensive understanding of the complete process, we can reconstruct the steps as follows: 1. The owl enters its hunting mode and begins to search for prey, primarily at night due to their nocturnal nature. 2. Owls sit at high points in trees and look around, utilizing their keen sense of vision and acute hearing to detect any potential prey movements or sounds. 3. When an owl spots a rodent or other small prey, they begin to track it, focusing their attention on the target's movements and waiting for the opportune moment to strike. 4. When the rodent stands still or appears vulnerable, the owl swiftly swoops down from its elevated position towards the prey. 5. As the owl approaches the rodent, it extends its sharp talons and accurately positions them to grasp the prey with precision and strength. 6. The owl grabs the rodent with their talons, securing a tight grip to prevent the prey from escaping. 7. Once captured, the owl may return to a nearby branch or a safe location to consume its meal. 8. The owl uses its powerful beak to tear the rodent's flesh, ingest the meat, and sometimes swallow parts of the prey whole, depending on the owl species and size of the prey. This hunting process is essential for owls to maintain their energy levels and overall survival in their natural habitats. Additionally, this process helps to regulate rodent populations and balance the ecosystem where owls reside."},{"question":"Here are some concepts: field, rise, tree What is a sentence about these concepts?","response":"In a big open field, a little tree started to grow taller as its branches began to rise towards the sky with each passing day."},{"question":"How do you say \\"In one plant, installation silencers to stop hissing air resulted in a dramatic reduction of excited cattle.\\" in Spanish?","response":"To translate this sentence accurately, I will break it down into smaller segments and then combine them into a coherent sentence in Spanish. 1. \\"In one plant\\" - \\"En una planta\\" 2. \\"installation silencers\\" - \\"instalación de silenciadores\\" 3. \\"to stop hissing air\\" - \\"para detener el siseo del aire\\" 4. \\"resulted in\\" - \\"resultó en\\" 5. \\"a dramatic reduction\\" - \\"una reducción drástica\\" 6. \\"of excited cattle\\" - \\"de ganado agitado\\" Now, combining these segments, we get: \\"En una planta, la instalación de silenciadores para detener el siseo del aire resultó en una reducción drástica de ganado agitado.\\" This is the Spanish translation of the sentence."},{"question":"You are given a sentence from a conversation between a human and a virtual assistant.

A. desk drawer B. schools C. pencil box D. principal E. office supply store The best answer is Answer:","response":"The best answer is a combination of options A, C, and E. Which option is best for you depends on your specific situation and immediate needs; however, I will provide a detailed answer covering all three options to help you decide where you should go. A. Desk Drawer: If you are at home or in an office space where you've stored stationery items, the desk drawer might be your first go-to spot to look for an eraser. Often, people store various stationery items, including erasers, pens, pencils, and other helpful tools in desk drawers. Always check the drawers nearest to you before considering going elsewhere, as it may save you time and effort. B. Pencil Box: The pencil box is another common place where people store their erasers. If you're in a school or college setting, or even at your home, a pencil box will likely have an eraser along with other stationery items such as pens, pencils, and sharpeners. If you're in a classroom, consider asking your classmates if they can spare an eraser from their pencil boxes, or you can check your own. E. Office Supply Store: If you're unable to find an eraser in either a desk drawer or pencil box, or you need to purchase a new eraser, the office supply store is your best bet. Office supply stores carry a wide range of stationery items, including various kinds of erasers, such as regular erasers, kneaded erasers, and ones that attach to the end of a mechanical pencil. Whether you're looking for a specific type or simply need any eraser available, an office supply store will have you covered. In conclusion, if you need an eraser, it's best to first check your desk drawer and pencil box, as these are the most common places for storing stationery items. If you still can't find one or require a new eraser, you should head to an office supply store to purchase one. Other options, such as schools and principals, may not be as convenient or accessible, especially since they typically provide erasers for their own staff and students.

In a typical demonstration of Japanese workmanship and efficiency, workers toiled around the clocks and had practically filled in the section of road in just two days, according to local media. The road reopened to traffic and pedestrians early on Tuesday after local officials declared the repaired stretch safe. The weeklong rush to reopen the busy stretch of road included repairs to a sewage pipe and replacing traffic lights and utility poles that were swallowed when the sinkhole opened up shortly after 5am local time on 8 November. The incident caused power cuts and disrupted phone signals, and gas and water supplies, but there were no reports of injuries. The mayor of Fukuoka, Soichiro Takashima, said the affected ground was now 30 times stronger than before, adding that a panel of experts would be set up to establish the cause of the cave-in. Local media reports said the 30m by 27m sinkhole, which was 15 metres deep, was caused by construction work on an extension to an underground line. The Fukuoka workers, who filled the hole with 6,200 cubic metres of sand and cement, drew praise on social media. One person tweeted: “I’m surprised the road reopened in a week!” Another said: “Impressive. That was fast.” The astonishing speed of the repair work brought back memories of the efforts to reopen roads that were badly damaged by the March 2011 triple disaster. Before-and-after-photos showed how a team of workers took just six days to repair gaping cracks up to 150 metres along a stretch of road north of Tokyo, boosting attempts by emergency and aid workers trying to reach hundreds of thousands of survivors. Summary:","response":"A big hole appeared in a road in Fukuoka, Japan, near a busy train station. It was caused by construction work. The hole was really big and deep, and it caused some problems with power, phone, gas, and water supplies. But no one got hurt! The people who fixed it worked really hard and really fast, so the road could be opened again in just one week. Now the ground is even stronger than it was before. The workers have been praised for doing such a good job so quickly!"},{"question":"Summarize: An interesting way to spark a riveting conversation is to debate. Simply choose a topic and have one person argue for it and another to argue against it. Remind yourself and your companions that the debate is just a game. A fun debate can quickly turn into a heated argument that might create discomfort between everyone in the car. Choose funny and light-hearted topics. Avoid heavy or complex topics to keep everyone in good spirits. Instead of arguing about morals or religious beliefs, debate about whether strawberries are the best kind of berry or whether squirrels are cute or just plain annoying. There are many word games that can be competitively fun and entertaining, in situations where you're driving alone or with others: Have a spelling bee. Name all the countries of the world. Name all the states or provinces or a country. Think of words that rhyme with each other as fast as you can. Whoever stops the pace, loses. Say one word at a time. Have each person say one word to create a sentence or story. You might come up with some hilarious examples. Read aloud a book or play and have everyone in the car act out a role or multiple roles. The driver should not participate in this game. If you're driving with others, get to know one another. Ask each other questions or play a variety of games: Play two truths and a lie. Have one person tell two truths and a lie. The others must guess which statements are truths and which one is a lie. Play Never Have I Ever. Each person will keep track of their own points, or hold up 10 fingers, or even be prepared to drink or eat something every time someone says something they have never done, but has actually done the activity. For example, Sally will say, \\"Never have I ever danced on stage.\\" If Bob has danced on stage before, he will lose a point or have to eat or drink something to show that he has indeed done that activity. Play truth or dare. However, be careful when designing the dares, ensuring that they can be safely done inside or outside the car. See how many things you can see during your car ride. You can try counting: Certain colours of cars. People walking on the road. Birds. Animals. Certain chain stores or buildings. License plates of cars from your area or your destination.","response":"Sparking a riveting conversation can be done through debates, keeping topics light-hearted and fun to avoid creating discomfort.

Their numbers were greatly reduced by disease and warfare with the Five Nations of the Iroquois, and by 1675 they had died out, moved away, or been assimilated into other tribes. After this, the lands of the Susquehanna valley were under the nominal control of the Iroquois, who encouraged displaced tribes from the east to settle there, including the Shawnee and Lenape (or Delaware).On November 5, 1768, the British acquired land, known in Pennsylvania as the New Purchase, from the Iroquois in the Treaty of Fort Stanwix; this included what is now Ricketts Glen State Park. After the American Revolutionary War, Native Americans almost entirely left Pennsylvania. Luzerne County was formed in 1786 from part of Northumberland County, and Fairmount Township, where the waterfalls are, was settled in 1792 and incorporated in 1834. About 1890 a Native American pot, decorated in the style of \\"the peoples of the Susquehanna region\\", was found under a rock ledge on Kitchen Creek by Murray Reynolds, for whom a waterfall is named.The Ricketts family began acquiring land in and around what became the park in 1851, when Elijah Ricketts and his brother Clemuel bought about 5,000 acres (2,000 ha) on North Mountain around what is now known as Ganoga Lake. By 1852 they had built a stone house on the lake shore, which they ran \\"as a lodge and tavern\\". Elijah's son Robert Bruce Ricketts, for whom the park is named, joined the Union Army as a private at the outbreak of the American Civil War and rose through the ranks to become a colonel. After the war, R. B. Ricketts returned to Pennsylvania and began purchasing the land around the lake from his father in 1869; eventually he controlled or owned more than 80,000 acres (32,000 ha), including the glens and waterfalls.Ricketts and the other settlers living in the area were not aware of the glens and their waterfalls until about 1865,... Answer:","response":"The first name of the son of the man who was brother of Clemuel is Robert Bruce. In the text, it is mentioned that \\"Elijah Ricketts and his brother Clemuel bought about 5,000 acres (2,000 ha) on North Mountain.\\" Then it states: \\"Elijah's son Robert Bruce Ricketts, for whom the park is named,\\" which indicates that Robert Bruce is the son of the man who was a brother to Clemuel."},{"question":"Are the following two questions the same? What is the difference between a company and a firm? What is the difference between a company and a corporation?","response":"First, I will analyze both questions to identify their meaning and compare them. Question 1: In order to answer the question \\"What is the difference between a company and a firm?\\" I have to assess the meanings and characteristics of both \\"company\\" and \\"firm\\". I will then compare and contrast their elements, either showing that there is a difference, or that they can be used interchangeably. Question 2: To answer the question \\"What is the difference between a company and a corporation?\\" I need to evaluate the meanings and characteristics of \\"company\\" and \\"corporation\\". After understanding their respective elements, I will then compare and contrast them to identify if there is a significant difference between the two or if they can be used interchangeably. Next, I will compare the two questions to determine if they are the same or different. When comparing the two questions, I notice that both are asking for the differences between the term \\"company\\" and another term – either \\"firm\\" or \\"corporation\\". While the questions share a common component, they differ in that the first question is concerned with \\"firm\\", and the second with \\"corporation\\". Conclusion: The two questions are not the same. While both questions involve comparing the term \\"company\\" with another term, the first question asks for the difference between a company and a firm, whereas the second question asks for the difference between a company and a corporation. The distinction lies in the terms being compared to \\"company\\" – \\"firm\\" in the first question, and \\"corporation\\" in the second."},{"question":"Teacher:Combine the given two facts to write a concluding fact. Note that there should be some parts of the first and second facts that are not mentioned in this conclusion fact. Your combined fact should be the result of a chain between the two facts. Chains form when two facts connect together to produce a concluding fact. An example of a chain is: \\"pesticides cause pollution\\" (fact1) + \\"pollution can harm animals\\" (fact2) → \\"pesticides can harm animals\\" (conclusion fact). Parts of the concluding fact overlap with the first and the second fact. To construct such a concluding fact, a useful way is to borrow the subject from one fact and the ending conclusions from another fact. Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Fact 1: an organism requires energy for growth. Fact 2: Growth has expanded rapidly. Student:","response":"By using the definition of combining facts and creating a chain, we can construct a combined fact.

Now, let's be accurate as possible. Some thinking first:","response":"Based on the given premise, it is not completely accurate to claim that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. Here's a breakdown of the premise and hypothesis: Premise: \\"A hot air balloon touching down with a man's shadow in the background.\\" This premise provides three specific pieces of information: 1. There is a hot air balloon. 2. The hot air balloon is touching down (landing). 3. There is a man's shadow in the background. Hypothesis: \\"A hot air balloon is landing on the ground with people in it.\\" This hypothesis implies the following: 1. A hot air balloon is involved. 2. The hot air balloon is landing on the ground. 3. There are people inside the hot air balloon. While the hypothesis is largely consistent with the premise, there is a discrepancy between the two. The premise mentions the presence of a man's shadow, which could suggest that there is a person outside of the hot air balloon. The hypothesis, on the other hand, indicates that there are people inside the hot air balloon. Given this information, we cannot definitively determine whether the people mentioned in the hypothesis are also present in the premise or whether they are the same person as the one casting the shadow. Therefore, we cannot say with certainty that the hypothesis is completely entailed by the premise."},{"question":"See the multi-choice question below: Sentence 1: to beat people up Sentence 2: To physically assault people.

This figure includes an estimated 1,206,353 persons in parts of northern Rakhine State, Kachin State and Kayin State who were not counted. People who were out of the country at the time of the census are not included in these figures. There are over 600,000 registered migrant workers from Myanmar in Thailand, and millions more work illegally. Burmese migrant workers account for 80% of Thailand's migrant workers. Population density is 76 per square kilometre (200/sq mi), among the lowest in Southeast Asia.\\" Answer: A:","response":"The population dynamics and migration patterns in Myanmar have various implications and effects on nearby countries, particularly the neighboring countries in Southeast Asia. In this context, we will focus on the impacts it has on the political, socio-economic, and environmental aspects in the region. 1. Political Impact: - Strained relations with neighboring countries: The significant number of migrants from Myanmar in countries like Thailand can cause strained relations due to differences in political systems, cultural and ethnic backgrounds, and raise diplomatic tensions as governments have to manage the influx of these migrants, whether legal or illegal. - Regional cooperation and policy coordination: Considering the large populations of Burmese migrants and refugees in neighboring countries, there is a need for proper regional cooperation and policy coordination to ensure their protection and welfare. This can foster closer collaboration among ASEAN countries in creating policies, laws, and agreements on citizenship, labor rights, and the overall rights and welfare of these migrants. 2. Socio-Economic Impact: - Remittances and economic boosts: Migrant workers from Myanmar, such as those registered in Thailand, bring significant financial contributions to their home country by way of remittances. This can help alleviate poverty and promote economic growth in Myanmar, thus contributing to the development of both the source and host countries. - Labor market effects: With the majority of Thailand's migrant workers coming from Myanmar, it can have several effects on the local labor market in Thailand such as filling labor shortages, providing cheap labor for businesses, and fostering competition in employment sectors. - Cultural exchange and diversity: The presence of a significant Burmese population in neighboring countries allows for cultural exchange and brings diversity to the host country's society. This can lead to greater appreciation of different traditions, languages, and religions to enrich social interactions and understanding in the region. 3. Environmental Impact: - Resource sharing and management: With the growing population in Myanmar and an increasing number of migrants in nearby countries, there is a greater need for efficient resource sharing and management in areas such as water, energy, transportation, and waste management. - Cross-border pollution and conservation efforts: As Myanmar's population growth and migration influence the region, there might be an increase in cross-border pollution due to unsustainable practices. This calls for increased cooperation between governments to jointly develop and implement measures to prevent environmental degradation and to promote conservation efforts. In conclusion, the population dynamics in Myanmar and the consequent migration patterns affect nearby countries in several ways. It prompts the need for regional cooperation, policy coordination, and a comprehensive approach to address the related political, socio-economic, and environmental challenges in the area. This reinforces the importance of collaboration and understanding among Southeast Asian nations to ensure a harmonious relationship that benefits everyone involved."},{"question":"Q: I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: what country in the middle east did france take control of after ww1 Suggested answer: On 28 July, the Austro-Hungarians fired the first shots of the war as preparation for the invasion of Serbia .

Context: New Year’s resolutions are great, unless you don’t really resolve to do anything. Then they become a list of wishes. Unless you are going to determine steps to make your wishes turn into goals AND you’re going to follow through with those steps, you probably should not make New Year’s resolutions. Full disclaimer before we completely dive in: I’m not against setting goals. I have always been a goal setter and sometimes even a goal achiever. If you’re the same, you may enjoy this audible, or if you’re interested in developing and achieving SMART goals try this e-book or this book. Why You Shouldn’t Make New Year’s Resolutions You’ll probably write the same things on a sheet of paper that you did the year before. Some of the common resolutions we’ve all heard are: Lose weight, exercise, spend less, save more, travel, go to church, and so on and so forth. There’s a reason these are common. We hear them (or write them) time and time again and…nothing changes. By mid-January, they’ll be long forgotten. Maybe even before January 15th, they aren’t a thought in our minds. They were good ideas two weeks prior (and the years before that), but that’s what they have remained…ideas. You didn’t think of a route to your destination. Saving money sounds great, but do you know what you’re already spending? Do you know what you need to cut and where you’ll put that amount? Have you factored in your new gym membership? What will you do with it? Will the autodraft payment that comes out each month help you shed those pounds? What churches are in your area? Do they have programs your family will be interested in?

This determination should address whether the post is sexually offensive or not, based on the content provided. It's important to remember that the task focuses specifically on sexually explicit content, meaning that if a post is offensive, but doesn't contain sexual content, it should be labelled as 'no'. Step 1: Read the text provided very carefully. Look for any offensive language or explicit sexual reference. The example given is \\"I'm starting to get self-conscious about my body odor On my last two dates, the woman has sprayed me with perfume before we had sex. Not sure of the brand but it had a distinct sharp, peppery smell.\\" Step 2: Consider any potentially offensive language or context.

In this context, while the speaker mentions having sex, it is not portrayed explicitly or in an offensive manner. Step 4: After analyzing the text, decide whether or not it falls into the category of being sexually offensive. In this case, the post isn't sexually offensive, so your answer should be 'no'.

Why did you remove every bit of emotion or tension for the sake of technical glitz? you know, if you wanted to harken to the oldies then why not learn from them first? this piece of dulling cinema was not worth my . A:","response":"The review appears to substantially decrease the chance of buying the product, in this case, a movie. There are several factors we need to consider to analyse this statement: 1. Critical commentary: The reviewer is highly critical of the product. They express their disappointment by stating phrases like, \\"your movie is just lame,\\" or \\"I was let down\\" which are extremely negative remarks and can discourage potential customers. Critical reviews significantly decrease the chance of buying a product as customers tend to avoid products that have attracted intense negative reviews. 2. Unmet Expectation: The reviewer mentions their expectations were not met – \\"I wanted to badly to love it as I have your music.\\" The fact that the reviewer desired to enjoy the product but was let down shows a gap between the consumer’s expectation and the actual quality of the product. Potential buyers often perceive this gap as a major downside, reducing the likelihood of purchasing the product. 3. Technical aspects: The review also criticizes the technical aspects of the movie: \\"all the flashy, nonsensical editing and all the wannabe arty junk.\\" These remarks downplay the product's quality to potential customers, suggesting poor production or execution. 4. Loss of Emotional Connection: The reviewer mentions the removal of \\"every bit of emotion or tension for the sake of technical glitz.\\" This speaks to an important perception that the movie lacked an emotional depth, thus failed to engage the viewer in a meaningful way. For many potential buyers, such an uninvolving and emotionally distanced product could be regarded as unappealing and therefore may discourage them from purchasing the product. 5. Poor Value for Money: The reviewer believes their money was wasted, as indicated by the comment: \\"this piece of dulling cinema was not worth my .\\" This is a strong deterrent for potential buyers as this implies the product does not offer a good return on investment. In conclusion, a review such as this would decrease the likelihood of buying the product due to its overwhelmingly negative commentary on both the qualitative and technical aspects of the movie, coupled with an expressed disappointment from a hitherto fan of the person behind the film. This critique provides a warning to potential consumers about an overall unsatisfactory experience and poor value for money."},{"question":"Tracy played professional football for many years after she was hired.

The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus. - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - Trachyglanis is a genus of loach catfishes from Africa . - The loach catfishes are a family, Amphiliidae, of catfishes (order Siluriformes). They are widespread in tropical Africa, but are most common in streams at high elevations; most species are able to cling to rocks in fast-flowing streams. The 13 genera contain 68 species. After reading the paragraphs above, we are interested in knowing the entity with which 'trachyglanis' exhibits the relationship of 'parent taxon'. Find the answer from the choices below. Choices: - amphiliidae - animal - homo","response":"Based on the provided information, we can derive the answer as follows: Binomial nomenclature is a system that assigns every species two Latin names, the first denoting the genus and the second representing the unique species within that genus. A 'genus' is a taxon that ranks above species and below family in the biological classification scheme. The given information states that 'Trachyglanis' is a genus of loach catfishes from Africa. This genus would thus fall under a higher classification, which is its 'family' or 'parent taxon'. The loach catfishes are part of the family 'Amphiliidae'. From the given choices, 'amphiliidae' falls directly above 'trachyglanis' in the biological hierarchy, serving its parent taxon. Therefore, 'Trachyglanis' exhibits the relationship of 'parent taxon' with 'amphiliidae'."},{"question":"Write an email with the following subject: Wine Country Visit Email:","response":"Subject: Wine Country Visit – Discover, Relish and Unwind in a Picturesque Paradise Dear [Recipient's Name], I hope this email finds you in high spirits and good health.

Here is the equation: -135 * m = 288 * m - 17350 + 5171 - 14470 Let's simplify the equation by first combining like terms on the right side: -135 * m = 288 * m - (17350 - 5171 + 14470) Calculate the sum of the numbers in the brackets: -135 * m = 288 * m - 20649 Now, let's isolate the 'm' by moving all the terms with 'm' to one side of the equation. To do this, add 135 * m to both sides: -135 * m + 135 * m = 288 * m + 135 * m - 20649 Combine the terms with 'm': 0 = 423 * m - 20649 Now, isolate the 'm' by moving the constant term to the other side. To do this, add 20649 to both sides: 20649 = 423 * m Finally, to find the value of 'm', divide both sides by 423: m = 20649 / 423 m ≈ 48.80 Hence, the value of 'm' is approximately 48.80."},{"question":"What's an example of a task that requires knowledge of physical objects to perform?","response":"An example of a task that requires knowledge of physical objects is building a tower with toy blocks.

Let's break it down: 1. \\"Hourly Stats\\" can be translated to \\"Estadísticas por hora\\". The word \\"Estadísticas\\" means \\"Stats\\" in Spanish, and the term \\"por hora\\" stands for \\"Hourly\\". a) Estadísticas: This term is the plural form of the word \\"Estadística\\" which means \\"Statistic\\" in English. In the context of the phrase, \\"Estadísticas\\" refers to a collection of data or figures representing the hourly statistics. b) Por hora: This term is composed of two words – \\"por\\" which is a preposition that denotes a proportional relationship, and \\"hora\\" which is the Spanish word for \\"hour\\". In the context of this phrase, \\"por hora\\" signifies the data or statistics are being represented in hourly intervals. 2. \\"For\\" can be translated as “para” in Spanish. \\"Para\\" is a preposition used to express purpose or destination. In this particular context, it is used to connect the hourly stats with the specific date. 3. \\"August 12, 2018\\" can be translated to \\"el 12 de agosto de 2018\\". In Spanish, dates follow a different format than in English. It uses the format \\"day-month-year\\" with the word \\"de\\" functioning as the preposition \\"of\\" to connect the day with the month and year. a) El: This is a definite article equivalent to the English \\"the\\", used here to determine the day. b) 12: It remains the same as in English, the number representing the day of the month. c) De: This preposition stands for \\"of\\" in English and is used to join the day and the month. d) Agosto: This is the Spanish word for \\"August\\", the eighth month of the year. e) De: We use this preposition again to join the month \\"agosto\\" and the year \\"2018\\". f) 2018: This remains the same as in English. So, putting it all together, “Hourly Stats for August 12, 2018” can be translated as “Estadísticas por hora para el 12 de agosto de 2018” in Spanish."},{"question":"Q:Here's a short story: Tony and Alex are riding motorcycles across the country.

Complete the next sentence: How to relieve chronic back pain naturally Choose the right mattress. You may not realize it, but on average, people spend about a third of their lives lying in bed. Therefore, choosing the right mattress plays an important role in managing back pain. OPTIONS: (A). Therefore, you should pick a mattress that fits your needs and your lifestyle. The ideal mattress should be put in the right, relatively flat place.; (B). Start by choosing a mattress that allows you to transport yourself comfortably. If you feel like you can do well without a mattress, then try sleeping on your back.; (C). You know your body and back best. Though you should choose a mattress based on personal preference, try staying away from soft mattresses.; (D). Standard mattresses can provide excellent support for an entire torso-including your back. If you are overweight, you may want to ramp up the load to avoid popping issues when you sleep.; The answer is:","response":"(C). You know your body and back best. Though you should choose a mattress based on personal preference, try staying away from soft mattresses. Choosing the right mattress can greatly impact your chronic back pain by providing the necessary support and alignment for your spine. Soft mattresses, although comfortable, may not provide the appropriate level of support for individuals with back pain, causing the spine to sink into the mattress and leading to poor posture during sleep. On the other hand, a mattress that is too firm can also cause discomfort by creating pressure points at the hips, shoulders, and other joints. To find the perfect balance, look for a medium-firm to firm mattress that will adequately support your spine while still offering a comfortable contour for the rest of your body. It's essential to test different mattresses and find the one that suits your needs best. This may require visiting various stores, laying on multiple mattresses, and consulting with sales professionals who may be knowledgeable about the best options for specific back issues. Additionally, consider any unique requirements you may have, such as allergies or body temperature regulation, when selecting the ideal mattress. Don't be afraid to invest in a high-quality product – investing in your sleep and spine health is a long-term decision that's well worth the cost."},{"question":"Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative (see options at the end)? a surprisingly funny movie .

Physically fit. [MAN] Late 20s. Physically fit, handsome and confident. [YOUNG WOMAN] Late teens. Physically fit, raw energy, independent and with a great sense of humor. Friedman guesses these young and “physically fit” characters might be Skywalker and Solo spawn (we’d hazard that the first is Luke’s and the third is Leia/Han; number two could go either way). An earlier casting call for the same project also sought older actors for a variety of roles. Meanwhile, in the rest of the world of Star Wars casting, other rumors continue to swirl, especially over whether Benedict Cumberbatch will follow his Star Trek Into Darkness director to a leading role in Star Wars.

He is wearing surfer shorts, which are a type of clothing designed for water activities and sports such as surfing or swimming. 3. He is standing on a boogie board, which is a piece of equipment used in recreational water activities like bodyboarding on waves at the beach. However, the hypothesis states that the young man is about to go swimming in a pool. There is not enough information in the premise to directly confirm or refute the hypothesis. The situation described in the premise takes place at the beach, but we have no information on whether the young man is planning to swim in a pool later, or if there is even a pool nearby. It is important to differentiate between the beach and a pool, as they are two distinct environments for water activities. A beach has waves and other natural elements, such as tides and currents, which create a different experience than swimming in a pool, where the water is usually still, and conditions are more controlled. While we cannot completely eliminate the possibility that the hypothesis could be true, we cannot confirm it based on the premise provided. The young man could potentially enjoy swimming in both environments, but that information is not given in the premise.

The drug, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase), the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, decreases blood levels of cholesterol by induce the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. The increased levels of the LDL-receptors stimulate the catabolism of plasma LDL, removing cholesterol from plasma, which is an important determinant of atherosclerosis. You may know of people who take a statin to help with their cholesterol levels. However, these drugs probably work slightly differently in many of those people. In some, it lowers their cholesterol significantly; in others it may lower it only moderately; and in some, it may have no significant effect at all.

Because of the genetic background of all people; the different single nucleotide polymorphisms that make us all different.

The statement, \\"A child soccer player runs for a ball near the goal,\\" indicates that the child is playing soccer, not basketball. Soccer and basketball are two distinct sports with separate sets of rules and gameplay. Soccer involves players using their feet, body, and head to move a ball around the field, while basketball involves players primarily using their hands to dribble and pass a ball around the court. In soccer, the primary objective is to score goals by maneuvering the ball into the opponent's goal, while in basketball, the primary objective is to score points by throwing the ball into a hoop. A soccer field is typically larger than a basketball court, and goals in soccer are made of vertical goalposts and a horizontal crossbar, while a basket in basketball comprises a hoop and a backboard. Thus, based on the information provided, the child is playing soccer, and it cannot be concluded that the child is playing basketball."},{"question":"Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: Do Macropidia and Crescentia only produce flowers? A:","response":"Macropidia and Crescentia are two distinct genera of flowering plants, but they do not only produce flowers. Apart from flowers, these plants also produce other important structures necessary for growth, reproduction, and survival. Macropidia, commonly known as Black Kangaroo Paw, is a monotypic genus within the family Haemodoraceae, native to Western Australia. Its single species, Macropidia fuliginosa, is characterized by its distinctive black and green flowers. This perennial plant not only produces flowers but also features other structures, such as: 1. Rhizome: Macropidia fuliginosa has a rhizome, or underground stem, which allows the plant to store nutrients and produce new shoots. The rhizome aids in the growth and asexual reproduction of the plant. 2. Leaves: The plant has long, narrow strap-like leaves that grow in a fan-shaped arrangement, channeling water to the base of the plant. 3. Seeds: After pollination, the plant produces fruits containing seeds that can be dispersed by wind or animals to propagate and establish new plants. Crescentia, commonly known as Calabash or Gourd tree, is a genus in the family Bignoniaceae, native to Central and South America. The best-known species in this genus is Crescentia cujete, which is widely cultivated for its large, round, hard-shelled fruits. Apart from producing showy, tubular flowers, Crescentia plants have other essential structures, such as: 1. Leaves: Crescentia species have simple, deciduous leaves that are important for photosynthesis and gas exchange, essential for the plant's growth and energy production. 2. Fruits: After flowers are pollinated, Crescentia species develop large, woody, gourd-like fruits. These fruits are used by humans for various purposes, such as making containers or musical instruments. The seeds within the fruits support the plant's reproductive processes. 3. Stem and branches: Crescentia trees have a woody stem and branches that provide structural support, allowing the plant to grow upwards and resist decay. In summary, both Macropidia and Crescentia genera produce flowers as part of their reproductive process. However, they also produce other structures, such as rhizomes, leaves, seeds, and fruits, which are essential for their overall growth, survival, and propagation."},{"question":"White House accused of abandoning imprisoned US aid worker in Cuba The Obama administration was accused on Tuesday of abandoning a US aid worker imprisoned in Cuba and of endangering his life by running a “cockamamie” program to create a Twitter-like network on the island nation. Senator Patrick Leahy challenged Rajiv Shah, the head of the US agency for international development, to explain why the agency had moved forward with the “Cuban Twitter” program, known as ZunZuneo, after the aid worker, Alan Gross, was arrested in December 2009. “Did USAid consider that the possible discovery of this program, which USAid knew about … if the Cuban government discovered it, did anybody consider what that might have meant for Alan Gross?” Leahy, a Vermont Democrat, asked Shah at an appropriations subcommittee hearing. “Alan’s detention is wrong,” Shah said. “The responsibility for his detention rests with Cuban authorities.” The ZunZuneo program was first exposed last week in a report by the Associated Press. In a blogpost Monday, USAid, a 1960s-era agency with a core mission of fighting poverty and hunger abroad while flying the US flag, defended the ZunZuneo program as in line with its broader mission. Leahy on Tuesday called USAid’s surveillance mission “dumb in its inception”, and described it as a “cockamamie” idea that was doomed to fail. “Why would we put that mission as part of USAid?” asked senator Mike Johanns, Republican of Nebraska. “To me it seems crazy. It just seems crazy that you would be in the middle of that. That’s just my observation.” Shah defended USAid’s communications infiltration activities as a “core part of what USAid has done for some time and continues to do,” in Cuba “and in many other parts of the world.” The agency has an annual budget of 15-20m to spend on “democracy programs” in Cuba. Gross was a government contractor employed by USAid to carry out an infiltration program that was not part of ZunZuneo. Gross, who is serving a 15-year sentence, began a hunger strike last week to protest Obama administration inaction on his imprisonment. “As far as I can tell, USAid and the Obama administration has all but forgotten about him,” Leahy said. “Told by the administration, ‘Well, if you only knew all the things we’re doing’ – all I know is whatever they’re doing hasn’t accomplished one darn thing. Whatever past attempts they’ve made have achieved nothing.” Shah, 41, a former executive with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, is credited with having revitalized USAid since he took over in 2009. Under Shah’s leadership the agency has dramatically cut back on the portion of its approximately 20bn budget that goes to government contractor and funneled more money into loan guarantees for local banks and other local organizations in target countries. Praise at Tuesday’s hearing for the agency’s work was overshadowed, however, by a sense of disbelief that USAid seemed to be dabbling in spycraft. Shah said the ZunZuneo program was “discreet” but “absolutely not” covert. “This program has been notified publicly in Congressional budget notifications,” he said, referring to internal budget breakdowns. “The notifications point out that we are working to increase the free flow of information and support civil society engagement using new technology.” Leahy said the budget notifications did not count as making the programs public. “I’ve read those,” he said. “Talk about bureaucratese. If you could figure out that it meant this, you’re doing a lot better job than most of us.” What are the most important parts of this text?","response":"The most important parts of this text are: 1. The Obama administration was accused of abandoning a US aid worker named Alan Gross, who was imprisoned in Cuba. 2.

The engines were made by Ford, under licence. The 17,316 workers employed in Ford's purpose-built factory had produced 34,000 engines by the war's end. The facility was designed in two separate sections to minimise the impact of bomb damage on production. The wood-working factory of F. Hills & Sons built more than 800 Percival Proctor aircraft for the RAF between 1940 and 1945, which were flight tested at the nearby Barton Aerodrome. Other companies produced gun bearings, steel tracks for Churchill tanks, munitions, Bailey bridges, and much else. ICI built and operated the first facility in the UK able to produce penicillin in quantity.As an important industrial area, the park suffered from extensive bombing, particularly during the Manchester Blitz of December 1940. On the night of 23 December 1940, the Metropolitan-Vickers aircraft factory in Mosley Road was badly damaged, with the loss of the first 13 MV-built Avro Manchester bombers in final assembly. The new Ford factory producing aircraft engines was bombed only a few days after its opening in May 1941. Trafford Hall was severely damaged by bombing, and was demolished shortly after the war ended.In the December 1940 air raids, stray bombs aiming for Trafford Park landed on Old Trafford football stadium, the nearby home of Manchester United, but this air raid only resulted in minor damage and matches were soon being played at the stadium again. On 11 March 1941, however, stray bombs aimed at Trafford Park fell onto Old Trafford for a second time, causing serious damage to the stadium. It was comprehensively rebuilt after the war and re-opened in 1949, until which time Manchester United played their home games at Maine Road, the stadium of Manchester City in Moss Side.At the outbreak of war in..., can you guess it ?

Public figures including Shahab Hosseini, who won the best actor award at this year’s Cannes film festival, have thrown their weight behind efforts to persuade families of victims to choose forgiveness over retribution. Reports from inside Iran show that an increasing number of Iranians held on murder charges are being spared the gallows as the nationwide campaign gains traction. According to the Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHR), which documents Iran’s use of the death penalty, the number of people whose lives were saved last year after being pardoned outnumbered those who were known to have been put to death for murder. Iran’s Islamic penal code allows the victim’s heir – walli-ye-dam – to personally execute the condemned under qisas (retribution) laws, in some cases even by pushing away the chair the convict is standing on. The same law also allows families to pardon the convict, often in exchange for a financial compensation known as diyah. A recent event at Tehran’s Koroush cinema, which was aimed at raising money for the families who are trying to secure a pardon, attracted big numbers. Hosseini was joined at the event by actor Mahtab Keramanti and the country’s vice-president for women’s affairs, Shahindokht Molaverdi. Nearly £60,000 was raised and at least one attendee donated her earrings. Although the convicts in such cases are facing death because of murder or complicity in the crime, activists say people are showing sympathy because they favour forgiveness. Some, but not all, of such prisoners are women who have killed their husbands but activists say they were themselves victims of domestic violence. Others include juvenile offenders who have committed crimes before reaching the age of 18, usually in a street brawl. Maryam Osoli and Sahar Mehabadi are both out of prison after being pardoned in recent months, according to activists. “This is a welcomed phenomenon,” Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam, an activist from the IHR, told the Guardian on the sidelines of the sixth World Congress Against the Death Penalty in Oslo. “People, where they have the possibility, choose forgiveness instead of death penalty. “Traditionally families of murder victims are encouraged to choose retribution, but here they say no to retribution and refuse to take the responsibility of taking another life. You can see an increasing trend where more people choose forgiveness than retribution.” Some Islamic scholars have highlighted that while Qur’an allows qisas, it also encourages forgiveness. In one prison, the lives of at least six women have been spared in the past six months because activists have been successful in persuading families to accept the diyah. But countrywide numbers are believed to be much higher. Under the Iranian law, the woman’s blood money is only half that of a man, but Iran approved a law earlier this year making the blood money equal for men and women in cases involving car accidents. The usual diyah is about 1.9bn rials (£38,000) for unintentional killings but some families ask for much higher in other cases. In 2015, at least 262 people on death row for murder were forgiven in Iran compared with 207 convicts executed for such crimes, according to the IHR. Although the history of people showing forgiveness is not new, many activists say a recent incident was a turning point in significantly increasing such pardons last year: in April 2014, an Iranian mother spared the life of a young man who had killed er son at last minute in an extraordinary episode that drew the world’s attention and also appeared on the front page of this newspaper. Despite this, Iran is still among the world’s top countries with the most executions because despite pardons in cases involving murder, drug-related executions have continued to surge. In most cases in Iran people put to death for drug offences. Madyar Samienejad, an Oslo-based human rights defender, struck a cautious tone, saying that the ultimate change should come from a shakeup in the law. “In some cases, families are demanding very unreasonable amounts of money for financial compensation in order to pardon the convict and this is not a culture that should become the norm. Only a change in the legislation can guarantee that we would ultimately see a country without death penalty.” Last year, Iran executed nearly 1,000 people, which was more than any other country apart from China. Executions in Iran, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia accounted for 89% of the total known executions worldwide in 2015. In first six month of this year, Iran is known to have executed between 182 to 201 people, which is a considerable drop compared with last year but activists were not sure if it amounted to an indication in a change in policy as the country went through parliamentary elections, a period when the authorities normally refrain from executing convicts. The Guardian travelled to Oslo for the sixth World Congress Against the Death Penalty on an invitation by its organiser, the French NGO Ensemble Contre la Peine de Mort (ECPM), which paid for its flight, accommodation and food. What was this article about?","response":"This article discusses an ongoing campaign in Iran that aims to save the lives of convicts on death row by encouraging forgiveness. A number of Iranian celebrities and public figures have joined the campaign in an effort to persuade the families of victims to choose forgiveness over retribution, as Iran has one of the world's highest records of executions. Iran's Islamic penal code allows the victim's heir to personally execute the condemned individual under qisas (retribution) laws, but the same law also allows families to pardon the convict, often in exchange for financial compensation called diyah. As the campaign gains traction, an increasing number of Iranians held on murder charges are being spared the gallows, with pardoned individuals outnumbering the executed. Many activists and Islamic scholars have highlighted that while Iran's law allows qisas, it also encourages forgiveness. However, while the numbers of pardoned convicts have risen, Iran still ranks among the world's top countries for executions primarily due to drug-related cases.

Solve 15*a + 109 = -383*a - 289 for a.","response":"To solve the linear equation 15*a + 109 = -383*a - 289 for a, follow these step-by-step instructions: Step 1: Move all terms with the variable 'a' on one side of the equation. Add 383*a to both sides of the equation to move the -383*a term to the left side: 15*a + 383*a + 109 = -383*a + 383*a - 289 Simplifying the equation, we have: (15 + 383)*a + 109 = -289 Step 2: Simplify the left side of the equation. Combine the like terms (the coefficients of 'a'): 398*a + 109 = -289 Step 3: Move the constant value to the right side of the equation. Subtract 109 from both sides of the equation to isolate the 'a' term: 398*a + 109 - 109 = -289 - 109 Simplifying the equation, we have: 398*a = -398 Step 4: Solve for 'a'. To find the value of 'a', divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of 'a', which is 398: a = (-398) / 398 Step 5: Simplify the result. Divide the numerator by the denominator to get the value of 'a': a = -1 So, the solution to the equation 15*a + 109 = -383*a - 289 is a = -1."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Q: How many membranes form the mitochondrion structure of a cell?

His emotional state made it impossible for him to study, and within a month of his arrival in Italy, he began the journey back to England, stopping in Paris on 26 October 1816. There he enrolled in the atelier of Jean-Baptiste Regnault but found the atmosphere rowdy and the studio too full of Frenchmen, and he left after a week. While in Paris he also attended the Académie des Beaux-Arts, and amassed a large quantity of prints from the art shops of Paris. Still homesick, Etty left Paris, returning to London in November.Notwithstanding his unhappiness, Etty appears to have developed as a painter during his travels. For the first time, his two paintings exhibited at the 1817 Summer Exhibition (Bacchanalians: a Sketch and Cupid and Euphrosyne) attracted a favourable review in the press, in this case from William Paulet Carey writing in the Literary Gazette who considered Bacchanalians \\"a fine classical invention\\" and Cupid as showing \\"splendid promise\\". Carey was later to take great pride in being the first critic to recognise Etty's potential, and continued to champion him throughout his career. In 1818 Etty entered a copy of Damiano Mazza's The Rape of Ganymede—at the time thought to be by Titian—in one of the Royal Academy's painting competitions. Easily the most accomplished entry in the competition, Etty was due to win until two of the other contestants complained that he had technically breached RA rules by briefly removing the painting from Academy premises to work on it at home; they further complained that Etty was technically a professional artist and thus ineligible for the contest despite his still being a student.

Then she went into the kitchen and grabbed what she needed before going back up to her room quietly. She switched on the TV and started eating...and eating...for hours, until it was all gone. What Emily didn't know at the time was that she was suffering from an illness called binge-eating disorder(BED) . For years, Emily didn't tell anyone what she was doing. She felt ashamed, alone, and out of control. Why don't famous people confess to BED, as they do to _ ? It's simple: There's a stigma involved. \\"Overeating is seen as very bad, but dieting to be skinny is seen as positive and even associated with determination,\\" says Charles Sophy, a doctor in Beverly Hills , California. \\"Some parents or friends may look at a teen with BED and think, 'Oh, a good diet and some will-power will do the trick.' But that's not true,\\" says Dr.Ovidio Bermudez , a baby doctor at the Eating Recovery Center in Denver. \\"Eating disorders are real physical and mental health issues; it's not about willpower.\\" The focus in treating BED shouldn't be on weight, because as with all eating disorders, the behaviors with food are a symptom of something deeper. Like most other diseases, genetics may play a big part in who gets BED and who doesn't. If you have a close relative with an eating disorder, that means you're more likely to develop an eating disorder of your own. Besides, many people with BED have tried at some point or another to control it by going on a diet, but paying more attention to food doesn't help. And it might even make things worse, like it did for Carla, who's 15 now and is recovering from BED. \\"My parents would always tease me about my weight, so when I was 14, I went on a very restrictive diet,\\" she says. When you can't have something, you only want it more, so every time Carla would have a bite of something that wasn't allowed on her strict diet. She would quickly lose control and binge . Question: What can we learn from Carla's story? Answer: Choices: (A). BED is an incurable disease.; (B). BED has something to do with genes.; (C). Going on a diet won't help BED patients.; (D). BED patients should pay attention to their food.; The answer is:","response":"(C). Going on a diet won't help BED patients."},{"question":"Write a sentence about a restaurant with all the following attributes: name = The Wrestlers, eatType = restaurant, priceRange = moderate, customer rating = high","response":"The Wrestlers is a restaurant where people go to eat yummy food that doesn't cost too much money, and lots of people say it's really, really good!"},{"question":"Sentence 1: That was good, you know distinctly good. Sentence 2: That was horrible, distinctly miserable. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","response":"Imagine you have two ice cream flavors. Sentence 1 is like saying, \\"This chocolate ice cream is yummy, really really yummy.\\" Sentence 2 is like saying, \\"This spinach ice cream is yucky, really really yucky.\\" If you believe that the chocolate ice cream is indeed yummy (which means Sentence 1 is true), it doesn't automatically mean that the spinach ice cream is yucky (or that Sentence 2 is true). These two sentences are separate and can be both true, only one true, or neither true. So, the second sentence can be true, but it doesn't have to be true just because the first sentence is true."},{"question":"Where to put the rope before we start the hike? Options: - swimming pool - lower person - boat - backpack - lay down Step-by-step reasoning process below:","response":"Before you start your hike, carefully consider the purpose for which you are bringing the rope along. Here is a step-by-step analysis of the options you provided and the reasoning behind each choice: 1. Swimming pool: This option generally doesn't apply to hiking. Ropes used at swimming pools are typically for lane dividers and have a specific place near the pool itself. 2. Lower person: If you mean attaching the rope to a person for a climb or descent during the hike, this is relevant to technical hiking, climbing or mountaineering trips. In such cases, you will first need to coile the rope and store it in a backpack. Only attach it to a person when you reach the point where roping up is necessary. 3. Boat: If your hike includes any water-based activities like canoeing or crossing a river, a rope may be necessary. In this case, you should keep the rope coiled and secured in the boat until the time comes to use it. But generally, rope for hiking is not stored on a boat beforehand. 4. Backpack (Recommended storage option): The best and most logical option would be to pack the rope securely inside the backpack. For this, you should first coil the rope and compress it to save space. You can then place the coil inside or strap it onto your backpack according to the intended purpose and the type of hike. This way, the rope is portable, safe, and easily accessible. 5. Lay down: This option doesn't offer much clarity in terms of practical storage for a hike. Leaving a rope lying on the ground or laid out will not be effective in transporting it. It could also increase the chances of damage or contamination. In summary, packing the rope in your backpack is the best option to store it before you start your hike. This way, the rope is properly stored, easy to access, and ready for use whenever it is needed during your adventure."},{"question":"Gunmen loyal to Bosnian Serb nationalist leader Radovan Karadzic conquered 70% of Bosnia with their arsenal of tanks, aircraft and howitzers bequeathed by the Yugoslav army. Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? Nationalists conquered the majority of Bosnia.","response":"Yes, the next sentence follows given the preceding text. Here's a detailed explanation: In the preceding text, we learn about the gunmen who were loyal to the Bosnian Serb nationalist leader Radovan Karadzic. These armed men used a variety of powerful weapons, such as tanks, aircraft, and howitzers. They obtained these weapons from the former Yugoslav army, which had either surrendered or disbanded. As a result of their military force and determination, the gunmen managed to conquer roughly 70% of Bosnia, which is more than two-thirds of the territory. This represents a significant portion of the country and a clear demonstration of their strength and control. The following sentence – \\"Nationalists conquered the majority of Bosnia\\" – effectively summarizes the main point of the preceding text. The term \\"nationalists\\" refers to the gunmen who were loyal to Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb nationalist leader. By conquering the majority of Bosnia, they successfully advanced their nationalist agenda and extended their influence over a substantial part of the country. Therefore, the next sentence is an accurate and concise summary of the situation described in the preceding text. It captures the key idea – the nationalists were able to take control over the majority of Bosnia with their display of firepower and military strength. This, in turn, underscores the seriousness and severity of the conflict at the time."},{"question":"Multi-choice question: Same meaning?

Stream-of-consciousness explanation: When considering the idea of humans breathing underwater without any equipment or modifications, one must take into account the basic anatomy and physiological capabilities of the human body. The respiratory system in humans is designed to extract oxygen from the air, which is inhaled through the nose and mouth, and then transported through the trachea, bronchi, and lungs, where the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide takes place. This process is specifically adapted for extracting oxygen from the gaseous atmosphere, and not from a liquid environment like water. In water, oxygen is dissolved, and the concentration of oxygen is much lower than it is in the air. Even if the human body were somehow capable of extracting dissolved oxygen from water, the rate of oxygen extraction would be far too slow to meet the body's metabolic demands. Additionally, the human lung structure is not adapted for water-based respiration, which is evident when we compare ourselves to aquatic animals like fish, which have specialized organs called gills that are designed for extracting oxygen from water. One might also consider the physical barriers of the respiratory system when submerged in water. The trachea and bronchi would be filled with water, making it difficult to inhale or exhale. The alveoli in our lungs are lined with a thin layer of fluid, forming a barrier for the gas exchange between the air and our blood. Submerging our lungs in water would dissolve this layer, causing the alveoli's walls to collapse, which would further reduce the surface area for gas exchange. In conclusion, due to the limitations of the human respiratory system and the physiological differences between air and water, it is not possible for humans to breathe underwater without any equipment or modifications. The answer to the question is no."},{"question":"Can we draw the following hypothesis from the context (see options)?

He found it helpful to categorize different scenarios in the model. First, he labeled electron with higher energy as cat A, and electron with lower energy as cat B. Then he labeled electron that gained energy as cat C, and election that lost energy as cat D. But I can use this background: As a young man, Bohr worked in Rutherford’s lab in England. Because Rutherford’s model was weak on the position of the electrons, Bohr focused on them. He hypothesized that electrons can move around the nucleus only at fixed distances from the nucleus based on the amount of energy they have. He called these fixed distances energy levels, or electron shells. He thought of them as concentric spheres, with the nucleus at the center of each sphere. In other words, the shells consisted of sphere within sphere within sphere. Furthermore, electrons with less energy would be found at lower energy levels, closer to the nucleus. Those with more energy would be found at higher energy levels, farther from the nucleus. Bohr also hypothesized that if an electron absorbed just the right amount of energy, it would jump to the next higher energy level. Conversely, if it lost the same amount of energy, it would jump back to its original energy level. However, an electron could never exist in between two energy levels. These ideas are illustrated in the Figure below . What is an answer for this question: Which electron would be farther from the nucleus, cat A or cat B? The answer is:","response":"The electron that would be farther from the nucleus, according to Greg's categorization and Bohr's model, is cat A. To better understand this answer, let's review the information and concepts given in the background: 1. Bohr's model describes the behavior of electrons in an atom and their arrangement around the nucleus. 2. Electrons are located at fixed distances from the nucleus, based on their energy levels, or electron shells. 3. These shells are concentric spheres with the nucleus at the center of each sphere. 4. Electrons with less energy are found at lower energy levels, which are closer to the nucleus. 5. Electrons with more energy are found at higher energy levels, which are farther from the nucleus. Now, let's analyze Greg's categorization of electrons: - Cat A: Electron with higher energy - Cat B: Electron with lower energy - Cat C: Electron that gained energy - Cat D: Electron that lost energy The question specifically asks which electron would be farther from the nucleus, cat A or cat B. According to Bohr's model, electrons with more energy are found at higher energy levels, which are farther from the nucleus. Since cat A refers to the electron with higher energy, it would be located farther from the nucleus compared to cat B, which has lower energy. Therefore, based on Greg's categorization and Bohr's model, cat A would be farther from the nucleus than cat B."},{"question":"Information: - Vanuatu (or ; Bislama ), officially the Republic of Vanuatu (Bislama: \\"Ripablik blong Vanuatu\\"), is a Pacific island nation located in the South Pacific Ocean.

LOS ANGELES West Coast ports, closed to incoming cargo vessels during the three-day holiday weekend, reopened in full on Tuesday as Labor Secretary Tom Perez arrived in San Francisco seeking to broker a settlement ending months of shipping disruptions. Perez was sent to meet with the two sides in the conflict at the behest of President Barack Obama, who has come under mounting pressure to intervene in a labor dispute that has cascaded through the U.S. commercial supply chain and beyond. It was not immediately clear whether Perez would meet with the two sides together or separately. But one source familiar with the situation said Perez would likely huddle in a room with the principal negotiators from both sides, along with the federal mediator who joined the talks last month. Administration officials offered few details. \\"Secretary Perez has meetings with both parties today in San Francisco,\\" spokeswoman Xochitl Hinojosa said in an email. \\"He'll urge the parties to resolve their dispute quickly at the bargaining table. We don't have any updates at this time.\\" Labor law experts said Obama has few other options at his disposal to spur a settlement in the contract negotiations, which have dragged on for nine months amid worsening cargo backups and curtailed port operations that the two sides have blamed on each other. And it was not clear what Perez could bring to the table besides the symbolic weight of Cabinet-level involvement. The International Longshore and Warehouse Union, representing 20,000 dockworkers, and the bargaining agent for shipping companies and terminal operations, the Pacific Maritime Association, have declined public comment since agreeing last Friday to honor a news blackout requested by the mediator. The PMA previously said the talks hit a snag on a union demand for changes in the system of binding arbitration of contract disputes. The union has insisted an accord is near. Operations to load and unload cargo vessels at all 29 West Coast ports were halted through the holiday weekend as of Friday night but resumed Tuesday morning, port authorities said. More than 30 freighters idled through the weekend waiting for berths to open outside the adjacent ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, the nation's two busiest cargo hubs. It was the longest such suspension in the months-long labor dispute. Vessel operations were likewise halted for two days last weekend, and again last Thursday, a union holiday. But shippers said work at the ports has continued in the dockyards, rail yards and terminal gates to move cargo already unloaded from ships. DOMINO EFFECT The affected ports handle nearly half of all U.S. maritime trade and more than 70 percent of shipments from Asia. A domino effect has rippled through much of the U.S. economy, extending to agriculture, manufacturing, retail and transportation, hitting imports and exports alike. The shippers have said they were curtailing port operations because it makes no sense to pay dockworkers premium overnight, holiday and weekend wages during union-caused work slowdowns the companies say have brought the ports to the brink of gridlock. The union has faulted changes in shipping practices instituted by the carriers themselves for congesting the ports, including super-sized freighters delivering higher volumes of cargo all at once, and say that suspending vessel operations has only worsened matters. The last time contract talks led to a full shutdown of the West Coast ports was in 2002, when the companies imposed a lockout that was lifted 10 days later under a court order sought by President George W. Bush under the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act. The two sides went on to clinch a deal in the ensuing \\"cooling-off\\" period, but the shipping industry has estimated the 2002 lockout caused 15.6 billion in U.S. economic losses. Then as now, the companies accused the union of instigating slowdowns that precipitated the crisis. Invoking Taft-Hartley under current circumstances would appear to be a long shot, said Daniel Mitchell, a professor emeritus for management and public policy at the University of California, Los Angeles. Obama would need to convince a federal judge that there was a work stoppage - not just a slowdown - stemming from a labor dispute and that it posed a national emergency, rather than an inconvenience to industry, Mitchell said.

As a result, shipping operations were delayed, ports were congested, and a domino effect impacted various sectors, including agriculture, manufacturing, retail, and transportation. The affected ports accounted for nearly half of all U.S. maritime trade and over 70% of shipments from Asia. The labor dispute caused operations to load and unload cargo vessels at all 29 West Coast ports to be halted during the weekends, leading to freighters waiting idle for berths to open in Los Angeles and Long Beach, the nation's two busiest cargo hubs. The dispute lasted for nine months, with both sides blaming each other for the increasing cargo backups and worsening port operations. In response, President Obama sent Labor Secretary Tom Perez to broker a settlement to end the disruptions. However, options for a resolution were limited for the President, and it wasn't clear what Perez could bring to the table other than the symbolic involvement of the Cabinet. Eventually, the labor dispute impacted businesses like ocean carrier Maersk Line, which had to cancel some sailings, and trucking operations that saw a severe decrease in their daily haulage. The dispute also led to calls for invoking the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act, a process that required President Obama to convince a federal judge that the situation posed a national emergency."},{"question":"Write a sentence about a restaurant with all the following attributes: name = Blue Spice, food = Italian, priceRange = high, area = riverside","response":"Blue Spice is a fancy restaurant by the river where they make yummy Italian food, like pizza and pasta, but it costs a lot of money to eat there."},{"question":"Review: Spoiler alert  although I think this one was spoiled coming out of the can It's hard to even imagine that a film with these stars, from this studio, made at this time period, could be so awful, but it is. It is the film's biggest flaw by far that it just doesn't make any damn sense. Rich widower American aristocrat Penn Gaylord leaves his small daughter \\"in charge\\" and goes off to World War I where he is killed. Then we flash forward to present day (1942) and total confusion. The three sisters are in court where they are said to have spent the last twenty years, and some jerk named Barclay is trying to take their home away from them. This is just the beginning of an endless series of unanswered questions that comprises the script, more holes in it than The Warren Report. What happened to the Gaylord fortune? If the will is worth half a billion, why has the family home gone from an opulent palace to the house on The Munsters? Who the devil is this Barclay clown? And why is he able to take someone's home away from them? The questions just pile on top of more questions. The usually affable and charming George Brent is playing Barclay, who is inexplicably a total sod tromping all over everyone, taking whatever the heck he wants no matter who it belongs to and without a twinge of guilt; yet no one besides Fiona (Barbara Stanwick) seems to particularly dislike this cretin. Why? None of these questions are ever answered. We instead just follow Fiona's life from one train wreck to another, the evil Barclay takes away her home, her fortune, and even her child. What does she do? Shoot him? Set him on fire? No, too logical. In a completely improbably wrap-up, this woman, who's only prior romantic involvement with Barclay was, save for the technicality of marriage, rape, suddenly decides mid-sentence (literally) that she does not hate him, she loves him. And they're going to live happily ever after. All of a sudden for no reason in the world, this early female role model of independence and authority is transformed into the usual helpless ankle-twisting twit more commonly found in films of this era. Yeah, sure, steal everything in the world that belongs to me and I'll fall in love with you. On what planet does that happen?

Please tell me if those questions are the same. Choose your answer from: (a). no (b). yes","response":"(a). no These two questions are not the same, as they address different aspects related to downvoting. Let me provide you with detailed explanations for both. 1. Why do you downvote answers? Downvoting is a feature usually present in online platforms, forums, or websites with user-generated content. The primary purpose of downvoting is to express disagreement with an answer, comment, or post. It is important to remember that the reasons for downvoting may vary from user to user. However, common situations where downvoting is employed include: - The content is factually incorrect or misleading: Users should downvote answers that provide false information or might lead other users to make wrong decisions or conclusions based on incorrect facts. - The content is of low quality: Low-quality answers or comments that show a lack of effort, do not provide substantial information, or fail to address the question may be downvoted by users. - Offensive or inappropriate content: Users should use the downvote feature to signal content that violates community guidelines or is disrespectful, offensive, or inappropriate in any way. This helps moderators and administrators to identify problematic content and maintain a healthy community environment. - The content does not contribute positively to the discussion: Sometimes, a comment or post may not necessarily be harmful or negative, but it doesn't add value to the discussion. In such cases, users may choose to downvote the content. 2. How do I use downvote correctly? To downvote correctly, you should consider the following guidelines: - Be objective: Downvote based on the content, not the person who posted it. Evaluate each answer, comment, or post fairly and independently. - Consider helpful intent: If a user's comments are not entirely accurate but demonstrate a helpful, well-meaning intent, try to provide constructive feedback instead of downvoting immediately. - Avoid downvoting simply because you disagree: The downvote feature should not be used to silence opinions or ideas that do not align with your own but are otherwise respectful and adhere to community guidelines. Downvotes should be reserved for genuinely unhelpful or problematic content. - Be respectful and considerate: When you downvote, bear in mind that your actions can affect the mood and environment of the community. Keep the downvoting criteria in mind and refrain from using it in a vindictive or bullying manner. To summarise, while the two questions you asked are related to downvoting, they address different aspects, making them distinct from one another. The first question focuses on the reasons and motivations behind downvoting, while the second question is more about the appropriate use and etiquette associated with the downvote feature."},{"question":"How is \\"Much of the skepticism stems from neighbouring Iran's enrichment programme, which has clouded global nuclear and non-proliferation issues.\\" said in Turkish?","response":"\\"Çoğu şüphecilik, komşu İran'ın zenginleştirme programından kaynaklanmaktadır, bu da küresel nükleer ve yayılmayı önleme konularını gölgelemiştir.\\" söylenir.

In the high-profile case that sparked awareness of cyber-bullying and harassment of gay teenagers, Ravi, 20, was convicted on parts of all 15 counts against him — including four bias intimidation counts — involving his former roommate, Tyler Clementi, an 18-year-old freshman. However, the jury had some difficulty with portions of the bias counts, giving a split verdict on some of the specific acts in which he was charged. The jury found Ravi not guilty of all bias counts pertaining to the man Clementi was seen with during the webcam spying. Sitting passively at the defense table, his parents seated in the first row behind him in the standing-room-only courtroom, Ravi showed little emotion as the verdict was read by the forewoman. The 15-member jury, including three alternates, reached its verdict shortly before noon, following two and a half days of deliberation. \\"We had a 20-year-old's life in our hands,\\" said juror Bruno Ferreira. \\"We were deciding his fate.\\" • FULL BREAKDOWN OF THE CHARGES AND EACH VERDICT Sentencing has been tentatively set for May 21. Ravi also faces the possibility of deportation to his native India. Prosecutors declined to change the status on Ravi's 25,000 bail. He already surrendered his passport. 47 Gallery: PHOTOS: Dharun Ravi convicted in Rutgers webcam spying trial Clementi committed suicide a few days after learning Ravi had watched him on a webcam set up in the dorm room the two young men shared. Ravi was never charged in connection with Clementi's death, in the closely-watched case that attracted national media attention. The Clementi family, who was present throughout the proceedings, afterward expressed their thanks to prosecutors and the judge in the case but said the trial was difficult for the family. “The trial was painful for us, as it would be for any parents. We wanted to be here for our son and we believe the trial is important,\\" said Tyler’s father, Joe Clementi. “We have come to understand that criminal law is only one way of addressing these problems.\\" Noting the establishment of the Tyler Clementi Foundation in his son’s memory, Clementi said, “You can make the world a better place. The change you want to see in the world begins with you.\\" Following the verdict, Middlesex County Prosecutor Bruce Kaplan said the investigation had been uniquely challenging because “we didn’t have Tyler to testify.” He added that identifying and analyzing all of the social media was another challenge of prosecuting. Kaplan said the prosecution went to \\"extraordinary efforts\\" to protect the identity of the man Clementi was kissing when Ravi saw them, who testified during the trial. Named only as “M.B.” in court proceedings and documents, his identity was protected because he was considered a sex crime victim in the case. “Tyler Clementi and M.B. were the victims of invasion of privacy,” said Kaplan. “Regardless of public opinion we were obligated to follow the law, we were obligated to follow the facts.” Attorneys for Ravi had no immediate comment, but one of them later told The Star-Ledger he plans to file an appeal. \\"We have a large number of issues surrounding evidence and law, as we dictated during the course of the trial,\\" defense attorney Steve Altman said. \\"Some of that evidence was determined by the judge to be irrelevant, that we think is very relevant.\\" After the judge set a sentencing date, Ravi and his family were ushered out the front of the courtroom. As Ravi stepped out of the courtroom to the flashing cameras, his mother placed her arm around the small of his back. The family and their lawyers headed to the elevators and were surrounded by a crush of media as they waited to board the elevators, while some reporters and camera crews ran downstairs to try to catch them on the way out. Before the case went to trial, Ravi rejected a plea deal that would have allowed him to avoid jail. Under the terms, he would have gotten probation and be required to perform 600 hours of community service and receive counseling. JURY NOT IN CONFLICT Ferreira said the jurors were not in conflict with each other during deliberations. \\"I'm actually satisfied with the verdict. It was very hard, very difficult. Nothing means we would be personally biased toward the defendant. You have to look at all the facts and the evidence. That's why you have 24 counts guilty and 11 not guilty. Witness statements and the evidence were not there to prove those,\\" he said. \\"This was very difficult, but it was a really good experience. You feel like justice has been served. Prosecutors presented more than 20 witnesses over 12 days of testimony, including students who lived in Ravi and Clementi's dormitory, Davidson Hall, law enforcement officials, Rutgers residence life staff and computer experts. Clementi, a shy violinist from Ridgewood, and Ravi, a tech-savvy computer geek from Plainsboro, were seemingly ill-matched from the start. The two roommates were worried about living together from nearly the moment they learned each other's names, according to documents filed in court. When Clementi asked to use their room on Sept. 19, 2010, Ravi went to the room of a friend, Molly Wei, and turned on his webcam from her laptop. Witnesses for the state testified that Ravi built an ”automatic accept” feature on his webcam to access it from elsewhere. Wei and Ravi saw Clementi and M.B. kissing for a few seconds, and Ravi tweeted to his followers that he saw his \\"roommate making out with a dude.\\" Two days later, when Clementi asked for the room again, Ravi set up the webcam and double-checked that it was angled at Clementi's bed, according to two students who testified. He also dared his Twitter followers to chat him during the hours Clementi had asked for their room. One witness testified that Ravi was \\"uncomfortable\\" having a gay roommate. Another read a text message in which Ravi explained his computer would \\"keep the gays away.\\" But on cross-examination, about a half dozen friends and dorm neighbors of Ravi's told Steve Altman, his lawyer, that Ravi never said anything malicious or derogatory about his gay roommate or about gay people in general. After the prosecution rested last Thursday, the defense called seven witnesses in quick succession, all friends and co-workers of Ravi's father who said they had never heard him say anything negative about gay people, though they had never actually discussed the topic with him. Throughout the trial, Altman maintained that Ravi only looked at the webcam to see what was going on in his room because he was put off by M.B.'s scruffy appearance. Ravi told police in a statement that M.B. didn't acknowledge him, appeared much older than a college student, and he got a \\"bad vibe\\" from him. On the evidence charges, prosecutors said Ravi deleted dozens of relevant text messages and tweets, and tried to influence what Wei told police. Clementi, who leaped to his death from the George Washington Bridge, came after a series of suicides of other young teenagers around the country who were bullied because they were gay or perceived to be gay. The trial lasted nearly four weeks. Star-Ledger staff writers Jessica Calefati, Sue Epstein, Peggy McGlone and Ted Sherman contributed to this report.

Mr. Ravi, 20, wearing a dark suit over his slight frame, sat expressionless as the jury forewoman read the verdict on the first count, of invasion of privacy. But he seemed surprised when she pronounced him guilty on the next charge, of bias intimidation. His eyes popped and he quickly turned his head from the jury. As he left the courtroom in a swarm of television cameras, his mother clutching his arm, he looked straight ahead and said nothing. The jury also found him guilty of lying to investigators, trying to influence a witness and tampering with evidence after he tried to cover up Twitter and text messages inviting others to join in the viewing. Some of the charges carry penalties of 5 to 10 years in prison. Mr. Ravi has surrendered his passport; prosecutors said he could face possible deportation to his native India , but that decision would be left to immigration officials. Judge Glenn Berman set sentencing for May 21. The case was a rare one in which almost none of the facts were in dispute. Mr. Ravi’s lawyers agreed that he had set up a webcam on his computer, and had then gone into a friend’s room and viewed Mr. Clementi kissing a man he met a few weeks earlier on a Web site for gay men. He sent Twitter and text messages urging others to watch when Mr. Clementi invited the man again two nights later, then deleted messages after Mr. Clementi killed himself. That account had been established by a long trail of electronic evidence — from Twitter feeds and cellphone records, dormitory surveillance cameras, dining hall swipe cards and a “net flow” analysis showing when and how computers in the dormitory connected. What the jury had to decide, and what set off debate outside as well as inside the courtroom, was what Mr. Ravi and Mr. Clementi were thinking. Photo Had Mr. Ravi set up the webcam because he had a pretty good idea that he would see Mr. Clementi in an intimate moment? Had he targeted Mr. Clementi and the man he was with because they were gay? And had Mr. Clementi been in fear? Advertisement Continue reading the main story Without Mr. Clementi to speak for himself, that last question was perhaps the most difficult to determine, and jurors struggled with it. “That was the hardest because you really can’t get into someone’s head,” said one, Bruno Ferreira, as he left the court. The jury deliberated longest — for well more than an hour, he said — on the bias intimidation charge. Mr. Ferreira said he ultimately voted guilty on the bias intimidation charge because Mr. Ravi had sent multiple Twitter messages about Mr. Clementi. “They were being done twice, not just one day,” he said. Another juror, Kashad Leverett, himself a student and a Twitter user, said he could relate to Mr. Ravi’s constant stream of Twitter and text messages. But the defense’s insistence that Mr. Ravi had set up the webcam because he was afraid Mr. Clementi’s visitor would steal something, he said, rang hollow. “If I knew someone was going to steal something from me, I would definitely take it with me,” Mr. Leverett said, adding, “Just from the fact of the second incident, it seemed that it was intentional.” Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Reflecting the difficulty of defining hate crimes, it had taken the judge more than an hour simply to instruct the jury on the questions they had to answer to reach a verdict. The jury concluded that Mr. Ravi had not knowingly or purposely intimidated the men when he watched the first time, on Sept. 19, 2010. Advertisement Continue reading the main story But it found him guilty of the charge because Mr. Clementi “reasonably believed” he had been made a target because he was gay. Photo The prosecution had pointed out that Mr. Clementi had checked Mr. Ravi’s Twitter feed — where Mr. Ravi told others he had seen his roommate “kissing a dude” — 38 times in the days after the first webcam viewing. Records showed that Mr. Clementi had gone online to request a room change, and a resident assistant testified that Mr. Clementi had complained to him. Mr. Clementi’s parents, Joe and Jane, attended the trial each day, sitting in the front row and showing little emotion. After the verdict, Joe Clementi, the director of public works in the northern New Jersey town of Hawthorne, read a brief statement, saying the trial had been “painful for us, as it would be for any parent who must sit and listen to people talk about bad and inappropriate things that were done to their child.” Mostly, he said, he wanted to deliver a message to middle- and high-school students. “You’re going to meet a lot of people in your lifetime,” he said. “Some of these people you may not like. Just because you don’t like them doesn’t mean you have to work against them. When you see somebody doing something wrong, tell them: ‘That’s not right. Stop it.’ The change you want to see in the world begins with you.” Mr. Clementi’s suicide came up only in passing during the trial. Still, the death defined the trial, turning what might have been a peeping Tom case or, as the resident assistant said, “a roommate issue” into something far more grave. The testimony painted a picture of two college freshmen, both from top-performing high schools in well-off suburbs, who could not have been more different. Mr. Clementi was shy and awkward, an accomplished violinist who had only recently told his parents he was gay. Mr. Ravi was popular but boastful, a computer wizard and ultimate Frisbee player who communicated with friends constantly via Twitter, text message and iChat. Mr. Ravi’s parents, who brought him here from India when he was young, sat vigil behind him each day, with a large group of friends, including several who had served as character witnesses for Mr. Ravi, testifying he was not biased against gay people. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Ravi had rejected plea deals, because prosecutors would have required him to admit to bias intimidation. His lawyers said he simply did not believe he had committed a hate crime. They argued that he was “a kid” with little experience of homosexuality who had stumbled into a situation that scared him. His lead lawyer, Steven Altman, made only a brief statement via e-mail following the verdict, saying “rest assured” he would appeal. Gay rights advocates, who had used the example of Mr. Clementi’s suicide to push New Jersey to pass what is considered the nation’s toughest antibullying law, hailed the jury’s decision. “This verdict sends the important message that a ‘kids will be kids’ defense is no excuse to bully another student,” said Steven Goldstein, the chairman of Garden State Equality. Mr. Kaplan, the county prosecutor, rejected suggestions that Mr. Ravi would not have been on trial if Mr. Clementi had not killed himself. Even if he had not, he said, “under these facts, under this evidence, we would prosecute this case.” |||||","response":"Dharun Ravi, a former Rutgers University student, was found guilty of a hate crime, evidence tampering, and invasion of privacy for secretly using a webcam to spy on his roommate’s liaisons with another man in their dorm room.

The newly exposed geoglyphs, discovered last week by a pilot flying over the region, include a snake nearly 200 feet long as well as a bird and some llama-like creatures, reports the Independent. Other designs, known as the Nazca Lines, were first spotted in the desert region from the air in 1939, the Daily Mail notes, and archaeologists are now working to confirm that the new lines are genuine. The Nazca Lines—described by UNESCO as \\"a unique and magnificent artistic achievement that is unrivaled\\" elsewhere in the prehistoric world—are thought to have been etched into the desert by the Nazca people sometime before 500AD, and they include long lines and geometric shapes as well the shapes of animals and plants. Many scholars believe they were used for astronomic rituals, but one of Peru's top experts tells El Comercio that the new finds confirm the relationship between \\"the ancient people who occupied this arid desert with rain and worship of water.\\" (Another prehistoric find was made in Spain recently—the oldest human poop ever discovered.)","response":"Title: Mysterious Ancient Designs Unearthed in Peruvian Desert Subtitle: Aerial discovery reveals potential link between ancient Peruvians and the worship of water. Introduction Sandstorms in Peru have uncovered mysterious designs believed to be thousands of years old, sparking new investigations and theories amid the nation's archaeological community. Consisting of several previously obscured geoglyphs, these remarkable formations may provide clues about ancient Peruvian rituals and their relationship with the elements. The Discovery Last week, a pilot flying over the arid region in Peru observed the newly-exposed collection of ancient drawings for the first time. According to the Independent, the geoglyphs include a snake measuring nearly 200 feet in length, a bird, and several llama-like creatures. These newly revealed designs join the previously discovered mysterious drawings known as the Nazca Lines, which have fascinated researchers since their initial spotting from the air in 1939 by archaeologists, as reported by the Daily Mail. The Nazca Lines Described by UNESCO as \\"a unique and magnificent artistic achievement that is unrivaled\\" elsewhere in the prehistoric world, the Nazca Lines are a collection of ancient geoglyphs etched into the desert of southern Peru. Archaeologists believe that the Nazca people, who inhabited the region between 500 BC and 500 AD, created these extraordinary drawings, which encompass long lines, geometric shapes, and the shapes of animals and plants. Purpose and Significance Many scholars theorize that the Nazca Lines were used for astronomical rituals, reflecting the predominant beliefs at the time. However, one of Peru's leading experts now suggests that the newly discovered geoglyphs confirm the close connection between ancient people who lived in the region and their worship of water, while also highlighting the importance of rain in this arid landscape. In a recent interview with El Comercio, the expert explained that the new geoglyphs provide valuable insight into the relationship between \\"the ancient people who occupied this arid desert with rain and worship of water.\\" This interpretation could lend support to the notion that the Nazca inhabitants used the vast array of lines and shapes in their ceremonies to call for rain or to express their reverence for water. Archaeological Importance The confirmation of these new geoglyphs as genuine ancient creations will not only solidify their importance in the archaeological record, but will also enrich our understanding of the intricate and fascinating beliefs and practices held by the Nazca people. By broadening the Nazca Lines' complexity and diversity, these findings will likely inspire further research into these astonishing and enigmatic manifestations of early human creativity and spirituality. Conclusion The recent uncovering of mysterious ancient designs in the Peruvian desert contributes to the ongoing research surrounding the Nazca Lines and the people who created them. As archaeologists work to confirm their authenticity and discern their purpose, this blend of artistic expression and spiritual significance brings forward compelling insights into the lives of the Nazca people and their relationship with the elements that sustained their desert existence."},{"question":"Produce a brief English sentence that would be considered grammatically acceptable","response":"The cat is playing with a ball."},{"question":"Summarize this article: Nonetheless, the use of a chokehold in subduing a large but unarmed man during a low-level arrest raises for Mr. Bratton the same questions about police training and tactics that he faced 20 years ago, in his first stint as New York City’s police commissioner. In 1994, the year after the Police Department banned chokeholds, a man named Anthony Baez died in the Bronx after a police officer put him in a chokehold during a dispute over a touch football game. At City Hall on Friday, Mr. Bratton said he did not believe that the use of chokeholds by police officers in New York City was a widespread problem, saying this was his “first exposure” to the issue since returning as police commissioner in January. Mayor Bill de Blasio, standing next to Mr. Bratton, said, “Like so many New Yorkers I was very troubled by the video,” referring to a bystander’s recording of the incident, which was posted on the website of The New York Daily News. The two police officers who initially confronted Mr. Garner have been temporarily taken off patrol duty. The police declined to name the officers but said one of them had been on the force for eight years and the other for four years. Late Friday, the mayor’s office announced that Mr. de Blasio was postponing his family’s departure on a planned vacation to Italy from Friday evening until Saturday. The postponement was to allow Mr. de Blasio to spend more time making calls to elected officials, community leaders and members of the clergy, and talking to the police, about Mr. Garner’s death, the mayor’s press secretary, Phil Walzak, said. The encounter between Mr. Garner and plainclothes officers, from the 120th Precinct, began after the officers accused Mr. Garner of illegally selling cigarettes, an accusation he was familiar with. He had been arrested more than 30 times, often accused of selling loose cigarettes bought outside the state, a common hustle designed to avoid state and city tobacco taxes. In March and again in May, he was arrested on charges of illegally selling cigarettes on the sidewalk. For years, Mr. Garner chafed at the scrutiny by the police, which he considered harassment. In 2007, he filed a handwritten complaint in federal court accusing a police officer of conducting a cavity search of him on the street, “digging his fingers in my rectum in the middle of the street” while people passed by. ||||| Photo: New York Daily News An unarmed 43-year-old father of six from Staten Island died yesterday after at least five NYPD officers choked and smothered him during an arrest. Eric Garner, who suffered from chronic asthma, diabetes, and sleep apnea, was about six-foot-four, 400 pounds, the Daily News reports, and had a history of arrests for selling untaxed cigarettes. “I’m minding my business,” he says when confronted in the deeply disturbing video shot by a neighbor. “Are you serious? I didn’t do nothin’. What’d I do?” “Every time you see me, you’re messing with me. I’m tired of it. This stops today,” says Garner. “Every time you see me, you wanna harass me. I told you last time, please just leave me alone.” When the officers move to arrest him, Garner struggles until he’s choked from behind by a man not in uniform, who then pushes Garner’s head into the concrete. “I can’t breathe!” says Garner in a muffled scream. “I can’t breathe!” He repeats it over and over again, at least nine times audibly. Witnesses say the incident started when Garner tried to break up a fight.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less water is absorbed by the plant happens, how will it affect LESS sugar and oxygen being produced. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","response":"Step 1: Identify the main process involved - In this case, the main process is photosynthesis, which is the process through which plants produce sugar and oxygen by using carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight. Step 2: Analyze the perturbation hypothesis - The hypothesis states that if less water is absorbed by the plant, it will result in less sugar and oxygen being produced. Step 3: Understand the role of water in photosynthesis - Water is an essential component for photosynthesis to occur, as it provides the hydrogen atoms needed to form glucose (sugar) and oxygen molecules. It is also used to maintain turgidity in plant cells, which helps keep stomata open for the exchange of gases. Step 4: Analyze the effect of perturbation on the process - If less water is absorbed by the plant, this will lead to a deficiency in the amount of water available for photosynthesis. As a result, the production of glucose and oxygen molecules will be reduced. Step 5: Consider the direct and indirect effects of perturbation - The direct effect of the perturbation is the reduced availability of water for the photosynthesis process, which leads to less sugar and oxygen being produced. The indirect effects can include the closing of stomata due to reduced turgidity in plant cells, which will further decrease the rate of photosynthesis as less carbon dioxide enters the leaf and less oxygen is released. Step 6: Conclusion - The perturbation of less water being absorbed by the plant does have both direct and indirect effects on the process of photosynthesis, ultimately leading to less sugar and oxygen being produced. This can also negatively impact the plant's growth and overall health, as these are the essential components for its energy production and respiration."},{"question":"Teacher:In this task, you are given a sentence or phrase in English.

Your task is to summarize them. Problem:TAMPA -- When former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney takes the stage just after 10 pm Thursday night at the Republican National Convention here, he'll have lots of work to do in the 40 (or so) minutes allotted for his acceptance speech. Virtually everyone gathered here in Tampa -- and by that we mean virtually every person in the Republican political class and the political media -- has an opinion about what Romney should say and how he should say it. We talked to a number of GOP strategist types over the past 24 hours to get their impressions of what Romney should say tonight. Their takes, plus a few thoughts of our own, are below. * Mitt the Man: Romney tells his own personal story sparingly -- and not all that well. That has to change tonight for the speech to be deemed a success. While Romney will never reach the rhetorical heights in re-telling his life story of Bill Clinton or Barack Obama, he has to find a way to break through the idea that most people have of him as a buttoned up, entitled rich guy. He has a good example to follow in doing just that; his wife Ann's speech on Tuesday night was an effective re-casting of the Romney narrative from one centered on huge homes and car elevators to one centered on a turned-over sawhorse as a desk and tuna fish as a preferred meal. Even more important than what Romney says about himself, however, may be how he says it. Romney has to look more comfortable in his own skin than he has in past big speeches when talking about himself. * Religion as Romney's secret weapon?: As a corollary to that first point, we have long argued that Romney is far better off embracing his Mormonism than running from it. For a candidate who has spent the last five-plus years fighting the perception that he lacks any consistent core, Romney's dedication to his faith could fill that void. And yet, as we noted above, he's never been comfortable talking about any aspect of his personal life with his religion at the top of that list. The question for Romney tonight is whether he can borrow a bit of the language -- in sentiment if not in the actual words -- of Paul Ryan's speech on Wednesday in which the Wisconsin Republican noted that while the two men don't share the same church, they share the same values. If Romney doesn't talk about his faith in some somewhat extended way, count us as believing he made a mistake. * Ignore the room: The biggest mistake a nominee can make in his acceptance speech is to target the few thousand people in the convention hall. Those people are already in Romney's camp; they are the most active of party activists. What Romney needs to do is remember that the real audience for his speech are the millions of people watching it on their TV sets. And for many of those people, it may be their first extended glimpse of Romney ever. That means Romney should largely steer away from throwing red meat to the conservative crowd -- the audience will be amped up for Romney almost no matter what he says -- and instead focusing on telling his story and laying out his vision for moving the country forward. * The vision \\"thing\\": Speaking of laying out a vision, Romney needs to do it. Not a series of policy proposals -- although he probably should do a bit of that too -- but rather a big vision of where he would take the country. To date, Romney has largely run on two conceits: 1. I am not Barack Obama 2. I can bring business principles to governance. To which many voters seem to say \\"Yes, but....\\". There's a reason that although the economy continues to be an anchor around the feet of President Obama, Romney isn't soaring. And it's because people want more from Romney. Remember that voters tend to want to cast a vote FOR something/someone rather than just against someone/something. Tonight is Romney's chance to give people a big -- and positive -- vision to vote for. * Serious man for serious times: Romney will never match President Obama in the charisma department. But, that's not necessarily a bad thing. \\"Romney just needs to be who he is – an executive who makes decisions and gets results,\\" said Republican consultant Curt Anderson. \\"We’ve had four years of Mr. Personality and it hasn’t helped our economy. That’s what Romney needs to convey tonight, and I bet he will.\\" Romney has to be careful not to be too workmanlike in his address (see \\"the vision thing\\" above) but the more he can project himself as a guy who may not bowl you over as a speaker but who has the resume to make the economy better in office, the better he will do. ||||| Romney's speech will be one of his last chances to sketch a portrait of who he is. | M.Scott Mahaskey/POLITICO Mitt's make-or-break night TAMPA, Fla. — Mitt Romney is about to face the most important political moment of his life. The speech Romney delivers at the Republican National Convention’s final night in Tampa will be one of his last opportunities to sketch a portrait of who he is and what he stands for to a country whose battleground states have seen him relentlessly portrayed by the Obama campaign as a heartless corporate raider — a perception that has dented his approval ratings and made it difficult for the GOP to change the campaign narrative. Story Continued Below In a precious hour before a national television audience, Romney has the opportunity to connect with voters in the convention hall but also well beyond. There is a deeper, softer, and much kinder side to Romney, those who know him insist, but he provides only those closest to him with a view of it. He has run the least biographically anchored campaign of any presidential nominee in recent history, declining to present his own fleshed-out accounts of his time at Bain Capital, his time as a bishop in the Mormon church, or his term as Massachusetts governor. ( Also on POLITICO: All the GOP convention speeches) That case has been made for him over the first three days of the convention through speeches and videos — and most dramatically through a Tuesday night prime-time appeal from his wife, Ann, — that his experience as an executive, church leader, Olympics chief and dad have created a three-dimensional, attractive candidate, not the caricature Republicans feel the Obama campaign team has created. The aim has been to “make the argument that all these things have prepared him to make him uniquely qualified to handle all the things” the country is facing, said Romney adviser Russ Schriefer, who has masterminded the convention programming. “There’s lots of different ways that he can tell that story.” But few will be as important as the speech he delivers himself. ( Also on POLITICO: Text and video of Ann Romney’s speech) He needs to make his case for the presidency, but he also needs to let the shrinking pool of undecided voters who are watching see who he is and what kind of president he would be. He needs elements of George H.W. Bush’s “thousand points of light,” George W. Bush’s, “They have not led. We will,” and John McCain’s straight talk to describe his own career. But he needs to show his humanity. Romney’s speeches are usually drafted by committee, then he tears into them, or he writes portions himself. The words he says tonight will be authentically his, for better or worse. ( PHOTOS: Scenes from the RNC) With that in mind, here are five ways Romney can use his speech to maximum effect: 1. Go bold. The Romney campaign has used that word frequently to describe the choice of Paul Ryan on the ticket. But while choosing the controversial Wisconsin congressman was politically risky, Romney has largely reverted back to his no-details posture, the one he’s had for much of the campaign. The convention speech is not the place for policy planks. But it is the place for Romney to show he can be bigger. “Republicans have a tendency to ask voters to choose our medicine because it tastes the worst, not because it works the best,” said Republican strategist Alex Castellanos, who worked on Romney’s 2008 presidential campaign. “We need to explain that if you vote for Romney-Ryan, you are not voting for less, you are voting for more,” he added. “More growth, more jobs, more prosperity, bigger paychecks, and more government revenue to save Medicare and Social Security, too. We need to put the Democrats on the defensive on austerity. We need to explain that Obama is the one asking you to settle for less.” To make that case, Romney should pitch his own plans, in as much of a positive frame as possible. He needs to explain why picking Ryan wasn’t about getting editorial board headlines with the word “bold,” but that he shares Ryan’s principles, that he believes the nation is headed down the wrong path and that he wants to do what is politically risky but philosophically right. That kind of language hasn’t been Romney’s strong suit before. But he needs to present voters with the path forward. ||||| Solution:","response":"In his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention, former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney has the opportunity to connect with voters and present a clearer portrait of who he is. Advisers suggest he should focus on discussing his personal story and embracing his faith to break the perception of him as a buttoned-up, entitled rich guy. Romney should also ignore the room and directly address the millions of people watching on their TV sets, offering a big vision of where he would take the country, and presenting himself as a serious man for serious times."},{"question":"In this task, you are given two phrases: Head and Tail, separated with <sep>.

Article: \\"Last week,\\" Dr. P said \\"I was invited to a doctors' meeting at the R. Hospital. In one of the rooms a patient, an old man, got up from his bed and moved slowly towards me. I could see that he hadn't long to live, but he came up to me and placed his right foot close to mine on the floor.\\" \\"Frank!\\" I cried with surprise. He couldn't answer as I knew, but he tried to smile, all the time keeping his foot close to mine. My thoughts raced back more than thirty years--to the dark days of 1941, when I was a student in London. The scene was an air-raid shelter , in which I and about a hundred other people slept every night. Among them were Mrs. West and her son Frank, who lived nearby. Sharing wartime problems, we got to know each other very well. Frank interested me because he was not normal . He had never been normal, ever since he was born. His mother told me he was 37 then, but he had less of a mind than a baby has. Mrs. West, then about 75, was a strong, able woman, as she had to be of course, because Frank depended on her completely. He needed all the attention of a baby. One night a policeman came into our shelter and told Mrs. West that her house had been all destroyed. That wasn't quite true, because the West went on living there for quite some time. But they certainly lost nearly everything they owned. When that kind of thing happened, the rest of us helped the unlucky ones. So before we separated that morning, I stood beside Frank and measured my right foot against his. They were about the same size. That night, then, I took a spare pair of shoes to the shelter for Frank. As soon as he saw me, he came running--and placed his right foot against mine. After that, he always greeted me in the same way. Question: Why did Dr P say that Mrs West had to be a strong, able woman? Options: A: She was over 75. B: She needed all the attention of a baby.

Teacher: Let's think:","response":"As an AI language model, let me help you analyze the premise and hypothesis in this situation to help you understand if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. Premise: \\"Two girls are staring at something beyond the camera.\\" This statement tells us that there are two girls and that their gaze is focused on something that is not visible in the camera frame. Hypothesis: \\"Two girls face each other and play pat-a-cake.\\" This statement assumes that the two girls are facing one another while playing a popular hand game called pat-a-cake. Now, let's think about whether the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. To entail means that the truth of the statement (premise) guarantees the truth of another statement (hypothesis). In this case, knowing that two girls are staring at something beyond the camera does not necessarily guarantee that they are facing each other and playing pat-a-cake. They could be looking at various things or participating in different activities altogether. To summarize, the given premise does not entail the hypothesis, as the information provided in the premise is not sufficient to guarantee that the proposed scenario in the hypothesis is true."},{"question":"Question: Who plays the husband Nick?

The cathedral—dedicated to the Holy Trinity—was established in 1224 on land granted by King Alexander II outside the burgh of Elgin and close to the River Lossie. It replaced the cathedral at Spynie, 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) to the north, that was served by a small chapter of eight clerics. The new and bigger cathedral was staffed with 18 canons in 1226 and then increased to 23 by 1242. After a damaging fire in 1270, a rebuilding programme greatly enlarged the building. It was unaffected by the Wars of Scottish Independence but again suffered extensive fire damage in 1390 following an attack by Robert III's brother Alexander Stewart, Earl of Buchan, also known as the Wolf of Badenoch. In 1402 the cathedral precinct again suffered an incendiary attack by the followers of the Lord of the Isles. The number of clerics required to staff the cathedral continued to grow, as did the number of craftsmen needed to maintain the buildings and surrounds. The cathedral went through periods of enlargement and renovation following the fires of 1270 and 1390 that included the doubling in length of the choir, the provision of outer aisles to the northern and southern walls of both the nave and choir. Today, these walls are at full height in places and at foundation level in others yet the overall cruciform shape is still discernible. A mostly intact octagonal chapter house dates from the major enlargement after the fire of 1270. The gable wall above the double door entrance that links the west towers is nearly complete and was rebuilt following the fire of 1390. It accommodates a large window opening that now only contains stub tracery work and fragments of a large rose window. Recessed and chest tombs in both transepts and in the south aisle of the choir contain effigies of bishops and knights, and large flat slabs in the now grass-covered floor of the cathedral mark the positions of early graves. The homes of the dignitaries and canons, or manses, stood in... answer the following question: What were the two staff positions at the Elgin Cathedral that continued to grow? Answer:","response":"The two staff positions at the Elgin Cathedral that continued to grow were the number of clerics and the number of craftsmen."},{"question":"Sometimes there are those days when everything just seems to drop into place. Those who need a goal are confident and clinical, those paid to keep them out are focused and alert; and Aston Villa are in town. Theo Walcott invited ninth-month-old son Finley along to his first game and was able to mark the occasion with his first goal in the Barclays Premier League for more than a year. 'In the second half, I can't think of a more one-sided game,' said Walcott, swept up in the euphoria of a fifth successive win, and the joy of being fit. Olivier Giroud chips the ball over the on-rushing Brad Guzan to score the opening goal of the game for Arsenal. Mesut Ozil fires in the Gunners' second goal after a well-timed through ball from Giroud. Theo Walcott bends in Arsenal's third goal of the afternoon after being set up by Santi Cazorla. Santi Cazorla scores Arsenal's fourth goal from the penalty spot, Guzan got a hand to it but couldn't keep it out. Hector Bellerin guides the ball into the back of the net from distance for Arsenal's fifth and final goal. Arsenal (4-2-3-1): Ospina 7; Bellerin 7.5, Mertesacker 7, Koscielny 7, Monreal 7; Coquelin 7.5, Ramsey 7 (Flamini 77, 6.5), Walcott 7 (Rosicky 70, 6.5), Cazorla 9, Ozil 8.5; Giroud (Akpom 70, 7). Subs not used: Szczesny, Gibbs, Gabriel, Chambers. Scorers: Giroud, Ozil, Walcott, Cazorla, Bellerin. Aston Villa (4-3-3): Guzan 6.5; Hutton 5.5, Clark 5.5, Okore 5.5, Richardson 6; Sanchez 4 (Westwood 76, 5), Delph 6, Cleverley 5 (Agbonlahor 66, 5); Gil 6, Weimann 5.5 (Sinclair 66, 5), Benteke 6.

CLICK HERE to see Sportsmail's Match Zone feature for goals, stats, heat maps and more. Mesut Ozil also scored his first in the Premier League since a long injury absence. It was his first since he last played Villa, and Ozil weighed in on the baby theme with a thumb-sucking celebration dedicated to his niece. Teenager Hector Bellerin found the net, too, with his first for the club, while Olivier Giroud grabbed the opener and Santi Cazorla struck from the penalty spot, a goal which his fabulous performance deserved. There might have been more. Twice Arsenal rattled the goal frame and Ozil saw one ruled out for offside, all of which must have been very painful for Villa to witness. Paul Lambert's team have not scored in more than 10 hours, and the fact they dominated possession and missed very good chances at key moments is of little consolation. 'We scored goals and we didn't concede,' said Wenger. 'Our offensive game was good even though we had weaker periods when Aston Villa were in possession. We always looked dangerous when we got through their lines. And we were defensively sound. Overall, it was a positive day for us. 'I feel a bit for Villa. They were caught in last 20 minutes because they were tired. The second goal was a blow for them. But overall they did fight.' Arsenal have won three on the bounce in the Premier League for the first time this season, building on the victory at Manchester City. Walcott, Ozil, Aaron Ramsey and Laurent Koscielny are back after injuries, but Wenger's decisions to bring in goalkeeper David Ospina and Francis Coquelin, who has added bite in midfield, have provided stability in the team, together with what seems a tactical tweak to concede a little more possession and operate on the break. The French striker's team-mates rush over to congratulate him after his delicate finish early in the first half. Ozil put in arguably his best performance of the season as Arsenal beat Aston Villa on Sunday afternoon. Walcott celebrates scoring his first Premier League goal of the season against Aston Villa in London. Cazorla is congratulated by Chuba Akpom, who won the penalty from which the Spaniard scored. Bellerin, set up by compatriot Cazorla, celebrates scoring the final goal of the afternoon. There was no Alexis Sanchez, who was resting a tight hamstring, but, with such an array of creative talent, Arsenal will always score goals. More importantly, these three wins have been achieved without conceding once. 'We have found better consistency,' said Wenger. 'That will be important until the end. Let's show we can win more. Confidence is higher but defensive stability vital. When you don't have that you suffer. 'It's too early to say we are in the title race. We are 11 points behind. They need to lose four and we need to win four. Let's try to be consistent and see what happens.' When Ozil's ambitious heel-flick cleared Jores Okore and fell perfectly for Giroud, there was a hint it might be one of those days. Once he cleared it from under his feet, Giroud, clipped a neat finish over the dive of Brad Guzan. Cazorla thumped a low curler into a post, Ozil was denied by a flag and Guzan saved from Ramsey. Villa steadied but were cautious. Even on the turnover of possession, they appeared reluctant to commit anyone in support of the ball-carrier, often leaving it to the front three, who were overwhelmed. Even so, three minutes before half-time, the visitors should have been level and would have been were it not for a fabulous save from Ospina. Villa's players look dejected after a torrid afternoon in north London that saw them concede five goals. Giroud celebrates after scoring his eighth goal of the season for the Gunners after just eight minutes of the first half. Andreas Weimann beat Bellerin in the air to meet a cross at close range but Ospina sprang to his left to keep it out. He made another fine save in stoppage time to deny Ashley Westwood, but Weimann’s header was the big chance. Score and it might change the rhythm of the game, panic Arsenal, but it was saved and within seconds Kieran Richardson was lunging into a last-ditch tackle to avert another dangerous breakaway from Walcott. Christian Benteke missed the target as Villa came out for the second half with more adventure, which only made it easier for Arsenal to rip them apart on the counter-attack. Since his players were wasteful in possession, it is easy to understand why Lambert operates with caution. Giroud supplied Ozil for the second, who took it on at pace and applied a precision finish, and Walcott made it three, cutting in from the left, trading passes with Cazorla and swerving his shot inside the post. Giroud headed against the bar before he was replaced by Chuba Akpom, who soon won a penalty, tumbling over Guzan after beating the keeper to a though ball. Guzan read Cazorla’s plan to smash it down the centre and stood firm but was only able to deflect the powerful strike into the net with his left-hand. Bellerin slid in the fifth, a beautifully accurate side-footed finish from the edge of the penalty box. It was one of those days. Aston Villa: therapy for the goalless. If only they could play against themselves. Arsenal substitute Akpom is taken out by goalkeeper Guzan for the penalty in the second half. World Cup-winner Ozil, who assisted the first goal and scored the second, had a goal disallowed for offside in the first half. American goalkeeper Guzan kicks the post in frustration after failing to save Cazorla's penalty. Arsenal captain Per Mertesacker clears the ball under pressure from Villa's Belgian striker Christian Benteke. Benteke, who scored twice in this fixture last season, controls the ball while Laurent Koscielny flies past.

Hailing from Papunya, Northern Territory, Australia, the band's sound was a unique fusion of country rock, blues rock, and Aboriginal rock. The group was composed of past members George Burarrwanga, Gordon Butcher, Sammy Butcher, and Neil Murray. The band's original lineup came together in the remote Aboriginal community of Papunya, where the members bonded over their shared love for music. Their name, Warumpi, comes from a local honey ant species that lives in a sacred dreaming site nearby. Warumpi Band were pioneers in incorporating indigenous themes and languages into their music, making them a vital force in the Australian rock scene. They achieved mainstream success and critical acclaim, thanks to their powerful sound and politically charged lyrics. Throughout their 20-year career, they released several albums under various record labels such as Hot, Powderworks/RCA, Festival/Parole, and CAAMA/Shock. One of Warumpi Band's most notable associated acts was Midnight Oil, another legendary Australian rock band.

However, the capital Sanaa and central Yemen are understood to be quiet. Before the truce was due to begin, clashes were reported at a major air base north of Aden after government allies took the nearby town of Sabr. The Saudi-led coalition said it would halt air raids at midnight (20:59 GMT) to let much-needed humanitarian aid in. But a Houthi spokesman said the rebels would not adopt a position on the move until they were officially informed. Earlier reports suggested that the Houthi leader, Abdel-Malek al-Houthi, had pledged to continue the fight. A correspondent with AFP news agency also reported sporadic gunfire in the northern outskirts of Aden barely an hour after the unilateral truce came into force. Rebels there are trying to halt the advance of loyalist forces who have retaken the port city. On Saturday, the coalition said it would suspend bombardment for five days but that it reserved the right to respond to \\"military activity or movement\\" by Houthi rebels. The unexpected ceasefire was announced after Yemen's President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi wrote to Saudi's King Salman asking for a break, to allow humanitarian supplies to be delivered. It came after strikes in Taiz province, which reportedly killed 120 people, including civilians. Aid agencies say a blockade on Yemen has worsened the humanitarian crisis which is gripping the country. More than 80% of Yemen's 25 million people now need some form of aid. The Saudi-led coalition has been bombing Houthi militia and forces loyal to former president Ali Abdullah Saleh since 26 March. The UN has warned the coalition that indiscriminate bombing of populated areas is against international law. A week-long truce brokered by the UN failed earlier this month. At least 1,693 civilians have been killed in fighting in Yemen, with almost 4,000 people wounded. The UN said the majority of casualties were caused by air strikes. Houthis - The Zaidi Shia Muslim rebels from the north overran Sanaa last year and then expanded their control. They want to replace Mr Hadi, whose government they say is corrupt. The US alleges Iran is providing military assistance to the rebels. Ali Abdullah Saleh - Military units loyal to the former president - forced to hand over power in 2011 after mass protests - are fighting alongside the Houthis. Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi - The president fled abroad in March as the rebels advanced on Aden, where he had taken refuge in February. Loyal soldiers, Sunni Muslim tribesmen and Southern separatists have formed militia to fight the rebels. Saudi-led coalition - A US-backed coalition of nine, mostly Sunni Arab states says it is seeking to \\"defend the legitimate government\\" of Mr Hadi.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more trucks take coal to the power station happens, how will it affect LESS coal arriving at the power station. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","response":"To examine the perturbation hypothesis and its effect on the coal mining process, let's break the scenario down step-by-step: 1. A mine is excavated in the side of a mountain. Increasing the number of trucks taking coal to the power station would not have an effect on this stage of the process. 2. Miners enter the mine. Similarly, increasing the number of trucks does not affect the entry of miners into the mine. 3. Miners remove the coal from the mine. At this stage, increasing the number of trucks could potentially affect the amount of coal removed from the mine indirectly if the mine is not able to meet the increased demand. However, it is more likely that the mining operation is producing coal at a consistent rate, and the increased number of trucks at power stations will not have an impact on the amount of coal removed. 4. The coal is placed into carts or on a conveyor belt. Like step 3, increasing the number of trucks would not have an effect on this stage of the process, as the loading of coal into carts or conveyor belts is isolated from the transportation of coal to the power station. 5. The coal is moved up to the surface. The process of moving coal up to the surface is separate from the number of trucks transporting the coal to the power station and should not be affected by the perturbation hypothesis. 6. The coal is loaded onto a truck. If more trucks are taking coal to the power station, it will require faster loading of trucks at the mine site. This could affect the flow of coal from the mining operation to the power station if there is a bottleneck in the capacity to load trucks. In this case, less coal could potentially arrive at the power station due to delays. 7. The truck takes the coal to a power station. More trucks going to the power station might result in congestion or capacity issues at the power station itself. In this instance, less coal could reach and be unloaded at the power station, due to a higher volume of trucks causing delays in unloading, thus indirectly affecting the coal supply. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis of more trucks taking coal to the power station could indirectly cause less coal to arrive. However, it would not affect the initial mining steps— excavating, entering the mine, removing coal, or moving the coal to the surface. The effects might only be seen in truck loading and unloading stages, as well as due to possible capacity and congestion issues at the power station."},{"question":"WASHINGTON -- A string of government reports yesterday offered a mixed picture of the US economy.

Movie title: Perfume: The Story of a Murderer Context: The film begins with the sentencing of Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (Ben Whishaw), a notorious murderer. Between the reading of the sentence and the execution, the story of his life is told in flashback, beginning with his abandonment at birth in a French fish market. Raised in an orphanage, Grenouille grows into a strangely detached boy with a superhuman sense of smell. After growing to maturity as a tanner's apprentice, he makes his first delivery to Paris, where he revels in the new odors. He focuses on the scent of a kindly girl selling plums (Karoline Herfurth) and startles her with his behavior. To prevent her from crying out, he covers the girl's mouth and unintentionally suffocates her. After realizing that she is dead, he strips her body naked and smells her until the scent fades.Afterwards, Grenouille becomes haunted by the desire to preserve the woman's scent forever. After making a delivery to a perfume shop, Grenouille amazes the Italian owner, Giuseppe Baldini (Dustin Hoffman), with his ability to create fragrances. He revitalizes the perfumer's career with new formulas, demanding only that Baldini teach him how to convert scents into perfume. Baldini explains that all perfumes are harmonies of twelve individual scents, and may contain a theoretical thirteenth scent. He also tells a story about a perfume discovered in an Egyptian tomb that was so perfect that it caused everyone in the entire world to briefly believe they were in paradise the moment the bottle was opened.When Grenouille discovers that Baldini's method of distillation will not capture the scents of all objects, such as iron chains and dead animals, he becomes depressed. After receiving a letter of presentation written by Baldini, Grenouille leaves to learn a different method in Grasse. En route to Grasse, Grenouille realises that he has no scent of his own, and is therefore a cipher. He decides that creating the perfect smell will prove his worth.Upon arrival in Grasse, Grenouille catches the scent of the naive Laura Richis (Rachel...

Additionally, the speaker emphasizes that there are also myriad problems that exist closer to home. In the context of the statement, \\"our own back door\\" likely refers to the speaker's own community, state, or nation. Therefore, the hypothesis: \\"We have enough of our own problems to deal with\\" can be considered true within the scope of the speaker's perspective. To fully understand the validity of the hypothesis, it is important to consider the various issues that are being faced globally, including conflicts, economic distress, and political tensions. In the case of the Middle East, the ongoing conflicts in the area, such as Israel-Palestine disputes and civil wars in neighboring Arab nations, emphasize the complexity and severity of the situation. The speaker seems to suggest that, while these problems are indeed pressing, there are also issues of comparable importance that directly impact their own community. Further support for the hypothesis can be found in the fact that every society tends to face a myriad of challenges. These can range from inadequate infrastructure and public services to socio-economic inequality and environmental concerns. Communities and nations need to allocate resources and attention to address these issues, and the emphasis on 'having enough problems to deal with' denotes the necessity for focusing on local issues before considering problems on a much larger and distant scale. In conclusion, based on the speaker's premise, the hypothesis \\"We have enough of our own problems to deal with\\" is generally considered true. This statement serves as a reminder that individuals and communities must recognize and prioritize the local issues they face. By addressing these immediate problems, societies can begin to establish a stronger foundation upon which they can tackle larger, more complex problems, such as those present in the Middle East or in other global contexts. However, it's essential to draft a balance between taking care of internal issues and addressing global issues as well since the latter may have direct or indirect consequences on the former."},{"question":"Is this product review positive?

Artistically, Moore, Hepworth and other members of The Seven and Five Society would develop steadily more abstract work, partly influenced by their frequent trips to Paris and their contact with leading progressive artists, notably Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, Jean Arp and Alberto Giacometti. Moore flirted with Surrealism, joining Paul Nash's modern art movement \\"Unit One\\", in 1933. In 1934, Moore visited Spain; he visited the cave of Altamira (which he described as the \\"Royal Academy of Cave Painting\\"), Madrid, Toledo and Pamplona.Moore and Nash were on the organising committee of the International Surrealist Exhibition, which took place in London in 1936. In 1937, Roland Penrose purchased an abstract 'Mother and Child' in stone from Moore that he displayed in the front garden of his house in Hampstead. The work proved controversial with other residents and the local press ran a campaign against the piece over the next two years. At this time Moore gradually transitioned from direct carving to casting in bronze, modelling preliminary maquettes in clay or plaster rather than making preparatory drawings. In 1938, Moore met Kenneth Clark for the first time. From this time, Clark became an unlikely but influential champion of Moore's work, and through his position as member of the Arts Council of Great Britain he secured exhibitions and commissions for the artist., what would be the answer ?

At this point Alvarado's force consisted of 250 Spanish infantry accompanied by 6,000 indigenous allies, mostly Kaqchikel and Cholutec. Alvarado and his army defeated and occupied the most important Xinca city, named as Atiquipaque, usually considered to be in the Taxisco area. The defending warriors were described by Alvarado as engaging in fierce hand-to-hand combat using spears, stakes and poisoned arrows. The battle took place on 26 May 1524 and resulted in a significant reduction of the Xinca population. Alvarado's army continued eastwards from Atiquipaque, seizing several more Xinca cities. Tacuilula feigned a peaceful reception only to unsuccessfully raise arms against the conquistadors within an hour of their arrival. Taxisco and Nancintla fell soon afterwards. Because Alvarado and his allies could not understand the Xinca language, Alvarado took extra precautions on the march eastward by strengthening his vanguard and rearguard with ten cavalry apiece. In spite of these precautions the baggage train was ambushed by a Xinca army soon after leaving Taxisco. Many indigenous allies were killed and most of the baggage was lost, including all the crossbows and ironwork for the horses. This was a serious setback and Alvarado camped his army in Nancintla for eight days, during which time he sent two expeditions against the attacking army. Jorge de Alvarado led the first attempt with thirty to forty cavalry and although they routed the enemy they were unable to retrieve any of the lost baggage, much of which had been destroyed by the Xinca for use as trophies. Pedro de Portocarrero led the second attempt with a large infantry detachment but was unable to engage with the enemy due to the difficult mountain terrain, so returned to Nancintla. Alvarado sent out Xinca messengers to make contact with the...

Scientific discourse has drifted to other meanings and there is no consensus on a definition. Emotion is often intertwined with mood, temperament, personality, disposition, and motivation. In some theories, cognition is an important aspect of emotion. Those acting primarily on the emotions they are feeling may seem as if they are not thinking, but mental processes are still essential, particularly in the interpretation of events. For example, the realization of our believing that we are in a dangerous situation and the subsequent arousal of our body's nervous system (rapid heartbeat and breathing, sweating, muscle tension) is integral to the experience of our feeling afraid. Other theories, however, claim that emotion is separate from and can precede cognition. - Guadalajara is the capital and largest city of the Mexican state of Jalisco, and the seat of the municipality of Guadalajara.

Somewhat of a specialist regarding American terrorism and due to teach a class on terrorism at the university, Michael starts to become suspicious of his new suburban neighbors, Oliver (Tim Robbins) and Cheryl Lang (Joan Cusack), whom he's just met after taking their son, Brady (Mason Gamble), to the emergency room following a reported fireworks accident.At first his suspicions are based on little things such as Oliver's architectural blueprints that seem to be for something other than the shopping mall he claims he's building, as well as pieces of mail that contradict where Oliver said he attended college. Neither his girlfriend and former student, Brooke Wolfe (Hope Davis), nor his wife's former FBI partner, Whit Carver (Robert Gossett), believe any of his wild theories.After doing some digging, Michael discovers that Oliver's real name is William Fenimore, and that he built a pipe bomb and used it to try to blow up a postal office in Kansas when he was 16. William/Oliver confronts Michael over his looking into William's past. He reveals that 'Oliver Lang' is the name of his friend, who died in a hunting accident. William's family had owned a farm but it went broke because the government 'appropriated' the river that ran through it 'for other uses'. As a result the crops died and they could not raise any animals. William's dad then killed himself and made it look like a tractor accident so the family could claim the life insurance.

Drink water throughout the day. Eat a snack or a light meal. Take it easy the rest of the day. Article:","response":"Title: The Perfect Post-Sauna Routine for Optimal Relaxation and Rejuvenation Introduction Saunas have long been known for their numerous health benefits, providing a soothing, stress-relieving environment where the gentle heat relaxes muscles, eliminates toxins, and rejuvenates both body and mind. However, just as important as the sauna experience itself is giving proper attention to your post-sauna routine. Engaging in the right activities and nourishing your body appropriately after a sauna session can significantly enhance its therapeutic effects and ensure you get the most out of this time-honored ritual. Step 1: Air Dry Your Skin Upon leaving the sauna, make sure to let your skin air dry instead of using a towel. This not only feels refreshing and cool but also allows your body to continue expelling toxins through the process of natural perspiration. While you're cooling down, take this opportunity to practice deep breathing exercises, which help release tension and promote an overall sense of calm. Allow your body to gradually adjust to the change in temperature, and try to avoid abrupt exposure to cold air or an icy shower right after your sauna session. This sudden change can constrict blood vessels, hinder circulation, and negate the benefits of your time in the heat. Step 2: Hydrate Throughout the Day Staying well-hydrated is absolutely essential for reaping the maximum benefits of your sauna experience. The high heat and humidity of a sauna can quickly lead to dehydration if you're not careful. To avoid any negative effects this might cause, make sure to drink plenty of water before, during, and after your sauna session. Keep a water bottle by your side and continuously replenish your body's fluids, making it a point to sip water at regular intervals throughout the entire day. This will not only prevent dehydration but also help flush out toxins and impurities that have been released during your time in the sauna. Step 3: Nourish Your Body with a Snack or Light Meal A sauna session can be quite draining on the body, particularly if it's an intense one. As such, it's crucial to refuel your body with nutritious food that will provide it with the energy and nutrients it needs to recover properly. Opt for a snack or light meal that is rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, as well as proteins necessary for muscle repair. Some excellent post-sauna food choices include fresh fruits, leafy greens, nuts, whole grains, yogurt, and lean protein sources like chicken or fish. Consuming these foods will help your body replenish its depleted resources, enabling you to regain strength and vitality more rapidly. Step 4: Take It Easy for the Rest of the Day One of the primary objectives of using a sauna is to relax and rejuvenate, so it's important to let your body continue this process throughout the rest of the day. This means avoiding rigorous physical activities or engaging in anything that might induce stress. Instead, engage in gentle, low-impact exercise like stretching or yoga, or indulge in a leisurely walk in nature. Take this time to engage in activities that promote relaxation and mindfulness, such as meditation, reading, or a calming hobby. Conclusion Incorporating these steps into your post-sauna routine is essential to ensure that your body effectively reaps the full range of health benefits offered by the sauna experience. By adequately nourishing and hydrating your body, as well as observing a stress-free remainder of the day, you will be able to maximize the potential of your sauna session, leaving you feeling profoundly relaxed, rejuvenated, and refreshed."},{"question":"You are given a sentence in Portuguese.

However, in Iran, which frequently practices capital punishment, one particular case has raised concerns and sparked debate surrounding the efficacy and morality of the death penalty. The botched execution of Alireza Alireza, a 37-year-old drug smuggler, was sentenced to death after being found in possession of a kilogram of methamphetamine. Earlier this month, Iranian officials hanged him for 12 minutes, cut him down, and pronounced him dead. His body was then sent off to be buried. However, the following day, morgue workers noticed steam in the plastic wrap used to cover his body and discovered that he was still alive. The state found itself in the unforeseen predicament of resuscitating and hospitalizing the man they had failed to properly execute. Family and human rights organizations' reactions \\"We couldn't believe he was still alive when we went to collect his body,\\" a relative says, adding that \\"his two daughters are very happy.\\" Amnesty International, however, is appalled at the prospect of re-executing Alireza, asserting that \\"carrying it out twice\\" is \\"simply ghastly\\" and \\"betrays a basic lack of humanity.\\" The organization also points out that the death penalty is not making headway in the fight against drug trafficking. Iran's stance on capital punishment Iran is known for its frequent employment of capital punishment, having executed (successfully) 508 people so far this year, a figure that has not diminished since President Hasan Rouhani's election. Out of those executions, 125 occurred after he took office in August. Most executions are for drug-related offenses. Now, Iranian judges are pushing for the re-execution of Alireza once he has fully recovered, stating that they had sentenced him to death, not hanging, so his original sentence has yet to be carried out. Conclusion The disturbing case of Alireza highlights the flaws and controversies of capital punishment in Iran. As human rights organizations such as Amnesty International condemn the practice and fight for its abolition, the Iranian government must grapple with the morality and pragmatism of its actions. In the midst of the ongoing debate over capital punishment, it is critical that questions about humanity, justice, and effectiveness are not lost."},{"question":"Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: The Harbourside Development is one of the world's most exciting places to shop.

Jake always tills his land, while Todd uses he no-tillage method. Which farmer used fewer chemicals for pest control? Hint: The benefits provided by no-tillage to predators may lead to larger predator populations, which is a good way to control pests (biological control), but also can facilitate predation of the crop itself. In corn crops, for instance, predation by caterpillars can be higher in no-till than in conventional tillage fields.In places with rigorous winter, untilled soil can take longer to warm and dry in spring, which may delay planting to less ideal dates. Another factor to be considered is that organic residue from the prior year's crops lying on the surface of untilled fields can provide a favorable environment to pathogens, helping to increase the risk of transmitting diseases to the future crop. And because no-till farming provides good environment for pathogens, insects and weeds, it can lead farmers to a more intensive use of chemicals for pest control. Other disadvantages of no-till include underground rot, low soil temperatures and high moisture.Based on the balance of these factors, and because each farm has different problems, agroecologists will not attest that only no-till or complete tillage is the right way of farming. Yet, these are not the only possible choices regarding soil preparation, since there are intermediate practices such as strip-till, mulch-till and ridge-till, all of them – just as no-till – categorized as conservation tillage. Agroecologists, then, will evaluate the need of different practices for the contexts in which each farm is inserted. A:","response":"Based on the given information, it can be concluded that Todd, who uses the no-tillage method, is likely to use more chemicals for pest control as compared to Jake who practices conventional tillage. Here are the key points that support this conclusion: 1. No-tillage provides a better environment for predators, which can lead to larger predator populations. However, this may also lead to increased predation on the crop itself, which could necessitate the use of chemical pest control. 2. Untilled soil takes longer to warm and dry in spring, potentially delaying planting to less ideal dates, which may lead to increased pest problems. 3. Organic residue from the prior year's crops lying on the surface of untilled fields can provide a favorable environment for pathogens, increasing the risk of disease transmission to future crops. 4. No-till farming can provide a better environment for pathogens, insects, and weeds, leading farmers to use more chemicals for pest control. Although agroecologists do not recommend only no-till or complete tillage for all situations and suggest considering other intermediate practices such as strip-till, mulch-till, and ridge-till, the information provided indicates that Todd is likely to use more chemicals for pest control due to the nature of no-tillage farming."},{"question":"Context:Locate wholesale leather furniture , bedroom furniture , office furniture and patio furniture wholesalers and discount prices on stylish that purchase customer returns , buy backs .

Jason got along with the natives better than Adam due to","response":"Jason's deeper understanding of and genuine interest in their culture, customs, and language, along with his empathetic and adaptable nature. From the very beginning, Jason made a conscious effort to immerse himself into the unfamiliar ways of the native people and learn as much as he could from their rich traditions. He invested time and energy to comprehend their social norms, etiquette, and beliefs, and showed a strong desire to be a part of their community, thereby forming lasting connections. On a personal level, Jason was naturally empathetic and open-minded, which allowed him to truly listen to the natives and appreciate their viewpoint. This allowed him to gain their trust and respect, as they could see that he valued their experiences and acknowledged their wisdom. He was sensitive to their needs and displayed genuine concern for their well-being, often volunteering to help with tasks or providing support in times of need. This further reinforced the bond and made it easier for him to develop strong relationships with the community members. Moreover, Jason was aware of the importance of language as a primary tool of communication, so he dedicated himself to learning the native language. By doing so, he was able to establish deeper connections with the people, as well as demonstrate his commitment to understanding their way of life. His willingness and aptitude for grasping the nuances of the language broke down barriers and facilitated more meaningful interactions. As a result, the natives felt more comfortable sharing their knowledge, stories, and even humor with him. Adam, on the other hand, seemed to have a more distant and superficial approach to engaging with the native people. He didn't invest the same level of time and energy in understanding their culture or language, which led to misunderstandings and an inability to truly connect on a personal level. It appeared as though Adam viewed the natives as exotic curiosities rather than individuals with their own set of beliefs, values, and traditions. His detached attitude may have kept him from forming authentic relationships with the natives and prevented him from experiencing the depth and richness of their culture. Furthermore, Adam's reluctance to adapt to the native way of life may have been interpreted as arrogance or disregard for their customs, creating an emotional distance between him and the community. This lack of adaptability and willingness to change in order to connect with the natives alienated him and ultimately hindered the establishment of a more meaningful relationship. In conclusion, Jason's dedication to understanding and engaging with the native culture, his empathetic nature, linguistic skills, and adaptability allowed him to form deeper and more meaningful connections with the community. Meanwhile, Adam's superficial approach, limited understanding of customs and traditions, and lack of genuine interest in immersing himself in the native way of life prevented him from fostering the same level of connection as Jason."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: You are given a sentence in Hebrew.

His father was illiterate and encouraged his children to work from an early age to help the family survive, rather than attend school. By the age of 6, Jara was already working on the land. His father could not support the family on his earnings as a peasant at the Ruiz-Tagle estate, nor was he able to find stable work. Context: After joining the choir at the University of Chile in Santiago, Jara was convinced by a choir-mate to pursue a career in theater. He subsequently joined the university's theater program and earned a scholarship for talent. He appeared in several of the university's plays, gravitating toward those with social themes, such as Russian playwright Maxim Gorky's The Lower Depths, a depiction of the hardships of lower-class life. In 1957, he met Violeta Parra, a singer who had steered folk music in Chile away from the rote reproduction of rural materials toward modern song composition rooted in traditional forms, and who had established musical community centers called penas to incorporate folk music into the everyday life of modern Chileans. Jara absorbed these lessons and began singing with a group called Cuncumen, with whom he continued his explorations of Chile's traditional music. He was deeply influenced by the folk music of Chile and other Latin American countries, and by artists such as Parra, Atahualpa Yupanqui, and the poet Pablo Neruda. In the 1960s, Jara started specializing in folk music and sang at Santiago's La Pena de Los Parra, owned by Angel Parra. Through these activities, he became involved in the Nueva Cancion movement of Latin American folk music. He released his first album, Canto a lo humano, in 1966, and by 1970, he had left his theater work in favor of a career in music. His songs were inspired by a combination of traditional folk music and left-wing political activism. From this period, some of his best-known songs are \\"Plegaria a un Labrador\\" (\\"Prayer to a Worker\\") and \\"Te Recuerdo Amanda\\" (\\"I Remember You Amanda\\"). Question: What was Jara's artistic work like Answer:","response":"Victor Jara's artistic work was mainly focused on folk music and songs that talked about the lives of regular people, like workers and farmers. He used traditional styles of music from Chile and other Latin American countries, and he got ideas from other artists like Violeta Parra, Atahualpa Yupanqui, and the poet Pablo Neruda. Jara's songs were special because they also talked about important ideas, like helping people and standing up for what's right. Some of his famous songs are \\"Prayer to a Worker\\" and \\"I Remember You Amanda.\\" Before focusing on music, Jara also worked in theater and acted in plays that showed the tough life of poor people."},{"question":"Jesse Virtanen - Jesse Virtanen (born August 7 1991) is a Finnish ice hockey defenceman who currently plays professionally in Finland for Lukko of the SM-liiga.

With the countless sources of information and varying perspectives on the same events and issues, it can be both exciting and overwhelming. The Post Politics Hour is your essential guide to understanding the political landscape, cutting through the clutter, and providing a comprehensive and unbiased look at what's happening in the world of politics. By engaging with politics in this focused manner, we hope to inspire thoughtful discourse and promote informed decision-making among citizens. Main Themes In this edition of Post Politics Hour, we will dive into several key themes in the world of politics that are shaping the global landscape, as well as dissect the key players and their motives. 1. The Rise of Populism As we have seen in recent elections and referendums around the world, a surge in populist and nationalist sentiment has been reshaping the political discourse. The Brexit vote, as well as the election of Donald Trump in the United States and the popularity of nationalist leaders in Europe, all demonstrate a pushback against globalism and perceived liberal elitism. While some argue that this wave of populism is necessary to restore power to the people, others maintain that it creates division and promotes misinformation. We will explore both perspectives and discuss what the future holds for this populist upswing. 2. Climate Crisis and Environmental Policies The world is grappling with a climate crisis that is increasingly becoming a central political issue. Governments around the globe are taking notice of the need to implement sustainable practices, introduce green technologies, and transition away from fossil fuels. However, various political factors, including the influence of lobbyists and a general resistance to change, have often hampered such progress. We will delve into how the political landscape is shifting to accommodate these needs and the emerging political alliances and antagonisms surrounding climate policy. 3. The Global Power Struggle With China's rapid economic growth and its increasing presence on the world stage, the traditional power balance between the United States and the rest of the world is shifting. This new dynamic has led to tensions between these two superpowers, exemplified by ongoing trade disputes and technology competition. We will analyze the implications of this geopolitical contest for the global political order, as well as the potential for collaborations to address pressing global issues like climate change and nuclear proliferation. 4. The Erosion of Trust in Institutions In many regions of the world, trust in political institutions has been declining. Voter disenchantment has manifested as low voter turnout, protests, and the growth of alternative political movements. Fueled by widespread distrust of mainstream media, as well as the proliferation of fake news and disinformation, many citizens now feel disconnected from the political processes that govern their lives. We will delve into the root causes of this erosion of trust and discuss potential solutions for rebuilding faith in democratic institutions. Conclusion The Post Politics Hour aims to navigate the complexities of the current political landscape, providing a balanced and nuanced perspective on the various issues shaping our world. By fostering an environment for informed discussion and reflection on global and local events, we hope to inspire individuals to engage with politics in a thoughtful and constructive manner. The ultimate goal is to promote a vibrant, democratic society in which citizens feel empowered to shape their communities and their world for the better. Today's political landscape is undoubtedly complex, but by breaking it down into comprehensible pieces and topics, we can better understand the shifting tides of power, ideologies, and motivations that shape our reality."},{"question":"Complete the passage: pick from possible candidates. (CNN) -- The coalition is growing -- not just in words, but in action. Just over two weeks after U.S. President Barack Obama vowed \\"America will lead a broad coalition to roll back this terrorist threat\\" posed by ISIS, more than 50 countries have signed up, so far, to support the fight. They include new entrants Belgium, Denmark and Britain, which will all send fighter jets to Iraq to assist that nation's government and the United States in the anti-ISIS military campaign. Even the foreign minister of Russia -- which has butted heads repeatedly with Washington, including over whether the President of neighboring war-torn Syria needs to go -- signaled Friday his country is ready to back Iraq in fighting terrorists, \\"above all the Islamic State,\\" which is what ISIS calls itself. For all these issues in Iraq, what to do on the ground in OPTIONS: - America may be even more complicated. - Barack Obama may be even more complicated. - Belgium may be even more complicated. - Britain may be even more complicated. - British may be even more complicated. - CNN may be even more complicated. - Denmark may be even more complicated. - ISIS may be even more complicated. - Iraq may be even more complicated. - Islamic State may be even more complicated. - Syria may be even more complicated. - U.S. may be even more complicated. - United States may be even more complicated. - Washington may be even more complicated. - anti-ISIS may be even more complicated.","response":"- Syria may be even more complicated. The correct answer is \\"Syria may be even more complicated.\\" The passage discusses the growing international coalition to fight ISIS, which is primarily active in Iraq and Syria. The issues in Iraq have been outlined, so it makes sense that the complications in Syria would be the next point of discussion. The other options are incorrect because they do not fit the context of the passage. For example, mentioning specific countries like \\"Belgium\\" or \\"Britain\\" wouldn't make sense, as the passage is discussing broader issues in the region rather than just individual countries' involvement. Similarly, phrases like \\"Barack Obama\\" or \\"CNN\\" wouldn't fit the context of the sentence, as they are not locations or situations that the coalition needs to address."},{"question":"Q: In this task, you're given an article and an answer. Your task is to generate the fill-in-the-blank question for this answer based on the given article. The blanks are always at the end of the question, and can be filled with more than one word or phrase. Article: Amazingly, US crime figures have been falling for 20 years now. Of course, the big question is, why? And can any lessons be learnt? One reason could be the fall in the demand for the drug crack. During the 1980s, drug-related crimes soared, mostly caused by desperate crack users. However, according to professor Blumstein, co-author of The Crime Drop in America, news of the dangers of crack use caused its decrease and led to a fall in the number of drug-related crimes. Some say that the adoption of a zero-tolerance policy in many cities has helped lead to a fall in crime. In New York City, for example, mayor Rudy Giuliani imposed strict and automatic punishments for all crimes, including minor offences such as graffiti and littering. Many believe this has had a very strong deterrent effect. Another reason could be smarter policing strategies. Anti-theft measures and educating the community about car theft has helped see a drop in crimes in many areas. Also, the use of crime mapping schemes that can discover identify crime peaks in different parts of the city has helped police target hotspots. Another reason could be that more criminals are now behind bars. Sociologist John Conklin (from Tufts University) says a significant factor behind the fall in crime in the 1990s is the simple fact that many criminals are in jail. In his book Why Crime Rages Fell, he says sentencing was merciful in the 1960s and 1970s, when crime rose. But then more prisons were built and more offenders were imprisoned. Some have linked the fall in violent crime to a decline in children's exposure to lead in petrol. Jessica Wolpaw Reyes says, \\"Even low to moderate levels of exposure can lead to behavioral problems, reduced IQ, hyperactivity and youth crimes. You can link the decline in lead between 1975 and 1985 to a decline in violent crime 20 years later.\\" Others say that the drop in crime has something to do with birth rates. According to statistics, birth rates peaked between 1957 and 1961, and the proportion of men in the US in their late teens and early 20s (the so-called \\"criminal age\\") was highest in the late 70s and early 80s. However, as time went on, the proportion of people in this age group decreased. Others claim that videogames have helped. A recent study has suggested that these games are keeping young people off the streets and therefore away from crime. Advocates of this argue that any effects the games may have in encouraging violent behavior is _ by the fact that the games keep potential criminals indoors and in front of the television. Some argue that the widespread use of camera phones makes some criminals think twice before committing a crime and getting filmed doing it. Also, many believe that the mass use of CCTV has also had an effect. Finally, some say that petty theft just isn't worth it any more. The resale value of second-hand goods such as televisions, cameras or clothes is now so low (or even non-existent) that most people see no point in stealing. So, what do you think? Answer: the special policies adopted by the US police that help a drop in crime A:","response":"Part #1: Generate a fill-in-the-blank question Usage: Question: \\"One reason for the drop in crime is the adoption of __________ by the US police?\\" This meets the criteria because it asks a question that anticipates the answer \\"the special policies adopted by the US police that help a drop in crime\\".

Is the following statement true? \\"Eagles cannot fly, though they are capable of gliding short distances.\\"","response":"The statement is partially true. Let's break it down step by step. 1. \\"Eagles cannot fly\\": This part of the statement is false. Eagles are powerful birds of prey with strong wings, and they are very much capable of sustained flight. They can reach great heights and cover large distances while searching for prey or migrating. 2. \\"Though they are capable of gliding short distances\\": This part of the statement is true. In addition to active flight, eagles also use gliding as a form of energy-efficient travel. Eagles can glide and soar through the air using rising currents of warm air (thermals), which allows them to cover significant distances with minimal effort. So, while the statement correctly recognizes that eagles are capable of gliding, it is incorrect in claiming that they cannot fly."},{"question":"What is an example of a tweet?","response":"An example of a tweet can vary greatly depending on the context, purpose, and the user's intention.

And with the exception of young boys, they aren't really any taller. The new statistics come from the CDC, which found the average American man now weighs 195.7 pounds—15 pounds more than in the late '80s and early '90s—and the average American woman now weighs 168.5 pounds—up 16 pounds over the past 20 years, according to Time. Live Science reports the CDC also found that waistlines were increasing over that time span. And NJ.com points out that the increase puts the BMI of the average man (28.9) and average woman (28.8) near the official obesity level of 30. The CDC found the average American man is 5-feet-9-inches tall, and the average American woman is 5-feet-4-inches tall. Those heights are unchanged over the past two decades. However, average 11-year-old boys are now an inch taller (and 13.5 pounds heavier). The largest weight gains between now and then were seen in men between the ages of 60 and 69 and women between 20 and 29. The CDC's report didn't give reasons for the increase in weight, but an expert who describes it as a \\"fairly rapid rate\\" of weight gain, tells HealthDay that less exercise and more calorie-heavy foods are to blame. (Italian researchers don't think pasta is making us fat, at least.) Expand this summary.","response":"Over the past two decades, the average weight of Americans has experienced a significant increase, with adults gaining around 15-16 pounds on average. According to recent statistics released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the average weight for American men has reached 195.7 pounds, while the average weight for American women is now at 168.5 pounds. Concurrently, waistlines have been expanding, and the BMI for both genders is nearing the official obesity level of 30. Interestingly, the height of the average American adult did not show any changes during this time period, with men staying at an average height of 5-feet-9-inches tall and women at 5-feet-4-inches tall. However, an exception was observed in average 11-year-old boys, who now measure an inch taller and 13.5 pounds heavier than two decades ago. The most significant weight gains were noted in men aged between 60 and 69, and women aged between 20 and 29. While the CDC's report does not provide specific reasons for the increase in weight, experts believe that lack of exercise and consumption of calorie-dense foods contribute to the problem. The weight increase among Americans indicates a serious concern for public health, as it may lead to an escalation in obesity rates and several related health issues. Obesity is linked to multiple chronic health conditions, such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and certain cancers. Additionally, obesity puts a strain on the healthcare system and may also impact work productivity and the economy. To combat this alarming trend, it is crucial for individuals and public health agencies to promote healthier lifestyles and better nutrition. Encouraging regular physical activity and consumption of a well-balanced diet consisting of whole foods, fruits, and vegetables is essential. Moreover, healthcare providers play a critical role in raising awareness about the risks associated with obesity and educating patients on how to maintain a healthy weight. Furthermore, government agencies and public health organizations should endorse policies and initiatives aimed at creating healthier environments for individuals and families. This may include efforts to improve the accessibility of healthy foods in schools and workplaces, urging food manufacturers to reduce harmful ingredients (such as added sugars, artificial trans fats, and excessive sodium), as well as promoting public spaces and community programs that support physical activity. In conclusion, the rise in average weight among Americans over the past two decades is a serious public health concern that requires immediate attention. By promoting healthy lifestyles, improving nutrition, and fostering supportive environments, individuals and communities can work together to reverse this trend and reduce the risks associated with obesity and related health conditions."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: During mid-summer (July in the northern hemisphere), the westward-moving trade winds south of the northward-moving subtropical ridge expand northwestward from the Caribbean into southeastern North America. When dust from the Sahara moving around the southern periphery of the ridge within the belt of trade winds moves over land, rainfall is suppressed and the sky changes from a blue to a white appearance, which leads to an increase in red sunsets. Its presence negatively impacts air quality by adding to the count of airborne particulates. Over 50% of the African dust that reaches the United States affects Florida. Since 1970, dust outbreaks have worsened because of periods of drought in Africa. There is a large variability in the dust transport to the Caribbean and Florida from year to year. Dust events have been linked to a decline in the health of coral reefs across the Caribbean and Florida, primarily since the 1970s. Similar dust plumes originate in the Gobi Desert, which combined with pollutants, spread large distances downwind, or eastward, into North America.There are local names for winds associated with sand and dust storms. The Calima carries dust on southeast winds into the Canary islands. The Harmattan carries dust during the winter into the Gulf of Guinea. The Sirocco brings dust from north Africa into southern Europe because of the movement of extratropical cyclones through the Mediterranean. Spring storm systems moving across the eastern Mediterranean Sea cause dust to carry across Egypt and the Arabian peninsula, which are locally known as Khamsin. The Shamal is caused by cold fronts lifting dust into the atmosphere for days at a time across the Persian Gulf states. Jennifer is looking to move to a new city. She has always wanted to live in a coastal town, and she has narrowed her options down to two. She is looking to live in either Malarn or Trainlan.

Trainlan has a very famous art museum in its city, and being an art fanatic, that greatly appeals to Jennifer. She is planning to take a trip to both cities sometime in the near future to see them in person before making her decision. Are the coral reefs near Malarn more or less healthy than the reefs near Trainlan? Answer:","response":"To answer this question, I'll analyze how the factors mentioned could affect the health of coral reefs near Malarn and Trainlan. 1. Malarn regularly gets a large amount of dust in the air from a desert located across the ocean. As mentioned in the text, dust events have been linked to a decline in the health of coral reefs. This means that the coral reefs near Malarn could be negatively impacted by the dust from the desert. 2. Trainlan is not specifically mentioned as being affected by dust or sandstorms, so it could be inferred that the coral reefs near Trainlan might not face the same level of dust exposure as those near Malarn. Given the information provided, it can be inferred that the coral reefs near Malarn are likely to be less healthy than the reefs near Trainlan due to the dust from the desert that regularly affects Malarn. However, it is important to note that other factors, such as local human activity and water temperature, could also affect the health of coral reefs in both locations.

Options: - Sentence A: \\"There may be a big city on earth.\\" - Sentence B: \\"There may be a big city on Mars.\\"","response":"To evaluate which of the two sentences is nonsensical, let's assess the meaning and plausibility of each sentence. Sentence A: \\"There may be a big city on Earth.\\" This sentence suggests the possibility of the existence of a large urban area on our planet, Earth. As we know from numerous examples, there are indeed many big cities on Earth, such as New York, London, and Tokyo, among others. The idea of there being a big city on Earth is rational, considering the human population and our ability to create urban spaces. So, Sentence A is sensible. Sentence B: \\"There may be a big city on Mars.\\" This sentence suggests that there could be a large urban area on Mars, which is a planet in our solar system. Currently, humans have not constructed any cities or settlements on Mars. While there is interest in potentially colonizing Mars, this remains a futuristic concept and has not yet come to fruition. Also, to date, there is no evidence of the presence of extraterrestrial civilizations on Mars that could have built cities. Hence, based on our present understanding, the notion of a big city existing on Mars is not plausible, making Sentence B nonsensical.

This is a mutualistic relationship, with these dairying ants milking the aphids by stroking them with their antennae. Although mutualistic, the feeding behaviour of aphids is altered by ant attendance. Aphids attended by ants tend to increase the production of honeydew in smaller drops with a greater concentration of amino acids.Some farming ant species gather and store the aphid eggs in their nests over the winter. In the spring, the ants carry the newly hatched aphids back to the plants. Some species of dairying ants (such as the European yellow meadow ant, Lasius flavus) manage large herds of aphids that feed on roots of plants in the ant colony. Queens leaving to start a new colony take an aphid egg to found a new herd of underground aphids in the new colony. These farming ants protect the aphids by fighting off aphid predators. Now, I have a new situation: Hannah and Joe are two colleagues. They both study horticulture. They've been studying ants lately for their entomology class. Hannah studied ants that farm aphids, while Joe studied ants that farm fungus. Answer this question please: Which student learned less about ants fighting off aphid predators?

Question: Of the three vote percentages mentioned, in which year did Emomali win by neither the smallest nor the largest margin? Context: The nation almost immediately fell into civil war that involved various factions fighting one another; these factions were often distinguished by clan loyalties. More than 500,000 residents fled during this time because of persecution, increased poverty and better economic opportunities in the West or in other former Soviet republics. Emomali Rahmon came to power in 1992, defeating former prime minister Abdumalik Abdullajanov in a November presidential election with 58% of the vote. The elections took place shortly after the end of the war, and Tajikistan was in a state of complete devastation. The estimated dead numbered over 100,000. Around 1.2 million people were refugees inside and outside of the country. In 1997, a ceasefire was reached between Rahmon and opposition parties under the guidance of Gerd D. Merrem, Special Representative to the Secretary General, a result widely praised as a successful United Nations peace keeping initiative. The ceasefire guaranteed 30% of ministerial positions would go to the opposition. Elections were held in 1999, though they were criticized by opposition parties and foreign observers as unfair and Rahmon was re-elected with 98% of the vote. Elections in 2006 were again won by Rahmon (with 79% of the vote) and he began his third term in office. Several opposition parties boycotted the 2006 election and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) criticized it, although observers from the Commonwealth of Independent States claimed the elections were legal and transparent. Rahmon's administration came under further criticism from the OSCE in October 2010 for its censorship and repression of the media. The OSCE claimed that the Tajik Government censored Tajik and foreign websites and instituted tax inspections on independent printing houses that led to the cessation of printing activities for a number of independent newspapers.

The backstory here is appropriately absurd. Rick and Morty, co-created by Community mastermind Dan Harmon, chronicles the adventures of an alcoholic superscientist and his mostly inept grandson, mixing absurd catchphrases, fantastic alien worlds, and extremely sharp storytelling into a cocktail that’s ripe for the internet age. One of the show’s gags had Rick obsessively questing for McDonald’s Szechuan nugget sauce, a promotional flavor briefly offered in conjunction with the Disney film Mulan 20 years ago. The show’s cultish fanbase responded en masse, starting a petition to bring back the sauce and talking it up endlessly online. McDonald’s execs hinted they might do just that, and made it official this week, saying the sauce would be available for just one day – today, October 7th – as part of a promotion for the chain’s new Buttermilk Crispy Tenders. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter. But there are signs that the promotion is going south, with fans and news outlets reporting that supplies of the ironically prized sauce are running out almost instantly at the select locations where it was supposed to be available. On Twitter, some customers are claiming stores reported receiving only 20 cups of the prized sauce. Other customers are claiming stores haven’t received promised supplies at all. Though the fast-food chain was clear that supplies would be limited, fans on social media are nonetheless extremely frustrated with the situation. . @McDonalds I’m at the Merrimack,NH location for the Szechuan Sauce!

We hear you & we're sorry not everyone could get some super-limited Szechuan. — McDonald's (@McDonalds) October 7, 2017 A relaunch of an old McDonald’s nugget sauce might not seem like a big deal to most people, but this could turn into something serious for McDonald’s. Fans of Rick and Morty are passionate, and some mimic the show’s more acerbic elements by displaying a mean streak so broad it has included harassing the show’s own female writers. Mix that with internet savvy and a target as big as the Golden Arches, and you’ve got a recipe for spicy disaster. ||||| “I want that Mulan McNugget sauce, Morty,” says Rick at the end of season premiere. “That’s my series arc, Morty! If it takes nine seasons!” So last week, after fans petitioned and pressured the chain, McDonald’s finally gave in. Unfortunately the event was mostly a letdown, and “Rick and Morty” fans let everyone know how angry they were on Twitter. ||||| McDonald's is receiving major backlash after a failed attempt at bringing back a cult-favorite sauce. As previously reported, McDonald’s had agreed to bring back the discontinued Szechuan sauce following pleas from Cartoon Network’s adult cartoon, “Rick and Morty.” McDonald’s announced last week that for one-day only, the fast food restaurant would carry the Szechuan sauce for customers at participating locations. BURGER KING ITEM HITS GROCERY STORES That one day – Saturday, October 7 – “Rick and Morty” and Szechuan sauce fans gathered outside McDonald’s restaurants nationwide. Thousands lined up hours before the packets were allowed to be sold, all clamoring for the sweet plum sauce. However, McDonald’s failed to mention in any of their widespread promos that only 20 packets of the highly anticipated sauce would be available at the stores. The Huffington Post reported that some locations listed online as participating stores didn’t actually have the sauce packets at all or some had sold out before the authorized selling time. Once the fans realized that the sauce had been sold out after waiting in line for hours, they were outraged. So much so that the police had to be called to disband an angry crowd surrounding a Wellington, Fl. McDonald’s. At another McDonald’s, a mob chanting, “we want sauce,” formed, and the police had to push them back. Other locations, adults left angry and kids left crying. The disgruntled customers took to Twitter to vent their frustrations at the chain, claiming false advertising and calling for both a “class action lawsuit” and a “boycott.” The latter became a trending hashtag for the day, #boycottMcDonalds. FOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS McDonald’s responded to the outrage, issuing a public apology on their Twitter account. “The best fans in the multiverse showed us what they got today,” McDonald’s tweeted. “We hear you & we’re sorry not everyone could get some super-limited Szechuan.” Fans weren’t buying it, and accused the hamburger joint of just wanting the publicity. The fast-food giant later released a second apology on Facebook, and promised that there would be more sauce on the horizon. \\"...Our super limited batch, though well-intentioned, clearly wasn't enough to meet that demand,\\" reads the statement. \\"...So, we are going to make this right. ... Szechuan Sauce is coming back again this winter.\\" ||||| Image copyright Twitter Image caption McDonalds sent the out-of production sauce to the show's creators before announcing its return A McDonald's PR stunt to bring back a rare dipping sauce left thousands of fans disappointed, with police called to some US restaurants on Saturday. The Szechuan sauce, which was only made in 1998 to promote the film Mulan, has become well known after featuring in the popular cartoon Rick and Morty. In July the chain sent a large bottle of the sauce to the show's creators. They then announced it would come back for one day on 7 October, but fans were left disappointed after stores ran out. In one video, police can be seen holding back people chanting \\"we want sauce\\". Officers also attended other stores because hundreds of people turned up. The sauce became a meme among fans of the adult animated science-fiction series after it was featured in the third series. McDonald's announced the Szechuan's return last week, describing it as a \\"really, really limited release\\" to special locations in the US. But fans online said some restaurants claimed they were only given 20 pots of the sauce per venue, while others received none. Fans took to social media to vent their frustrations after being unable to get their hands on the out-of-production dip. One couple posted that they had driven for four hours to a restaurant stocking the sauce, but were left disappointed. The global fast food chain apologised to fans on social media but repeated their warning that the release was going to be \\"super limited\\". Pots of the sauce are now listed for sale on online auction websites for hundreds of dollars. Angry customers posted pictures of breaded chicken and dipping sauces from other fast-food chains in protest at the stunt. Others posted pictures of large bowls of the sauce they had made for themselves at home. ||||| Tweet with a location You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

It is the 5th most populous state and 25th largest state in terms of land area, and is often noted as a microcosm of the entire country. The word \\"Illinois\\" comes from the Algonquin word for \\"tribe of superior men\\". With Chicago in the northeast, small industrial cities and great agricultural productivity in central and northern Illinois, and natural resources like coal, timber, and petroleum in the south, Illinois has a diverse economic base and is a major transportation hub. The Port of Chicago connects the state to other global ports from the Great Lakes, via the Saint Lawrence Seaway, to the Atlantic Ocean, as well as the Great Lakes to the Mississippi River, via the Illinois River. For decades, O'Hare International Airport has been ranked as one of the world's busiest airports. Illinois has long had a reputation as a bellwether both in social and cultural terms and politics. - The Democratic National Convention (DNC) is a series of presidential nominating conventions held every four years since 1832 by the United States Democratic Party. They have been administered by the Democratic National Committee since the 1852 national convention. The primary goal of the Democratic National Convention is to nominate and confirm a candidate for president and vice president, adopt a comprehensive party platform and unify the party. Pledged delegates from all fifty U.S. states and from American dependencies and territories such as Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, and superdelegates which are unpledged delegates representing the Democratic establishment, attend the convention and cast their votes to choose the Party's presidential candidate. Like the Republican National Convention, the Democratic National Convention marks the formal end of the primary election period and the start of the general election season. - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\". - In American politics, a \\"superdelegate\\" is an unpledged delegate to the Democratic National Convention who is seated automatically and chooses for themselves for whom they vote. These Democratic Party superdelegates (who make up just under 15% of all convention delegates) include elected officials and party activists and officials. Democratic superdelegates are free to support any candidate for the presidential nomination. This contrasts with convention \\"pledged\\" delegates who are selected based on the party primaries and caucuses in each U.S. state, in which voters choose among candidates for the party's presidential nomination. Moreover, superdelegates are permitted to participate in the primary elections as regular voters. - Barack Hussein Obama II (; born August 4, 1961) is an American politician who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. He was the first African American to serve as president, as well as the first born outside the contiguous United States. He previously served in the U.S. Senate representing Illinois from 2005 to 2008, and in the Illinois State Senate from 1997 to 2004. - A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, sea, lake or another river. In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague. - The President of the United States (POTUS) is the elected head of state and head of government of the United States. The president directs the executive branch of the federal government and is the commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces. - The Chesapeake Bay is an estuary lying inland from the Atlantic Ocean, and surrounded by the North American mainland to the west, and the Delmarva Peninsula to the east. It is the largest such body in the contiguous United States. The northern bay is within Maryland, the southern portion within Virginia, and is a very important feature for the ecology and economy of those two states, as well as others. More than 150 major rivers and streams flow into the bay's drainage basin, which covers parts of six states (New York, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia) plus all of the District of Columbia. - The contiguous United States consists of the 48 adjoining U.S. states plus Washington, D.C. (federal district), on the continent of North America. The term excludes the non-contiguous states of Alaska and Hawaii and all off-shore United States territories and possessions, which include American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. - The District of Columbia Democratic Presidential Primary took place on February 12 , 2008 , nicknamed the \`\` Potomac Primary '' because Maryland and Virginia , which border the Potomac River , also held Democratic primaries that day . Fifteen delegates were up for grabs in the District of Columbia Democratic Primary , including 10 delegates from the District of Columbia 's municipal subdivisions ( five delegates for Wards 1 - 4 , and five delegates for Wards 5 - 8 ) . An additional five delegates were awarded to the at - large winner , Barack Obama . These 15 delegates represented the District of Columbia at the Democratic National Convention in Denver , Colorado . A total of 24 unpledged delegates , known as superdelegates , also attended the convention and cast their votes as well . Barack Obama received the endorsements of Mayor Adrian Fenty and former Mayor Marion Barry ( both African Americans ) , while he and Hillary Clinton were both endorsed by various members on the District of Columbia City Council . Barack Obama won the District of Columbia , as he did the other Potomac contests that day . He earned 12 pledged delegates to Clinton 's 3 . - The Potomac River is located along the mid-Atlantic Ocean coast of the United States and flows into the Chesapeake Bay. The river (main stem and North Branch) is approximately long, with a drainage area of about 14,700 square miles (38,000 km²). In terms of area, this makes the Potomac River the fourth largest river along the Atlantic coast of the United States and the 21st largest in the United States.

Where might he have been? Options: - hotel - guest room - office - apartment - house Answer:","response":"Based on the given information and common sense, it is highly likely that James was in an apartment or a house. This is because the given scenario indicates that he wanted to have extra sleeping arrangements for guests, which typically applies to private residential situations. In a hotel or a guest room, there would already be arrangements made for accommodating extra guests, as they are geared towards providing lodging services. Similarly, an office is a workspace, and it is generally an inappropriate setting for accommodating guests for overnight stays. Therefore, the most sensible options for where James might have been are an apartment or a house. Both of these residential options allow for flexible arrangements, and they offer the required space for purchasing a hide bed sofa to accommodate the extra guest comfortably. In an apartment or house, James has the freedom to modify and adjust the living area according to his needs, as opposed to being confined to limited options in a hotel, guest room, or office setting. By adding a hide bed sofa to his living space, James can conveniently extend his hospitality to two guests, creating a comfortable and practical solution for their temporary stay."},{"question":"Missed Opportunity<br>Alicia dug through all the clothes on the sale rack.

How is baking soda made? How do you make baking soda?","response":"The questions \\"How is baking soda made?\\" and \\"How do you make baking soda?\\" do have similar meanings, but there are slight distinctions between them based on the implications they carry. 1. Interpretation of the first question \\"How is baking soda made?\\": This question is more generally asking about the process used to manufacture baking soda. The question is not specifying who or what is doing the action. In this context, the expected answer would likely pertain to the industrial method used to make baking soda on a large scale. Explanation: The use of passive voice implies that the agent (who does the action) is not essential, or that the focus should be on the process rather than who is carrying it out. 2. Interpretation of the second question \\"How do you make baking soda?\\": This question is directly asking the person being addressed how they, specifically, would make baking soda. In this case, the answer might be different depending on who is being asked. Some might interpret this question as seeking a DIY (Do It Yourself) method, although making baking soda at home is not typical or recommended as it involves complex chemical processes. Explanation: The use of \\"you\\" makes the question directed and personal, and could imply that the asker wants to know how the respondent, specifically, would carry out the action. In conclusion, while both questions relate to the process of creating baking soda, they differ subtly in context and probable intent. The first question asks about the process broadly, while the second questions asks for a specific person's method, possibly interpreted as a DIY version. Their meanings, therefore, are not exactly the same, but are related."},{"question":"Review: Totally forgettable. Specially because of the weak acting.

The original Farsi sentence is: ما از نقاشی ناخودآگاه (doodle) و طراحی شروع می کنیم. 2. The sentence can be understood as: \\"We start from unconscious painting (doodle) and designing.\\" 3. To translate this sentence into Arabic, we can use the following corresponding words: - ما (We) -> نحن - از (from) -> من - نقاشی ناخودآگاه (unconscious painting) -> الرسم العفوي * نقاشی (painting) -> الرسم * ناخودآگاه (unconscious) -> العفوي - (doodle) -> (doodle) The word \\"doodle\\" can be retained as it is because it is an English term commonly used in many languages. - و (and) -> و - طراحی (designing) -> التصميم - شروع می کنیم (we start) -> نبدأ 4.

Burning of coal: When coal is burned in industries or power plants, it releases a large amount of heat energy, which is used to generate electricity or to power various industrial processes. During combustion, the sulfur present in the coal is exposed to oxygen. 2. Sulfur in the coal combines with oxygen to form sulfur oxides: As the coal burns, the sulfur atoms present in the fuel react with oxygen to form sulfur oxides, predominantly sulfur dioxide (SO2). 3. The sulfur oxides are released into the atmosphere: The sulfur oxides created during combustion are released into the atmosphere as part of the flue gas emissions from power plants and industrial facilities. 4. The sulfides combine with oxygen in the atmosphere to form sulfur trioxide: Once in the atmosphere, sulfur dioxide can undergo a series of chemical reactions with oxygen to form sulfur trioxide (SO3). 5. The sulfur trioxide reacts with water in the atmosphere to form sulfuric acid, a very strong acid: The sulfur trioxide will then react with water vapor present in the atmosphere to produce sulfuric acid (H2SO4), a highly corrosive and strong acid. 6. The sulfuric acid makes the rain acidic: The resulting sulfuric acid becomes part of the atmospheric moisture, which falls as acid rain when precipitation occurs. Acid rain can have harmful effects on the environment, including causing damage to forests, water ecosystems, and buildings or monuments made from materials such as limestone and marble."},{"question":"Data: Trane, product, Building Management System; Trane, revenue, 10264000000; Trane, netIncome, 556300000; Trane, location, Swords, Dublin Sentence about the following data:","response":"Trane is a company that makes special systems called Building Management Systems to help control things inside big buildings.

Paracetamol; Nurofen; Anadin; or Ibuprofen? Answer:","response":"The drug corporation in question, Reckitt Benckiser, was found guilty of marketing false 'variations' and inflated pricing of the identical product named Nurofen. Reckitt Benckiser is a British multinational consumer goods company that produces health, hygiene, and home products. One of the most popular brands under its vast portfolio is Nurofen, an over-the-counter medication primarily known for its ibuprofen content used for relieving pain, reducing inflammation, and lowering fever. The controversy arose when it was discovered that Reckitt Benckiser was misleading consumers by marketing and selling different versions of Nurofen which were labelled to target specific types of pain such as migraines, tension headaches, period pain, and back pain. These 'variations' of Nurofen were priced differently and often at a significantly higher price compared to regular Nurofen, giving consumers the perception that the specific-pain range was specialized in treating the type of pain it was labelled for. However, upon further investigation, it was revealed that these variations contained exactly the same active ingredient, Ibuprofen lysine (342mg). Whether it was Nurofen Back Pain, Nurofen Migraine Pain, Nurofen Period Pain, or Nurofen Tension Headache, the active ingredients were identical, and there was no specific formulation in these products that made them target the specific pains they were marketed for. Reckitt Benckiser's marketing strategy was deemed misleading by authorities, and they were found guilty because they were essentially charge consumers more for a perception of specialization that did not exist. The identical composition of these drugs meant that they were no more effective in treating the specific ailments they were advertised to address than regular, and cheaper, Nurofen. This unethical approach sparked a hefty fine and a significant amount of backlash for Reckitt Benckiser, as these practices violated consumer trust and contravened fair marketing and pricing norms. This case against Reckitt Benckiser serves as a cautionary tale for pharmaceutical and consumer goods companies on the price and reputational damage that can follow such misleading labeling and marketing tactics."},{"question":"this will literally be accepted with gratitude by every living being on earth.

Tucked into the woods along a country road in rural Virginia, the church holds about 50 worshippers. On this cold November Sunday, Abduraheem and his family of eight noticeably increase the congregation's size. They do their best to follow the unfamiliar English of the old Baptist hymns, which are very familiar to their new neighbors. And they share the hymns from their former home — Sudan. Standing in a single line in front of the altar, the family fills the church with Arabic song. \\"Unbelievable,\\" Abduraheem says repeatedly, as he describes his journey from a crowded prison cell in Sudan to a fixed-up house on the farm of his new pastor. \\"Unbelievable\\" seems like the only word that could describe the turn his life took, thanks to a Facebook post and a U.S. congressman. Abduraheem's work as a former pastor is not outlawed in his native Sudan, but Christians are a minority in a diverse country that has suffered through multiple civil wars. According to the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, there has been \\"an escalation in the Sudanese government's persecution of Christians,” since the 2011 secession of South Sudan. Abduraheem says his work was spreading the gospel; the Sudanese government accused him of espionage, and he was detained along with two other pastors in December 2015. \\"The first day when they took us to the prison, they beat us,” he says softly. Abduraheem was shifted from prison to prison. For five months, he wore the same clothes he was wearing when he was arrested. His eyes became damaged from the harsh prison light.

The Killian documents, presented during a 60 Minutes segment in 2004, were purported to be memos written in the early 1970s by President George W. Bush's superior in the Texas Air National Guard, Lieutenant Colonel Jerry B. Killian. These documents raised questions regarding President Bush's fulfillment of his National Guard duty and suggested that he might have received preferential treatment owing to his family's political connections. The documents received significant media attention, with further investigations into their authenticity quickly casting doubt on their legitimacy. It later became a significant controversy for CBS News as the authenticity of the documents was called into question. Critics claimed that the documents were likely forgeries, based on discrepancies in the typewriting, formatting, and language used in the memos, pointing to the likelihood that they were created using modern word processing programs rather than the typewriters in use at the time the memos were allegedly written. The controversy led CBS News to appoint a panel to investigate the issue, ultimately resulting in the admission that the news organization could not prove the authenticity of the documents, and several CBS News staff members being asked to resign or being terminated. To sum up, the statement does contain the correct answer to the question. The documents aired during the 60 Minutes segment in 2004 came to be known as the Killian documents, sparking a significant controversy due to questions surrounding their legitimacy and the conduct of CBS News in procuring and presenting them to the public."},{"question":"Continue the following story.

(October 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Vianne Rocher (Juliette Binoche), an expert chocolatier, drifts across Europe with her daughter Anouk (Victoire Thivisol), following the north wind. In the beginning of the Lenten season in 1959, \\"fifteen years after the War,\\" they travel to a quiet French village that closely adheres to tradition, as led by the village mayor, the Comte de Reynaud (Alfred Molina). Just as the villagers begin observing the forty days of Lent, Vianne opens a chocolate shop, much to Reynaud's displeasure. Vianne wears more colorful clothing than the village women, is an atheist, and has an illegitimate child. She does not fit in well with the townspeople, but is nevertheless optimistic about her business. Her friendly and alluring nature begins to win the villagers over one by one, causing Reynaud to openly speak against her for tempting the people during a time of abstinence and self-denial. The Comte will not admit that his wife has left him; he is romantically interested in Caroline, but he does not pursue her. One of the first to fall under the spell of Vianne and her confections is Armande (Judi Dench), her elderly, eccentric landlady. Armande is unhappy that her cold, devoutly pious daughter Caroline (Carrie-Anne Moss) will not let Armande see her grandson Luc because Caroline thinks Armande is a \\"bad influence\\". Vianne arranges for Luc and his grandmother to see each other in the chocolaterie, where they develop a close bond. Caroline later reveals to Vianne that her mother is a diabetic, though Armande continues to eat the chocolate despite her condition.

However, the mass of the water in the tub is much greater than the mass of the soup in the pot. This means that there are many more particles of water than soup. All those moving particles give the water in the tub greater total kinetic energy, even though their average kinetic energy is less. Therefore, the water in the tub has greater thermal energy than the soup. To compare the thermal energy of some other materials, go to the following URL and click on the interactive animation “Temperature and Thermal Energy.” Now, I have a new situation: Tim is trying to boil two pots of water, pot A and pot B. Tim has a device which lets him see what the average kinetic energy is of the particles in each pot is.

Currently, Mike has a container in his garage that is filled with two different gases. A large portion of the gas is Mologen and a smaller portion is the gas Hamogen. Which gas is responsible for more of the pressure inside the container? Answer:","response":"To determine which gas is responsible for more of the pressure inside the container, we'll refer to the Ideal Gas Law, which is illustrated by the equation PV = nRT. In this equation, P is pressure, V is volume, n is the number of moles/amount of gas, R is the ideal gas constant, and T is the temperature. Since the container holds both Mologen and Hamogen, we can say that the total pressure inside (P_total) is the sum of the partial pressures of Mologen (P_Mologen) and Hamogen (P_Hamogen): P_total = P_Mologen + P_Hamogen. Given that there is a large portion of Mologen and a smaller portion of Hamogen in the container, and without any additional information about the specific amounts, temperatures, or the gases' properties, we can conclude that it is more likely that Mologen is responsible for more of the pressure inside the container, as the pressure of a gas is directly related to the amount of gas present in the same volume and under the same temperature conditions."},{"question":"Write a dialog based on this summary: Celesta has Nelly's literature textbook.

Entailment means that the truth of the premise guarantees the truth of the hypothesis. In this case, the premise states a fact about commercial ferries arriving at Athinios port, but it does not provide information about the design purpose of the port. Conclusion: The hypothesis is not entailed by the premise, as the premise does not guarantee the truth of the hypothesis."},{"question":"Given the question: I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

This inspires the jealousy of the club's DJ Eric, Christina's former boyfriend who has also impregnated the club's owner Zoe. While at the club, Francis pays his brother Harold's young daughter to babysit. However, Francis has no children left and the girl merely practices music alone until Francis returns and drives her home. Francis' relationship with his brother is strained, as the police have told Francis that Harold had an affair with his wife before she died in a car accident, that left Harold a paraplegic.

From 2013 to 2014, 426% more products tested positive for fentanyl, according to new numbers from the . In the same time period, deaths from synthetic opioids increased by 79%. But that 79% might actually underestimate the number of deaths from synthetic opioids; the CDC was able to evaluate only the 27 states that had consistent death certificate reporting of the drugs involved in overdoses. The analysis did not include New Mexico, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania or Delaware, states that respectively had the second-, sixth-, eighth- and ninth-highest rates of overdose in the country. The CDC estimates that the 27 states evaluated represent 75% of the synthetic opioid deaths in the country. In its analysis, it further drilled down on the states that have had the biggest rise in fentanyl-related deaths and seizures, hoping to better understand how illicit fentanyl is making an impact. Though the number of heroin-related deaths is still greater than those from fentanyl, CDC behavioral scientist Matthew Gladden said, \\"the issue [of fentanyl] seems to be spreading and growing. The number of samples law enforcement submits for testing is still increasing and spreading.\\" Fentanyl is most commonly prescribed to cancer patients for relief of pain. It is more potent than morphine and 30 to 50 times more powerful than heroin. According to the DEA, illicit fentanyl is not being diverted from hospitals, but rather being sourced from China and Mexico and making its way into street drugs in the United States. Often, it is passed off as heroin or some other pill and users have no idea that they are taking the dangerous drug. Dealers are also cutting heroin and other drugs with it, because illicit fentanyl is cheap and allows them to stretch their supply. This year in California, fentanyl was passed off as the prescription drug and sold on the street. In just 10 days, one batch was responsible for at least 10 deaths and 48 overdoses. Most recently, an outbreak of nearly in just five days in western Cincinnati was linked to illicit fentanyl. After his death in April, pop star Prince's toxicology report found fentanyl in his system. Investigators seized from his Paisley Park compound that were labeled as hydrocodone, but actually contained fentanyl. It's difficult to determine just how much illicit fentanyl is out there because there are so many newly emerging variants or analogues, and many medical examiners and toxicologists are just beginning to test for it. Deaths from fentanyl itself are not reported in national data. Just six of the states evaluated by the CDC actually track deaths from the drug: Florida, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Ohio. When totaling those states' numbers, there was an increase of 1,008 fentanyl-specific deaths between 2013 and 2014. In the same time period, there were 966 more deaths from other synthetic opioids, indicating that illicit fentanyl is driving much of the increase. Ohio has been one of the places hardest hit by the epidemic. In 2014, it had the second largest number of opioid-related deaths in the country and the fifth highest rate of overdose. In Ohio between 2013 and 2014, fentanyl submissions to DEA labs by law enforcement increased by 1,043%, while fentanyl-related deaths increased by 526%. Yet in the same time period, prescriptions for fentanyl actually dropped by 7% in the state. The growing presence of fentanyl, combined with its potency, is causing public health experts to sound the alarm. formerly a director in the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy and currently a professor of psychobiology at Harvard Medical School, likened illicit fentanyl to crack cocaine. \\"It enters the brain much more quickly,\\" she said. But unlike crack, which is three times stronger than cocaine, some fentanyl analogues are 100 times more powerful than regular fentanyl. \\"I would say it's like crack on steroids,\\" Madras said. Gladden added, \\"The key message to the rest of the country is for states that haven't seen illicitly made fentanyl, they need to be vigilant.\\" He said states need to be ready with plenty of naloxone, a drug that can counteract opioid overdose, and make efforts to reach out to harm-reduction groups to help counter the impact of illicit fentanyl. What is a short summary of the above article?","response":"Fentanyl is a very strong medicine that helps people, especially cancer patients, with their pain. It is much stronger than other pain medicines like morphine and heroin. Sadly, some bad people are making fentanyl in a wrong way and selling it as different drugs. This is dangerous because it can make people very sick and can even cause death. There have been many more cases of this happening in recent years, so people are trying to be more careful and figure out how to stop it. It is important to make sure that people know what they are taking and where their medicine comes from to stay safe."},{"question":"Write a title for this article: Happy Friday! Or, as we like to say on Solo-ish: Appy Friday. Welcome to an occasional feature, where we test-drive new dating apps and report back. When you open up Her, a women-only dating app that started in Britain and just launched across the United States, it seems very confident. “Finding you all of the babes,” it promises as it pulls up profiles of other queer women nearby. But those are the last words you are going to see for a while. The app offers little more than photos, so a user’s profile is essentially a mini Instagram feed. It’s a model that’s both refreshing and baffling. After being trained on wordier, profiles like those on OkCupid and even Tinder, there’s an initial shock using Her. It’s kind of sweetly organic that way: When you “like” a user’s photo, she gets a notification and then has the option of chatting with you. If you both like photos on each other’s pages, it’s a “match,” and you are then prompted to chat: an accelerated version of what might happen between two strangers giving each other the eye at a club. The app relies on images over words because “we didn’t want to awkwardly think and describe how unique and great we were,” explains Her founder Robyn Exton, who helped usher the app, previously called Dattch, into this new format. “We had [photos] that showed who we really were, what we cared about and what it would be like to hang out with us.” The lack of a caption option is frustrating, though, since context for some of those snaps would help. Just who is that woman standing next to Stacey in her profile photo? They look like they’re at a wedding. Is Cute Stacey married? How long will it take to find that out? Next. You can write a tiny intro blurb and post it in place of a photo on your profile, but few users seem to do that. The app is “very sleek, but ended up hiding the navigation a little too well,” says Monica, a 26-year-old user in Washington. “It took me a lot of time to figure out how to do anything. I felt like a very bad millennial.” As for the text option: “I made one and then deleted it because I thought it was cutting off,” she says. “I didn’t realize it scrolled until I saw someone else’s, and then redoing it felt like a lot of effort.” A Facebook-style feed area allows users to post links, so you can get some sense of your personality across by sharing stories and events. The feed is one of the features Exton says she is most proud of: “We see a lot of people will end up chatting and meeting because they liked a comment or an article someone shared,” she says. You can choose how to “identify” from a drop-down list of 12 options, which is nice to see and makes the app feel very queer. (“Gay guys had their zillion apps, straight people got Earth. We wanted lesbians to have their space,” reads part of Her’s mission statement.) But the choices are so vague that they end up not quite doing the job for gay ladies. I am a femme looking for butches. This dynamic is a big part of my sexuality and identity. But those identifiers are not options. I finally picked “lesbian,” but what does that even mean in this context? I would love to see gender identity options — those are in the works, Exton says. And I would love even more to see a sorting function that would find me all of the babes with fades and neckties. The app’s algorithm does pick up what you’re looking for eventually, says Exton, and sometimes will show you women outside your filters. She says users “often end up meeting people — and happily dating — someone that isn’t their traditional ‘type.'” The app did take me out of my usual tunnel-vision of what I find attractive in a woman. I even liked the photos of women who seemed like they’d make great friends. “Women tend to meet in a social and friendship way first,” Exton says. “Loads of our users stay friends because they want queer friends as well as someone to date.” Exton is careful to describe Her as a “women-only” app, since “more than half our users are bi or curious,” and says that it’s not quite even a “dating app,” since more than 30 percent of users are in relationships. This brings up an important question: With Her, queer women can finally cruise each other for sexual relationships just like the gay boys and straight people have long been able to. Why not own that? Over three weeks of using Her several times daily, I made all the first moves, liked lots of people outside of my usual “type” and had only one semi-successful chat: a two-day conversation about playing the bass with a woman whose every photo was of her playing bass. Wherever you went, by the way, I’d still like to go to one of the go-go shows you play. Even though you never got around to inviting me. On a scale of zero (not a match) to five (soulmate status), Her gets a 3. Bumble, where women make the first move VIDEO | My parents took Tinder for a spin. They were pickier than I am.

He owns a private investigation firm, but the days of chasing down infidelities and petty theft hardly satisfy his thirst for intrigue. In this quiet town, the local bakery called \\"Seven Delights\\" is the epicenter of the community. The townsfolk passionately discuss the eccentric owner, Eliza Stephens, affectionately known as \\"Seven.\\" The bakery is a cherished local haunt, yet, something is brewing beneath the surface. Act 2: The Discovery One autumn morning, as the first sign of golden leaves hit the pavement, Charlie's life is upended when he stumbles upon a gruesome scene - Seven's lifeless body, lying in the alley behind her famed bakery. With the number \\"2\\" carved into her forearm, panic rushes through the tight-knit community as they grapple with the enormity of the crime. Charlie, haunted by the mysterious \\"2\\" and his need to bring justice, dusts off his detective cap and becomes obsessed with the investigation. With the help of a rookie officer, Jenna Michaels, they embark on a difficult journey to uncover the killer's identity amidst an increasingly suspicious town.

They discover a tangled web of deception, betrayal, and vengeance involving Seven and multiple townspeople. They uncover the story of \\"The Two,\\" a group of seven individuals that once formed a secret society dedicated to protecting the town from corruption and crime, led by none other than Seven herself. The group disbanded years ago amidst controversy, with each member going their separate ways, retaining only their nicknames based on the numbers they held within the group. Charlie and Jenna find themselves questioning the very people they once trusted as they persistently navigate the shadows of Silver Springs. They uncover a treacherous plot involving drugs, blackmail, and the bitter fallout from the original group's dissolution. Act 4: The Deadly Countdown Now, a deranged killer is seeking a twisted form of justice, targeting former members of \\"The Two,\\" marking them with their respective numbers. As the death toll rises, so does Charlie's conviction to find the murderer and restore a semblance of peace to the town.

Seeking redemption and a chance to resurrect the group, Sam painstakingly executed his former friends - hoping to reunite the remaining members by revealing the town's ongoing corruption. In a desperate race against time, Charlie and Jenna confront the deviant Sam. A heart-stopping showdown ensues, with Charlie ultimately apprehending Sam and ending the killings once and for all. The people of Silver Springs must now grapple with the horrifying events that befell their town. Charlie, redeemed and guilt-free, is offered a position on the police force once more.

A NASA working group hosted a discussion this week to ask: Who owns the moon? The answer, of course, is no use. The Outer Space Treaty, the international signed by more than 100 countries, states that the moon and other celestial bodies are the province of all mankind. No doubt that would annoy all of the people throughout the ages, like monks from the Middle Ages, who have tried to claim the moon was theirs. But ownership is different from property rights.

You have to determine whether, as a result of the Head, PersonY, or others, feel what is mentioned in the Tail or not. Feelings in this task are the emotional reactions on the part of PersonY or other participants in an event. For example, as a result of gift-giving, others (in this case, PersonY) might feel appreciated. Classify your answers into \\"Yes\\" and \\"No\\". The phrase may also contain \\"___\\", a placeholder that can be an object, a person, and/or an action. Head: PersonX affords another ___<sep>Tail: budgeted","response":"To process this task, we will analyze the Head event and determine if it can result in the emotion mentioned in the Tail event. Head: PersonX affords another ___ This head event involves PersonX giving, providing, or allocating something to someone else (represented by the placeholder \\"___\\"). Tail: budgeted The tail event expresses the feeling of someone, most likely PersonY or others, being budget-conscious or responsible with their finances. Now, we will evaluate the connection between the Head and the Tail events. The action of PersonX providing or allocating something to someone else can potentially lead that person to feel they are in a budgeted situation, especially if the allocation is money or resources with the expectation that they will have to manage them carefully. Therefore, the output according to the task instructions is: Output: Yes"},{"question":"Hoping to rebound from their shutout loss to the Buccaneers, the 49ers flew to the University of Phoenix Stadium for a Week 12 NFC West duel with the Arizona Cardinals on Monday night.

Article: Charlie Chaplin was one of the greatest and most widely loved silent movie stars. From Easy Street (1917) to Modern Times (1936), he made many of the funniest and most popular films of his time. He is best known for his character \\"the little tramp \\". It is this kind-hearted character that we connect with the time of silent movies. Born in London in 1889, Chaplin first visited America with a theater company in 1907. Appearing as Billy in the play Sherlock Holmes, the young Chaplin toured the country twice. On his second tour, he met Mack Sennett and was signed to Keystone Studios to act in films. In 1914, Chaplin made his first short film, Making a Living. That same year, he made thirty-four more short films. These early silent shorts allowed very little time for anything but physical comedy, and Chaplin was extremely good at it. Chaplin was known as one of the most demanding men in Hollywood. No matter how big or tiny the size of the part, Chaplin walked each actor through every scene. Chaplin knew that a successful scene wasn't simply about the star, but about everyone on the screen. He required that all the actors and actresses work together in every performance. The only way to achieve it was to keep complete control over every scene. As he became more popular, he used more and more creative and difficult filming techniques. Movies such as his 1925 hit, The Gold Rush, required endless reworking of scenes and rebuilding of sets. Though Chaplin is of the silent movie era, his achievements were carried over into the films of today. His strictness and concern for the processes of acting and directing made his films great and led the way to a new and more wonderful cinema. Chaplin's working life in entertainment lasted over 75 years, from the Victorian stage and the music hall in the United Kingdom as a child performer, until close to his death at the age of 88. Question: We can learn from the passage that _ . Options: A: Charlie Chaplin went to America for the first time at 20 B: Charlie Chaplin made 35 short films in total in 1914 C: short films had many kinds of comedy besides physical comedy D: Charlie Chaplin didn't make any popular movies after 1936 Answer:","response":"B: Charlie Chaplin made 35 short films in total in 1914"},{"question":"Q:I know that the answer to the question \\"If you traveled Interstate 26 from the starting point, where will you end up?\\" is in \\"Interstate 40 crosses the state in a west-east orientation.

What impact would this have had on his health, asks Harry Low. The western lowland silverback left his den through an unlocked door and entered the zookeepers' enclosure, where he seized his chance to drink something sweet - lots of it. He would have been more familiar with the diluted version of the drink, which forms part of the gorillas' daily diet, according to a spokeswoman for the zoo, along with cold fruit tea and leafy greens such as cabbage and kale. They are also fed other fresh vegetables including broccoli, carrots and cucumber. Gorillas have quite large stomachs so this epic helping of concentrated squash could have caused severe stomach pains and diarrhoea, according to Prof Phyllis Lee, a primatologist at the University of Stirling. \\"Five litres is quite a lot for a gorilla to consume in one go but given a gorilla's manual dexterity, I would assume that some would have been spilled,\\" she says. \\"He must have found it and taken his opportunity, similar to how a four-year-old child would.\\" Lee added that she would expect the squash to affect the consistency of Kumbuka's poo rather than its colour - even in the case of blackcurrant - though she added that she had not studied the matter closely. Image copyright PA Image caption Kumbuka succeeded in opening the bottle but may have spilled some of its contents But what about the effect of the sugar? Might this have caused a surge of physical activity once the effect of the tranquilliser had worn off? Apparently not in this case. \\"Within two hours Kumbuka was back with his family, snacking on treats, and probably wondering what all the fuss was about,\\" according to Prof David Field, who carried out a report into last week's incident. Had a human drunk five litres of undiluted squash, the results would have been similar, but possibly more extreme. It would be almost impossible for a human to take that much squash on, according to dietitian Dr Sarah Schenker. \\"I would imagine it would lead to a very upset tummy and disrupt the digestive tract,\\" she says. Diarrhoea and sickness would be the main symptoms, she suggests, though they would not last too long. \\"It wouldn't cause lasting damage - maybe you'd feel the effects for a day.\\" According to Phyllis Lee, Kumbuka's size - he weighs 29 stone (184kg) - would have helped him cope with his squash-drinking binge. There would have been no danger of overdosing on vitamin C, she says, and no damage to the teeth from just one episode of this kind. \\"That would only be caused by continually consuming sugary drinks.\\" Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Professor David Field, the zoological director at Londonzoo explained to BBC Radio 4's PM programme what Kumbuka did with his freedom.

On the London Zoo website it states Kumbuka 'likes to indulge his more mischievous streak; he’s been spotted taking apart enrichment toys and even breaking the heavy branches that make up his climbing apparatus'. It also says how Kumbuka 'lavishes' female gorilla's attention and enjoys showing off his 'impressive agility skills climbing around the Gorilla Kingdom gymnasium'.

As the first part of our investigation concludes, I’m keen to use this opportunity to clarify some things. The results of this initial investigation have established that the gorilla dens are sound and fit for purpose. For a Zoological Director running a zoo responsible for thousands of animals and hundreds of staff, this kind of reassurance matters. I can certainly tell you that there were no broken locks, Kumbuka did not smash any windows, he was never ‘on the loose’, and his normal gorilla posturing reported by visitors earlier in the day was unrelated to the incident. What I will tell you is what happened, according to those who were actually there. Kumbuka was called into his private night quarters for his dinner at around 5.10pm on Thursday 13th October. As a big silverback male with a matching appetite, he eats separately from the females - otherwise they wouldn’t get a look in. Unfortunately the door to his den had not been properly secured and a secondary security door had not yet been locked. We’ve since established that Kumbuka made an opportunistic escape from his unlocked den into the staff-only service corridor where a zookeeper was working. Thanks to the incredibly close bond and relationship shared by the zookeeper and Kumbuka, the zookeeper was able to continually reassure Kumbuka, talking to him calmly and in the same light-hearted tone he would always use, as he removed himself from the area. Staff raised the alarm that triggered our standard escape response, while Kumbuka briefly explored the zookeeper area next door to his den, where he opened and drank five litres of undiluted blackcurrant squash. Kumbuka was immediately contained in the non-public area by quick-thinking zookeepers responding to the alarm, where he was tranquilised and moved back into his den. Video of Gorillas enjoy foraging for Autumn treats Any breach of our security protocols is incredibly serious, but the incident itself was less dramatic than some would have you believe. Within two hours Kumbuka was back with his family, snacking on treats, and probably wondering what all the fuss was about. The professional responses of our zookeepers, our security teams and the emergency services was exemplary and thanks to the zookeepers’ strong relationship with Kumbuka they were able to reassure him during the incident. Now that the initial facts have been established, it’s our job to understand any contributing factors that allowed an experienced and highly trained zookeeper to make a mistake with the doors. I myself started life as a volunteer zookeeper in 1980, caring for gorillas and chimpanzees. Those of us who have had the privilege of caring for great apes become quickly aware of their individual characters and tailor our care to account for each of their personality traits. Kumbuka is the alpha male in our gorilla troop at ZSL London Zoo, an impressive male in both stature and character. Kumbuka has fathered two infants and is a patient and protective father, who displays typical silverback behaviour, such as beating his chest and posturing. Gorilla Kingdom is his home and territory and as his family grows, so will Kumbuka’s naturally protective instincts. I have the utmost respect for Kumbuka and the gorilla troop – a respect that I know is shared by all of my zookeeper colleagues, who also recognise the important responsibility they have in caring for them. The magnitude of personal responsibility that zookeepers feel for the animals in their care, the colleagues they work with every day and the thousands of visitors to their zoo is indescribable. It is this sense of responsibility that provides some of our strongest security measures. We know that humans sometimes make mistakes, but these are rare. We also know that automating every security system poses a greater risk of mechanical failure, and could lead to an over-reliance on technology that will create the kind of complacency that has no place here. We will continue to work with our keeping teams to identify any adjustments or modifications that can help avoid any repeat mistake in future, but ultimately our trust in our people is not shaken. Today, Kumbuka and his family are happily playing, eating and sleeping in Gorilla Kingdom. Gorillas invoke the most remarkable feelings of wonder from anyone who sees them and our visitors can continue to be assured that these animals are safe, secure and in the care of a team of dedicated zookeepers. ||||| Fruit-flavoured squash before and after being mixed with water Squash (also known as cordial), in British English, is a non-alcoholic concentrated syrup used in beverage making. It is usually fruit-flavoured, made from fruit juice, water, and sugar or a sugar substitute. Modern squashes may also contain food colouring and additional flavouring. Some traditional squashes contain herbal extracts, most notably elderflower and ginger. Drinks [ edit ] Squash is mixed with a certain amount of water or carbonated water before drinking. The amount of water added is to taste, with the squash becoming less strong the more it is diluted. As a drink mixer, it may be combined with an alcoholic beverage to prepare a cocktail. Citrus fruits (particularly orange, lime and lemon) or a blend of fruits and berries are commonly used as the base of squash.[1] Traditional squashes are usually flavoured with ginger, chokeberries (often with spices added), elderflower, and sometimes orange or lemon.[citation needed] Preparation [ edit ] Squash is prepared by combining one part concentrate with four or five parts water (carbonated or still). Double-strength squash and traditional cordials, which are thicker, are made with two parts concentrate. Some squash concentrates are quite weak, and these are sometimes mixed with one part concentrate and two or three parts water. Storage [ edit ] Most cordials and squashes contain preservatives such as potassium sorbate or (in traditional cordials) sulphites, as they are designed to be stored on shelves. They keep well because of the preservatives and their high sugar content. Nonetheless, some choose to store their squash in refrigerators. Ingredients [ edit ] Ingredients in squashes and cordials have evolved over the years. A traditional cordial contains three ingredients: sugar, juice or plant extract and some water. Usually it can contain an acidifier such as citric acid or in very old-fashioned cordials lemon juice, or even spices such as cinnamon or cloves. Recreations of these traditional preparations often contain a preservative especially sulphur dioxide, although sugar alone will keep it fresh for quite a long time. Modern squash drinks are generally more complex and sugar free squash even more so; the ingredients are usually water, sweetener such as aspartame or sodium saccharin, juice in a low quantity (typically 5-10 percent), large quantities of flavouring, preservatives and sometimes a colour such as anthocyanin. In the middle are ordinary squashes, which contain sugar, water, a larger amount of juice, preservatives, colouring such as anthocyanin and often a small amount of flavouring. Although colours such as Allura Red AC and Sunset Yellow FCF are occasionally used in squash, most modern British companies are gradually aiming to use natural colours such as beta carotene or anthocyanins, and natural flavourings. Flavourings [ edit ] Traditional squashes may be flavoured with elderflowers, lemon, pomegranate, apple, strawberry, chokeberry (often with spices such as cinnamon or cloves added), orange, pear, or raspberry. Modern squashes usually have simpler flavours, such as orange, apple, summer fruit (mixed berries), blackcurrant, apple and blackcurrant, peach, pineapple, mango, lime, or lemon. Terminology [ edit ] \\"Cordial\\", \\"diluted juice\\", and \\"squash\\" are similar products, although the products known as cordials tend to be thicker and stronger, requiring less syrup and more water to be blended.[citation needed] In British English, \\"cordial\\" refers to a sweet fruit-flavoured drink (as different from a syrup).[2] \\"High juice\\" is not a brand of squash but rather a type that contains a larger amount of juice, around 45%. Squash is often colloquially known as \\"juice\\". However this term is a misnomer; no squash is pure juice. Squashes are commonly called according to the fruit from which they are made. More rarely, they may be called \\"fruit drink\\", especially if they are ready-diluted in a plastic bottle or paper carton (e.g., Fruit Shoot). Some small areas in the North East refer to squash as \\"dilutey juice\\". Fruit juice content [ edit ] Squashes are measured by their juice content, the average being 30%. A variety of squash that contains a larger amount of fruit juice, up to half or more of the volume in juice, is sold in markets as \\"high juice\\", and squashes are quite often called \\"juice\\" when talking to children, especially these high-juice beverages, although this may be confusing. However, many squashes contain less than 20% juice, and some as little as 5-10%. The latter are typically low in nutritional value, and the high juice versions are reasonably higher in nutrients, although one downside is that it is high in sugar and does not contain fibre or minor nutrients. That goes with almost all squashes. A low juice squash may state \\"with real fruit juice\\" on the label. Low-sugar squashes [ edit ] Squashes labelled \\"no added sugar\\" are artificially sweetened, usually with aspartame, acesulfame K, saccharin or sucralose, which is much cheaper for the manufacturers than both HFCS and natural sugar. They are very low in calories, sometimes having as few as 4 per 100ml diluted, and they are marketed towards families seeking low calorie alternatives. They tend to be very low in fruit juice, as fruit juice contains natural sugars, so they usually also contain natural or artificial flavourings (isoamyl acetate for pear or banana, or mixed with malic acid to make an apple-like flavour, ethyl methylphenylglycidate for strawberry, octyl acetate for orange, allyl hexanoate for pineapple etc.) to make up for the lack of fruit juice taste. World markets [ edit ] Assorted bottles of squash at a grocery store in Argentina Britvic (under the Robinsons, MiWadi and Teisseire brands), Hamdard (under the Rooh Afza brand in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh), Nichols (under the Vimto brand), Suntory (under the Ribena brand) and Coca-Cola (under the Kia-Ora brand). Australian brands include Cottee's, Bickford's, P&N Beverages and Golden Circle cordials. Indian brands include Kissan and Rasna. In Israel, fruit squashes are produced by such companies as Prigat. Animal consumption [ edit ] The gorillas at London Zoo are given both squash and cold fruit tea to drink. When a silverback called Kumbuka escaped from his enclosure in 2016, he drank five litres (8.8 imperial pints) of undiluted blackcurrant squash that was in the keepers' area.[3] See also [ edit ] |||||Summary:","response":"When Kumbuka, a gorilla, escaped from his enclosure at the London Zoo, he drank five litres of undiluted blackcurrant squash before he was tranquillised.

This town now honors him with the annual Oz-Stravaganza festival. 2. Syracuse, New York: Baum's family moved to Syracuse, NY when he was a young man. While in Syracuse, Baum met his future wife, Maud Gage, and they were married in 1882. 3. Aberdeen, South Dakota: In 1888, Baum moved with his wife and their four sons to Aberdeen, South Dakota, where he opened a store called \\"Baum's Bazaar.\\" Unfortunately, the store didn't fare well and eventually closed down. While in Aberdeen, he began his writing career, working as a journalist and editor for the local newspaper, \\"The Aberdeen Saturday Pioneer.\\" 4. Chicago, Illinois: In 1891, Baum and his family moved to Chicago, pursuing better opportunities. He got a job as a reporter for the \\"Evening Post.\\" Baum continued his writing career, contributing to various magazines and newspapers while also writing children's books. It was here that he penned \\"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\\" in 1900, which quickly gained immense popularity. 5. Coronado, California: Desiring a more suitable climate due to his wife's health issues and a quieter place to work on his writing, Baum and his family moved to Coronado, California, in 1904. He stayed there for several winters, often writing his Oz books from the \\"Griswold,\\" a famous rental house in the area, and later built his permanent home, \\"Ozcot,\\" in Hollywood. 6. Hollywood, California: In 1910, Baum and his family moved permanently to Hollywood, California, where they built their home, \\"Ozcot.\\" The house had a garden filled with various plants and trees mentioned in his Oz books. Baum continued to write his immensely popular Oz series and became involved in the burgeoning movie industry, setting up his own movie production company, \\"The Oz Film Manufacturing Company,\\" in 1914. L. Frank Baum passed away at his Ozcot home in Hollywood, California, on May 6, 1919, but his legacy lives on through the timeless stories he created, enchanting generations of readers for over a century."},{"question":"Answer this question. What exotic city was featured in National Geographic magazine's first photo story in 1905?","response":"The first photo story in National Geographic magazine was about the exotic city called Lhasa. Lhasa is in a country called Tibet, which is close to a big country called China. It has beautiful mountains and colorful buildings."},{"question":"Generate a context and a hypothesis.","response":"Context: In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the consumption of plant-based diets around the world. More and more people are adopting vegan, vegetarian, and flexitarian lifestyles, opting to reduce or eliminate their consumption of animal products. This trend has been driven by several factors, including concerns about physical health, environmental sustainability, and animal welfare. It has also given rise to a burgeoning market for plant-based alternatives to meat, dairy, and other animal-derived products. In light of this growing interest in plant-based diets, researchers and nutrition experts have conducted various studies to better understand the potential impact of these diets on human health. Some of these studies have focused specifically on protein intake, given that this macronutrient is often a significant component of animal products and a topic of interest to individuals considering a shift to a plant-based diet. As a result, researchers have examined how protein sources and quantity might vary between plant-based and omnivorous diets and how these variations could impact overall health and well-being. Hypothesis: Given the growing popularity of plant-based diets and the importance of protein in the human diet, we hypothesize that a well-planned plant-based diet, which includes a variety of high-quality protein sources, can provide individuals with the recommended daily allowance of protein and support overall health and well-being. Furthermore, we postulate that those who follow such a plant-based diet may enjoy additional health benefits, such as reduced risk of chronic diseases, compared to those who consume a typical omnivorous diet. To test this hypothesis, we suggest conducting a large-scale and long-term study comparing the protein intake, nutritional status, and health outcomes of individuals who adhere to a plant-based diet with those who follow an omnivorous diet. The study should be designed to isolate the specific impact of protein intake and other relevant dietary factors on the participants' overall health and well-being. Participants should be matched for various demographic factors, such as age, sex, body mass index, and exercise levels, to reduce potential confounding variables. The results of this study could help to further our understanding of the capacity of a plant-based diet to meet the protein needs of individuals and provide valuable information to nutrition experts and the general public. Ultimately, these findings could support the claim that plant-based diets can be healthful, sustainable, and nutritionally adequate, fostering a greater level of confidence in those who choose to adopt this lifestyle for a variety of reasons."},{"question":"Two concerts at Wrocław’s Wratislavia Cantans , one of the most acclaimed festivals of East-Central Europe, will be the first time the Iturriaga quartet plays at the lower Silesian capital and the third time in Poland.

Allen plays Leonard Zelig, a nondescript enigma, who, out of his desire to fit in and be liked, takes on the characteristics of strong personalities around him. The film, presented as a documentary, recounts his intense period of celebrity in the 1920s and includes analyses from contemporary intellectuals. Zelig was photographed and narrated in the style of 1920s black-and-white newsreels, which are interwoven with archival footage from the era and re-enactments of real historical events. Allen used newsreel footage and inserted himself and other actors into the footage using bluescreen technology. To provide an authentic look to his scenes, Allen and cinematographer Gordon Willis used a variety of techniques, including locating some of the antique film cameras and lenses used during the eras depicted in the film, and even going so far as to simulate damage, such as crinkles and scratches, on the negatives to make the finished product look more like vintage footage. The virtually seamless blending of old and new footage was achieved almost a decade before digital filmmaking technology made such techniques in films like Forrest Gump (1994) and various television advertisements much easier to accomplish. The film uses cameo appearances by real figures from academia and other fields for comic effect. Contrasting the film's vintage black-and-white film footage, these persons appear in color segments as themselves, commenting in the present day on the Zelig phenomenon as if it really happened. They include essayist Susan Sontag, psychoanalyst Bruno Bettelheim, Nobel Prize-winning novelist Saul Bellow, political writer Irving Howe, historian John Morton Blum, and the Paris nightclub owner Bricktop. Also appearing in the film's vintage footage are Charles Lindbergh, Al Capone, Clara Bow, William Randolph Hearst, Marion Davies, Charlie Chaplin, Josephine Baker, Fanny Brice, Carole Lombard, Dolores del Rio, Adolf Hitler, Joseph Goebbels, Hermann Goring, James Cagney, Jimmy Walker, Lou Gehrig, Babe Ruth, Adolphe Menjou, Claire Windsor, Tom Mix, Marie Dressler, Bobby Jones, and Pope Pius XI. In the time it took to complete the film's special effects, Allen filmed A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy and Broadway Danny Rose. Are any parts of the movie in color?","response":"Yes, parts of the movie \\"Zelig\\" are indeed in color. Contrasting with the predominant vintage black-and-white aesthetic, there are contemporary segments of the film presented in color. These sections feature real figures from various professional fields, who appear as themselves in what could be called 'modern-day' scenes, commenting on the happenings of the Leonard Zelig phenomenon as if it really occurred. These individuals include prominent personalities such as essayist Susan Sontag, psychoanalyst Bruno Bettelheim, Nobel Prize-winning novelist Saul Bellow, political writer Irving Howe, historian John Morton Blum, and Paris nightclub owner Bricktop. These scenes of color are somewhat of a stylistic decision by Woody Allen, they offer a notable contrast to the monochromatic vintage footage, providing the audience with a clear distinction between the present (at the time of making the film) and the past as depicted in the black-and-white sections. It's interesting to mention that beyond this use of color footage for present-day commentary, the film is phenomenal in its commitment to historical re-creation, blending vintage footage with new scenes shot (and tweaked) to look old. This attention to stylistic detail extends to the point of simulating defects on the negatives, as if the footage was vintage, hence contributing to the overall authenticity and believability of the narrative, making the color sections stand out even more prominently due to the stark contrast in visual tone. These color scenes serve as a tool for narrative bridging, giving insights and interpretations that link the past and the present, enabling the audience to better comprehend the significance of Zelig's story, not just as a character study, but also as a reflection of society's complex dynamics. They provide a rich context to understand the mockumentary style storytelling adopted by Allen in this film."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: Andrea \\"Andy\\" Sachs (Anne Hathaway), an aspiring journalist fresh out of Northwestern University, lands the magazine job \\"a million girls would kill for\\": junior personal assistant to icy editor-in-chief Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep), who dominates the fashion world from her perch atop Runway magazine.

Ripper (Sterling Hayden) is commander of Burpelson Air Force Base, which houses the Strategic Air Command 843rd Bomb Wing, equipped with B-52 bombers and nuclear bombs. The 843rd is currently in-flight on airborne alert, two hours from their targets inside Russia. General Ripper explains to Group Captain Mandrake how he first discovered the Communist plot to pollute Americans' \\"precious bodily fluids.\\" General Ripper orders his executive officer, Group Captain Lionel Mandrake (Peter Sellers) of the UK Royal Air Force, to put the base on alert. Ripper also issues \\"Wing Attack Plan R\\" to the patrolling aircraft, one of which is commanded by Major T. J. \\"King\\" Kong (Slim Pickens). All of the aircraft commence an attack flight on Russia and set their radios to allow communications only through the CRM 114 discriminator, which is programmed to accept only communications preceded by a secret three-letter code known only to General Ripper. Mandrake discovers that no war order has been issued by the Pentagon and tries to stop Ripper, who locks them both in his office. Ripper tells Mandrake that he believes the Soviets have been using fluoridation of United States water supplies to pollute the \\"precious bodily fluids\\" of Americans; Mandrake now realizes that Ripper is insane. At the Pentagon, General Buck Turgidson (George C. Scott) briefs President Merkin Muffley (also Peter Sellers) and other officers and aides about the attack in the \\"War Room\\".

PFM were the first Italian group to have success abroad, entering both the British and American charts. Between 1973 and 1977 they released five albums with English lyrics. They also had several successful European and American tours, playing at the popular Reading Festival in England and on a very popular national television program in the United States. The lack of a strong lead vocalist had always been considered PFM's biggest liability so, for this reason, they enrolled Bernardo Lanzetti, who was previously with the group Acqua Fragile. While a college student, Lanzetti had lived in Austin, Texas for a few years. But most importantly he had a powerful and distinctive voice and could speak fluent English. The first release by the six-piece band was Chocolate Kings in 1975. Featuring a harder rock sound, it had modest success at home but was their least popular album in Italy so far. The same album was released with different cover art by Manticore in the UK and by Asylum Records in the US. The controversial US/UK cover showed a chocolate bar in a partially peeled Stars and Stripes wrapper on the front, along with the crumpled and discarded wrapper on the back. PFM appeared on the BBC television show The Old Grey Whistle Test in 1976 performing the title track to the album. The album reached the UK top 20 but was less successful internationally. Mauro Pagani left the group following Chocolate Kings to pursue a solo career. Lanzetti also appeared on Jet Lag (1977), an album highly influenced by the Jazz-fusion movement, which was recorded in Los Angeles. This was their last album with English lyrics and the last album released in the U.S., also on Asylum. Violinist Gregory Bloch, previously with the group It's a Beautiful Day, replaced Mauro Pagani and helped the band acquire notoriety in the US before leaving to join the Saturday Night Live Band in 1979. For Passpartu (1978) PFM added two new percussion players and shifted stylistic direction once again. The album contains seven songs in Italian and one instrumental, characterized by an international pop music style; an early example of what today is known as 'Worldbeat'. The album contains mostly acoustic guitar and draws from Italian folk and Latin music as well as Jazz-Pop styles, somewhat like Steely Dan. This was the last album to feature Lanzetti, who then left to pursue a solo career. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: What did they do after that last album?","response":"After that last album, Passpartu, which featured Bernardo Lanzetti, he left the band to pursue a solo career."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person that began recording atop Mayan pyramids in Mexico? English-Tamil musician M.I.A. (Mathangi \\"Maya\\" Arulpragasam) released her second album Kala in 2007, which achieved widespread critical acclaim, and was certified gold in the United States and silver in the United Kingdom. Six months after giving birth to her son Ikyhd in February 2009, she began composing and recording her third studio album in a home studio section of the Los Angeles house she had bought with her partner Ben Bronfman. She used instruments such as the portable dynamic-phrase synthesizer Korg Kaossilator to compose. She took the beat machine and began recording atop Mayan pyramids in Mexico. Much of the work on the album was undertaken at her house in Los Angeles, in what she called a \\"commune environment\\", before it was completed in a rented studio in Hawaii. She collaborated with writer-producer Blaqstarr because, in her opinion, \\"he simply makes good music\\". M.I.A.'s collaboration with Derek E. Miller of Sleigh Bells on the track \\"Meds and Feds\\" prompted her subsequent signing of the band to her label N.E.E.T., and according to Miller, this experience gave him the confidence to record the band's debut album Treats.Her creative partnership with the comparatively unknown Rusko grew from a sense of frustration at what she saw as her now more mainstream associates suggesting sub-standard tracks due to their busy schedules. Diplo worked on the track \\"Tell Me Why\\", but at a studio in Santa Monica rather than at the house. He claimed in an interview that, following the break-up of his personal relationship with M.I.A. some years earlier, he was not allowed to visit the house because \\"her boyfriend really hates me\\".Tracks for the album were whittled down from recording sessions lasting up to 30 hours. Producer Rusko, who played guitar and piano on the album, described the pair getting \\"carried away\\" in the studio, appreciating the \\"mad distorted and hectic\\" sound they were able to create.

While many people associate Wisconsin with dairy production due to its nickname, \\"America's Dairyland,\\" California has in fact surpassed Wisconsin as the highest dairy-producing state in the nation. California's booming dairy industry can be attributed to a variety of factors. To begin with, the state enjoys a mild climate, providing suitable conditions for raising healthy cows and generally supporting a year-round dairy production. Another crucial factor is the abundance of fertile land across the state, which allows for the growth of sufficient feed crops to sustain large-scale dairy herds. Furthermore, California has a large population and marketplace, which drives local demand for dairy products like milk, cheese, and yogurt. This creates a favorable environment for dairy farmers to sell their goods locally or to export them to international markets. Additionally, some dairy production facilities in California have adopted cutting-edge techniques and technologies to improve milk production, processing, and distribution, helping the state further excel in terms of dairy output. Over the past few decades, California has only continued to strengthen its position as the leading dairy state. According to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), California produced approximately 40.5 billion pounds of milk in 2020, accounting for around 18.7% of the nation's total milk production. Wisconsin, on the other hand, produced about 30.7 billion pounds of milk the same year, making up approximately 14.3% of national milk production. So, while Wisconsin may be traditionally known for its dairy products, California has indeed surpassed it to emerge as the United States' top dairy state, thanks to its advantageous climate, fertile land, large population, and constant innovations in the dairy industry."},{"question":"Thehumankingdom,thekingdomofwisdom,thedivineworldandthekingdomofblissarethusexclusivelykingdomsoflightandjoy,wherelifeculminatesinitsveryhighestformofwell-being,andwhereallbeingsareexclusivelyajoyandblessingforoneanother,therebyappearinginGod'simageafterhislikeness.

Afterward, Kulkov's dog sniffs out where his master is buried and starts digging. This alerts one of Kulkov's comrades, who communicates with him by tapping on a metal pipe in code. Learning that Kulkov has caught an officer, he leaves to get help. Kulkov is in no hurry to dig out. Though the prisoners rank no higher than a sergeant, he is convinced one of them is an officer in disguise, based on a pistol and a monocle he has found. He begins questioning the men one by one, but while he rules out ex-miner Stillman (Rudolph Anders) and a former magician (Philip Van Zandt), he cannot pinpoint his man. An eighth German soldier, thought to be dead, wakes up and attacks. In the struggle, the lone lantern is extinguished and Elenko is stabbed in the shoulder. However, Kulkov kills him and regains control of the situation. Oddly, Elenko is certain that one of the Germans tried to help her in the darkness. Kulkov decides to try a ploy. He orders the magician to go around the corner of the main room out of sight of the others. He knocks the German out and then fires one round, making the rest think he has exacted...

Options: - Sentence A: \\"A went to a shoe to purchase a video game.\\" - Sentence B: \\"A went to a store to purchase a video game.\\" . Explanation:","response":"Sentence A is the correct answer to the question of which sentence is against common sense. The reason for this is that Sentence A states, \\"A went to a shoe to purchase a video game.\\" This statement is illogical and goes against common sense because it suggests that a person is able to visit a shoe (an object) for the purpose of buying a video game. In reality, a shoe is an item people wear on their feet and not a place to buy video games. On the other hand, Sentence B states, \\"A went to a store to purchase a video game.\\" This sentence aligns with common sense, as it is reasonable to assume that purchasing a video game typically takes place within a store or shop that sells such items."},{"question":"Title: An alternative view of Romania Review: The book may never stand out as a literary gem, but it is an emotional and stirring account of one man's experience both growing up in Romania and his experience with the revolution. It is a recount that you will not find in any history book, but one that is just as relevant, of the euphoria Christmas 1989 and subsequent disappointment afterwards. Each Romanian has their own opinion of that time, as events affected everyone differently, and the revolution was short in duration and not wide spread. My wife's recounts vary greatly from Antal's.

The premise doesn't provide any information relating to someone needing to be fired. Step 4: Conclusion Based on the steps above, we cannot conclusively affirm the hypothesis solely from the premise provided. While the doubt about something making sense is present in both the premise and the hypothesis, the suggestion of firing someone is not included in the premise.

Lead is such a well-known health - perhaps even contributing to the fall of the Roman Empire- that it came as a shock to discover that toys played by children could contain lead. Doctors are now dealing with the aftershocks. Just how dangerous is this exposure? That's the question physicians are being asked by parents who find a lead-polluted Elmo, of Dora. Millions of others toys, lunch boxes and pieces of jewelry manufactured in China have been recalled because they contain lead either in the paint that coats them or as a component of the plastic used to make the item more flexible. The lead content in some of the toys recalled this summer was 180 times the amount allowed by law. Some pieces of jewelry were almost 100% lead. Experts advise that the items do cause a risk and that doctors should urge parents to check the comprehensive lists of recalled products on the Consumer Product Safety Commission's Web site and return any appearing on those lists to the manufacturers. If exposure is suspected, a blood test is in order . Since there is no safe level of this universal element, the risk face by children for lead poisoning and its accompanying threat of learning disabilities and behavior problems is considerable. Doctors who have toys in their waiting rooms also are advised to see if any of them have been recalled and to check for chipped, flaking paint-even on those that haven't yet been recalled--since new announcements of toy risk continue.

Plot title: Tarzan Movie plot: In the second half of the 1800s, an English couple and their infant son escape a shipwreck, ending up near uncharted rainforests off the coast of Africa. The couple craft themselves a treehouse from their ship's wreckage, but are subsequently killed by Sabor, a rogue leopardess. Kala, a female mountain gorilla who recently lost her own child to Sabor, hears the cries of the orphaned human infant and finds him in the ruined treehouse. Though she is attacked by Sabor, Kala and the baby manage to escape. Kala takes the baby back to the gorilla troop to raise as her own, an act which the leader and her mate, Kerchak, disapproves of but grudgingly lets her proceed with. Kala raises the human child, naming him Tarzan. Though he befriends other gorillas and animals, including a young female gorilla named Terk and the paranoid male elephant Tantor, Tarzan finds himself treated differently because of his different physique, so he makes great efforts to improve himself. As a young man, Tarzan manages to kill Sabor with a crude spear he made, gaining Kerchak's reluctant respect. The gorilla troop's peaceful life is interrupted by the arrival of a team of human explorers from England, consisting of Professor Porter, his daughter Jane, and their hunter-guide Clayton. The explorers are looking to study gorillas. Jane accidentally becomes separated from the group and chased by a pack of baboons, and Tarzan saves her. He recognizes that she is the same as he is: a human. Jane leads Tarzan back to the explorers' camp, where Porter and Clayton both take great interest in him â the former in terms of scientific progress while the latter hopes to have Tarzan lead him to the gorillas so that he can capture them and return with them to England. Despite Kerchak's warnings to be wary of the humans, Tarzan continues to return to the camp, where Porter, Clayton, and Jane teach him to speak English as well as what the human world is like. He and Jane begin to fall in love. However, the English explorers have a difficult time... My question: Who does Tarzan have to hold at bay?

Up in front of me was a giant billboard advertising yet another jeweler, in ten-foot letters and bright silver watches like massive alien machines. The traffic slowed and stopped on the ramp as it bottlenecked further into the city, and my head turned to examine the sign and the blocked view of the cityscape and land beyond. Past it was another billboard, with the name of a casino as its only text, filled with collaged images of money, plush rooms, and dancers. A quarter mile further brought me to an advertisement for business management solutions. Another few hundred yards and I was urged to try the new sandwich at the new sandwich place. The sun set and the signs stayed bright as automatic light switched on. The city grew dark and the hills beyond feebled out, existing only in our minds and finally not even there. All that remained were the well-lit and shiny reminders that lawyers were standing by to take my case to court, and that somebody's air conditioners would outlast somebody else's. I had an idea. I made the call the next day. It would put me back a good half grand, but it would be worth it. There would be no design meeting; I sent them the image and it was printed. A few weeks later it went up. Now on my commute, when I paused in the crush of metal bodies, I looked up and saw mountains by Maxfield Parrish, reaching up to the clouds in impossible cragginess, rivulets and gushing streams painted down their sides, with the sun striking vibrant oranges and reds into the shadows of the rocks. There were trees in copper-patina green and still pools quieter than the middle of winter but warm as the first day of summer. No doubt people thought it was the first part of a two-stage advertising gimmick, or a filler to be used when no one was renting space on the sign. But I was happy.

The desert that is encroaching into northeastern Nigeria is the Sahara Desert. The Sahara is the largest hot desert in the world, spanning across most of the northern part of Africa. Its expansion into surrounding regions, including northeastern Nigeria, poses a significant threat to the livelihoods of people living in those areas. This phenomenon is known as desertification. The process of desertification occurs when arable land becomes dry and infertile due to a combination of factors, including deforestation, overgrazing, and climate change. As the desert extends its reach, agricultural lands, water resources, and ecosystems are affected, putting additional pressure on communities that depend on these natural resources for their survival. In the context of northeastern Nigeria and Lake Chad, the effects of desertification are particularly evident. Lake Chad is a significant water source for nearly 30 million people across Nigeria, Niger, Chad, and Cameroon. However, since the 1960s, the lake has shrunk to less than a tenth of its original size due to the prolonged drought, decreased rainfall, and increased evaporation attributed in part to climate change. As Lake Chad diminishes, the surrounding region faces increased desertification, impacting the availability of fertile land and water resources necessary to support agriculture, fishing, and livestock farming. This results in negative socio-economic consequences, with communities experiencing food and water shortages, displacement, and conflict as they compete for the remaining limited resources. While the sentence provided does not directly mention the Sahara Desert or the process of desertification, it does touch upon relevant geographical information. The mention of the \\"dry north-east corner of the country\\" hints at the desertification occurring in the region, which we know is caused by the encroachment of the Sahara Desert. In conclusion, the sentence does not explicitly answer the question, but with some contextual knowledge, we can deduce that the Sahara Desert is the desert encroaching into northeastern Nigeria. The situation further highlights the need for sustainable land and water management practices, as well as targeted interventions to address the consequences of desertification and support communities affected by these environmental challenges."},{"question":"Question: Information: - Vuosaari is a neighbourhood in the City of Helsinki, Finland.

It was usually contested between countries or military units. The military patrol competition encompassed 25 kilometer cross-country skiing (15 km for women) and rifle shooting. The size of the patrol was four members. The total climb had to be from 500 to 1200 meters (300 to 700 for women). The rules were very similar to modern biathlon. Traditionally the participating patrol had to consist of one officer, one non-commissioned officer (NCO) and two privates. The officer carried a pistol instead of a rifle and did not take part in the shooting. The total weight of the backpacks of the NCO and the privates had to be at least 24 kilograms. In later years the competitors did not carry backpacks, and the rifles were small bore rifles, similar to those in biathlon. The patrol leader did not have any kind of weapon. - The Olympic Oath (distinct from the Olympic creed) is a solemn promise made by one athlete judge or official and coach at the Opening Ceremony of each Olympic Games.

Use a thermometer to ensure that your Developer is 102 degrees Fahrenheit or 38.8 degrees Celsius. With a stopwatch in hand, pour the Developer into the tank until it is level with the opening at the lid. Start the stopwatch as soon as you've poured all the Developer into the tank. Agitate the tank for 15 seconds. Do this by swirling the tank around. Flip the tank gently 4 times every 30 seconds. Tap the tank gently on the edge of the sink to pop any bubbles that have formed inside from flipping it. Repeat this every 30 seconds for 3 minutes exactly. At 3:25, start pouring the Developer back into its original chemical container or jug using the funnel. Your developing time will be 3 ½ minutes. Do not neglect to agitate the developing tank.

Protect your face with goggles and a dust mask or respirator. Wear heavy work gloves to avoid getting cut. Also cover all your exposed skin with your clothes so no debris gets stuck in your skin. Work in a well-ventilated area. Outside is best. If you’re in a garage, keep the door open. Spread a sheet under the car to catch any falling debris. A dual-action sander uses compressed air to spin the sanding surface. Start with a coarse, 40-grit sandpaper. This strips off the top layer of paint. You can buy or rent sanders from a hardware store. You can also use a grinder. This strips the paint off much faster. However, it can also damage the metal. Always keep the grinder moving and don’t hover over one spot to avoid denting the bare metal. Another option is sanding by hand, without an electric sander. This is extremely time-consuming, but you will save money. Also, sanding by hand is a better option if you own a classic car to avoid damaging the body. Use a sanding block at the same grit levels as you use for the electric sander. Flat surfaces like the hood or roof are the easiest to sand, so start here. Start the sander and press it down on the car surface with even pressure. Leaning the sander to one side could cause denting. Slide the sander slowly across the car and let it grind off the paint as you move. If the car has only been painted once, you’ll see the white primer and then bare metal. If there are multiple paint layers, spend more time on each section to strip it away. Some spots may be tougher than others. If the paint won’t come off in one spot, keep the sander there for a few seconds to work the paint off. Replace the sandpaper when it gets too dull. You’ll notice that it doesn’t strip the paint as well after a while. This means it’s time for a new piece of paper. Once you've tackled the larger areas, move on to tight areas like the ones around the doors. These are tougher to reach, so try opening doors and the trunk to get into tight spots. Angle your sander so it fits into these areas. Spread a sheet inside your car to protect the interior from dust and debris. If there are tight areas at angles you can't reach, try using a sand block on these spots instead. After finishing with the 40-grit paper, wipe the car down with a moist rag to remove any dust. Then load finer-grit paper onto the sander. Do another sanding round with 120, 220, and 400-grit paper. Remember to wipe the car down in-between each sanding session. This process removes small sections of oxidation and rust that you can’t see with the naked eye. Leaving these on the car’s surface could damage a new paint layer over time. when you’re done sanding to remove remaining dust. Once you’ve gone through all the sanding steps and the car is down to its bare metal, give the car a good wash. Use water and soap to remove any dirt and debris. Then let the car dry completely. For a faster job, you can also wipe the car down with mineral spirits rather than wash it with soap and water. Once all the paint is off and the car is clean, continue with painting the car. If you’re going to paint the car, apply primer as soon as the car is dry to prevent rusting. What is a summary of what this article is about?","response":"The article provides a comprehensive guide on how to safely and effectively remove paint from a car using electric sanding, in preparation for repainting.

Fact 2: Another form of aggressive behavior is known as territorial aggression. Given the two facts above, answer the question \\"What does aggression cause?\\" with the following options: - ligt - death - harm - damage - force - caring - companionship - peace A:","response":"Aggression causes harm and damage, both physically and emotionally, to other individuals or groups, as well as to the aggressor themselves. This behavior can result in various negative consequences, including injuries, emotional distress, psychological trauma, and, in severe cases, even death. Aggression can manifest in various forms, such as verbal abuse, threats, physical attacks, and territorial aggression, as mentioned in Fact 2. Territorial aggression typically refers to behaviors that are intended to protect an individual or group's territory or perceived boundaries against intruders, which may lead to conflicts and violent encounters. Regardless of its form, aggressive behavior ultimately aims to dominate or control others, and it can lead to long-lasting effects on the mental and physical health of those involved. In some cases, the harm and damage caused by aggression may be irreparable, perpetuating a cycle of violence and suffering. However, it is important to recognize that aggression does not inherently lead to positive outcomes such as caring, companionship, or peace. Though aggression may, at times, be a natural response to certain environmental stimuli or stressors, it is crucial to find healthy and nonviolent methods to resolve conflicts and foster harmonious relationships. In conclusion, aggression predominantly causes harm and damage to individuals and groups involved in the aggressive behavior. These consequences can be both physical and emotional, highlighting the importance of promoting healthy communication and constructive coping mechanisms to mitigate the impacts of aggression on all parties involved."},{"question":"Given the question: Information: - Bordeaux (Gascon Occitan: \\"\\") is a port city on the Garonne River in the Gironde department in southwestern France. - Norfolkline was a European ferry operator and logistics company owned by Maersk.

Keep flipping and turning the bacon so that it browns evenly. Using your tongs, remove the pieces from the pan and onto your paper bag/towels or newspapers to drain.; 2). Start with a cold pan.

Using your hands, remove the pieces from the pan and onto your paper bag/towels or newspapers to drain.;","response":"Cooking bacon in a pan can be a relatively straightforward task, but when done properly, the outcome is a delicious, crispy treat that can be enjoyed in many dishes or by itself. Between the two options provided, I would recommend going with option 1. It is identical to option 2 in the method of cooking, but it suggests using tongs to remove the bacon from the pan instead of your hands – a safer course of action. Here are the detailed steps: 1. Selection of Bacon: First, select the right bacon for your preferences. You could choose thick-cut or thin-cut bacon. This will affect both the cooking time and the end result in terms of crispiness. 2. Preparing the Pan: According to both provided options, you should start with a cold pan. This is because when you place bacon in a hot pan, the fat immediately starts to sizzle and the meat can get cooked unevenly. A cold start allows the fat to slowly heat and render out, providing a layer of grease that will help cook the bacon more evenly. 3. Laying out the Bacon: Lay out your bacon strips on the pan before you turn on the heat. Make sure to arrange them side by side without overlapping because they will shrink, and overlapping might cause them to stick together and cook unevenly. 4. Cooking: Once your bacon is laid out in the pan, turn on the heat to low or medium-low. The reason for this is to cook the bacon low and slow, which minimizes the risk of burning the bacon while allowing the fat to render out and the meat to reach a perfect level of crispiness. 5. Flipping the Bacon: As the bacon starts to heat, it will begin to curl, cook, and release its fat. During cooking, keep flipping and turning the bacon using tongs or a fork every few minutes so that it browns evenly and does not stick to the pan. 6. Draining: You will know the bacon is done once it's a nice golden-brown color and crispy to your liking. Use your tongs to carefully remove each piece from the pan and place them on a paper towel, paper bag, or newspaper layer you've prepared. This step helps to drain the excess fat and makes your bacon less greasy. Remember to always be careful while cooking to avoid any possible burns or injuries. Cooking utensils such as tongs are recommended over using hands for safety reasons. Additionally, the rendered fat left in the pan can be saved in a container and refrigerated to use for cooking other dishes if desired. It can enrich flavor tremendously. Bacon cooked in this manner is not only delicious, but it also provides a sense of accomplishment in achieving perfectly crispy, non-greasy strips. Enjoy your home-cooked bacon!"},{"question":"Q: The speed of a boat in still water is 40kmph and the speed of the current is 20kmph. Find the speed downstream and upstream? Options: (A) 40, 68 kmph (B) 40, 30 kmph (C) 90, 60 kmph (D) 40, 60 kmph (E) 60, 20 kmph Let's give some random thoughts before answering.","response":"In order to solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the speed of the boat in still water, the speed of the current, and the overall speed downstream and upstream. Let's denote: - Vb as the speed of the boat in still water, which is 40 kmph. - Vc as the speed of the current, which is 20 kmph. - Vd as the downstream speed (i.e., the speed of the boat with the current). - Vu as the upstream speed (i.e., the speed of the boat against the current). Now, let's analyze the problem step by step: 1. Downstream speed (Vd): When the boat travels downstream, the currents help it move faster. So, we simply add the speed of the boat (Vb) to the speed of the current (Vc) to find the downstream speed (Vd). Vd = Vb + Vc = 40 + 20 = 60 kmph 2. Upstream speed (Vu): When the boat is traveling upstream, it has to work against the current, so we subtract the speed of the current (Vc) from the speed of the boat (Vb) to find the upstream speed (Vu). Vu = Vb - Vc = 40 - 20 = 20 kmph Based on our calculations, the downstream speed is 60 kmph, and the upstream speed is 20 kmph. Therefore, the correct answer is: (E) 60, 20 kmph"},{"question":"Given the question: Process: - Animals and plants die in soft soil or mud - Sediment builds up over the remains - The remains decompose, leaving only trace amounts - The remaining parts over the years are replaced with mineral - A fossil is formed - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose person is on a diet happens, how will it affect more animals die on muddy soil.

This connection is likely minimal and does not significantly affect the overall process. 2. Sediment builds up over the remains: A person's diet does not have any effect on sediment build-up. This process is independent and is influenced by factors like the natural weathering of rocks and the deposition of particulate matter. 3. The remains decompose, leaving only trace amounts: A person's diet does not have any effect on the decomposition of remains. This process involves the breakdown of organic matter by microorganisms and other natural processes. 4. The remaining parts over the years are replaced with minerals: A person's diet does not have any impact on this step as it is a natural process involving the infiltration of minerals into the remaining parts of the remains. 5. A fossil is formed: A person's diet does not influence the final formation of a fossil. The process of fossilization is dependent on the factors mentioned in the previous steps. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis of a person being on a diet has no direct effect on the process of fossil formation. Any indirect effects would likely be minimal and not significantly impact the overall process. The connection between the person's diet and more animals dying on muddy soil is tenuous and does not substantiate the perturbation hypothesis."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

Article: While your pet fish may appear to be ignorant of your presence, chances are that it knows you extremely well and can probably even identify you from a crowd of human faces! At least, that is the conclusion reached by scientists the University of Oxford in the U.K. and the University of Queensland in Australia, following an extensive study of the archerfish , a species of tropical fish that can be found all the way from India to Indonesia, the Philippines, and Australia. The ability to distinguish between human faces is a complex task. That's because we all have the same basic features -- two eyes sitting above a nose and a mouth. It's only the subtle differences that make humans distinct from one another. Since this requires a combination of both visual sense and memory, researchers had always assumed that _ was a skill possessed only by those with complicated brains, i.e., humans, a few select animals -- such as horses, cows, dogs, monkeys and some birds, like pigeons. To test if this assumption was accurate, a team of scientists led by Dr. Cait Newport, Marie Curie Research Fellow in the Department of Zoology at Oxford University, decided to study fish. The aquatic animals have small brains that lack the neocortex , or neocortex-like structure, believed to help recognize the subtle differences between human facial features. The team began by presenting four archerfish with images of two human faces. Initially, the fish spat randomly at both. However, they soon learned that pouring water at the one selected by the researchers earned them a food treat. After that, they focused primarily on that image. The researchers then took the experiment one step further, by introducing 44 other human faces to the mix. To the researcher's astonishment, the trained archerfish were able to recall the learned image almost 81% of the time. And this accuracy improved to 86% when the researchers made the identification even harder, by replacing the colored photos with a set of black and white images and hiding the shape of the head. Question: In the experiment, the researchers trained the archerfish _ . Options: A: by taking photos of fish B: by improving people's images C: by rewarding them with food D: by covering their heads","response":"In the experiment, the researchers trained the archerfish by rewarding them with food. The correct answer is C: by rewarding them with food."},{"question":"Premise: \\"A gymnast in navy sparkly blue warms up for her routine.\\" Hypothesis: \\"The gymnast is at a competition.\\" Do we know that the hypothesis entailed by the premise? Let's solve step-by-step:","response":"Step 1: Analyze the premise The premise states: \\"A gymnast in navy sparkly blue (uniform) warms up for her routine.\\" From this, we know that there is a gymnast wearing a specific type of uniform who is warming up for a performance. Step 2: Analyze the hypothesis The hypothesis states: \\"The gymnast is at a competition.\\" This suggests that the gymnast is participating in a competitive event with other gymnasts. Step 3: Compare the premise and the hypothesis The premise gives us information about a gymnast's attire and her pre-performance activity. It does not explicitly mention a competition or other competing gymnasts. Step 4: Determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise While it is possible that the gymnast is at a competition based on the premise, we cannot definitively conclude that from the information given. It could also be a practice session, an exhibition, or a training event.

Both the following solutions offer safe and efficient methods, and by examining their advantages and drawbacks, we can determine the better option: Solution 1: Manual harvesting with a sharp knife and gloves 1. Advantages: a. No need for specialized equipment; only a sharp knife and gloves are required. b. Direct control over the process, ensuring minimal damage to the rest of the plant. c. Suitable for home gardeners and small-scale operations. d. Environmentally friendly as no power tools are used. 2. Drawbacks: a. Time-consuming, especially for larger Yucca plants or multiple harvests. b. Physically demanding as it requires precise cutting and potential bending or reaching. c. Risk of injury if proper care is not taken with the sharp knife. Solution 2: Using specialized hand pruners or shears 1. Advantages: a. Designed specifically for cutting leaves or stems, providing a clean and accurate cut. b. Less physically demanding as the pruners/shears provide leverage for the cutting process. c. Suitable for home gardeners and small-scale operations. d. Faster process compared to using a simple knife. 2. Drawbacks: a. Cost of purchasing specialized hand pruners or shears. b. Potential for causing damage to the plant if not used correctly or if pruners/shears are dull. c. Still requires manual labour and time investment, although typically less than with a knife. Both solutions can effectively harvest leaves off a Yucca plant. However, the better solution should address the key concerns of efficiency, ease of use, and minimal damage to the plant. Based on the advantages and drawbacks, Solution 2 (using specialized hand pruners or shears) emerges as the better option. Using specialized hand pruners or shears offers a faster and less physically demanding process compared to manually cutting the leaves with a knife. This method is particularly advantageous when dealing with multiple plants or larger specimens. The specialized pruners/shears are designed specifically for this type of task and provide clean and accurate cuts, further minimizing the risk of causing unnecessary harm to the plant. While Solution 2 does involve some investment in purchasing the right tools, this cost is typically justified by the improved harvesting process and higher overall efficacy. However, it is crucial to ensure that the pruners or shears are well-maintained and used correctly and that the users are familiar with the proper techniques to minimize damage to the Yucca plant while harvesting its leaves."},{"question":"Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: Who re-enacts a famous scene from Bande à part? Matthew is an American exchange student who has come to Paris to study French.

After dinner with their parents, Théo and Isabelle offer Matthew the chance to stay with them while their parents are on a trip. Matthew accepts, considering them his first French friends. Matthew becomes suspicious of their relationship after seeing them sleeping nude together; he soon discovers that they accept nudity and sexuality liberally. After Théo loses at a trivia game, Isabelle sentences him to masturbate to a Marlene Dietrich poster in front of them. After Matthew loses at another game, he is seduced to take Isabelle's virginity.

Thread turnbuckles through 2-3 pairs of suction cups. Stick each pair of suction cups on either side of the granite seam.\\"","response":"The Art of Granite Installation: Seamlessly Uniting Two Pieces for a Sleek Finish Granite countertops are renowned for their durability, aesthetic appeal, and easy maintenance. Natural stones like granite are known for their unique appearance, making them a popular and sought-after choice for kitchens and bathrooms. The beauty of these stones lies not only in their individual patterns and hues but also in how well they are installed, leaving a seamless connection between the pieces. The process requires precision, patience, and skillful techniques. In this article, we will explore one such technique that professionals use to achieve a beautifully joined granite seam: connecting two granite pieces using turnbuckles and suction cups. # Before You Begin Carefully plan and prepare for the granite installation. It is wise to entrust the task to skilled professionals as it involves precise measurements and handling of heavy materials. Granite countertops are custom made, ensuring that they match perfectly with the existing room dimensions and the desired design. Consult with your granite fabricator for expert guidance, who will take detailed measurements before procuring the granite. # Step-by-Step Guide to Connecting Two Granite Pieces using Turnbuckles and Suction Cups Follow these steps to seamlessly unite two pieces of granite for polished and well-connected countertops: 1. **Prepare the workspace**: Clean the area where the granite countertops will be installed, ensuring that there is no dirt or debris that might hinder the installation process. It is necessary to have a flat and stable surface, such as plywood, for the granite to rest upon. 2. **Clean the granite**: Use a lint-free cloth and stone cleaner to remove any dust or dirt from the granite pieces. This ensures that the suction cups stick securely to the granite surfaces and promotes proper adherence of the epoxy during installation. 3. **Position the granite pieces**: Neatly lay the two pieces of granite side-by-side, aligning the edges to make sure they match perfectly. Pay attention to the seam, ensuring that it appears straight and follows the flow of the granite pattern. 4. **Thread turnbuckles through suction cups**: Prepare 2-3 pairs of suction cups with attached turnbuckles (metal devices used for tightening or loosening ropes). Turnbuckles usually consist of a threaded loop attached to two hooks. Thread the turnbuckles through the suction cups so that they can be used to hold and adjust the granite pieces during the seam connection process. 5. **Attach suction cups to granite**: Stick one of each suction cup pair on either side of the granite seam, directly opposite each other. Ensure that the turnbuckles are properly connected so that they can pull the granite pieces together. 6. **Apply epoxy**: Apply a color-matched epoxy along the seam to connect the two granite pieces. Ensure that the epoxy completely fills the seam, starting from the center and working your way outward. The epoxy should match the color and pattern of your granite, creating a seamless appearance when cured. 7. **Tighten the turnbuckles**: Use the turnbuckles to pull the granite pieces together, tightening the seam and allowing the epoxy to settle properly. Adjust the turnbuckles to ensure that the granite surfaces are flush with each other. 8. **Remove excess epoxy**: Once the epoxy is sufficiently cured, remove any excess using a razor blade or putty knife. Be careful not to create any scratches or marks on the granite surface. 9. **Perform a final inspection**: Inspect the seam to ensure that it is smooth, flush, and matches your granite's original pattern. Check the surrounding areas as well, making sure that no damage has occurred during the installation process. 10. **Seal the granite**: Apply a high-quality stone sealer to the granite countertop, following the manufacturer's instructions. This step helps protect the granite from stains and ensures the longevity of your beautiful countertop. In conclusion, uniting two pieces of granite using turnbuckles and suction cups is an effective, professional technique to attain a sleek, seamless finish for your granite countertops. With careful planning, measurement, and execution, you can achieve a beautifully connected granite surface that will stand the test of time and add style and value to your home."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who tries to seduce Helen? from the following article ?

Options: - Sentence A: \\"music can destroy human's body\\" - Sentence B: \\"music can awake human's emotion\\" Hmmm, let me think. I want to lay out the solution in details.","response":"Among the given options, Sentence A: \\"music can destroy human's body\\" is the nonsensical sentence. Explanation: Sentence B: \\"music can awake human's emotion\\" is a valid and meaningful statement because music is known to evoke emotions in humans. It can provoke feelings of happiness, sadness, nostalgia, and excitement, among others. Scientifically, music has been known to stimulate the release of hormones such as dopamine and serotonin, which are related to emotional responses. On the other hand, Sentence A: \\"music can destroy human's body\\" is nonsensical because there is no evidence or logical reasoning that supports music having physically destructive effects on the human body. Music may influence moods, behaviors, or emotions, but it cannot literally destroy human body tissue or organs. However, it is important to note that exposure to excessively loud music or sounds over a prolonged period can have adverse effects on a person's hearing, but that still does not equate to music destroying the human body."},{"question":"Premise: Subject to the provisions of section 417, the Administrator shall allocate allowances for each affected unit at an affected source annually, as provided in paragraphs Hypothesis: The Administrator has no power to allocate allowances.

Explanation: The premise states that the Administrator is responsible for allocating allowances for each affected unit at an affected source annually, subject to the provisions of section 417. The provisions mentioned in section 417 are not defined in the given context, but it can be assumed that these provisions give guiding principles, limitations, or conditions for the allocation of allowances. On the other hand, the hypothesis asserts that the Administrator has no power to allocate allowances. This hypothesis directly contradicts the premise, as the premise explicitly outlines the Administrator's responsibility in allocating allowances, albeit subject to certain provisions. The presence of section 417 provisions does not negate the Administrator's power to allocate allowances; it just implies that the power must be exercised according to the specified provisions. Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. While both statements address the role of the Administrator in allocating allowances, the premise assigns this role to the Administrator with certain conditions, while the hypothesis denies the Administrator's authority altogether.

By its nature as a mystery religion reserved for the initiated, many aspects of the Dionysian cult remain unknown and were lost with the decline of Greco-Roman polytheism; modern knowledge is derived from descriptions, imagery and cross-cultural studies. - Ancient Greek includes the forms of Greek used in ancient Greece and the ancient world from around the 9th century BC to the 6th century AD. It is often roughly divided into the Archaic period (9th to 6th centuries BC), Classical period (5th and 4th centuries BC), and Hellenistic period (3rd century BC to the 6th century AD). It is antedated in the second millennium BC by Mycenaean Greek. - Plato ( also Plato Comicus ; Ancient Greek : ) was an Athenian comic poet and contemporary of Aristophanes . None of his plays survive intact , but the titles of thirty of them are known , including a Hyperbolus ( c. 420 - 416 BC ) , Victories ( after 421 ) , Cleophon ( in 405 ) , and Phaon ( probably in 391 ) . The titles suggest that his themes were often political . In 410 BC , one of his plays took first prize at the City Dionysia . Phaon included a scene ( quoted in the Deipnosophistae of Athenaeus ) in which a character sits down to study a poem about gastronomy ( in fact mostly about aphrodisiacs ) and reads some of it aloud . The poem is in hexameters , and therefore sounds like a lampoon of the work of Archestratus , although the speaker calls it \`\` a book by Philoxenus '' , meaning either the poet Philoxenus of Cythera , the glutton Philoxenus of Leucas , or both indiscriminately . - In Ancient Greece, a deme or demos was a suburb of Athens or a subdivision of Attica, the region of Greece surrounding Athens. Demes as simple subdivisions of land in the countryside seem to have existed in the 6th century BC and earlier, but did not acquire particular significance until the reforms of Cleisthenes in 508 BC. In those reforms, enrollment in the citizen-lists of a deme became the requirement for citizenship; prior to that time, citizenship had been based on membership in a phratry, or family group. At this same time, demes were established in the city of Athens itself, where they had not previously existed; in all, at the end of Cleisthenes' reforms, Attica was divided into 139 demes to which one should add Berenikidai, established in 224/223 BC, Apollonieis (201/200 BC) and Antinoeis (126/127). The establishment of demes as the fundamental units of the state weakened the gene, or aristocratic family groups, that had dominated the phratries. - Ancient Greece was a civilization belonging to a period of Greek history from the Greek Dark Ages of the 12th-9th centuries BC to the end of antiquity (AD). Immediately following this period was the beginning of the Early Middle Ages and the Byzantine era. Roughly three centuries after the Late Bronze Age collapse of Mycenaean Greece, Greek urban poleis began to form in the 8th century BC, ushering in the period of Archaic Greece and colonization of the Mediterranean Basin. This was followed by the period of Classical Greece, an era that began with the Greco-Persian Wars, lasting from the 5th to 4th centuries BC. Due to the conquests by Alexander the Great of Macedonia, Hellenistic civilization flourished from Central Asia to the western end of the Mediterranean Sea. The Hellenistic period came to an end with the conquests and annexations of the eastern Mediterranean world by the Roman Republic, which established the Roman province of Macedonia in Roman Greece, and later the province of Achaea during the Roman Empire. - Mycenaean Greek is the most ancient attested form of the Greek language, on the Greek mainland, Crete and Cyprus in Mycenaean Greece (16th to 12th centuries BCE), before the hypothesised Dorian invasion, often cited as the \\"terminus post quem\\" for the coming of the Greek language to Greece. The language is preserved in inscriptions in Linear B, a script first attested on Crete before the 14th century. Most inscriptions are on clay tablets found in Knossos, in central Crete, as well as in Pylos, in the southwest of the Peloponnese. Other tablets have been found at Mycenae itself, Tiryns and Thebes and at Chania, in Western Crete. The language is named after Mycenae, one of the major centres of Mycenaean Greece. - The Hellenistic period covers the period of ancient Greek (Hellenic) history and Mediterranean history between the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC and the emergence of the Roman Empire as signified by the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the subsequent conquest of Ptolemaic Egypt the following year. At this time, Greek cultural influence and power was at its peak in Europe, Africa and Asia, experiencing prosperity and progress in the arts, exploration, literature, theatre, architecture, music, mathematics, philosophy, and science. It is often considered a period of transition, sometimes even of decadence or degeneration, compared to the enlightenment of the Greek Classical era. The Hellenistic period saw the rise of New Comedy, Alexandrian poetry, the Septuagint and the philosophies of Stoicism and Epicureanism. Greek Science was advanced by the works of the mathematician Euclid and the polymath Archimedes. The religious sphere expanded to include new gods such as the Greco-Egyptian Serapis, eastern deities such as Attis and Cybele and the Greek adoption of Buddhism. - The Dionysia was a large festival in ancient Athens in honor of the god Dionysus, the central events of which were the theatrical performances of dramatic tragedies and, from 487 BC, comedies. It was the second-most important festival after the Panathenaia. The Dionysia actually consisted of two related festivals, the Rural Dionysia and the City Dionysia, which took place in different parts of the year. They were also an essential part of the Dionysian Mysteries. - The Peloponnesian War (431404 BC) was an ancient Greek war fought by Athens and its empire against the Peloponnesian League led by Sparta. Historians have traditionally divided the war into three phases. In the first phase, the Archidamian War, Sparta launched repeated invasions of Attica, while Athens took advantage of its naval supremacy to raid the coast of the Peloponnese and attempt to suppress signs of unrest in its empire. This period of the war was concluded in 421 BC, with the signing of the Peace of Nicias. That treaty, however, was soon undermined by renewed fighting in the Peloponnese. In 415 BC, Athens dispatched a massive expeditionary force to attack Syracuse in Sicily; the attack failed disastrously, with the destruction of the entire force, in 413 BC. This ushered in the final phase of the war, generally referred to either as the Decelean War, or the Ionian War. In this phase, Sparta, now receiving support from Persia, supported rebellions in Athens' subject states in the Aegean Sea and Ionia, undermining Athens' empire, and, eventually, depriving the city of naval supremacy. The destruction of Athens' fleet at Aegospotami effectively ended the war, and Athens surrendered in the following year. Corinth and Thebes demanded that Athens should be destroyed and all its citizens should be enslaved, but Sparta refused. - Aristophanes (or ; c. 446 c. 386 BC), son of Philippus, of the deme Kydathenaion, was a comic playwright of ancient Athens. Eleven of his forty plays survive virtually complete. These, together with fragments of some of his other plays, provide the only real examples of a genre of comic drama known as Old Comedy, and are used to define it. - Greece (' ), officially the Hellenic Republic (Greek: ' ), historically also known as Hellas (\\"\\" ), is a country in southeastern Europe. Greece's population is approximately 10.955 million as of 2015. Athens is the nation's capital and largest city, followed by Thessaloniki. - Hyperbolus (\\"Hyperbolos\\") was an Athenian politician active during the first half of the Peloponnesian war, coming to particular prominence after the death of Cleon. - Athens (\\"Athína\\" ) is the capital and largest city of Greece. Athens dominates the Attica region and is one of the world's oldest cities, with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years, and its earliest human presence starting somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennia BC. Classical Athens was a powerful city-state that emerged in conjunction with the seagoing development of the port of Piraeus, which had been a distinct city prior to its 5th century BC incorporation with Athens. A centre for the arts, learning and philosophy, home of Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum, it is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy, largely because of its cultural and political impact on the European continent, and in particular the Romans. In modern times, Athens is a large cosmopolitan metropolis and central to economic, financial, industrial, maritime, political and cultural life in Greece. In 2015, Athens was ranked the world's 29th richest city by purchasing power and the 67th most expensive in a UBS study. - Old Comedy (\\"archaia\\") is the first period of the ancient Greek comedy, according to the canonical division by the Alexandrian grammarians. The most important Old Comic playwright is Aristophanes whose works, with their daring political commentary and abundance of sexual innuendo, effectively define the genre today. Aristophanes satirized and lampooned the most prominent personalities and institutions of his time, as can be seen, for example, in his scurrilous portrayal of Socrates in \\"The Clouds\\", and in his racy anti-war farce \\"Lysistrata\\". Aristophanes was only one of a large number of comic poets, however, working in Athens in the late 5th century BC; his biggest rivals were Hermippus and Eupolis. - Dionysus (\\"Dionysos\\") is the god of the grape harvest, winemaking and wine, of ritual madness, fertility, theatre and religious ecstasy in ancient Greek religion and myth. Wine played an important role in Greek culture, and the cult of Dionysus was the main religious focus for its unrestrained consumption. He may have been worshipped as early as c. 15001100 BC by Mycenean Greeks; traces of Dionysian-type cult have also been found in ancient Minoan Crete. His origins are uncertain, and his cults took many forms; some are described by ancient sources as Thracian, others as Greek. In some cults, he arrives from the east, as an Asiatic foreigner; in others, from Ethiopia in the South. He is a god of epiphany, \\"the god that comes\\", and his \\"foreignness\\" as an arriving outsider-god may be inherent and essential to his cults. He is a major, popular figure of Greek mythology and religion, becoming increasingly important over time, and included in some lists of the twelve Olympians, as the last of their number, and the only god born from a mortal mother. His festivals were the driving force behind the development of Greek theatre.

Could you help me answer this question? If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\". Plot title: The Negotiator Movie plot: Lieutenant Danny Roman (Jackson) is a top police hostage negotiator. When he cannot talk a hostage-taker into surrendering, he offers himself as an additional hostage and lures the subject into a position where he can be taken down with the minimum use of force, rather than an all-out assault.Roman is middle-aged and recently married. While celebrating his most recent success, he is approached by his colleague Nathan 'Nate' Roenick (Guilfoyle) who warns him that large sums of money are being embezzled from the Chicago Police Department's disability fund of which Roman is on the board. Roenick has an informant with whom he was at the Police Academy and served with for a while, but refuses to name him. Later that evening, Roman is summoned via his pager for another meeting with Roenick but instead finds him dead by gunshot wounds.The case goes badly for Roman when it is assigned to Inspector Niebaum (Walsh) of the Internal Affairs Division (IAD) whom Roenick claimed was part of the embezzling. Furthermore the gun used to kill Roenick was one of three that were part of a case Roman handled in the past: two were recovered but not the third. Documents found in Roman's house indicate that the money has gone to an offshore account of which he denies any knowledge.Facing serious charges, suspended from the force and rejected by his friends, including Roenick's widow, a frustrated Roman storms into Niebaum's office and, in the chaos that follows, takes him and several others hostage, including his personal assistant Maggie (Fallon), police Commander Grant Frost (Rifkin) and two-bit con-man Rudy Timmons (Giamatti).With the building evacuated and placed under siege by police and FBI, Roman issues his conditions which include finding Roenick's informant and summoning police Lieutenant Chris Sabian (Spacey), another top negotiator.

Article: Is it necessary for a young man to have an apartment as a prerequisite for marriage? Housing has become a major obstacle for Chinese young men hoping to start a family. China may breed a new group of bachelors, men caught in the trap of unaffordable houses. Since early 2009, the housing market has once again become a hot pot at boiling point. Even with allowance and special government policies, home prices in China's first-tier cities such as Beijing and Shanghai are riding the crest of a rising wave. According to the \\"2010 China Marital Status Report\\" released on Dec 15, 2010, about 70 percent of women interviewed said that housing, a stable income and some savings were the main requirements for marriage. From the report, we can see that housing is given top priority and that women see an apartment as essential to show that the man is responsible and can provide for his family. Personality and morals lay outside the top three matrimonial requirements. Some women and their families hold the traditional position and take it for granted that the home issue should be the man's responsibility, which doesn't agree with the contemporary independent spirit of women and gender equality. These marriage values reflect the fact that many women consider marriage another form of \\"social welfare\\". Things may be different overseas. Social housing, provided by European authorities, offer the less wealthy people their own piece of real estate. Such housing is usually apartments in tall buildings with 10 or more floors on the _ of town, whose main advantage is the low rents. For many Americans, houses don't pose an obstacle to getting married. They often buy a house after the wedding, because more and more people are reconsidering their real estate worship, and going back to a more rational mode of consumption.

Answer: Oklahoma, also known as the Sooner State, boasts a rich history encompassing various historical events, landmarks, and cultural aspects that have influenced and shaped the state over the years. 1. Native American history: Oklahoma was originally inhabited by several Native American tribes such as the Caddo, Wichita, and Osage. Later in the 1800s, it became a resettlement location for numerous additional tribes due to the Indian Removal Act. The influence of Native American culture is still evident today through continued tribal presence, museums, and cultural centers across the state. 2. Land Run of 1889: The land run marked the opening of the Unassigned Lands in then-Indian Territory to non-Native American settlement. This event led to the nickname \\"Sooner State,\\" as some settlers entered the territory before the official start time, becoming known as \\"Sooners.\\" The land run established numerous settlements in the area and led to the rapid growth of Oklahoma City. 3. Statehood: Oklahoma became the 46th state to join the Union on November 16, 1907. This milestone instilled a sense of pride for state residents and bound them together under a common identity. 4. The Dust Bowl: In the 1930s, severe drought, poor agricultural practices, and economic depression contributed to Oklahoma's Dust Bowl, resulting in devastating dust storms and widespread impoverishment. This event significantly impacted the state's population and economy, prompting many to leave the state. The Dust Bowl has influenced Oklahoma's emphasis on agricultural research, water conservation, and responsible land management. 5. Tulsa Race Massacre: In 1921, racial tensions erupted in the Greenwood District of Tulsa, leading to a tragic and devastating attack on the thriving African-American community. The massacre resulted in the deaths of hundreds of African Americans and the destruction of the affluent area known as \\"Black Wall Street.\\" This remains a significant event in Oklahoma's history, influencing racial relations and discussions on racial equity to this day. 6. Oil boom and industry: Oklahoma experienced significant economic growth in the early 20th century due to the discovery of oil. The oil boom led to the establishment of several oil companies and supported the development of cities like Tulsa and Oklahoma City. Although the oil industry has experienced fluctuations, it remains an essential part of Oklahoma's economy and identity. 7. Route 66: This iconic U.S. highway runs through the heart of Oklahoma, with numerous attractions, museums, and distinctive landmarks along the way. Route 66 has contributed to the state's tourism industry and continues to provide a nostalgic journey through American history. 8. Folk music and culture: Oklahoma has a deeply rooted folk culture, reflected in traditional musical styles and performers, such as Woody Guthrie and his songs of social activism. The state's folk music legacy is celebrated through various festivals, museums, and music venues. These historical events, landmarks, and cultural aspects have influenced Oklahoma's development, character, and identity. Through their continued preservation, they provide a glimpse into the past while contributing to the state's present-day cultural richness and diversity."},{"question":"Come up with a question and reasoning that would justify this answer: 3500","response":"Question: What is the total weight, in pounds, of 100 cats if each cat weighs an average of 35 pounds?

The Falcons are now coached by Michael Huger, their 17th head coach. Hypothesis: The NCAA has a championship tournament for every sport","response":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, we cannot determine if the hypothesis that the NCAA has a championship tournament for every sport is true or not. The paragraph only mentions the Bowling Green Falcons men's basketball team and their participation in the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament in 1968. It does not provide information about other sports or their respective tournaments. To address the hypothesis, we would need to research further into the NCAA organization and their structure for organizing championship tournaments across various sports. The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) is a prominent organization in the United States that oversees athletic programs for various colleges and universities, encompassing several sports. The NCAA is divided into three divisions: Division I, Division II, and Division III. Upon further investigation, we can find that the NCAA does indeed host championship tournaments for a wide range of sports, including but not limited to basketball, football, baseball, soccer, ice hockey, track and field, and volleyball. These championships are organized across the three NCAA divisions and cater to both men's and women's sports teams. However, it is essential to note that not every sport or athletic event that may exist at collegiate level has an NCAA championship tournament. For example, certain sports like rugby or rowing have limited participation or, at times, are governed by other organizing bodies, such as the Collegiate Rugby Championship for rugby or the Intercollegiate Rowing Association for rowing. In some instances, the NCAA might only have a championship for a specific sport in one or two of its divisions (e.g., Division I and II but not in Division III). In conclusion, while the NCAA does indeed host championship tournaments for numerous sports, it does not cover every possible sport played at the collegiate level. The hypothesis as stated, is not completely true. It would be more accurate to say that the NCAA hosts championships for a vast range of sports but not necessarily every sport."},{"question":"Translate from English to Spanish: Member Country: one of the Member Countries of the Cartagena Agreement.","response":"País miembro: uno de los países miembros del Acuerdo de Cartagena."},{"question":"Question: - clubs is ofk fk brodarac beograd hajduk beograd javor ivanjica alania vladikavkaz kitchee - caps is 30 20 - position is central defender - currentclub is fk brodarac - height is 1.83 m ftin 0 on - years is 1999 2005 -- 2009 2009 -- present -- 2001 2001 -- 2003 2003 -- 2004 - ntupdate is october 23 , 2009 - pcupdate is october 23 , 2009 - birth date is 23 july 1975 - fullname is ivan jević - birth place is belgrade , sfr yugoslavia - goals is 5 0 Given the details above, guess who could this information be about.

Movie title: Once Upon a Time in the West Movie plot: The film portrays two conflicts that take place around Flagstone, a fictional town in the American Old West: a land battle related to construction of a railroad, and a mission of vengeance against a cold-blooded killer. A struggle exists for Sweetwater, a piece of land near Flagstone containing the region's only water source. The land was bought by Brett McBain (Frank Wolff), who foresaw that the railroad would have to pass through that area to provide water for the steam locomotives. When crippled railroad tycoon Morton (Gabriele Ferzetti) learns of this, he sends his hired gun Frank (Henry Fonda) to intimidate McBain to move off the land, but Frank instead kills McBain and his three children, planting evidence to frame the bandit Cheyenne (Jason Robards). It appears the land has no owner; however, a former prostitute (Claudia Cardinale) arrives from New Orleans, revealing she is Jill McBain, Brett's new wife and the owner of the land. Meanwhile, a mysterious harmonica-playing gunman (Charles Bronson), whom Cheyenne later dubs \\"Harmonica\\", pursues Frank. In the film's opening scene, Harmonica kills three men sent by Frank to kill him. In a roadhouse on the way to Sweetwater, he informs Cheyenne that the three gunfighters appeared to be posing as Cheyenne's men. Back at Sweetwater, construction materials are delivered to build a railroad station and a small town. Harmonica explains that Jill will lose Sweetwater unless the station is built by the time the track's construction crews reach that point, so Cheyenne puts his men to work building it. Frank turns against Morton, who wanted to make a deal with Jill; Morton's disability makes him unable to fight back. After raping Jill, Frank forces her to sell the property in an auction. He tries to buy the farm cheaply by intimidating the other bidders, but Harmonica arrives, holding Cheyenne at gunpoint, and makes a much higher bid based on his reward money for delivering Cheyenne to the authorities.

Construct a question in such a way that (i) it is unambiguous, (ii) it is answerable from the passage, (iii) its answer is unique (iv) its answer is a continuous text span from the paragraph. Avoid creating questions that (i) can be answered correctly without actually understanding the paragraph and (ii) uses same words or phrases given in the passage. Input: British colonial rule introduced Western elements of culture to Burma. Burma's education system is modelled after that of the United Kingdom. Colonial architectural influences are most evident in major cities such as Yangon. Many ethnic minorities, particularly the Karen in the southeast and the Kachin and Chin who populate the north and northeast, practice Christianity. According to the The World Factbook, the Burman population is 68% and the ethnic groups constitute 32%. However, the exiled leaders and organisations claims that ethnic population is 40%, which is implicitly contrasted with CIA report (official US report). Output:","response":"Part #1: Reading the given passage and construct a question. Usage: Read the passage about British colonial rule in Burma and its effects on the country's culture, and formulate a related question. The question example for this part would be: \\"What elements of British culture were introduced to Burma during colonial rule?\\" This meets the criteria as it considers the information from the passage to create a relevant question. Part #2: Ensure the question is unambiguous. Usage: Make sure that the question is clear and easy to understand. An example of an unambiguous question would be, \\"What educational system is Burma's system modeled after?\\" This meets the criteria because it is specific and straightforward, making it easy to grasp and answer. Part #3: The question must be answerable from the passage. Usage: The question should be directly answerable from the given passage. An example question for this part would be, \\"What is the percentage of the Burman population in Burma according to The World Factbook?\\" This meets the criteria since the passage provides this information, which is 68%. Part #4: The answer to the question should be unique. Usage: Form a question that has only one possible answer based on the passage. For instance, \\"Which ethnic minorities in Burma practice Christianity?\\" This meets the criteria as the passage provides a unique answer: the Karen, the Kachin, and the Chin populations. Part #5: The answer to the question should be a continuous text span from the paragraph. Usage: Make sure that the answer to the question can be taken directly from a single, continuous text span in the paragraph. For example, with the question, \\"In which cities are colonial architectural influences most evident?\\", the answer \\"major cities such as Yangon\\" meets the criteria since it is taken directly from a continuous text span in the passage. Part #6: Avoid creating questions that can be answered without understanding the paragraph. Usage: The question should require an understanding of the passage to be answered correctly. An example that meets this criteria would be, \\"What do the exiled leaders and organizations claim about the ethnic population percentage in Burma?\\" This requires understanding the passage to give the specific answer of \\"40%,\\" which contrasts with the CIA report. Part #7: Avoid using the same words or phrases from the passage in the question. Usage: Create questions without directly copy-pasting words or phrases from the passage. A sample question meeting this criterion would be, \\"What is the ratio of the Burman population to the ethnic groups in Burma according to an official US report?\\" Here, the question is rephrased without using the exact wording from the passage, while still retaining the same meaning."},{"question":"Sentence: \\"Michelle kept the papers over the desk.\\" Would a linguist rate this sentence to be acceptable linguistically?

Ben walked along the street and found the end of a length of string. He picked it up and pulled on it. More string came but not the end. Ben followed the string to see where it went.","response":"As Ben continued to pull on the string, he began to notice that it was unraveling from a tightly wound spool that had been left by the side of the road. This piqued his curiosity even further, and he decided to see how long the string actually was. Step by step, he followed the path the string led him on, wondering who could have left such an intriguing breadcrumb trail for him to find. As he walked, the scenery around him began to change. The familiar buildings and homes that lined the streets of his neighborhood gradually gave way to more rustic, less populated areas. Ben started to feel a sense of adventure as he journeyed deeper into a part of town he had never explored before. Every time he stumbled upon another spool, Ben's heart raced with anticipation. He wondered if there was a meaning behind the string and who could be leading him on this chase. He felt a mix of excitement and apprehension, but he made a mental note of his steps and continued on. After a while, the string led Ben off the paved road and into a wooded area. The sun had begun to set, casting an orange glow on the trees and making the shadows dance. The mysterious string seemed to beckon him deeper into the woods' embrace, and Ben couldn't resist the call. With the light fading fast, Ben decided he needed to make a makeshift marker to help him find his way back. He tied the loose end of the string to a sturdy branch and then continued onward. He felt reassured that he would find his way back home after he discovered the secret of the string. Finally, after what felt like hours, Ben arrived at a small clearing. In the center of the clearing stood a large, ancient-looking oak tree. As he approached the tree, he noticed that the string was wrapped around it multiple times, creating a tangled, beautiful, web-like pattern. He allowed himself a moment to absorb the scene before him. It was as if the string was inviting him to solve a puzzle — one that only he was meant to unravel. Ben took a deep breath, feeling a sudden surge of courage and determination. He started untangling the string from the mighty oak, focusing on each knot and twist as he deliberately undid the intricate pattern. As Ben worked, he reasoned that someone must have left the string as a clue or a challenge, and he was set on discovering its purpose. In the process, he discovered something about himself as well: his own curiosity, persistence, and creativity. No matter the outcome, he knew that this strange journey had led him to find hidden strengths within himself. Finally, Ben loosened the last knot and found a small, hand-carved wooden box secured within the tangle. Gently, he opened it and discovered a note inside. The note read, \\"Congratulations on finding your way, brave traveler. Within you lies the spirit of adventure that many lack. The string led you here, but your determination and courage were the keys to unlock this treasure. Cherish this gift and always remember the day you chose to follow the string.\\" Attached to the note was a small, antique key, the symbol of a journey well-traveled. Ben smiled as he closed the box, feeling an overwhelming sense of accomplishment and pride. He knew that he would never forget this day and the lessons he learned. With newfound confidence, he retraced his steps with the help of the string, eager to share his story and treasure with his friends and family."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: You are given a statement written in Panjabi.

Reeps One, whose real name is Harry Yeff, is famous for his unique ability to create bass music using his vocal chords. The artist believes the key to his success is moving away from the hip-hop style that is historically associated with beatboxers, and instead towards electronic music such as grime, dubstep and drum and bass. Scroll down for video. Reeps One, whose real name is Harry Yeff, is famous for his unique ability to create bass music using his vocal chords. 'The electronic influence as a whole completed defined the way I beatbox,' he said. 'When I started doing that publicly, started not thinking about other beatboxers, not even other musicians, but what resonates with me, it really affected the entire world community.' 'I'm so honoured when people tell me \\"you're the reason I started beatboxing\\"'. After winning the UK Beatbox Championships twice in a row, Yeff moved on to touring the world, taking the place of DJs to perform high energy, hour long sets in night clubs using just his voice. Reeps One judging at the American Beatbox Championships last month in New York where he also performed. Reeps One has now recorded a documentary with Sofar Sounds, a revolutionary music organisation who set up secretive gigs in people's homes. 'I'm so honoured when people tell me \\"you're the reason I started beatboxing'\\"he said. Last month he flew to New York to judge the American Beatbox Championships alongside American actor and beatboxer Michael Winslow. Yeff also took up a residency at famous celebrity haunt, The Box, and recorded a documentary with Sofar Sounds, a revolutionary music organisation who set up secretive gigs in people's homes. 'For some reason I seem to have had a massive influence on the American community, and I've felt that in my time here so much,' he said. Yeff also took the chance to challenge New York's famous chess hustlers - who play for cash in the city's Union Square - showcasing another of his talents, honed competing in chess tournaments as a teenager. He said: 'It's the one place where you really see the semi-ghetto vibe mixing with intellectual prowess. 'I used to turn up to chess tournaments with my flat caps and tracksuits and that energy has always really appealed to me.

Cerebellum activation in Reeps One (yellow) compared to a novice (pink). Neurologists compared their brains as they beatboxed. Yeff mostly used two brain areas while the novice used many more brain areas, suggesting a need to plan each sound and a lack of automatic processing. 'To go and win a few games and hustle the chess hustlers a little bit, was something to tick off the life 'to-do' list.' So impressive are his skills, scientists at University College London asked him to have a brain scan as part of a study to find out how someone's mind changes when they become an expert. Neurologists compared the brain activity of Yeff with a novice, while they both beatboxed. Yeff mostly used two brain areas, including the cerebellum - responsible for learning complicated movements. The novice used many more brain areas, suggesting a need to plan each sound and a lack of automatic processing. Yeff can feel this natural automation as he performs, 'When I was on a project with a group of soloist musicians, a number of them said to me \\"When we play our instrument it's an extension, but your voice is completely close to your mind\\" and this is true. 'That's what makes my performance, I think, so connecting and engaging. It's not a mechanical block, it's shifting and changing and skewing all the time dependent on the reaction of the audience.'

Sun poisoning symptoms usually go away on their own within 7-10 days, but the best method of defense is to avoid getting sun poisoning to begin with and actively protect yourself from the sun’s damaging rays. UV rays are at their most intense between 10AM and 4PM, so trying to avoid the sun through these hours will be especially important. Dermatologists recommend using “broad-spectrum” sunscreens of at least SPF 30. Broad-spectrum sunscreens block out both UVA and UVB rays. Make sure you apply it at least 15-30 minutes prior to sun exposure. A sunburn can occur after spending only 15 minutes in the sun, so applying sunscreen before going outside into the sun is especially important when being proactive with your sun protection. These white spots are not completely fixable, as the pigment is gone from the skin. Your best plan of action is to prevent the light spots from spreading, which means protecting your skin before more sun exposure. This includes things like hats and sunglasses. The more skin you have covered, the less likely you are to expose yourself to the sun’s harmful rays. You might not know it, but the sun can be very damaging to your eyes. Around 20% of all cases of cataracts can be directly related to UV exposure and damage. The sun can also cause macular degeneration, which is one of the foremost causes of blindness in the US. If you are taking any medications, you will want to check out the literature that came along with them from the pharmacy. Some drugs are known to cause further sensitivity to UVA/UVB rays, which could put you at more risk for sun poisoning if you don’t protect your skin. Some of these medications include some types of antidepressants, some antibiotics, some acne medications, and even some diuretics. These are only a few examples, so be sure to check yours specifically. If you no longer have the literature that came along with your prescriptions and medications, ask your doctor or pharmacist. Summary:","response":"To prevent sun poisoning and protect yourself from harmful UV rays, follow these steps: 1. Avoid sun exposure between 10AM and 4PM, when UV rays are most intense. 2. Use broad-spectrum sunscreen with at least SPF 30, which blocks both UVA and UVB rays. Apply it 15-30 minutes before sun exposure. 3. Cover your skin with hats, sunglasses, and clothing to minimize sun exposure. 4. Protect your eyes from sun damage by wearing sunglasses that block UV rays, as they can contribute to cataracts and macular degeneration. 5.

Science/Tech"},{"question":"In the early 1980s complaints about violence and gore in films such as Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom and Gremlins, both of which received PG ratings, refocused attention on films seen by small children and pre-teens. According to author Filipa Antunes, this revealed the conundrum of a film which \\"could not be recommended for all children but also could not be repudiated for all children uniformly,\\" leading to speculation that the rating system's scope, in particular its PG classification, \\"no longer matched a notion of childhood most parents in America could agree on.\\" Steven Spielberg, director of Temple of Doom and executive producer of Gremlins, suggested a new intermediate rating between \\"PG\\" and \\"R\\". The \\"PG-13\\" rating was introduced in July 1984, with the advisory \\"Parents Are Strongly Cautioned to Give Special Guidance for Attendance of Children Under 13 -- Some Material May Be Inappropriate for Young Children\\". The first film to be released with this rating was the 1984 John Milius war film Red Dawn. In 1985, the wording was simplified to \\"Parents Strongly Cautioned -- Some Material May Be Inappropriate for Children Under 13\\". Around the same time, the MPAA won a trademark infringement lawsuit against the producers and distributors of I Spit on Your Grave over a fraudulent application of its R rating to the uncut version of the film, and forced its member studios and several other home video distributors to put MPAA ratings on the packaging of MPAA-rated films via a settlement that would come into effect by fall that year. Based on this passage, what 1984 film had the first pg-13 rating? Let's think fast. Stream of consciousness:","response":"The passage mentions that complaints about violence and gore in films like Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom and Gremlins led to a need for a new rating system; Steven Spielberg suggested an intermediate rating between \\"PG\\" and \\"R\\" called \\"PG-13.\\" We can find the answer to the question by looking for the first film mentioned in the passage that was released with the PG-13 rating. In this case, the passage states that \\"the first film to be released with this rating was the 1984 John Milius war film Red Dawn.\\" So, the 1984 film that had the first PG-13 rating was Red Dawn."},{"question":"Sentence 1: and some of the patent attorneys have been real casual in their clothes and then other ones tend to always wear a suit with a very starched cotton shirt so that's just you Sentence 2: Some of the patent attorneys have worn jeans and t-shirts to court sessions.

The incident, which has garnered national attention, sees the prosecution arguing against the actions of the officers, while the defense maintains that the officers acted in accordance with their training and responsibilities. The chilling details of the case have ignited fierce debates surrounding police conduct and the use of force, questions that are of great relevance to the ongoing conversation about law enforcement in our society. The incident took place on a cold winter night in a quiet residential neighborhood. The police received reports of gunshots in the area, prompting them to dispatch multiple officers to the scene in search of a potential shooter. As the officers arrived on location, they encountered a unidentified individual who matched the description given by witnesses. The prosecution argues that the responding officers failed to adequately assess the situation and resorted to lethal force prematurely, resulting in the tragic death of an innocent civilian. They stress the importance of effective communication and de-escalation tactics that could have potentially diffused the situation and saved a life. The defense, on the other hand, presents a stark contrast in perspective, asserting that the officers acted in self-defense and within the bounds of their authority. According to their version of events, the officers identified themselves and gave multiple verbal warnings before drawing their weapons. They argue that the individual failed to comply with instructions and posed an immediate threat to the officers and others in the vicinity. The defense also highlights the fact that a handgun was found near the scene, potentially linking the individual to the gunshots that were reported earlier. The community and the nation at large are sharply divided in their opinions of this case. It has brought to light lingering frustrations about perceived police brutality and the injustices suffered by marginalized groups. Many who support the prosecution's stance argue that systemic racism often plays a role in police violence, and are demanding that the officers be held accountable for their actions. They contend that the deceased individual, regardless of their role in the events leading up to the shooting, was denied any opportunity to be heard or to explain their actions. Conversely, those siding with the defense express support for law enforcement and argue that the officers were carrying out their duty to protect and serve the community, and were acting in their own best interest. They reiterate that the police are often faced with dangerous situations, forcing them to make split-second decisions, and thus, should be afforded some level of understanding and support. As the trial progresses, emotions are running high, with both sides fiercely dedicated to their respective positions. Regardless of the outcome, this case is likely to have an impact on the ongoing discussions around police conduct, use of force, and accountability. The conclusion of this trial will determine whether the shooting incident represents an instance of a justifiable use of force in line with police responsibilities, or if it serves as further evidence of the need for radical change in our system of law enforcement. The weight of justice lies heavily on the courtroom as the nation anxiously awaits the verdict."},{"question":"Generate a correctly punctuated version of the following text: Remember the pictures then try to find all the matching pairs","response":"Remember the pictures.

Justification: To find the amount of energy expended in this scenario, we can calculate the gravitational potential energy, which is the energy an object possesses due to its position in a gravitational field. The formula for gravitational potential energy is: PE = m * g * h where PE is the potential energy, m is the mass of the object (1000 kg in our case), g is the acceleration due to gravity (9.8 N/kg), and h is the height at which the object is raised (220 meters). Plugging in the values, we can calculate the potential energy: PE = 1000 kg * 9.8 N/kg * 220 m PE = 4400 Joules So, the car would expend 4400 Joules of energy to travel up the 220-meter hill at a consistent speed."},{"question":"Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: Where was the song that was a lead single for the eleventh studio album by American rock band Weezer first performed?","response":"The song you are referring to is \\"Feels Like Summer,\\" which served as the lead single for Weezer's eleventh studio album, titled \\"Pacific Daydream.\\" Released on March 16, 2017, \\"Feels Like Summer\\" introduced a new era for the American rock band, showcasing their blend of alternative rock, power pop, and indie rock, with elements of electronic music. \\"Feels Like Summer\\" was first performed live by Weezer during their \\"Weezer & Pixies Tour\\" in March 2017, with a noteworthy performance on March 18, 2017, at the South by Southwest (SXSW) festival held in Austin, Texas.

While there are many places that happily accept that a nursing mother needs to feed her child when out and about, plenty of new mums still feel judged when doing so in public. One woman who wants to help stamp out those feelings is fertility expert and author Emma Cannon, who has opened her doors to new mums who want a cuppa while feeding their child and perhaps a little advice too. Feeling comfortable: A new breastfeeding cafe will open in Chelsea, London and provide breastfeeding advice for new mums. Emma has launched a drop in 'cafe' service in London so these mums can receive midwifery help and breastfeeding advice in a welcoming atmosphere. Emma says, 'I breast fed both my children for over a year and personally I never experienced any problems and was never made to feel uncomfortable, but I do think it depends on the individual. 'Although I was always discrete I equally was more concerned with the needs of my babies than with other people's prejudice. But I do know that not everyone feels this way, which is why I want to help women it they want to breastfeed.' Breast is best: The breastfeeding cafe will help support mums and treat any underlying difficulties that they may have. The idea of the cafe is that new mums can share advice and tea as well as benefiting from qualified medical care. Emma added: 'If they don't feel like breastfeeding and they just want advice about feeding then that is ok too-we can support new mums in whatever way feels right to them. 'The purpose of the cafe is not to hide women away, it is to give them a place to get good advice'.

Emma says: 'At my clinic, the Fertility Rooms, from where I have launched the breastfeeding cafe, we take an integrated approach. 'That means women don't just get advice on traditional methods of breastfeeding, but they get advice on foods, which improve milk supplies. 'They can also benefit from acupuncture if need be to help with mastitis, lack of milk supplies and any other minor ailment.

Sometimes the early challenges of breastfeeding and understanding your baby's feeding cues can be very confusing. 'We can advise on correct position and attachment, managing wind and colic, how to increase milk supply, feeding plans, prevention and treatment of sore nipples, mastitis or engorgement. 'We can also help with identification of tongue tie and referral for treatment and advice on conditions such as thrush if necessary'.

Kennedy. The movie adopts a conversational approach, presenting interviews, archival footage, and expert analysis in an attempt to shed light on the numerous speculations that have developed over the years. The critic's overall impression of the movie appears to be mixed, with both positive and negative aspects highlighted. Here's a breakdown of the main points raised in the review. Positive aspects: 1. Engaging content – JFK Conspiracy Nuts offers captivating insights into the enigma that is the JFK assassination. The movie does an effective job of presenting various conspiracy theories in a manner that keeps the viewers hooked. 2. Presentation – The director skillfully juggles facts, opinions, and speculation, weaving them together into a cohesive narrative.

Provocative questioning – The short film raises questions about the reliability and consistency of official investigations and their accounts of the assassination. This invites viewers to engage in a thought-provoking discussion about the JFK assassination, which remains a contentious topic to this day. Negative aspects: 1. Lack of objectivity – The critic raises concerns about the movie's impartiality, noting that it seems to lean towards promoting conspiracy theories rather than presenting a balanced view. There is a sense that the film might be giving more weight to certain theories over others, which could have been better balanced to generate a more unbiased viewpoint. 2. Superficial analysis – While the movie does a good job of touching on several conspiracy theories, the critic feels that it falls short in providing thorough analysis and in-depth exploration of these ideas. This results in a somewhat superficial treatment of the subject matter, which may leave viewers unsatisfied if they were hoping for a more comprehensive investigation. 3. Lack of clarity – The critic points out that JFK Conspiracy Nuts sometimes fails to distinguish between facts, opinions, and baseless speculations. This can lead to confusion and might cause viewers to question the reliability of the information presented. In conclusion, JFK Conspiracy Nuts is a short film that stirs both intrigue and debate about the many conspiracy theories surrounding the JFK assassination. While the critic applauds the film for its engaging content, well-structured presentation, and provocative questioning, they express concerns regarding the movie's objectivity, superficial analysis, and lack of clarity. Given the mix of both positive and negative elements, it's difficult to definitively state whether the critic's overall perspective leans more towards a positive or a negative outlook on the movie."},{"question":"Question: Process: - Bats and other animals produce a high-pitched tone - The sound travels in waves, as sound does - The sound 'bounces' off of a nearby object - The sound wave returns to the bat - The bat hears the echoed sound - Folds in the bat's ear and adaptations in the bat's brain enable it to determine the size, shape, and position of the other object via the properties of the returned sound waves - Other animals use echolocation in generally similar ways - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the bat is sick happens, how will it affect WEAKER echolocation. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","response":"If a bat is sick, it can potentially affect its echolocation abilities, especially if the sickness weakens the bat. This can happen through several direct or indirect effects: 1. Reduced energy levels, strength, or stamina: When a bat is sick, its energy levels may decline, leading to weaker echolocation calls. Since high-pitched tones require energy to produce, a weak bat might not be able to generate as loud or clear a sound, which may reduce the effectiveness of its echolocation. 2. Impaired hearing: If the sickness affects the bat's hearing capacity, it might have trouble detecting the returning sound waves or interpreting the information they convey. This would impact the bat's ability to navigate and hunt using echolocation. 3. Neurological effects: A sick bat might have impaired brain function due to fever, inflammation, or infection. These issues can affect the bat's ability to process the returned sound waves and determine the size, shape, and position of objects in its environment. 4. Physical malformations: If the bat's sickness results in changes to its ear shape or other body parts involved in echolocation, like its larynx or mouth, this could lead to weaker or distorted echolocation signals. These altered signals may provide less accurate information to the bat about its surroundings. 5. Distraction or disorientation: A sick bat may be more focused on recovery and addressing its illness than on echolocation. Additionally, if the sickness causes disorientation or imbalance, the bat might find it harder to process and interpret echolocation data, leading to decreased accuracy and effectiveness. Overall, if a bat is sick and experiences weaker echolocation due to perturbations related to its illness, it may struggle to navigate, find food, or avoid obstacles, potentially making it more vulnerable to predation or environmental hazards. The extent to which the perturbation affects echolocation will depend on the severity and nature of the illness."},{"question":"What is the sentiment of the following movie review sentence? stiflingly","response":"To analyze the sentiment of the given word \\"stiflingly,\\" I will follow these steps: Step 1: Understand the meaning Stiflingly is an adverb, and it means something is done in an oppressively close or stuffy manner, causing discomfort or the inability to breathe freely.
