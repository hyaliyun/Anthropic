Following the war, the Treaty of Versailles altered the map of Europe and ultimately led to the outbreak of World War Two, as nations were divided, radical politics was fueled by angry citizens and countries subsequently invaded as Europe entered a second state of flux with boundaries and areas of ocupation that changed in a short and violent period of time.

I killed my mom with my .22. I don’t know why I did it.' Killer: Noah Crooks, left, allegedly shot his mother Gretchen, right, multiple times in her Iowa home and then called police. During the conversation, which lasted about 10 minutes, the boy repeated his confession several times The Global Gazette reported. 'I feel crazy and I know I'm not. I. think I have some form of ADD,' Crooks told the 911 operator. 'I tried. to rape her. I tried to rape her but I couldn't do it. 'Who tries to rape their own mom? My life is down the drain now.' As Michael placed a call to deputies. and sent an ambulance to the Crooks' home, Noah told him that his weapon. is empty and appeared concerned that the officers might shoot him. 'I just wish it was a dream so I could wake up and I could kiss her and hug her,' then-13-year-old Crooks said. Noah rambled on about his mother. making him homemade doughnuts earlier that night and expressed disbelief. that he killed her after she did that for him. He then revealed that Gretchen Crooks had taken away his 'Call of Duty' video game because he got bad grades in. school, and that is when he snapped. 'Something just came over me,' he told the dispatcher. Weapon: A motive for the shooting has yet to be reported while the victim's husband, pictured, had a penchant for guns according to his Facebook page.

However, a contest ends immediately if a competitor is awarded the highly-prized 'ippon' - the maximum score.\\nAn ippon can be scored by a clean, forceful throw; by holding the opponent mainly on his or her back for 30 seconds (under control); or by submission to a strangle, a choke or a lock applied against the elbow.\\nIppon sometimes occurs just seconds into a match but a contest going the full distance lasts five minutes for men and four minutes for women. If the scores are tied, a sudden death 'golden score' period comes into play.\\nThis system, designed to take the decision out of the referee's hands, first appeared at an Olympics in 2004. The first athlete ('judoka') to score any point is declared the winner, providing drama akin to a penalty shoot-out in football.\\nIf the scores are tied after five minutes, the contest enters a golden-score period, when the first score of any sort wins.\\nIn a sport which promotes politeness, courage, sincerity, self-control, honour, modesty, friendship and respect, penalties ('shido') are given to players who infringe the rules.\\nThe first penalty only earns a warning, but the second and third result in points being awarded to the opponent, with the fourth equating to an ippon and therefore ends the contest.\\nA judoka can be disqualified ('hansukomake') for deliberately hurting their opponent.\\nMore on the Team GB website\\nA terrible showing at last year's world championships led to GB's elite coaching staff being replaced.

But Trump also made it clear he is concerned about this year's congressional midterm elections, in which opposition Democrats are favored to make gains.  \\"And all of the great momentum that we are having as a country on jobs, on safety, on security, on our military — it is all at stake in November,\\" Trump warned at the Indiana rally.  2020 is expected to produce a bumper crop of Democratic presidential contenders who will vie for their party's nomination.

It can also make a difference whether you go during peak time or not. For example, tickets always cost more during school holidays and weekends than they do during the weekdays. Theme parks always get very busy during the summer months, so if you don't like crowds, it's usually a good idea to go earlier or later in the year!

Tom Brook examines the potential risks and rewards of the religious blockbuster.\\n\\nIt was an intriguing image and it caught Twitter users' imagination – a massive wooden replica of Noah's Ark under construction in suburban New York. \\"I dreamt about this since I was 13,\\" tweeted Black Swan director Darren Aronofsky, whose epic film of Noah’s life is set for release next March. \\"And now it's a reality.\\"\\n\\nThis enormous set is a rare extravagance in the age of CGI pictures. And in more ways than one, it looks back to an older style of movie-making. It heralds a flood of Hollywood films on biblical themes.\\n\\nThere are two planned Moses pictures in the works, with Ang Lee and Ridley Scott rumoured as directors. Then there’s a Cain and Abel story in development. Sony Pictures Entertainment confirmed last year they’d given approval for production to go ahead through Will Smith’s production company. Other religious films are also being incubated.\\n\\nHollywood’s interest in biblical epics is to some extent cyclical – in the 1950s and early 60s they were a staple. Legendary filmmaker Cecil B DeMille made a big impact with The Ten Commandments in which Charlton Heston played Moses. Other biblical hits from the time included Solomon and Sheba, David and Bathsheba and Ben-Hur. These films dominated the box office.\\n\\nBut not all the religious films from the era resonated with an audience. One of the best-known – The Greatest Story Ever Told – didn’t do well commercially. And several didn’t meet with the approval of reviewers. The New York Times critic wrote that the biblical epic King of Kings, narrated by Orson Wells, had “the nature of an illustrated lecture.”\\n\\nRecently interest in religious-themed films has been heightened as the Hollywood studios have, once again, come to realise there’s a potentially huge audience for biblical fare. Not necessarily earth-shattering news when you take into account that a Gallup poll conducted last year found more than 75 per cent of Americans identify with a Christian religion.\\n\\nBut what’s got Hollywood’s attention in the past few weeks is the just-completed American TV series The Bible on the History Channel. This miniseries – which dramatised the Bible in five two-hour programmes – became a surprise blockbuster. It reached an audience of more than 13 million with its first episode – an unusually large viewing figure for a miniseries on cable TV.\\n\\nReality TV impresario Mark Burnett, who co-produced the series with his wife actress Roma Downey, clearly thinks there’s a demand for religious entertainment. “We believe in the Bible, we believe in Jesus and that’s the number one subject right now in America. And that’s great!” he says.\\n\\nThe success of the History Channel’s The Bible has animated studio executives. Paul Degarabedian, box office analyst for Hollywood.com, says: “I think that’s maybe the foremost thing on their minds right now: that if done properly Bible-based movies could potentially be moneymaking and profitable.”\\n\\nBut catering to the growing interest in biblical adventures presents the Hollywood studios with a challenge: how to create a movie that will engage both secular audiences as well as those who strongly identify with their religious background? Screenplays have to be thoughtfully composed to reach audiences everywhere. It’s not an easy feat if you’re trying to reach a worldwide audience that includes people who practice very different religions.\\n\\nMaking the right kind of religious films is difficult for the studios as Toby Miller, author of Global Hollywood 2, confirms. “It’s a big issue in overseas sales,” he says. “How Christian can you get? How Old Testament can you get? ”\\n\\nHollywood has engendered heated controversies in the past when it has taken on religious stories. Biblical characters are seen as sacrosanct. California-based Brian Godawa, a filmmaker who writes and directs spiritual stories, has taken exception to the forthcoming film Noah.\\n\\nBased on his reading of the screenplay he says: “They’re turning it into a political propaganda piece for environmentalism. What they’ve done is made the meaning of the Noah story into something that’s not in the Bible.”\\n\\nHe adds: “We’ll just have to wait and see what happens with Noah because if it’s as anti-biblical as I think religious people won’t want to see it.”\\n\\nWhether or not planned religious movies create criticism, Hollywood is not going to hold back given the promise of big box office rewards.\\n\\nAnother strong factor encouraging the studios to explore biblical stories is that Hollywood’s big staple – the superhero films of recent years – may have run their course. “It’s true there isn’t much that is left to be mined but it is clear there is a massive appetite for that kind of story,” says Professor Miller.\\n\\nReligious epics, if carefully calibrated, could perhaps satisfy the appetites of the superhero audience.\\n\\nThe studios have already peddled god-like superheroes and met with box office success. Take Thor – the Kenneth Branagh directed action-adventure released two years ago which took in more than $180m at the international box office.\\n\\nThe character of Thor in the movie certainly had a religious dimension. As Professor Miller says: “Thor is a god, or a semi-god, able to go beyond the human norm and provide inspiration to the conventional person,”\\n\\nPaul Degarabedian believes given the right treatment all the excitement of the Bible – the events, battles and intrigue – could be fashioned into an appealing blockbuster. “That could be something that could totally cross over that would be cinematic, compelling, entertaining that could be huge if it’s done with the proper balance of secular style storytelling,” he says.\\n\\nBut Brian Godawa is pessimistic, arguing that secular Hollywood doesn’t really understand religion. “The problem is that many people in Hollywood are not spiritually, religiously inclined – they don’t understand the Bible. They don’t understand Christianity or Judaism. They import their own views into it.”\\n\\nWhat some studio executives would like to see is a replication of the success of Mel Gibson’s 2004 religious epic The Passion of The Christ which depicted the last twelve hours in the life of Jesus. The film made more than $600m around the world.\\n\\nDespite considerable controversy – and charges of anti-Semitism – it was a religious film that did reach beyond the US Christian community. It also made headway in countries with large Muslim populations such as Egypt. But it was banned in other parts of the Muslim world for different reasons – partly because the crucifixion, so vividly depicted in the picture, contradicts the Koran.\\n\\nSome commentators see the success of The Passion of The Christ as specifically connected to both the socio-political climate in the US at the time it was launched and Mel Gibson’s stature. He personally financed the film which also benefitted from a very effective marketing campaign that relied heavily on church groups.\\n\\nRight now Hollywood is mired in soul-searching looking for new ways to reach audiences of all kinds both religious and secular. Religious epics remain risky ventures but they could be part of the answer – if done properly the payoff could be huge.\\n\\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.\\nWhat are the most important parts of this news article?","response":"This news article talks about how Hollywood is showing interest in making movies based on stories from the Bible. They think that these movies could be very popular, just like superhero movies. Some upcoming movies are about Noah, Moses, and Cain and Abel. Hollywood has made movies about Bible stories in the past, but now they want to make even more because they think many people will watch them. The challenge for movie makers is to create a movie that can be enjoyed by people who are religious and those who aren't. These movies could be very successful if they are made in the right way, but they can also cause controversy if they don't follow the Bible closely or upset people's beliefs."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: This article: Harry Glicken (March 7, 1958 – June 3, 1991) was an American volcanologist. He researched Mount St. Helens in the United States before and after its 1980 eruption, and was very distraught about the death of fellow volcanologist David A. Johnston, who had switched shifts with Glicken so that the latter could attend an interview. In 1991, while conducting avalanche research on Mount Unzen in Japan, Glicken and fellow volcanologists Katia and Maurice Krafft were killed by a pyroclastic flow. His remains were found four days later, and were cremated in accordance with his parents' request. Glicken and Johnston remain the only American volcanologists known to have died in volcanic eruptions. Despite a long-term interest in working for the United States Geological Survey, Glicken never received a permanent post there because employees found him eccentric. Conducting independent research from sponsorships granted by the National Science Foundation and other organizations, Glicken accrued expertise in the field of volcanic debris avalanches. He also wrote several major publications on the topic, including his doctoral dissertation based on his research at St. Helens titled \\"Rockslide-debris Avalanche of May 18, 1980, Mount St. Helens Volcano, Washington\\" that initiated widespread interest in the phenomenon. Since being published posthumously by Glicken's colleagues in 1996, the report has been acknowledged by many other publications on debris avalanches.

In the 1980s, a young guitarist called Euronymous forms a black metal band called Mayhem, the first of the genre in their country of Norway, with Necrobutcher on bass, and  Manheim on drums. Manhein leaves and is soon replaced by new drummer Hellhammer and they recruit a new vocalist from Sweden called Dead, who exhibits self-destructive behavior, which he portrays during their live shows by cutting himself and bleeding on the audience, and throwing pig heads at the \\"posers\\". At a show filmed by their friend Metalion, the band meets a fan named Kristian, whom Euronymous initially looks down on. While home alone, Dead uses his personal knife to cut his arms and throat, and then uses Euronymous' shotgun to shoot himself in the forehead, leaving behind a suicide note. Euronymous returns home and finds the body but instead of calling the police, he takes photos of the body and moves the knife and shotgun around. After Dead's body is taken away, Euronymous gives necklaces to the other band members which he claims are pieces of Dead's skull; this disgusts Necrobutcher, prompting him to leave the band. Soon after, Euronymous starts his own black metal record label and opens a record shop called Helvete, which becomes a social hub for black-metallers like Metalion, Fenriz of Darkthrone, Faust of Emperor, and Kristian (who is now calling himself Varg Vikernes) of Burzum.

Bush. He served as the 43rd President from January 20, 2001, to January 20, 2009.\\n\\nGeorge W. Bush, the son of former President George H.W. Bush, was born on July 6, 1946, in New Haven, Connecticut. Before becoming president, he served as the 46th Governor of Texas from 1995 to 2000. He is a member of the Republican Party and had Dick Cheney as his Vice President during his two terms in office. \\n\\nHurricane Katrina was one of the costliest and deadliest natural disasters in U.S. history. It caused devastating damage across the Gulf Coast, particularly in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. New Orleans, located in Louisiana, was one of the cities that suffered the most, as the hurricane led to widespread flooding due to the failure of the city's levee system.\\n\\nPresident George W. Bush's administration faced significant criticism in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, as the government's response to the disaster was widely seen as inadequate and slow. Many people believed that Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), headed by Michael D. Brown at the time, failed to efficiently manage the crisis and provide timely assistance to those affected by the hurricane.\\n\\nThe Bush administration implemented several measures to address the crisis, such as providing financial assistance and humanitarian aid to the affected areas, and repairing the damaged infrastructure. However, the slow response and perceived lack of empathy by President Bush and his administration left a lasting negative impression and became one of the major criticisms of his presidency.\\n\\nIn the years since Hurricane Katrina, various government agencies, including FEMA, have undergone significant reforms to improve their preparedness and response to natural disasters.

The biggest culprits are rivers and with them many agriculture fertilizer chemicals as well as livestock and human waste. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone.Marine debris, which is also known as marine litter, describes human-created waste floating in a body of water. Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter.  Croatia and Italy were two countries of similar size and population located on opposite shores of the same sea. Croatia based its economy on tourism and fishing, while Italy based its economy on conventional agriculture. Both countries had thriving economies, but they both polluted the sea in different ways.  Which country caused more marine litter?\\nAnswer:","response":"It is difficult to definitively determine which country caused more marine litter without comprehensive data, but we can make some observations based on the information provided.\\n\\nCroatia, with an economy based on tourism and fishing, might produce less agricultural runoff than Italy. Agricultural runoff, including fertilizers and livestock waste, causes chemical pollution, hypoxia, and dead zones. However, tourism and fishing activities might still contribute to marine litter through the improper disposal of waste, such as plastic packaging, food waste, and fishing gear.\\n\\nItaly, with an economy based on conventional agriculture, is more likely to produce greater amounts of agricultural runoff, as mentioned above. This would contribute to chemical pollution, hypoxia, and dead zones. Although agriculture is the primary focus, tourism, shipping, and other human activities could still lead to the generation of marine debris.\\n\\nWhile both countries contribute to marine pollution, it seems that Italy might have a more significant impact on chemical pollution and hypoxic conditions in the sea due to its agricultural activities. However, both countries can still contribute to marine litter through tourism, fishing, and other human activities.\\n\\nTo provide a more accurate conclusion, a detailed comparative study on the quantity and type of marine litter and pollutants caused by the two countries would be needed. This would help to determine the overall impact of each nation's activities on ocean pollution."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Information:  - A cement is a binder, a substance used in construction that sets and hardens and can bind other materials together. The most important types of cement are used as a component in the production of mortar in masonry, and of concrete, which is a combination of cement and an aggregate to form a strong building material.  - Europa-Park is a theme park and the largest in Germany, and the second most popular theme park resort in Europe, following Disneyland Paris.  - Asphalt (, occasionally ), also known as bitumen is a sticky, black and highly viscous liquid or semi-solid form of petroleum. It may be found in natural deposits or may be a refined product; it is a substance classed as a pitch. Until the 20th century, the term asphaltum was also used. The word is derived from the Ancient Greek  \\"ásphaltos\\".  - Portland cement is the most common type of cement in general use around the world, used as a basic ingredient of concrete, mortar, stucco, and most non-speciality grout. It was developed from other types of hydraulic lime in England in the mid 19th century and usually originates from limestone. It is a fine powder produced by heating materials in a kiln to form what is called clinker, grinding the clinker, and adding small amounts of other materials. Several types of Portland cement are available, with the most common being called ordinary Portland cement (OPC) which is grey in color, but a white Portland cement is also available.  - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf.  - A lift hill, or chain hill, is an upward-sloping section of track on a roller coaster on which the roller coaster train is mechanically lifted to an elevated point or peak in the track. Upon reaching the peak, the train is then propelled from the peak by gravity and is usually allowed to coast throughout the rest of the roller coaster ride's circuit on its own momentum, including most or all of the remaining uphill sections. The initial upward-sloping section of a roller coaster track is usually a lift hill, as the train typically begins a ride with little speed, though some coasters have raised stations that permit an initial drop without a lift hill. Although uncommon, some tracks also contain multiple lift hills.  - Polymer concretes are a type of concrete that use polymers to replace lime-type cements as a binder. In some cases the polymer is used in addition to portland cement to form Polymer Cement Concrete (PCC) or Polymer Modified Concrete (PMC). Polymers in concrete have been overseen by Committee 548 of the American Concrete Institute since 1971.  - Asphalt concrete (commonly called asphalt, blacktop, or pavement in North America, and tarmac or bitumen macadam in Great Britain and Ireland) is a composite material commonly used to surface roads, parking lots, and airports. It consists of mineral aggregate bound together with asphalt, laid in layers, and compacted. The process was refined and enhanced by Belgian inventor and U.S. immigrant Edward de Smedt. It is increasingly being used as the core of embankment dams.  - Temple of the Night Hawk is an enclosed roller coaster located at Phantasialand . Founded in 1988 after 18 months of construction , the ride was originally called \`\` ' Space Center ' '' . The ride led passengers past models of rockets and emulated asteroids and the darkened hall was dimly lit with thousands of tiny spots of light to resemble stars . Due to the construction of the neighbouring Wurze Town in 2001 , the roller coaster was redeveloped with a fantasy jungle theme and was renamed as the Temple of the Night Hawk . The roller coaster is now completely dark . Until 2006 there were some green moving lights and strobe lights in the first lifthill , still present today , but not operational . In 2008 the Lights on the coaster trains were turned off or broke down and have never been repaired since then . Till 2010 there was a green laser projection with the outlines of a flying hawk and until June 2012 , there were some red strobe - lights at the final brakerun . In 2011 , the park installed new strobe lights in the first lifthill , which broke down after about two months , and were never repaired since then . The ride has four trains and one spare train for repairs each with seven cars . Each car has two rows of seats each holding two people . During the four - minute ride time the trains are lifted by three lift hill chains , 1.174 metres of track . The roller coaster is therefore one of the longest indoor roller coasters in the World , slightly beaten by \`\` Mindbender '' in Galaxyland Amusement Park , Canada . The hall in which the track is located is around 120,000m³ in size and rests on 180 concrete pillars which are 12 metres deep in the ground . In the basement of the hall is the \`\` ' Hollywood Tour '' ' darkride . The total investment for the ride was around 15 million DM . With the redevelopment of the ride in 2001 the park tried greening the roof of the hall by installing an irrigation system , however the results were n't as good as expected .

The park was opened in 1967 by Gottlieb Löffelhardt and Richard Schmidt. Although starting as a family-oriented park, Phantasialand has also added thrill rides, especially during recent years. Furthermore, following the example of Europa-Park, they have decided to attract business customers beside the regular ones, calling it \\"Business der neuen Dimension\\" (\\"business of a new dimension\\").  - Road surface or pavement is the durable surface material laid down on an area intended to sustain vehicular or foot traffic, such as a road or walkway. In the past, gravel road surfaces, cobblestone and granite setts were extensively used, but these surfaces have mostly been replaced by asphalt or concrete laid on a compacted base course. Road surfaces are frequently marked to guide traffic. Today, permeable paving methods are beginning to be used for low-impact roadways and walkways.  - A roller coaster is an amusement ride developed for amusement parks and modern theme parks. LaMarcus Adna Thompson obtained a patent regarding roller coasters on January 20, 1885, which were made out of wood, but this patent is considerably later than the \\"Russian mountains\\" described below. In essence a specialized railroad system, a roller coaster consists of a track that rises in designed patterns, sometimes with one or more \\"inversions\\" (such as vertical loops) that briefly turn the rider upside down. The track does not necessarily have to be a complete circuit, as shuttle roller coasters demonstrate. Most roller coasters have multiple cars in which passengers sit and are restrained. Two or more cars hooked together are called a train. Some roller coasters, notably wild mouse roller coasters, run with single cars.  - Concrete is a composite material composed of coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement that hardens over time. Most concretes used are lime-based concretes such as Portland cement concrete or concretes made with other hydraulic cements, such as ciment fondu. However, asphalt concrete, which is frequently used for road surfaces, is also a type of concrete, where the cement material is bitumen, and polymer concretes are sometimes used where the cementing material is a polymer.

Congress matters a lot more. When you’re on the campaign trail, they don’t matter as much.”\\n\\nUnlike Mr. Bush, who recognized his limitations as a public speaker, Mr. Obama and his team have enormous faith in his capacity for communicating with the American people. When he was considering a bailout for the auto industry and advisers warned of a popular backlash, he expressed confidence that he could explain it to the public. After Mr. Obama gave his speech in Cairo reaching out to the Muslim world, some aides argued that the address itself was responsible for Iranians taking to the streets of Tehran to protest a disputed election.\\n\\nBut David Axelrod, the president’s senior adviser, said the White House is realistic. “No one ever believed that the power of communicating was in and of itself enough,” he said. “It’s important to communicate what you’re doing and why. But without the what and the why, the communicating is of little value.”\\n\\n“I think it continues to be valuable,” he added. “But ultimately we’re going to be judged not on the power of the oratory but the record. Everybody here understands that.”\\n\\nPresidential speeches used to be much rarer than they are today, reserved more for strategic moments. These days, in a hyperactive media environment, presidents talk publicly two or three times a day. Harry S. Truman spoke in public 88 times in a typical year, according to “POTUS Speaks,” the memoir of Michael Waldman, who was Mr. Clinton’s chief speechwriter. By contrast, Ronald Reagan made 320 public remarks in a typical year and Mr. Clinton, 550.\\n\\nWith the help of six speechwriters led by Jon Favreau, Mr. Obama is on pace to match Mr. Clinton and likely exceed him, according to White House officials. On any given day, Mr. Obama may address the Tribal Nations Conference and also tape a video speech to grassroots volunteers, to name a couple of examples from a single day last week.\\n\\n“When you do four or five speeches a day, not any single speech is going to be the biggest speech he ever does,” said one White House official who requested anonymity to speak more candidly. “In a media environment like this, the attention span is rather short so it may seem like the magic isn’t there. But there are still moments when he rises to the occasion when he needs to.”\\n\\nMr. Obama’s aides point to several such moments this year — his first address to a joint session of Congress as he was advocating a large spending package to stimulate the economy, his speech at Georgetown University laying out his vision of a “new foundation” for a post-recession nation, his Cairo speech, his commencement address at Notre Dame where he tried to bridge the divide over abortion and his September return to Congress to argue for his health care plan.\\n\\nWhile Mr. Gerson contends that months of Obama speeches have not erased deep public concerns with his health care plan, Geoff Garin, a Democratic strategist, called the address to Congress “the best policy address by a president since Lyndon Johnson talked about the Voting Rights Act in 1965.” Following an August dominated by attacks on the health care plan, Mr. Garin said Mr. Obama “was able to lift a debate that had got stuck in the mud up to a much higher place and let Obama and supporters of health care reform retake the high ground.”\\n\\nBut the risk for any president is that at some point the public begins to tune out. “President Bush in 2007 actually gave some pretty good speeches about Iraq and nobody was paying attention anymore and so it just didn’t matter,” Mr. Garin said. “People still pay attention to President Obama. But did anybody hear his speech about education reform in Wisconsin the other day? Of course not.”\\n\\nA version of this article appears in print on November 8, 2009, on Page WK1 of the New York edition with the headline: The Words That Once Soared.

The increased need for presidents to communicate their policies and ideas has lessened the impact of individual speeches.

She thinks what it comes down to, at least for some people with autism, is permanently eliminating just a single chemical compound known as monosodium glutamate, or MSG - an ingredient many people associate with Chinese food. \\n  \\n Actually, Reid said, the chemical is in nearly every processed food imaginable, but it only appears on food labels as MSG about 1 percent of the time. Instead, MSG is sometimes labeled as flavor or flavoring, soy protein, barley malt, pectin, corn starch or yeast extract, Reid said. \\n  \\n \\"We're getting an abundance of MSG,\\" she said. \\"It's in 95 percent of processed food. And we don't need it in our diet - ever.\\" \\n  \\n While there is no science to back up many of her claims, Reid said the most convincing evidence to her is the results she saw in her daughter. At age 7, Brooke is completely cured, Reid said. And from all outward appearances that seems to be true. \\n  \\n Research is sparse \\n  \\n Dr. Robin Hansen, professor of pediatrics at UC Davis and a developmental behavior pediatrician who recently led a study for the university's Mind Institute, said it's fairly common for parents to seek out alternative treatments for their children with autism. Nearly 7 percent of the children with autism they studied were on gluten- and casein-free diets. \\n  \\n \\"We don't have a lot of diet research to look at, because these studies are difficult to do,\\" she said, describing the trickiness of monitoring a child's food intake in a double-blind study. \\"And no one has done an MSG study. But what we do have doesn't show a marked difference even with children with gastrointestinal problems.\\" \\n  \\n Still, she wouldn't dissuade parents from trying as long as they make sure the diet is balanced and to keep in mind that it's a big undertaking. \\n  \\n For Reid, the journey was long, difficult and often heartbreaking, but ultimately a victory that persuaded her to quit her high-paying job and help other parents with what she learned, establishing the Fremont nonprofit foundation Unblind My Mind. \\n  \\n It started when Brooke was 2. Reid and her husband noticed that their daughter, the youngest of five, couldn't make human connections, had severe communication problems and threw tantrums that lasted for hours. She also had digestive issues and constipation - all hallmark signs of autism. \\n  \\n Reid told herself Brooke would grow out of it. Her husband, Paul Sauer, wasn't so sure. A cellular biologist, he began plugging Brooke's issues into search engines and perusing websites. One night he came home with information he had printed off the Internet about autism. \\n  \\n \\"Brooke displayed every characteristic on the list,\\" Reid said. \\"I could check every box.\\" \\n  \\n Looking for answers \\n  \\n They went through all the traditional channels, starting with their pediatrician. Their doctor agreed that something was wrong but didn't know where to direct them. So they hired a psychologist to test Brooke, and the results showed that she was moderately autistic with some severe learning disabilities, Reid said. \\n  \\n \\"She was in her own world,\\" Reid said. \\"Her actions were repetitive, like doing a puzzle over and over again for hours. And she exhibited signs of obsessive-compulsive disorder. She couldn't stand going home in the stroller on a different route without having a screaming tantrum.\\" \\n  \\n They enrolled her in a special-education preschool and tried to come to terms with the fact that their daughter would probably never function normally. \\n  \\n Reid began reading autism blogs and going onto online bulletin boards, gathering as much information as possible on what more she could do. What she found was that some parents were having success with diet, specifically cutting out gluten and dairy. \\n  \\n The MSG factor \\n  \\n She tried it with her daughter for six months and Brooke improved - a little. Then she saw something about how one parent was cutting out foods with MSG. It seemed odd to Reid. \\n  \\n \\"I remember thinking, MSG?\\" she said. \\"Who uses that anymore?\\" \\n  \\n Quickly she determined that it was in more foods than she could count. Desperate for results, she told her husband she wanted to try the diet. He was dubious. Already their household had been divided on the gluten-free, dairy-free diet - with most of the family opting to eat more conventionally. \\n  \\n But the more Reid researched, the more it made sense. She said she found plenty of studies that showed that many Americans suffer from glutamate imbalance. Glutamate is a chemical messenger that transmits signals between neurons and other cells in the body. Glutamate is needed for learning and functioning. \\n  \\n Reid believes that when there is too much glutamate in the body, it causes neurological disfunction. This theory is shared by many scientists. But Reid takes it a step further, believing that a diet filled with MSG can add to the imbalance, or make it much worse. \\n  \\n Dr. Sanford Newmark, who practices integrative medicine at UCSF's Osher Center and specializes in treating autistic children, says there are no scientific studies to back up her hypothesis. But he would be willing to try it because he has seen results from gluten- and casein-free diets. \\n  \\n \\"There is so much we don't know about autism,\\" he said. \\"And there is no way to know who will respond and who won't.\\" \\n  \\n Results from diet \\n  \\n Newmark said that a third of his patients respond significantly to diet and another third see mild improvement. For some reason some people can't break down gluten or casein in the gut and it winds up going into the bloodstream, he said. \\n  \\n \\"There's a huge connection between the gut and the brain,\\" he said, adding that autistic children who suffer from gastrointestinal problems, such as constipation, often see the best results from the diet. \\n  \\n As far as the MSG-free diet, other than Reid's experience Newmark said he has seen no evidence that it works. \\n  \\n \\"While it's not normal for kids with moderate autism to be cured by 7, it's not unheard of,\\" he said. \\n  \\n But there is no harm in trying, he said. \\"If you actually ate just fruit, meat, vegetables, beans and whole grains and not processed food, it's a more healthful diet.\\" \\n  \\n Dr. Antonio Hardan, a child and adolescent psychiatrist at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital Stanford and an expert on the neurology of autism, said, \\"I believe that we have to be open-minded about new approaches to treating autism.\\" \\n  \\n But he too echoes Newmark's words that Reid's diet is not scientifically tested and warns that changing an autistic child's diet could have serious consequences. One of the traits of autism is picky eating, he said. Doctors believe it may be related to sensory issues such as texture, smell and taste. \\n  \\n \\"By limiting something they like, you could be making life in that household impossible,\\" he said. \\n  \\n Just timing? \\n  \\n He also wonders if Brooke Reid's recovery might have been a coincidence to the diet. \\n  \\n \\"For 100 years we didn't have processed food, but we did have autism,\\" he said. \\"But despite the lack of scientific support, it might be worth considering in light of the good response of some types of seizures to the ketogenic diet.\\" \\n  \\n The ketogenic diet - a high-fat, low-carbohydrate regime - has successfully been used to treat epilepsy in children. \\n  \\n But Reid said she has her own proof. She sees it every day with her Unblind My Mind foundation. \\n  \\n \\"Out of the 75 cases of diagnosed autism I've worked on, 74 drastically improved within five weeks,\\" she said. \\n  \\n And then there is Brooke. ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

Photo by Chip Scheuer. \\n  \\n What’s a mother to do when her three-year-old daughter is diagnosed with autism? Well, if you’re a biochemist like Dr. Katherine Reid, Ph.D, you’ll probably end up researching everything you can about the developmental disorder, and maybe even beginning your therapy in the aisles of the grocery store. \\n  \\n By asking the question what are we eating?, Reid claims she’s been able to completely manage her daughter Brooke’s autism. What we put into our bodies, she says, can have profound effects on our brains. \\n  \\n “Autism is a pervasive developmental disorder, which means that there are so many different areas of the brain that it hits, and how it manifests itself in each child is different,” says Reid. \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n Some of the overarching characteristics of the disorder, though, include communication and social impairments, seizure-like behavior, and extreme sensitivity to light and sound. Brooke, diagnosed at age three as “moderate” on the spectrum, suffered from all of the above. \\n  \\n “It was difficult to integrate her into any mainstream setting,” says Reid. “Even like going to a park, because you just didn’t know if this seizure-like behavior was going to flare up and it was really hard to explain.” \\n  \\n Three years later, Brooke has improved so much that she was taken out of special needs school, and she’s functioning well in mainstream kindergarten. “She’s now the most social kid out of the five children,” says Reid, who credits the success to a total reinvention of her daughter’s diet, and the removal of one ubiquitous ingredient: monosodium glutamate. \\n  \\n The journey to the MSG discovery began with the addition of nutritional supplements like magnesium, Vitamin D3, Omega 3 Fish oil and B-Complex vitamins. “I observed eye contact coming back, and minor improvements, but still autistic, still special needs, not functioning very well in the mainstream environment,” says Reid. \\n  \\n Her next step was an approach popular among parents of autistic children, but with unreliably mixed results: a diet free of gluten and casein, a milk protein added to many foods. Again, Brooke showed slight improvements. But it wasn’t until she took it one step further that Brooke’s seizures and sensory distortions, or extreme sensitivity to light and sound, were completely alleviated. \\n  \\n “I found that gluten and casein weren’t the only thing that I needed to remove,” says Reid, who read in a blog that she also needed to be careful with MSG. “And at that point I was like who is feeding their kids MSG?” \\n  \\n As it turns out: everybody. \\n  \\n “I was shocked. It’s all over the place in our foods, and it’s not being labeled as monosodium glutamate, it’s being labeled as almost healthy things, as natural flavors, for instance. So you can have a food labeled 100% organic, all natural, no MSG added and still, that food item contain a significant amount of MSG,” says Reid. \\n  \\n It’s the “free glutamate” in MSG, produced when gluten, casein and other proteins are processed, that are slipping into almost every processed food out there, including juices, flavored teas, and even toothpaste. It appears in “natural foods” as protein powders, yeast extract, hydrolyzed proteins, extracted proteins and other forms, and it’s added not as a preservative, says Reid, but to make us think that food tastes better. \\n  \\n “It actually doesn’t have any taste in and of itself, but it’s a chemical that’s causing a brain reaction that’s making us think it tastes good,” says Reid. “It’s binding to the glutamate receptor, and it’s exciting our neurons.” \\n  \\n And for the autistic brain, which is already hyper-stimulated, it can wreak havoc, says Reid. \\n  \\n “Once we became aware of the marketing gimmick going on here and the disguise, and removing it really ended up removing a lot of processed foods, she was a new kid,” says Reid, whose shopping list is now made up of primarily fruits, vegetables, organic meats, and raw nuts and seeds. \\n  \\n “It just reduced the noise, the light was no longer an issue, any room sound that was going on didn’t bother her, and she was able to absorb like a sponge,” says Reid. \\n  \\n Interestingly enough, pharmaceutical drugs currently in clinical trial for treating autism and other brain disorders like Alzheimer’s Disease, block the glutamate receptors in the brain. ||||| We believe every healing journey begins \\n  \\n with a closer look at what we are eating!

Well, Hollywood & Highland is my baby. I've lived a five-minute walk from the site of this spanking-new development for the last 21/2 years. I kept a concerned eye on the pregnancy, I was there at the birth, and now I'm watching as it takes its first tentative steps. The merits (or otherwise) of the new shopping and entertainment complex, which looms like a big old-fashioned liner sailing on Hollywood Boulevard, are a chief topic of conversation among my friends. So far, most of them seem to see the whole enterprise as a bit of a lost opportunity, and certainly not a place they would frequent for the sake of it. But I've visited it three times, morning, afternoon and night, willing it to succeed. Frankly, from the beginning, I thought that anything they built would be an improvement. I first visited Hollywood Boulevard on a trip from London almost 10 years ago and felt the profound depression common to any tourist who wandered farther than the forecourt of Grauman's Chinese. I was filming a documentary for British TV on horror writer Clive Barker, and we needed to shoot a weird, menacing landscape that conjured the dark side of the human psyche. The Boulevard was the perfect place. Sleazy beyond the call of duty and downright dangerous, it symbolized how far Hollywood had fallen. It felt like a place that had been abandoned by the world. But the world came back in droves a few weeks ago, on Hollywood & Highland's official opening day. I went to the opening-night gala concert in the new Kodak Theatre, and the boulevard was packed. Traffic was at a standstill, and it was good to have the illusion that one was in a living, breathing city center. Hollywood was coming home to Hollywood, so surely this meant glamour. Be-suited, I took my British friend Vanessa, who remembers the Boulevard from the days of the Brown Derby and who this night had dressed to the nines in a gold silk evening dress. Meeting across the street in the newly restored Pig & Whistle, we were as excited as kids at Christmas, all dressed-up with somewhere to go. This was a mistake. The opening night was a resolutely drab affair. I should have known something was amiss when a couple of excitable tourists asked to take our picture, no doubt thinking that, like the Marilyn and Crocodile Dundee look-alikes hired to mill around and summon the magic of Hollywood, we were a couple of actors in period dress. Undaunted, we pressed on. The massive archway that leads to the theater from the street is impressive, though Kodak is obviously not given to self-effacement and its name, emblazoned on high, lends an unnecessary touch of vulgarity. We walked the route that presumably the stars will take on Oscar night toward the ceremony's new home in the Kodak, past somewhat unwelcoming luxury goods shops that might make them, like us, feel as though they're passing through an up-market airport mall. Trying to keep our sense of occasion intact, we ascended the grand, sweeping Busby Berkeley-style stairway that led to ... nothing in particular. The theater foyers had a terribly underwhelming brown quality, with the muted colors and unadorned walls so characteristic of provincial conference centers. Surely, I thought, the home of the Oscars needed a fantastically grand reception hall, a place where the audience mingles in all its finery amid magnificent surroundings, a place that would put the show back into show business. But then I realized that, of course, that's the part of the Oscar bash that TV audiences never see. Maybe acknowledging that it's the red-carpet arrivals and the auditorium that the star struck of the world are privy to, the architects of the Kodak seem to have dispensed with the middle bit as an irrelevance. At first glance, the auditorium is impressive. With its 3,300 seats, it is huge, but in that time-worn phrase, it manages to be intimate too. Our spirits were lifted, but then strangely, spent the rest of the evening slowly deflating. This might have been due to the seriously odd choice of performer--Russell Watson, a fellow countryman of mine who, as far as I can tell, is still unknown here. But after an hour or so, I realized that I was uncomfortable because the theater felt strangely inauthentic, like the set of a theater instead of a real one. The much-vaunted acoustics also had that somewhat flat, TV feel about them, rather as though one were listening to a very, very loud CD. I left that night with a sense of foreboding. But not wanting to yield to it, I was back the following afternoon to sample the shops and get a sense of what the out-of-towners searching for Hollywood will find. I made my way to Babylon Court, the center of the development and the place most easily accessible from the street. This felt great. The crowd was big and obviously enjoying itself, and the court is open to the skies, so I didn't feel that familiar gotta-get-outta-here rush. The two massive white elephants atop their columns have loomed large over the Boulevard for months and could have represented the world's largest hostage to fortune. But for me, they worked brilliantly. Together with the elaborately decorated ceremonial arch that frames a view of the Hollywood sign, they gave the place a sense of grandeur and fun totally missing from such sterile destinations as the hideous Beverly Center. The shops--Victoria's Secret, Brookstones, various jewelry and clothes stores--offered an unspectacular and inevitable choice. Maybe, when all three levels are full (and given the recessionary temper of the times, this will be a real task), I will actually want to buy something here. For the time being, even with the presence of the Gap and its fellow chain stores, there's the distinct sense that the mall is either too gift-oriented, or for that matter, too expensive. A nice big book shop (the current offering, Book City, is too small and specialized) and a food market would start to give the place a backbone, as well as a reason for residents to visit along with the expected hordes of tourists. I live on Formosa and Hollywood and would love to simply walk a few hundred yards for a carton of milk or to browse through magazine shelves in fun surroundings. We're not talking big spending here, but it's the locals who give a place its character. Hollywood & Highland's crowning glory is the view that comes when you climb the steps to one of the upper levels. We're so unaccustomed to being up high in L.A. that the chance to walk around, look out at the city and watch the crowd below makes for one of the place's best features. Standing on the third floor in the middle of one of the walkways that straddle the Babylonian archway, you can appreciate the full sweep of Hollywood from the distant sign in the hills right through to the El Capitan Theater on the south side of the Boulevard. It forced me to look anew at surrounding buildings, which I had stopped noticing. From this perspective, you can also take in the traffic winding down Highland, and it's apparent that the development has had the effect of genuinely altering the landscape for the better. Hollywood itself, at least on this occasion, felt electric. For me, this more than made up for my Kodak moment. I went back a third time, to see a movie at the new Chinese multi-screener (nice theater, shame about the movie) and then just to hang out and people-watch--a revolutionary pastime in L.A. In among the tourists crowding the food franchises, I spotted what seemed like a few like-minded Angelenos. Sure enough, they were resting actor/model/whatevers, simply passing the time. For Hollywood & Highland to truly work, and I hope that it does, it can't be given over solely to the plane, train and bus crowd, so this was reassuring. And--did I forget to mention?--I could smoke unhindered, too. The way things are going in L.A., any place that allows that, even if it is open-air anyway, gets my vote.\\n\\nWrite a one or two sentence summary.","response":"Hollywood & Highland is a new shopping and entertainment complex in Los Angeles that has been met with mixed reviews, but has some positive features such as impressive views of the city and a feeling of grandeur and fun in Babylon Court.

Isaac Benjamin became ensnared in a bureaucratic snafu that took away his Social Security disability payments for more than two years. The story of Martha, a woman from Sierra Leone, was more compelling. Beaten, raped and tortured in her politically repressive homeland, she knowingly used someone else's passport to escape to America, but was caught by immigration authorities upon her arrival. She desperately sought political asylum. Not the kind of cases that lead to ground-breaking upheavals in the law, but the kind of cases that are handled day in and day out by lawyers for the legally disenfranchised who have no where else to turn. The work of attorneys from Legal Services of New Jersey will be highlighted in a onehour documentary, \\"Quest for Justice,\\" to be aired 9 p.m. today on New Jersey Network. Produced by NYD2, a communications firm based in Somerset, the documentary features case histories of clients whose needs ranged from housing to fighting off deportation. Joseph, a 54-year-old naturalized citizen, turned to Legal Services when the landlord of his federally subsidized apartment complex in Elizabeth turned a deaf ear to his request for a ground-floor apartment. Having lost the use of his left arm in warding off the machete attack during a robbery attempt, Joseph said he found it increasingly difficult to negotiate the five flights of stairs lugging groceries or laundry on the frequent occasions when the building's elevator was out of order. \\"With this, it became impossible for me to stay upstairs,\\" he said, pointing to the scars on his forearm. \\"If I cannot carry my groceries or my laundry, how can I live?\\" \\"It was a compelling case,\\" said Legal Services attorney Stephen St. Hilaire. \\"The key for us -- and we have to make tough decisions all the time on whether to take a case -- was visualizing what he had to do to get to the fifth floor, struggling with a bag of groceries,\\" he said.

Consciousness is often referred to as a person's individual awareness and perception of their own thoughts, emotions, sensory experiences, and surroundings. While we can examine brain activity, neuronal connections, and chemical changes associated with conscious states, the exact nature of consciousness, and how it is connected to muscle action, remains elusive.\\n\\nMuscle action, on the other hand, relies on a complex interplay of various cellular, biochemical, and electrical processes. When the brain sends signals to the muscles, these signals are translated by motor neurons into electrical impulses, which then travel through the muscle fibers and trigger muscle contractions. Although we understand the basic mechanisms underlying this process, the intricate relationship between consciousness and muscle action is yet to be completely unraveled.\\n\\nAs for electricity, it is a form of energy arising from the existence, movement, or interactions of charged particles, such as electrons and protons. Electricity can be generated through various means such as fossil fuel combustion, nuclear reactions, renewable sources like solar and wind, and even physical and chemical processes like electrolysis.\\n\\nThe power generator, on the other hand, is a device designed to convert one form of energy, typically mechanical energy, into electrical energy. The process of generating electricity from a power generator usually involves a spinning rotor (a rotating part) driven by an external force, such as an engine powered by diesel or another fuel. As the rotor spins, it causes a magnetic field to rotate with it, and this rotating magnetic field generates an electric current in the surrounding coils of wire.\\n\\nThe relationship between electricity and the power generator can be explained through electromagnetic induction, a phenomenon first discovered by Michael Faraday in the early 19th century. Electromagnetic induction is the process by which a changing magnetic field creates an electric current in a conductor. So, while we may not know every detail about the nature of electricity, we do understand the basic principles of how it is generated in a power generator.\\n\\nIn summary, while we have made significant advancements in understanding the processes underlying muscle action and electricity, the concept of consciousness remains mysterious and challenging to decipher. Similarly, the connection between consciousness and muscle action and electricity and power generators is at different levels of comprehension, but each domain continues to be explored through ongoing scientific research and discovery."},{"question":"How are assets are divided in a divorce?\\n\\nHow are assets divided in a divorce in china?\\n\\nPlease tell me if those questions are the same.\\nSelect from:\\n[a]. no;\\n[b]. yes;","response":"To answer your question, I will first research how assets are divided in a divorce in general. Then, I will look into the specific laws regarding asset division in China. Finally, I will determine if the questions are the same or different based on the information I gathered. \\n\\nStep 1: Researching how assets are divided in a divorce in general\\nIn most countries, assets acquired during a marriage are considered marital property and can be subject to division upon divorce. The manner in which these assets are divided depends on the jurisdiction and its applicable laws. There are two main methods for dividing assets in a divorce: community property and equitable distribution. Community property states that assets are divided equally between the spouses, while equitable distribution takes into account factors such as the length of the marriage, each spouse's income, and other relevant factors to determine a fair division of assets.\\n\\nStep 2: Researching the specific laws regarding asset division in a divorce in China\\nIn China, the division of property in a divorce is governed by the Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China. According to the law, property acquired during the marriage is considered community property and should be divided equally between the spouses. However, exceptions may apply in cases of adultery, domestic violence, or if one spouse is deemed responsible for the dissolution of the marriage. Other factors such as each spouse's income, contributions to the household, and earning potential may also be considered when determining a fair division of assets. \\n\\nStep 3: Comparing the two questions and determining if they are the same\\nBased on the information gathered in steps 1 and 2, it is clear that the process of dividing assets in a divorce varies depending on the country and its applicable laws. Therefore, the answer is:\\n\\n[a]. no; the questions are not the same. Talking about assets division in general may involve different laws and processes across various countries, while the question specifically about China focuses on the laws and regulations applicable within the country."},{"question":"Please answer this question: where is the g protein linked receptor located?","response":"G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), also known as seven-(pass)-transmembrane domain receptors, 7TM receptors, heptahelical receptors, serpentine receptor, and G protein–linked receptors (GPLR), are a large and diverse group of protein receptors that are found across the eukaryotes - from yeast to humans. They play a vital role in many different biological functions.\\n\\nGPCRs are typically located in the cell membrane or plasma membrane that surrounds the cell. The plasma membrane, the boundary between the cell and its environment, makes an excellent location for proteins involved in communication and signaling, such as the GPCRs.\\n\\nThe term \\"G protein-coupled receptors\\" gives some indication as to how these proteins operate within the cell. They comprise of a single polypeptide that threads back and forth through the lipid bilayer of the plasma membrane seven times. This is why they are also referred to as seven-transmembrane receptors.\\n\\nThe structure of a GPCR consists of an extracellular N-terminus, followed by seven transmembrane helices connected by three extracellular and three intracellular loops ending with an intracellular C-terminus. The transmembrane helices create a pocket in the cell membrane in which signaling molecules, or ligands, can bind.\\n\\nUpon ligand binding, GPCRs undergo a conformational change, which allows it to act as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF). The GPCR exchanges the GDP bound to the G protein for a GTP. The G protein's α subunit, together with the bound GTP, can then dissociate from the β and γ subunits to further affect intracellular signaling proteins or target functional proteins directly depending on the α subunit type (Gαs, Gαi/o, Gαq/11, Gα12/13).\\n\\nTherefore, GPCRs can interact directly with “G proteins” on the interior of the cell when a signaling molecule binds to them. This initiates an internal signal transduction pathway which leads to various cellular responses.\\n\\nGPCRs are involved in a wide variety of physiological processes. Some examples of their physiological roles include: the senses of vision, smell, and taste, regulation of immune system activity and inflammation, behavior and mood regulation, and regulation of blood pressure and heart rate among many others. Their fundamental role in so many biological functions also makes them a common target for pharmacological intervention, with an estimated 34% of all prescription drugs targeting GPCRs."},{"question":"If \\"The girl in pink does a midair leg splits.\\" does that mean that \\"The girl in pink is flexible.\\"?\\nOptions:\\n- yes\\n- it is not possible to tell\\n- no A step-by-step solution is:\\n","response":"Yes, \\"The girl in pink does a midair leg splits\\" implies that \\"The girl in pink is flexible.\\" \\n\\nA step-by-step solution is:\\n\\n1.

Panasonic produces most of Leica 's branded digital point and shoot cameras in Japan , but not film cameras , the Leica M8 or Leica M9 digital rangefinder cameras , the X1 and X2 digital cameras or the Digital Modul R digital camera back for the Leica R9 film SLR . Panasonic showed a prototype of a planned 3D Lumix camera in September 2011 , saying that it would have twin 4x zoom lenses with folding optics and optical image stabilization for both video and still images . In November 2015 , Panasonic released a free firmware update for its Lumix G7 , GX8 and FZ300 cameras . The update gives the cameras a new mode called \`\` Post Focus , '' which can capture up to 49 points of focus in a single burst , and the mode works with any lens that offers autofocus capabilities .

What kind of dog is the Bernese Mountain Dog which is from the Swiss Alps?\\nAnswer:","response":"The Bernese Mountain Dog is a large, sturdy and strong breed of dog that originates from the Swiss Alps region. It belongs to the working group of dogs and more specifically, it is one of four breeds known as \\"Sennenhund\\" or \\"Swiss Mountain Dogs.\\" These dogs were primarily bred for various tasks such as herding, guarding, and draft work, like pulling carts.\\n\\nThe Bernese Mountain Dog has a distinctive tri-color coat, with a primarily black body, white chest, and rust-colored markings on the face, chest, and legs. Their coat is long, silky, and thick, which helps keep them warm in the cold mountainous climate from which they originated. The breed is well-muscled and has a powerful build, with males typically weighing between 80 to 115 pounds and standing 25 to 27.5 inches tall, and females weighing between 70 to 95 pounds and standing 23 to 26 inches tall.\\n\\nThe Bernese Mountain Dog is known for its gentle, affectionate, and calm demeanor, making it an excellent family companion. They are intelligent dogs that are eager to please, which makes them relatively easy to train. However, they also have a moderate energy level and need regular exercise to keep them mentally and physically healthy.\\n\\nIn summary, the Bernese Mountain Dog is a large, strong, and versatile working breed that hails from the Swiss Alps. They are characterized by their tri-color coat, gentle temperament, and a combination of strength and agility that made them effective herders, guards, and draft animals in their native region. Today, they are primarily kept as companion animals and are known to be loyal, affectionate, and easy to train."},{"question":"Choose your answer: is the following review positive or negative?\\n\\nThe only reason they are getting a bad rating from me is because twice I have gone there on a Saturday to get my dog's nails clipped and wasn't able to get it done.

Meet Josh Rosen.\\n\\n\\"He's really respectful,\\" said St. John Bosco senior guard Matthew Katnik. \\"He sits when he has to, stands when he has to.\\"\\n\\nThe UCLA-bound Rosen also stands out as a quarterback with Jewish roots. Though Benny Friedman and Sid Luckman -- playing before the 1950s -- made the Hall of Fame, Jay Fielder and Sage Rosenfels are the only two modern-era Jewish NFL quarterbacks.\\n\\nWhen asked if he takes pride in being part of a select group of noteworthy Jewish quarterbacks, Rosen, who calls himself \\"kind of an atheist\\" and whose mother is a Quaker Christian, brushes it aside.\\n\\n\\"(I) just happen to have that kind of background,\\" he said. \\"There really isn't too much to it.\\"\\n\\nThere, however, is no downplaying his accomplishments on the high school level. Rivals.com's No. 1 ranked quarterback (and No. 2 ranked player overall) in the 2015 class, Rosen has thrown for 5,287 yards, 61 touchdowns and 16 interceptions.\\n\\nThe 6-4, 210-pounder with a quick release and great pocket presence completed 68.6 percent of his passes for 3,200 yards, 39 touchdowns and just seven interceptions while leading Bosco to a 16-0 record and a California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) state title last year.\\n\\nRosen, 17, is one of the best quarterbacks in years from the Southern California area, a region that has produced Heisman Trophy winners, first-round draft picks and NFL starting quarterbacks.\\n\\n\\"I have seen a lot of quarterbacks in my career -- Mark Sanchez, Matt Leinart and Matt Barkley and some of those really, really talented guys,\\" Bosco coach Jason Negro said. \\"Josh is every bit as talented as those individuals.\\"\\n\\nLegendary Mater Dei High coach Bruce Rollinson, who coached Barkley and Leinart, saw Rosen's entire throwing repertoire -- the touch pass, the mid-range pass and the deep ball -- firsthand as he lost to Bosco twice, 24-2 and 34-7, last year.\\n\\n\\"He's everything that the press has been speaking about,\\" Rollinson said. \\"He's a force to be reckoned with.\\"\\n\\nThe senior will showcase his skills Aug. 22 when Bosco begins its season against Saint Louis (Hawaii) School at Honolulu's Aloha Stadium. There Rosen will orchestrate Bosco's explosive no-huddle, spread attack.\\n\\n\\"We are definitely at another level in terms of our ability to be sophisticated offensively,\\" Negro said. \\"We're able to do so much because of the intelligence of our quarterback.\\"\\n\\nHis intelligence extends off the field.\\n\\nThe son of a Penn-educated father -- spine surgeon Dr. Charles Rosen -- and a Princeton-educated mother -- former journalist Liz Lippincott -- Rosen has a cumulative 4.3 GPA. He took four AP classes and Honors Pre-Calculus last year. (He's not allowed to take as many AP classes this year since he would have to drop them halfway through, because of his early enrollment at UCLA.)\\n\\n\\"He doesn't mind helping other people that have trouble understanding something,\\" said Katnik, who took AP U.S. History and AP Physics with Rosen. \\"He's a really smart kid.\\"\\n\\nRosen's AP credits apply toward his UCLA degree requirement, part of the reason he wanted to attend the California state school. That allows him to either graduate in three years and enroll in the UCLA Anderson School of Management's MBA program as a senior -- or graduate in three years and enter the NFL.\\n\\nEither way he is prepared for the next phase in life.\\n\\nRosen seemed destined to play quarterback.\\n\\nBefore he turned 1, he was constantly throwing things from his crib, including one time when Lippincott entered his room, after his nap.\\n\\n\\"He launched his bottle,\\" she said. \\"I swear it almost knocked me out.\\"\\n\\nThough a natural passer, his first love was tennis. Sponsored by Wilson Sporting Goods, he earned a top 10 ranking in junior tennis and traveled the country for national tournaments. He even quit football in sixth and seventh grade to focus on tennis.\\n\\n\\"That was my sport,\\" Rosen said. \\"Tennis was what I really wanted to do.\\"\\n\\nBut because of the repetitive swings, he suffered overuse injuries (scapula dyskinesis and glenohumeral internal rotation deficit or GIRD) to his shoulder during winter nationals in Arizona.\\n\\nHe avoided surgery, and his throwing shoulder healed. But his tennis interest waned, and he sought a team-oriented sport at a school. (Most elite tennis players don't attend four-year colleges; many are even homeschooled through high school.)\\n\\nFootball became his game, and -- with the exception of playing on the Bosco team last year -- he has not played tennis competitively since junior high.\\n\\nHis athletic gifts come from his parents. A nationally ranked ice skater, Charles Rosen competed in the sport until he was 20 and narrowly missed making the Winter Olympics in the mid-1970s. Lippincott captained the Princeton lacrosse team.\\n\\n\\"There's a genetic component to athletes,\\" Dr. Rosen said. \\"And he's got two jocks as parents.\\"\\n\\nIn addition to the athletic bloodlines, Josh Rosen has an impressive lineage. His mom's great-great-great grandfather was Joseph Wharton.\\n\\nThe patriarch of one of the many Quaker families who became successful business entrepreneurs -- including the founders of Lloyds Banking Group and Barclays -- Wharton manufactured iron and nickel, co-founded Bethlehem Steel and established Wharton, University of Pennsylvania's renowned business school.\\n\\nThe Rosens vacation at the Whartons' Jamestown, Va., home every summer.\\n\\nJoseph Wharton's daughter, Joanna, married Philadelphia publisher J. Bertram Lippincott in 1887 and named their oldest son Joseph Wharton Lippincott.\\n\\nLiz's father was the last family CEO of noted publishing house J.B. Lippincott & Co, which was later acquired by Harper & Row, and Josh -- whose full name is Josh Ballinger Lippincott Rosen -- is named after the publisher's founder.\\n\\n\\"We don't usually use (the full name) just because it's kind of pretentious,\\" Liz joked. \\"It's just for the family sentimentality.\\"\\n\\nWhile combining those Quaker roots and Jewish upbringing, Josh had a Bar Mitzvah and attends Seder every Passover, but he also celebrates Christmas.\\n\\n\\"My parents are pretty awesome in letting me kind of pick my own path,\\" Rosen said, \\"and letting me believe what I want to believe.\\"\\n\\nPerhaps that's why Rosen has enjoyed learning the perspective of different religions and philosophies while at Bosco, the school recommended by friend and current Cal WR Bryce Treggs. Rosen recently completed a nine-page paper entitled \\"What is the good life?\\"\\n\\nBosco has about 820 students, and that includes Mormons, Baptists and several who hail from Polynesia. The football program has around 210 players, and last year's center, Elijah Zabludoff, was Jewish.\\n\\nThat gave the Catholic school the unusual distinction of having an all-Jewish, center-quarterback exchange in 2013.\\n\\nThough Bosco has provided a comfortable environment for someone raised Jewish, Rosen, who self-deprecatingly said he has \\"got a relatively big nose,\\" has received derision about that from opposing teams.\\n\\n\\"I've gotten some slurs here and there,\\" Rosen said, \\"but not anything too bad. It's all fun and games.\\"\\n\\nRosen declined to delve further. And whether it was just meaningless trash talk as he insinuated or something more nefarious, it's a far cry from the injustices experienced generations ago.\\n\\nDuring his late-teens, Charles Rosen remembers clearly outskating opponents -- but then ending up behind them in the final rankings. One notion was that the United States Figure Skating Association (USFSA) wanted to present less ethnic looking skaters as All-American champions during the Cold War era.\\n\\n\\"It used to be difficult in athletics sometimes if you were Jewish,\\" Dr. Rosen said. \\"That was 30 years ago, and things change.\\"\\n\\nRosen will enroll at UCLA early, starting college in the winter quarter after graduating high school, following the fall semester.\\n\\nThe opportunity to start as a true freshman was a major reason he chose UCLA. The Bruins are slated to have an open QB competition to replace Heisman Trophy candidate Brett Hundley, with whom Rosen visits whenever he swings by the UCLA campus.\\n\\nBosco runs a similar offense to UCLA. The Bosco staff has visited that school, along with Oregon and Arizona State, during the past couple years, and those programs greatly influenced Bosco's attack, which is predicated on its quick pace.\\n\\n\\"That's one of the reasons Josh is going to be such a good fit at UCLA,\\" Negro said.\\n\\nDespite possessing the large frame of a dropback passer, Rosen is adept at running the zone-read. He burned Mater Dei during the teams' playoff game last year, breaking tackles to the tune of 11 carries for 113 yards.\\n\\n\\"He really had a tremendous all-around game -- running, throwing,\\" Rollinson said. \\"He was on fire.\\"\\n\\nThat shows that even when high school opponents try to disguise coverages on the back end, Rosen will find a way to lead his team to victory.\\n\\nIt's a trait he began showcasing as a sophomore, after playing on the JV as a high school freshman.\\n\\nOn fourth-and-goal with 3:11 remaining and Bosco down 17-10 to Notre Dame (Calif.) High in the 2012 CIF Pac-5 Division Quarterfinals, Rosen rolled right and connected on a nine-yard, pylon route to A.J. Holman to tie the game. He then led the team down the field to score the game-winning touchdown with 1:19 left.\\n\\n\\"That was pretty much the defining moment,\\" Negro said. \\"We knew he was going to be special.\\"\\n\\nRosen is certainly an exceptional case, but while many may focus on a talented Jewish quarterback leading a Catholic school, ideologies are secondary for the heralded passer.\\n\\n\\"They could be praying to Zeus every time at those games,\\" Dr. Rosen said. \\"And he wouldn't care as long he gets to throw a football.\\"\\n\\n-- Follow Jeff Fedotin on Twitter @JFedotin.\\n\\nLike us on facebook, follow us on twitter, and subscribe to our YouTube channel.\\n\\nVIDEO OF THE DAY:This Chevy Truck Is A Tailgating Machine\\nWhat are the most important parts of this news article?","response":"This news article is about Josh Rosen, a very talented high school quarterback who is Jewish and attends a Catholic school.

A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command.

There are numerous variables at play, including genetics, lifestyle choices, environmental factors, and unforeseeable accidents or events.\\n\\nBeginning with genetics, we know that an individual's genes can predispose them to certain health conditions or diseases, which can indirectly influence when they may die. However, genetics is not deterministic, and many other factors play a role in whether someone will develop a particular condition or not.\\n\\nLifestyle choices are another significant factor when considering a person's life expectancy. Choices like diet, exercise, and substance use can all impact a person's risk of developing health conditions that could potentially lead to death. However, a person can make positive lifestyle changes that could reduce the risk of health complications, and it is impossible to say with certainty that these choices will never change.\\n\\nEnvironmental factors, such as exposure to pollution, extreme weather events, or living conditions, can also influence a person's health and lifespan. While these factors can have measurable impacts on life expectancy, predicting the exact date and time of death based on these factors is not viable.\\n\\nLastly, unforeseeable accidents or events, such as accidents, natural disasters, or even acts of violence, can lead to sudden death without any prior indication. These occurrences cannot be reliably predicted using current technology.\\n\\nTaking all of these factors into account, it becomes evident that predicting the exact date and time of a person's death is an immensely complex and multifaceted endeavor. Our current technology and knowledge can estimate life expectancy based on a variety of factors, but these predictions are necessarily probabilistic and ever-changing due to the countless variables that influence a person's life trajectory. Therefore, the answer to the question would be: it is not possible to tell."},{"question":"Please briefly summarize this news article:\\n\\nMan facing animal cruelty charge for riding horse from SC to Key West after divorce\\n\\nMIAMI – A man trying to ride his horse from South Carolina to Key West following his divorce is now facing an animal cruelty charge.\\n\\nThe Miami-Herald reported that 36-year-old Chris Emerson left his Greenwood, South Carolina home about five months after getting divorced and crashing his truck.

She is voiced by Julie Kavner and first appeared on television in The Tracey Ullman Show short \\"Good Night\\" on April 19, 1987. Marge was created and designed by cartoonist Matt Groening while he was waiting in the lobby of James L. Brooks' office.\\nContext: Matt Groening first conceived Marge and the rest of the Simpson family in 1986 in the lobby of producer James L. Brooks' office. Groening had been called to pitch a series of animated shorts for The Tracey Ullman Show, and had intended to present an adaptation of his Life in Hell comic strip. When he realized that animating Life in Hell would require him to rescind publication rights, Groening decided to go in another direction and hurriedly sketched out his version of a dysfunctional family, naming the characters after members of his own family. Marge was named after Groening's mother Margaret \\"Marge\\" Groening, who has said she bears little similarity to the character, stating, \\"It's really weird to have people think you're a cartoon.\\" Marge's beehive hairstyle was inspired by the titular Bride in Bride of Frankenstein and the style that Margaret Groening wore during the 1960s, although her hair was never blue.  Marge debuted with the rest of the Simpson family on April 19, 1987, in The Tracey Ullman Show short \\"Good Night\\". In 1989, the shorts were adapted into The Simpsons, a half-hour series airing on the Fox Network. Marge and the Simpson family remained the main characters on this new show.  Matt Groening believes that episodes featuring Marge are among the most difficult episodes to write. Bill Oakley believes that the \\"junior\\" writers are usually given Marge episodes because he and writing partner Josh Weinstein were given several to write during their first season. During the third season of the show, most of the writers focused on Bart and Homer, so David M. Stern decided to write a Marge episode, which became \\"Homer Alone\\" (season three, 1992). He felt that they could achieve a \\"deeper vein\\" of comedy in an episode where Marge has a nervous breakdown, and James L. Brooks quickly approved.\\nQuestion: What was his process in creating her?\\n\\nAnswer:","response":"The process of Matt Groening creating Marge Simpson started when he was called to pitch a series of animated shorts for The Tracey Ullman Show in 1986. Initially, Groening had planned to adapt his comic strip, Life in Hell, but upon realizing that he would have to give up the publication rights, decided to go with a different concept.\\n\\n1. Conceiving the idea of a dysfunctional family: Groening decided to create an animated dysfunctional family, which later became the Simpsons. This idea came to him in the lobby of producer James L. Brooks' office, where he hurriedly sketched the first versions of the characters.\\n\\n2. Naming and drawing inspirations from his own family: Groening drew inspirations for the names and characteristics of the characters from his own family members. Marge Simpson was named after his own mother, Margaret \\"Marge\\" Groening. However, his mother stated that she bears little similarity to the character.\\n\\n3. Designing Marge's iconic appearance: The most notable feature of Marge's design is her high beehive hairstyle. Groening took inspiration from the Bride of Frankenstein for this hairstyle, which was also a popular look that his mother adorned during the 1960s. He added his unique twist to the design by coloring her hair blue.\\n\\n4. Character development: Marge made her first appearance on television in The Tracey Ullman Show short \\"Good Night\\" on April 19, 1987. As the series evolved into its own half-hour show, The Simpsons, in 1989, Marge's character was further developed alongside the rest of the Simpson family as the main characters.\\n\\n5. Writing challenges: Matt Groening has admitted that episodes featuring Marge are among the hardest to write. Writers often struggle to capture her nuances and depth as a character, leading to the assignment of Marge-centric episodes to \\"junior\\" writers, as Bill Oakley has mentioned. This ultimately created opportunities for these writers to explore deeper veins of comedy as seen in the episode \\"Homer Alone\\" (1992), where Marge experiences a nervous breakdown.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the process of creating Marge Simpson involved Matt Groening's spur-of-the-moment decision to sketch an animated family, drawing inspirations from his own family for character names and traits, designing an iconic appearance for Marge, and further developing her character in the series for added depth and nuance."},{"question":"\\n\\nDo you think the right answer to the question \\"what are the largest group of animals?\\" is \\"insects\\", given that  the largest group of animals are insects?\\nAnswer:","response":"Yes, the right answer to the question \\"what are the largest group of animals?\\" is \\"insects,\\" based on the fact that insects constitute the largest group of animals on Earth.\\n\\nInsects are part of a larger classification called arthropods that also includes spiders, crustaceans, and other invertebrates with exoskeletons and jointed legs.

The tiebreaker race is scheduled for one week later at the (fictional) Los Angeles International Speedway in California. Lightning is desperate to win the race, since it would not only make him the first rookie to win a championship, but also allow him to leave the unglamorous sponsorship of Rust-Eze and allow him to take The King's place as the sponsored car of the lucrative Dinoco team. Eager to start practice in California as soon as possible, he pushes his big rig, Mack, to travel all night long. While McQueen is sleeping, the exhausted Mack drifts off and is startled by a gang of four reckless street racers, causing McQueen to fall out the back of the trailer and onto the road. McQueen wakes in the middle of traffic and speeds off the highway to find Mack, only to end up in the run-down desert town of Radiator Springs, while inadvertently ruining the pavement of its main road. After being arrested and impounded overnight (while guarded by a rusty, but friendly, tow truck named Mater), McQueen is ordered by the town judge, Doc Hudson, to leave town immediately.

The aquatic Cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and porpoises) evolved from even-toed ungulate ancestors, and therefore modern taxonomic classification combines Artiodactyla and Cetacea into Cetartiodactyla.  - The sheep (\\"Ovis aries\\") is a quadrupedal, ruminant mammal typically kept as livestock. Like all ruminants, sheep are members of the order Artiodactyla, the even-toed ungulates. Although the name \\"sheep\\" applies to many species in the genus \\"Ovis\\", in everyday usage it almost always refers to \\"Ovis aries\\". Numbering a little over one billion, domestic sheep are also the most numerous species of sheep. An adult female sheep is referred to as a \\"ewe\\", an intact male as a \\"ram\\" or occasionally a \\"tup\\", a castrated male as a \\"wether\\", and a younger sheep as a \\"lamb\\".  - Kenya, officially the Republic of Kenya, is a country in Africa and a founding member of the East African Community (EAC). Its capital and largest city is Nairobi. Kenya's territory lies on the equator and overlies the East African Rift covering a diverse and expansive terrain that extends roughly from Lake Victoria to Lake Turkana (formerly called Lake Rudolf) and further south-east to the Indian Ocean. It is bordered by Tanzania to the south and southwest, Uganda to the west, South Sudan to the north-west, Ethiopia to the north and Somalia to the north-east. Kenya covers , and had a population of approximately 45 million people in July 2014.  - Tanzania , officially the United Republic of Tanzania, is a country in Eastern Africa within the African Great Lakes region. Parts of the country are in Southern Africa. It is bordered by Kenya and Uganda to the north; Rwanda, Burundi, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the west; Zambia, Malawi, and Mozambique to the south; and by the Indian Ocean to the east. Mount Kilimanjaro, Africa's highest mountain, is in northeastern Tanzania.  - The lion (\\"Panthera leo\\") is one of the big cats in the genus \\"Panthera\\" and a member of the family Felidae. The commonly used term African lion collectively denotes the several subspecies in Africa. With some males exceeding in weight, it is the second-largest living cat after the tiger. Wild lions currently exist in sub-Saharan Africa and in India (where an endangered remnant population resides in Gir Forest National Park). In ancient historic times, their range was in most of Africa, including North Africa, and across Eurasia from Greece and southeastern Europe to India. In the late Pleistocene, about 10,000 years ago, the lion was the most widespread large land mammal after humans: \\"Panthera leo spelaea\\" lived in northern and western Europe and \\"Panthera leo atrox\\" lived in the Americas from the Yukon to Peru. The lion is classified as a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), having seen a major population decline in its African range of 3050% over two decades during the second half of the twentieth century. Lion populations are untenable outside designated reserves and national parks. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes of concern. Within Africa, the West African lion population is particularly endangered.  - Nairobi is the capital and largest city of Kenya. It is famous for having the Nairobi National Park, the world's only game reserve found within a major city. The city and its surrounding area also form Nairobi County, whose current governor is Evans Kidero and Deputy Governor is Jonathan Mueke.  - A country is a region that is identified as a distinct national entity in political geography. A country may be an independent sovereign state or one that is occupied by another state, as a non-sovereign or formerly sovereign political division, or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated people with distinct political characteristics. Regardless of the physical geography, in the modern internationally accepted legal definition as defined by the League of Nations in 1937 and reaffirmed by the United Nations in 1945, a resident of a country is subject to the independent exercise of legal jurisdiction.  - The domestic goat (\\"Capra aegagrus hircus\\") is a subspecies of goat domesticated from the wild goat of southwest Asia and Eastern Europe.  - East Africa or Eastern Africa is the easterly region of the African continent, variably defined by geography or geopolitics. In the United Nations Statistics Division scheme of geographic regions, 20 territories constitute Eastern Africa:  - A herd is a social grouping of certain animals of the same species, either wild or domestic. The form of collective animal behavior associated with this is referred to as \\"herding\\".  - Bison are large, even-toed ungulates in the genus \\"Bison\\" within the subfamily Bovinae.  - Uganda (or ), officially the Republic of Uganda, is a landlocked country in East Africa. It is bordered to the east by Kenya, to the north by South Sudan, to the west by the Democratic Republic of the Congo, to the south-west by Rwanda, and to the south by Tanzania. Uganda is the world's second most populous landlocked country after Ethiopia. The southern part of the country includes a substantial portion of Lake Victoria, shared with Kenya and Tanzania. Uganda is in the African Great Lakes region. Uganda also lies within the Nile basin, and has a varied but generally a modified equatorial climate.  - An antelope is a member of a number of even-toed ungulate species indigenous to various regions in Africa and Eurasia. Antelopes comprise a wastebasket taxon (miscellaneous group) within the family Bovidae, encompassing those Old World species that are not cattle, sheep, buffalo, bison, or goats. A group of antelope is called a herd.  - Eurasia is the combined continental landmass of Europe and Asia. The term is a portmanteau of its constituent continents. Located primarily in the Northern and Eastern Hemispheres, it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Pacific Ocean to the east, the Arctic Ocean to the north, and by Africa, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Indian Ocean to the south. The division between Europe and Asia as two different continents is a historical and cultural construct, with no clear physical separation between them; thus, in some parts of the world, Eurasia is recognized as the largest of five or six continents. In geology, Eurasia is often considered as a single rigid megablock. However, the rigidity of Eurasia is debated based on the paleomagnet data.  - The African Great Lakes are a series of lakes constituting the part of the Rift Valley lakes in and around the East African Rift. They include Lake Victoria, the second largest fresh water lake in the world by area, and Lake Tanganyika, the world's second largest freshwater lake by volume and depth. Collectively, they contain 31,000 km (7400 cu mi) of water, which is more than either Lake Baikal or the North American Great Lakes, and constitutes about 25% of the planet's unfrozen surface fresh water.  - The Democratic Republic of the Congo , also known as DR Congo, DRC, DROC, East Congo, Congo-Kinshasa, or simply the Congo is a country located in Central Africa. From 1971 to 1997 it was named, and is sometimes still called Zaire, and from 1908 to 1960 it was called the Belgian Congo. The DRC borders the Central African Republic, and South Sudan to the north; Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi and Tanzania to the east; Zambia and Angola to the south; the Republic of the Congo to the west and the Atlantic Ocean to the southwest. It is the second-largest country in Africa by area and eleventh largest in the world. With a population of over 80 million, the Democratic Republic of the Congo is the most populated officially Francophone country, the fourth most-populated nation in Africa and the eighteenth most populated country in the world.

It now seems that a new fitness title is released every other month. While their sheer numbers certainly prove that this genre of game has become big business, no game of this type has yet presented a credible challenge to the Wii Fit franchise's dominance of this market. The only title that has come anywhere near close is EA Sports Active which was released earlier this year and has since sold nearly two million units. Now, with the festive season upon us, and the promise of an ever expanding girth brought on by parties, dinners and calorie-rich Christmas pudding, EA has released a sequel in the form of EA Sports Active More Workouts. If the title seems unimaginative, take heart in the fact that at least this fitness game does exactly what it says on the box.\\n\\nEA Sports Active More Workouts doesn't really offer an experience that differs all that much from its predecessor. Rather, it builds on the solid foundations of EA Sports Active, while expanding its content to include larger workout challenges, stretching and cool-down periods and exercises that target more areas of the body. The overall formula here is the same as before; players use the Wii Remote and Nunchuck in conjunction with a resistance strap and a leg band to perform exercises that are aimed at toning muscles and burning fat. At the time of this writing, EA Sports Active More Workouts is only available as a stand-alone entity; newcomers to the franchise will have to fork over around £15 for the game's accessories, which are currently sold separately. It's unclear at this time whether it will ever be sold as a bundle, but the cost of EA Sports Active: More Workouts and the EA Sports Active accessory pack add up to the same cost as the first game anyway. Veterans, for their part, will save a little bit of cash and will be able to import their fitness profile from EA Sports Active over to their new game.\\n\\nAside from a couple of tweaks, the experience of exercising is the same as before. Players tuck the Nunchuck into the pocket of the leg-strap in order to perform exercises below the waist (such as lunges) and most of the longer cardio exercises. The Wii Remote and Nunchuck are used for upper body exercises, both on their own (for cardio boxing or squash) and with the resistance strap for toning exercises (bicep curls, lateral raises and so forth). There is the option to use a balance board, although owning one isn't essential to play the game. Each exercise is introduced with a brief video in which the player is shown what to do and also what position to stand in. Players can set the difficulty of their exercises as well as set goals for burning calories or hours spent working out. All throughout the workouts, the players will be encouraged by a virtual trainer whose gender they can pick from the start, and whose psychotically cheerful demeanour will eventually cause them to fantasise about hurling a brick through their television's screen.\\n\\nWith the core experience basically untouched, EA Sports Active More Workouts differs from it predecessor by the depth of new content and a handful of cosmetic changes. Owners of the first game will notice a couple of tweaks right from the loading screen; the soundtrack is a little more sedate and all of the scenery has changed. The avatars now mirror the player's activities in an island paradise which not only looks better than the slightly bland track and field environment from the first game, it also offers some new activities. Another big change is that the first game's 30-day challenge has been replaced by a new 6-week challenge, presumably to increase the possibility that exercising in the living room will become more of a long-term commitment. Once again, the challenge also encourages players to fill in details about their daily diet and activities to help build up a more accurate trajectory of their progress. However, all set workouts now have warm up and cool down periods, which corrects a potentially harmful omission from the first game – especially for players who habitually worked out on the hardest settings.\\n\\nThe new game offers around 35 new exercises in total; some are evolutions of exercises in EA Sports Active (such as cardio boxing with moving targets) and some are only available with the balance board (such as step-ups). There are also a lot of brand new exercises which use the peripherals in new and interesting ways and allow players to target areas of muscles on their bodies. Probably the most noticeable collection of new exercises – which were conspicuous by their absence in the first game – are those that target stomach muscles such as crunches and (horrendous) leg raises. There are also a large selection of exercises which take advantage of the game's tropical paradise setting such as water skiing, paddle surfing and obstacle courses involving flotation devices.\\n\\nUnfortunately EA Sports Active More Workouts carries over a couple of gameplay drawbacks from the original title. The Nunchuck and Wii sometimes takes longer to register one leg than the other during lunge exercises. The journal entries are improved somewhat, but they're still too just general to offer any worthwhile nutritional advice and the workouts have too much of a heavy reliance on calorie counting. As far as the peripherals are concerned, the fabric leg-strap is still a solid piece of kit, but the resistance strap is fairly useless as a toning implement. It's a shame that the new game doesn't offer a better peripheral that could actually help build muscle on the upper part of the body – especially when the rest of the game seems to offer a more well-rounded exercising experience than its predecessor. The only other problem the game has is that it may seem like a bit of a cash-grab to anyone who bought the first instalment in the series; asking full price for what could be offered as DLC (at a substantially lower cost) on either Xbox Live or PSN may cause a little consternation.\\n\\nThen again, maybe not. The arrival of EA Sports Active More Workouts barely six months after its predecessor hasn't caused fans of the original to start a boycott, after all - which if anything proves fitness games just don't have the same hold over players as zombie shooters. Niggles aside, it's a huge improvement on EA Sports Active. While EA hasn't tinkered too much with the foundations of the franchise, the tweaks, tucks and additional content make EA Sports Active More Workouts feel like a far more effective fitness package than its predecessor. For players who want to work up a sweat in front of their consoles it's one of the best titles available.\\nWhat are the most important parts of this text?","response":"EA Sports Active More Workouts is a new exercise video game for Nintendo Wii. It has more workouts and routines, including stretching exercises, stomach muscle targeting, and creative uses of the game's resistance strap. The game keeps the fun aspect of exercising while offering new settings and activities. Some improvements have been made compared to the previous game, but there are still some drawbacks. The game is a good option for people who want to work up a sweat while playing video games."},{"question":"Definition: In this task, you're given a context, a question, three options, and an answer.

Given the context: How would Aubrey feel afterwards?  Possible answers: worried about the bully, terrified of the bully, frightened\\nAnswer:","response":"After getting a bully suspended for bullying, Aubrey likely experienced a mix of emotions upon seeing the bully again at school. While her initial response might be relief that her actions led to consequences for the bully, she could still experience various levels of anxiety or fear, taking into account different factors surrounding the incident and the bully's return.\\n\\nAubrey might feel worried about the bully for several reasons:\\n\\n1. Concern for the bully's well-being: Understanding that everyone has a unique story, Aubrey may worry about the reasons that led to the bully's behavior in the first place – be it family issues, emotional struggles, or other underlying problems. Seeing the bully back at school may evoke concern if Aubrey wonders whether these issues have been addressed and whether the bully will cope better now.\\n\\n2. Empathy for the bully's experience: Aubrey might also worry about how the suspension affected the bully and her self-esteem. Even though the discipline was earned, Aubrey may empathize with the challenges the bully may need to overcome in order to reintegrate into school life – such as loss of friendships and potentially having to rebuild trust with teachers and classmates.\\n\\nAt the same time, Aubrey could feel terrified or frightened of the bully:\\n\\n1. Fear of retaliation: Given that her actions led to the bully's suspension, Aubrey might feel scared that the bully will seek revenge upon their return, possibly through verbal or physical aggression, or through a more subtle form of harassment.\\n\\n2. Anxiety about social standing: No matter the justification for her actions, Aubrey might still face judgment or negative reactions from her peers, causing her to fear being labeled a \\"snitch\\" or outcast. This could make her feel terrified, not only of the bully but also of being ostracized by her classmates.\\n\\n3. Uncertainty about the situation: The unknown can be terrifying, and Aubrey may not be aware of what happened during the bully's suspension. Were steps taken to address the behavior? Did the bully experience a shift in attitude? Being unsure of any changes could provoke fear in Aubrey when she encounters the bully again.\\n\\nOverall, Aubrey's feelings after seeing the bully at school could include being worried, terrified, or frightened, depending on her emotional connection to the bully, her character traits, and the context surrounding the suspension and subsequent events. She might experience a combination of these feelings, with their intensity and focus shifting over time as the situation develops."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Fact 1: Pollination is the fertilization step in the sexual reproduction of plants.

Autom is the work of Intuitive Automata, a company based in Sha Tin which claims to be a pioneer in commercial socially-interactive robots. The robot, which stands around 38 centimeters tall, has a head that swivels  , blue eyes, and a touch screen which allows the user to input information daily about exercise and diet Its creators say Autom will have a daily conversation with its user lasting up to five minutes, giving feedback and encouragement.Over time, it will interact more with the user as it gathers more information about them. Cory Krdd, a research team manager with the Federal Emergency Management Agency claims research has shown that people find robots a more reliable source of information than on-screen-based character. In a controlled study in Pittsburgh City Council, 15 dieters were given Autom for six weeks. Another 15 received a touch-screen computer with identical software and 15 were given a paper log.The study found, people using the robot are more likely to stick with their diets longer, in fact twice as long as those using just a paper log. \\"While not one person among the computer or paper groups continued past six weeks, most who had Autom did not want to give her back at the conclusion of the study,\\" he said.

But the next night, Lillian is found to have died of a heart attack. The Liptons are surprised by the death because Lillian seemed so healthy. The Liptons are also surprised by Paul's cheerfulness so soon after his wife's death. Carol becomes suspicious and starts to investigate, even inventing an excuse to visit him. An urn she finds in Paul's apartment contradicts Paul's story that Lillian had been buried. Larry becomes frustrated with Carol, telling her she's \\"inventing a mystery\\". Carol sneaks into Paul's apartment while he's away and finds more telling signs. Lillian's urn is missing, there are two tickets to Paris and hotel reservations with a woman named Helen Moss.

As we explained, both were involved during 1998 and 1999 in preparing to attack a ship off the coast of Yemen with a boatload of explosives. They had originally targeted a commercial vessel, specifically an oil tanker, but  Bin Laden urged them to look for a U.S.warship instead. In January 2000, their team had attempted to attack a warship in the port of Aden, but the attempt failed when the suicide boat sank. More than nine months later, on October 12,2000, al Qaeda operatives in a small boat laden with explosives attacked a U.S. Navy destroyer, the USS Cole. The blast ripped a hole in the side of the Cole, killing 17 members of the ship's crew and wounding at least 40. The plot, we now know, was a full-fledged al Qaeda operation, supervised directly by  Bin Laden. He chose the target and location of the attack, selected the suicide operatives, and provided the money needed to purchase explosives and equipment. Nashiri was the field commander and managed the operation in Yemen. Khallad helped in Yemen until he was arrested in a case of mistaken identity and freed with  Bin Laden's help, as we also mentioned earlier. Local al Qaeda coordinators included Jamal al Badawi and Fahd al Quso, who was supposed to film the attack from a nearby apartment. The two suicide operatives chosen were Hassan al Khamri and Ibrahim al Thawar, also known as Nibras. Nibras and Quso delivered money to Khallad in Bangkok during Khallad's January 2000 trip to Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok. In September 2000,  Bin Laden reportedly told Nashiri that he wanted to replace Khamri and Nibras. Nashiri was angry and disagreed, telling others he would go to Afghanistan and explain to  Bin Laden that the new operatives were already trained and ready to conduct the attack. Prior to departing, Nashiri gave Nibras and Khamri instructions to execute the attack on the next U.S.warship that entered the port of Aden. \\n\\nQuestion: \\"Who provided the funds for the attack on the USS Cole?\\"\\n\\nAnswer: \\"Al Qaeda Chief\\"\\n\\nIs this answer to the question correct?\\nOPT:\\nA). no\\nB). yes","response":"B). yes\\n\\nThe answer to the question is correct.

The tram stop was named after the street , which had been named for Werner Stauffacher in 1893 . Stauffacher is officially just the name of the tram stop , not the square , and there was formerly a Stauffacherplatz some 200 m farther along the street towards the Sihl ( named in 1898 ) . Since the name of the tram stop induced common usage to associate Stauffacherplatz with the tram stop , leading to confusion with the actual Stauffacherplatz , the latter was renamed to Ernst - Nobs - Platz in 2003 . St. Jakob was the site of a sick - house outside the town of Zurich and an associated chapel since the 11th century . The first historical mention of the St. Jakob church dates to 1221 . It was the site of the Battle of St. Jakob an der Sihl in 1443 . In 1677 , the sick - house was transformed into a Pfrundhaus ( senior citizens ' residence ) , disestablished in 1842 .

In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague.  - The Sihl is a Swiss river that rises near the Druesberg mountain in the canton of Schwyz, and eventually flows into the Limmat in the centre of the city of Zürich. It has a length of , including the Sihlsee reservoir, through which the river flows. Water is abstracted from the river at the Sihlsee, leading to decreased downstream water flows and a consequent negative impact on water quality.  - Aegidius (or Giles or Glig) Tschudi (5 February 150528 February 1572) was an eminent member of the Tschudi family, of Glarus, Switzerland.

Many people who live into their hundreds live in the Mediterranean , so their diet, which is high in fruits, vegetables, nuts, and healthy fats like olive oil, gets a lot of attention. The diet has been linked to a healthier older age, lower risk for heart disease, and even protection against memory loss.  Education is related to a longer life. A 2012 report from the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics found that people with a bachelor's degree or higher live about nine years longer than people who don't graduate high school. James Smith, a health economist at the RAND Corporation, is also a supporter of the argument for staying in school for better life expectancy. His findings show education should be an even bigger factor than race and income. Educated people are more likely to land better jobs, plan for their future, and make healthier lifestyle choices. Being a hard worker doesn't necessarily mean job-stress will harm you. The Longevity Study found that plenty of hard workers lived long lives. \\"Skeptics  may wonder if hard workers really are enjoying life.\\" the authors write, \\"We found that productive, hardworking people (even in old age) are not stressed or miserable, but tend to be happier, healthier, and more socially connected than their less productive peers.\\" Having a strong social group is associated with a longer life.

She says it's like a \\"lightning bolt\\" that came out of nowhere, and she is sad because she thinks Mr. Petraeus is a good person.\\n\\nAnother man named Pete King, who's in charge of a group called the House Homeland Security Committee, wants Mr. Petraeus to still help them understand what happened in Benghazi. \\n\\nThis whole thing has gotten people talking about other things too, like something called the \\"fiscal cliff.\\" This is a big, important money problem the country is facing, and a man named Bill Kristol thinks that the Republicans should agree to a plan that helps people who make less than a certain amount of money.\\n\\nThere are also some people, like Chuck Schumer and Lyndsey Graham, who are working together to figure out how to fix a big thing called \\"immigration reform.\\" This is about making rules for people who come to our country from other places.

This game is well known by Packer fans for its ending. Towards the end, the Packers tried to lateral the ball to get down the field and score a game-winning touchdown. The play looked like a total bust, as Aaron Rodgers was wrapped up and brought down, seemingly ending the game. However, the Lions were called for a controversial facemask penalty that gave the Packers one more chance on an untimed down. On the next play, Rodgers threw a 61-yard Hail Mary pass to Richard Rodgers to end the game. The ball traveled 68 yards through the air, making it the longest touchdown pass in NFL history by air. The pass gave the Packers a 27-23 win. Some Packers fans refer to this play as \\"Hail Rodgers\\" or \\"Rodgers to Rodgers\\".\\nAnswer this question: Which player caught the longest pass of the game?","response":"The player who caught the longest pass of the game was Richard Rodgers. He caught a 61-yard Hail Mary pass from Aaron Rodgers to win the game for the Packers."},{"question":"How does the sentence end?\\n\\nThe police were looking for Neil and not Nelson, by reason that ","response":"The police were looking for Neil and not Nelson, by reason that Neil was the one who took the cookies without asking, while Nelson was playing nicely with his toys."},{"question":"(LT) Arvoisa puhemies, tämä on todellakin varsin monimutkainen kysymys.\\n\\nWhich language is this?","response":"This is the Finnish language, which is a Uralic language primarily spoken in Finland.

While acceptance rates fluctuate yearly, it is important to consider several factors that contribute to the increased competitiveness during the RD pool.\\n\\nFirstly, U-M has an Early Action (EA) admissions program that allows students to apply earlier, usually in November, with decisions being released by mid-December. The students admitted through EA tend to have a higher acceptance rate compared to RD applicants. One reason for this is that EA applicants demonstrate a keen interest in attending U-M, which is considered an asset by the admissions committee.\\n\\nSecondly, a significant portion of the incoming class is filled through EA, leaving fewer spots available for students applying in the RD pool. Consequently, the RD pool becomes more competitive as there are more applicants vying for the limited remaining openings.\\n\\nThirdly, the RD pool often comprises a larger and more diverse group of applicants, thus increasing the competition. As a renowned public university, U-M attracts numerous high-achieving students with various backgrounds, experiences, and academic achievements. This diversity means that the RD applicants must stand out among their peers to secure one of the remaining seats in the class.\\n\\nIn summary, admission to the University of Michigan could indeed be more competitive during the regular decision pool due to factors such as Early Action admissions, limited available spots, and the diverse pool of applicants.\\n\\n---\\n\\nAnswer 2: Mike Pence's potential roles and actions as a president or vice president\\n\\nMike Pence, the former Vice President of the United States (2017-2021) under President Donald Trump, would likely bring a combination of his conservative beliefs, political experience, and loyalty to the Republican Party if he were to serve as a president or vice president again.\\n\\nAs a president, Mike Pence would likely emphasize the following:\\n\\n1. Strong commitment to conservative values: He would follow through on policies that align with traditional Republican values, such as reducing taxes, limiting government intervention, and supporting pro-life stances.\\n\\n2. Foreign policy: Mike Pence has expressed his support for a strong military presence globally and has focused on maintaining America's relationships with its long-standing allies. It is reasonable to assume that he would continue to prioritize these areas if he were to become president.\\n\\n3. Economy: As a strong advocate for free-market principles, Pence would likely focus on economic policies that encourage business growth, reduce regulations, and stimulate job creation.\\n\\n4. Social issues: Pence is known for his conservative stance on social issues, including advocating for religious freedom and opposing same-sex marriage and LGBTQ+ rights. As president, it is possible that his administration would make decisions reflecting these viewpoints.\\n\\nIf Mike Pence were to serve as vice president again, his priorities might include:\\n\\n1. Supporting the president's agenda: Pence's primary role as vice president would be to support the president's policies and initiatives, representing and defending the administration's objectives.\\n\\n2. Presiding over the Senate: As vice president, Pence would be responsible for presiding over the Senate, casting tie-breaking votes when necessary, and keeping order in the legislative body.\\n\\n3. Advising the president: Pence's experience in politics, including his time as a Congressman and Governor of Indiana, would make him a valuable advisor to the president, providing input on domestic and international issues.\\n\\n---\\n\\nIn conclusion, the answers to these two questions are different, as they address unrelated topics. The first answer discusses the competitiveness of University of Michigan admissions in the regular decision pool, while the second answer outlines the potential actions and priorities of Mike Pence if he were to serve as a president or vice president again."},{"question":"Add punctuation to the following sentence: The Augustinus Foundation Augustinus Fonden awarded Na Bolom Denmark with 10000 danish kroner on October 5th 2009 to restorethe buildings of Na Bolom in MexicoThe donat\\n\\n","response":"The Augustinus Foundation (Augustinus Fonden) awarded Na Bolom, Denmark, with 10,000 Danish kroner on October 5th, 2009, to restore the buildings of Na Bolom in Mexico.

This controversial topic was a part of his lesson on Jim Crow racial segregation laws and their impact on African Americans. During the class, Barron presented a video that depicted white performers from the time utilizing blackface to imitate African Americans, an offensive and derogatory practice.\\n\\nThe suspension occurred two weeks prior when an assistant principal at Monroe Middle School attended Barron's class and observed the lesson in progress. As a result, Barron was placed on paid administrative leave pending further investigation. This decision sparked outrage among both parents and students at the school, who organized a protest in support of the veteran teacher.\\n\\nAs a dedicated educator with 36 years of experience, it is understandable that many found the suspension to be an overreaction. The lesson on blackface and racial segregation was designed to educate students about the historical context and the prejudice that was prevalent during that era. Presenting this information in a comprehensive manner allows students to better understand and learn from the mistakes of the past.\\n\\nAfter the protest by parents and pupils, Barron was allowed back into the classroom to continue teaching. In a statement released through his lawyer, Barron expressed his gratitude, saying, \\"I am very pleased that I will be allowed to return to the classroom and the students that I have dedicated the past 36 years of my career to.\\"\\n\\nThe case demonstrates the complexity of addressing sensitive historical topics in educational settings. While it is essential for students to learn about the unfortunate and painful aspects of history, educators must consider diverse perspectives and approach such topics with the utmost care. In Barron's case, allowing him to return to the classroom can be seen as a testament to his commitment to providing students with a comprehensive education. Nevertheless, it also serves as a reminder that educators and institutions must handle delicate subjects with care, ensuring that these discussions contribute to fostering empathy, tolerance, and a broader understanding of historical context."},{"question":"Read the text and determine if the sentence is true:\\n\\nOct 10 (Infostrada Sports) - Results and standings from the European Ch.

Justin conducts his reactions at a high temperature, while Thomas conducts his reactions at a lower temperature.  and a hint : When the temperature of reactants is higher, the rate of the reaction is faster. At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. As a result, they are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. For example, food spoils because of chemical reactions, and these reactions occur faster at higher temperatures (see the bread on the left in the Figure below ). This is why we store foods in the refrigerator or freezer (like the bread on the right in the Figure below ). The lower temperature slows the rate of spoilage.

Rabbits: Rabbits living in colder climates, such as the Arctic hare, also possess a layer of fat under their skin to provide insulation. This fat layer, combined with their dense fur, allows them to survive in extreme environmental conditions.\\n\\n4. Other animals: Many animals that live in cold environments have evolved to have a layer of fat under their skin for insulation and energy storage. Examples include seals, whales, and some species of penguins. These animals typically have a thick, insulating layer of blubber or fat that helps them conserve heat and stay warm in frigid aquatic or terrestrial habitats.\\n\\n5. Humans: Humans, too, have a layer of subcutaneous fat under their skin that helps insulate and protect the body from cold temperatures. This fat layer provides a barrier between our internal organs and the cold external environment, helping maintain a stable core body temperature. In addition to insulation, the subcutaneous fat layer also serves other vital purposes, such as supplying energy, shock absorption, and protection for internal organs.\\n\\nHowever, it is important to note that the presence and thickness of this fat layer can differ significantly between individual animals and humans due to factors such as genetics, diet, and adaptation to specific environments."},{"question":"Outside of the Netherlands and Belgium, the dialect around the German town of Kleve (South Guelderish) both historically and genetically belongs to the Dutch language.

Robin could not sleep at night: This indicates that Robin had trouble falling asleep, which happens to many people from time to time.\\n\\n2. Robin stayed up watching films: This suggests that Robin sought entertainment as a way to cope with her sleeplessness.

Robin could not get up in the morning: Due to staying up late watching films, Robin was understandably unable to wake up early, causing her to start school late.\\n\\nGiven the context, now let's assess the possible answers:\\n\\na. Report her to the office: This would involve notifying school authorities of Robin's tardiness. While it is necessary for students to be punctual, Robin's situation may be better resolved with a more understanding and compassionate approach.\\n\\nb. Sleep in: This option suggests that Robin should continue to rest and skip school, which is not an ideal solution in the long term.\\n\\nc. Suspend her also: This is a punitive measure, which may not be the most appropriate response considering that the situation may be better solved through understanding and support.\\n\\nBased on these considerations, it seems that the question is asking what Robin should have done before running into the problem of not being able to get up in the morning. The most logical step for Robin before staying up to watch films would have been to try to address her sleeplessness and prioritize sleep. This could involve creating a more relaxing bedtime routine, seeking professional advice, or exploring other strategies to improve her sleep hygiene.\\n\\nIn conclusion, none of the provided answers directly address what Robin should have done before reaching the point of being late for school. However, they can serve as a reminder that improving Robin's sleep habits and addressing sleep difficulties should be the primary focus to avoid similar issues in the future."},{"question":"Given the question: Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

As in other languages, verbs need to be conjugated to match the number of people performing them. You'll also need to put verbs in past, present, or future tense to indicate the time in which the action was performed. For example:  In the sentence, “I thought I locked the gate,” thought and locked are both past-tense verbs. In the sentence, \\"I want to open the door,\\" want and open are both present-tense verbs. In the sentence, \\"The girls admit they lied,\\" admit is in its plural form. Were you only talking about 1 girl, you would say, \\"The girl admits that she lied.\\" An adverb describes an action or an adjective (or another adverb in some cases). Adverbs show when, to what extent, and how a specific action was performed. Most, but not all adverbs end with “-ly.” Examples of adverbs include:  How: “Sam quickly ate his lunch,” or “Bertram moodily shaved his mustache.” To what extent: “Jennie did her homework excellently,” or “The cat was very furry.” When: “Tom went to his lessons weekly,” or “Adele never cut her hair.” The “-ly” ending is usually used for adverbs that derive from adjectives (such as “hungrily” from “hungry” or “gently” from “gentle”). Adverbs that do not follow this form include “too,” “very,” “never,” and “often.” You can use adjectives to modify nouns and, occasionally, pronouns. These words answer questions about nouns like: what kind? which one? how many? Examples of adjectives include:  You are a great person. The tall man was late for the meeting. Her smelly cat ruined the house party. The iguana is a terrible pet. Your mother is a kind woman. When adjectives are used to modify pronouns, they usually need a helping verb such as is and are. For example, “They are interesting,” or “He is tall.” In rare cases, adjective forms can be used to modify another adjective (a job that is typically done by adverbs). For example, “He drove a bright red car.” Determiners are a special form of adjective that are used to provide information about nouns, such as specificity, number, and distance from the speaker. For example, if you want to indicate specificity, use a definite or indefinite article. You would use the definite article “the” when you're referring to 1 particular example of a specific noun (e.g., “the book”). Use “a” if you're referring to any example of a that kind of noun (“a book”). The most common types of determiners include:  The definite article the (singular or plural) and the indefinite articles a or an (singular) or some (plural). These articles show whether the noun they modify is specific or general. For example, “The [specific] man wanted some [general] apples.” The demonstrative adjectives, which indicate both specificity and proximity to the speaker. This (singular) and these (plural) refer to specific nouns that are close to the speaker. That (singular) and those (plural) suggest a little more distance. For example: “Put these [specific, close] books with those [specific, more distant] papers over there.” Numbers are also a form of determiner, which can specify the quantity of a noun. For example, “I have twenty-three cats in my bedroom!”\\n\\nSummary:","response":"The article discusses the functions and forms of various parts of speech in English, including verbs, adverbs, adjectives, and determiners, with examples demonstrating tense, plurality, descriptive properties, and specificity."},{"question":"Remove the spaces from the following sentence: Last 10 comments by aqityfyl:","response":"Okay, little friend!

But with the 2014 election on the horizon, Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin, chair of the Democratic Governors Association, said this year's gubernatorial contests won't be about that operative word.

However, in a continually shifting political landscape, the outcome of the 2014 gubernatorial races remained uncertain. Candidates on both sides of the aisle faced unique challenges as they navigated the complex web of issues that affected their respective states.\\n\\nMoreover, with the electorate becoming increasingly polarized, appealing to moderate and independent voters became an even greater task for Democratic and Republican candidates alike. Shumlin's assertion that the election was not about \\"change\\" suggested that the focus had shifted from a potential large-scale overhaul of political leadership at the state level to a more nuanced, issue-driven discussion of policy and governance.\\n\\nDespite this assertion, the enduring appeal of \\"change\\" as a rallying cry for political candidates should not be underestimated. The 2014 gubernatorial races, like any election cycle, were influenced by factors such as voter sentiments, local issues, national trends, and the characteristics of individual candidates. In the end, attracting voters required candidates on both sides of the aisle to not only address these factors but to also present a compelling vision for the future of their state.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while Shumlin expressed doubt about the significance of \\"change\\" in the 2014 gubernatorial races, the enduring power of that message should not be dismissed outright. Regardless of the specific importance attributed to the idea of change, candidates in gubernatorial elections, such as those occurring in 2014, were ultimately tasked with addressing the needs and concerns of their constituents in a way that resonated with voters and ensured their continued faith in the political system.

I taught the kitten the way Pa taught me: I threw him into water where he could not stand, and I watched, ready to grab him if he went under. Tiger did not thrash desperately like me. He merely paddled urgently for the edge of the plastic pool with his head high and his thin legs churning. Little Bit said, \\"Dog paddle,\\" and we all laughed. \\"Tiger paddle,\\" I said, and we all laughed some more, even Jordy. That was probably when Ma noticed the kitten swimming lessons and stopped them. Our swimming lessons happened in two places. When Pa took us, we went to Hawkins Springs behind Mrs. DeLyons' Fountain of Youth Motor Hotel. When Ma took us, we drove to Mermaid Springs State Park, where we would sometimes meet Mr. Drake. I liked Mermaid Springs better because I felt safe there. Ma could not swim, so she never made me jump off a dock into deep water, and she always insisted that I wear an orange styrofoam cylinder on my back like a skindiver or spaceman. Ma usually sat on a towel on the grass near the beach, reading a magazine or a book while tanning her legs. Every now and then she would call to us not to go too far or not to splash each other. When she wore her one-piece red swimming suit, she would come in up to her waist, then lower herself to her shoulders, being careful not to get her hair wet. On the rarest occasions, she would wear a swimming cap and float on her back in the shallow water. Often she stayed in her shorts and shirt, adding sunglasses and removing shoes as her concession to summer and the beach.

Let's break down your questions one by one so we can understand them clearly.\\n\\nFirst, you're asking about the style of painting in a work by Vladimir Volegov. Vladimir Volegov is known for painting in a realistic style, which means his paintings look like real life. It's like seeing a photograph, but it's created with paint instead. His paintings often show people and their emotions, making them feel alive and real.\\n\\nSecond, you're asking if the painting is a copy of someone else's work. I can't see the actual painting you're talking about, but Vladimir Volegov usually creates his own original paintings, which means they come from his own ideas and not copied from others. A copied work is when one artist tries to imitate another artist's painting, making it look the same, but a painting by Volegov would usually be his own original creation.\\n\\nLastly, you're asking if the two questions have the same meaning. The answer is no, they do not have the same meaning. The first question is about the style of the painting (realistic), while the second question is about whether the painting is a copy of someone else's work.\\n\\nIn summary:\\n1. The painting by Vladimir Volegov is likely in a realistic style.\\n2. The painting is probably not a copy of someone else's work.\\n3.

Jimmy Hi, Jimmy, As far as I know, people who have lived abroad often find that the adjustment   to returning home is more difficult than their adjustment to living in a foreign culture. Why? We expect to have some problems when we go to a new place, speak a different language and learn the rules of a different culture ... But home? ... we know that place! Your parents expect that the same person who boarded the airplane one year ago will be returning. Especially if they have never been abroad themselves, your parents probably won't understand the changes that living abroad can cause in a person. On the other hand, you may have maintained   an ideal mental image of your loved ones while abroad, an image that is broken into pieces when you return. Remember you have been living a different lifestyle in your host country, and you have probably become very independent while staying there alone. Now that you're home, you will be expected to conform   again to the lifestyle of your family. As a result, you may be upset about your parents' involvement in your life. Communication is the key to overcoming this problem. Tell your parents how you are feeling. Share with them information about cultural re-entry , and ask them to be patient. This does not mean that you have to forget your experience and give up everything you've learned! Learn to find a balance between the old and new, just as you did when first adjusting to your host country's culture.

It digest food in two ways, mechanically and chemically. Both help in the process of turning food into nutrients. The digestive system also eliminates solid food waste. The major organs of the digestive system include the mouth, esophagus, stomach, and small and large in- testines. These organs all work together to help you gain energy from the food you eat. Digestion starts in the mouth. When food is swallowed, it travels through the esophagus to the stomach. In the stomach, digestion continues and a small amount of absorption of nutrients takes place. Most chemical digestion and nearly all absorption of nutrients take place in the small intestine. This organ consists of three parts: duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. The large intestine is the last stop in the digestive system. This is where water is absorbed. The food not digested is released as waste. \\n\\nAccording to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"What organs make up the digestive system and where does it start?\\" is \\"It starts at the mouth and includes the esophagus, stomach, small and large intestine\\"?","response":"Yes, that's correct. The digestive system starts at the mouth and includes various essential organs, which are the mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine (comprising the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum), and large intestine. All these organs work together in a coordinated manner to ensure the efficient breakdown and absorption of nutrients from the food we consume, as well as to eliminate solid waste from our body. Digestion begins in the mouth with the mechanical and chemical breakdown of food, and continues in the stomach, where it is further processed. The small intestine is responsible for most of the chemical digestion and nearly all nutrient absorption. Finally, the large intestine absorbs water and excretes any remaining undigested waste."},{"question":"Killing people had become a way of life for the gangster, but surely he would also what?\\nOptions:\\n- feel remorse\\n- hate\\n- get killed\\n- teach children\\n- murder Hmmm, let me think.","response":"Each of these options could potentially apply to the gangster in different ways or situations.

Feel remorse: Killing people may become second nature to the gangster in order to accomplish their goals or as a self-defense mechanism, but that doesn't necessarily mean they don't feel remorse or guilt for their actions. Human beings are capable of experiencing complex emotions, and while the gangster may suppress these feelings for the sake of their criminal lifestyle, deep down, they may still feel regret or sadness for their actions.\\n\\n2. Hate: The gangster might develop a sense of hatred, either towards others or themselves, as a result of their violent behavior. This may stem from resentment towards others for pushing them into or enabling their criminal lifestyle, or it could be directed inwards due to self-loathing or guilt.\\n\\n3. Get killed: Living a life of crime and violence puts the gangster at great risk for danger, retaliation, or legal consequences. It's possible that the gangster might eventually be killed, either by rival criminals, law enforcement, or even by their own hand if they cannot bear the weight of their actions any longer.\\n\\n4. Teach children: It's possible that the gangster could impart their criminal knowledge or skills upon a younger generation, either within their own family or as part of a larger criminal organization. This may not be a desirable outcome, but it's worth noting that criminality can be learned and passed down through generations, and this gangster might play a role in that cycle.\\n\\nOut of these options, it would depend on the specific gangster and their personal characteristics or experiences which outcome is the most likely."},{"question":"Write the last sentence in this story.\\n\\nMADRID, Spain (CNN) -- A man died after being gored in the neck during the annual running of the bulls in Pamplona, Spain, the Navarra regional government said Friday on its Web site.

The statement discusses the Ming court's lack of concern for Tibet contributing to the Mongols seizing the opportunity to reclaim their old vassal of Tibet and fill the political vacuum that had been created. However, it does not provide a specific time frame or date for when the peak of the conquest took place.\\n\\nTo provide a detailed and accurate response, the conquest of Tibet can be examined in relation to different historical periods.\\n\\nIf we focus on the Mongol conquest of Tibet, it is essential to talk about Kublai Khan, the founder of the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368) in China. The Mongol conquest of Tibet reached its peak during his reign as he extended the Mongol Empire and established a relationship between the Yuan Dynasty and Tibet. In 1244, the Sakya leader Sakya Pandita was invited to Kublai Khan's court, and in 1254, his nephew Phagpa was invited as well. In 1260, Kublai Khan became the Great Khan of the Mongol Empire, and he officially named his nephew Phagpa as the Imperial Preceptor in 1264. Subsequently, Kublai Khan integrated the Tibetan spiritual and political authority into the Yuan government, which enabled direct control over Tibet. In this historical context, the peak of the conquest of Tibet under the Mongol reign can be considered between 1260 and 1280.\\n\\nHowever, if referring to the later efforts to reclaim Tibet, the discussion is different. The provided statement mentions the Mongols pouncing on the chance to reclaim Tibet due to the Ming Dynasty's lack of concern. During the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), the Chinese authority maintained a relatively distant and less military-oriented relationship with Tibet, which led to the political vacuum the statement refers to. In this context, Altan Khan, a Mongol leader, established a new relationship between the Mongols and the Tibetans in the 16th century.\\n\\nIn 1578, Altan Khan met with the Tibetan leader Sonam Gyatso and granted him the title of 'Dalai Lama,' which means 'Ocean of Wisdom.' This marked the beginning of the lineage of the Dalai Lamas, who would become the spiritual and political leaders of Tibet. After Altan Khan's efforts to consolidate power in Tibet, it can be said that the peak of the Mongols reclaiming their influence over Tibet occurred in the late 16th century.\\n\\nIn summary, the conquest of Tibet reached its peak under the Mongol control during Kublai Khan's reign in the 1260s and 1280s. However, the reclaiming of Tibet by Mongols can be considered at its peak during the late 16th century when Altan Khan forged a new alliance with the Tibetans. It's important to note that the given statement helps provide context about political influences in Tibet during the Ming Dynasty but does not directly answer the question about the peak of Tibet's conquest."},{"question":"What makes a genius so smart?\\nWhat makes a genius?\\n\\nAre these two questions inquiring about the same information?","response":"Both questions are certainly related, but they have slightly different implications. Primarily, they inquire about the factors that contribute to someone being considered a genius and the characteristics typical of a genius. To address these questions meaningfully, I will discuss them individually while highlighting their relationship.\\n\\n1. What makes a genius so smart?\\n\\nA genius is typically considered an exceptionally intelligent person who has extraordinary cognitive abilities, creative thinking, and problem-solving skills. There are several factors that contribute to a genius being smart:\\n\\na. Genetics: Studies have shown that intelligence has a genetic component, with some estimates suggesting that about 50-75% of intelligence is heritable. This means that a genius could have inherited their extraordinary intelligence from their ancestors.\\n\\nb. Brain structure and function: Research has found that the brains of highly intelligent people often have unique structural and functional characteristics. For example, the corpus callosum, which connects the two brain hemispheres, can be larger in geniuses, facilitating quicker communication between the two halves of the brain. Moreover, geniuses may have denser gray matter, which contributes to greater neural efficiency, capacity, and cognitive ability.\\n\\nc. Early cognitive development: Certain factors during childhood can have a significant impact on a person’s cognitive abilities. Early exposure to stimuli and challenging environments can promote brain development and contribute to improving cognitive skills. Many geniuses have shown exceptional cognitive abilities from a young age, such as an aptitude for learning new skills or processing information quickly.\\n\\nd. Hard work and commitment: High intelligence alone does not determine genius-level accomplishments. A strong work ethic, dedication, perseverance, and the drive to explore, learn, and innovate contribute significantly to a genius’s intellectual capabilities.\\n\\ne. Environment: Growing up in an environment that nurtures curiosity, learning, and creativity can play a crucial role in the development of a genius. Supportive and engaging educational experiences, mentorship, and opportunities for skill development can all contribute to an individual reaching their intellectual potential.\\n\\n2. What makes a genius?\\n\\nThe term \\"genius\\" goes beyond mere intelligence, indicating one’s extraordinary abilities or talents in multiple domains. Some factors characteristic of a genius might include:\\n\\na. Creativity: A genius usually possesses a high degree of creativity, using their knowledge and intelligence to think outside the box and come up with innovative solutions and ideas.\\n\\nb. Insight: Geniuses often demonstrate a profound understanding of complex topics, simplifying and explaining them in a manner that demonstrates their depth and clarity of thought.\\n\\nc. Originality: A genius may bring forth new and unique ideas, challenging existing norms and paradigms and revolutionizing their fields.\\n\\nd. Impact: The work of a genius often has a significant impact on society, culture, or knowledge in their area of expertise. This influence may be felt for generations, shaping the future in meaningful ways.\\n\\ne. Intuition: Geniuses often have a heightened sense of intuition that allows them to make connections between seemingly unrelated concepts, fostering new perspectives and ideas.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while both questions are closely related in exploring the nature of a genius, the first question focuses on the factors that contribute to their extraordinary intelligence, whereas the second question expands on this to include the broader characteristics of a genius. These characteristics encompass their creativity, originality, impact, and more, setting them apart from those with just exceptional cognitive abilities."},{"question":"Read the text and determine if the sentence is true (see options at the end):\\n\\nNew Day is a 1949 book by Jamaican author V.

You will be given an SQL statement and an English description with what is wrong about that SQL statement. You must correct the SQL statement based off of the feedback. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned.

Common thermal mass materials include stone, cement and water. Historically they have been used in arid climates or warm temperate regions to keep buildings cool by absorbing solar energy during the day and radiating stored heat to the cooler atmosphere at night. However, they can be used in cold temperate areas to maintain warmth as well. The size and placement of thermal mass depend on several factors such as climate, daylighting and shading conditions. When properly incorporated, thermal mass maintains space temperatures in a comfortable range and reduces the need for auxiliary heating and cooling equipment.\\n\\nHow is thermal mass used to keep buildings cool?","response":"Thermal mass is used to keep buildings cool by acting like a big sponge that can soak up heat during the day and release it at night. In simple words, it helps store the heat from the sun in materials like stone, cement, or water. When the sun shines during the day, these materials absorb and hold the heat. Later, when the temperature gets cooler at night, the stored heat slowly comes out of the building, making the inside of the building feel cooler. This way, the thermal mass helps to keep the building comfortable without using extra machines to cool or warm it up."},{"question":"Alhambra, powerType, Humphrys, Tennant and Dykes; Humphrys, Tennant and Dykes, location, Deptford; Alhambra, builder, Samuda Brothers\\n\\nWhat is sentence that verbalizes this data?","response":"The Alhambra, a powerType structure, was built by Samuda Brothers in Deptford, with significant contributions from Humphrys, Tennant, and Dykes."},{"question":"Here is a news article: Found it on OfferUp via someone on the Bike Index.

Eric Bike ||||| A year ago, before the man they call Bike Batman began his work—before he headed out on missions around the Emerald City with a pocketful of cash and the cops on speed dial and a paladin’s sense of wrongs to be righted, before he’d rescued two dozen stolen bikes from the grubby fingers of the city’s thieves, before even anyone referred to him as Bike Batman—he was just an average-seeming guy in Seattle who liked to ride his bicycles. \\n  \\n He rode his bike to work. After work, he rode his bike home again. In the evenings, in his basement, he wrenched on bikes that he fixed up and flipped. Monkeying with bikes helped him burn off stress. The guy had a wife who also liked to ride, a wife who at times would wonder aloud if all that half-finished transportation would be departing the basement soon, honey, so they could finally tackle that remodel. \\n  \\n In short, the guy showed no crime-fighting predilection—certainly no inkling to become a vigilante who would face off against criminals while armed with little more than a smartphone, some spare time, and a pair of brass balls. He didn’t choose to become Bike Batman. \\n  \\n Sometimes in life, though, the cape finds you. \\n  \\n All the action heroes have their origin story. Here is Bike Batman’s: It was May 2015. A Monday or a Tuesday. Our guy, an engineer, was at work. (Never mind where, and don’t worry about his name. He doesn’t want the glory or need the guff.) He was surfing online for a steel bike for his wife to ride on an upcoming trip. And—well, here, let him tell you what happened next: \\n  \\n “So I was looking for a Surly Cross-Check,” he says one recent day at lunch over a pulled-pork sandwich. “And I’d been searching for one on Craigslist forever. And one finally popped up. And it was really, really cheap. And I thought immediately, this is either stolen—it’s super beat-up and all the parts are junk—or the person doesn’t know what they have. It was like 300 bucks. And it would sell for $700—like half-price. \\n  \\n “So I started asking the guy questions about fit, about parts, about whatever. And the guy couldn’t answer anything. So I think, OK, this is probably stolen. And I did a quick Google: ‘Surly.’ ‘Cross-Check.’ ‘Seattle.’ ‘Stolen.’ And a Bike Index ad popped up. And the Bike Index ad had pictures of this bike, and it had a contact number for the owner of this thing.” \\n  \\n Bike Index, if you haven’t heard of it, is the nation’s largest bike registry and a clearinghouse for info on stolen rides. It lists more than 75,000 bikes. When someone loses his bike and turns to the web, if there’s a hit, Bike Index is often one of the first links that pops up. \\n  \\n So our guy—he’s not Batman at this point, remember, still just some joe who likes bikes and who’s in possession of a certain curiosity of mind, the kind of guy who likes to pull on a string to see what’s at the other end—reaches out to the original owner of the Cross-Check. \\n  \\n “I shoot her a text. I say, ‘I may have found your bike for sale. Could you provide some details?’ And she responded with pictures of her police report, pictures of her receipts, all this stuff. Serial number. \\n  \\n “I think she thought I was some weirdo.” \\n  \\n It could’ve ended there. Except it didn’t. That afternoon, our hero pulls on the string a little harder. He decides to pose as a buyer so he can meet the guy who’s selling the stolen bike. He has no idea what to say. No escape route. No nothing. The seller suggests meeting in downtown Seattle. Right by the city jail, as it turns out. \\n  \\n When the seller shows up, it’s not one guy. It’s three guys. “They looked like drug addicts. And, you know, whatever. I talk to people like this all the time. I take after my mom—talk to everybody. My wife hates it. And I start talking to them, looking at the bike. And immediately I’m like, this bike is set up exactly like the lady’s that I’ve been texting. I flip the bike over, check the serial number. The serial number’s the same. OK. At this point, the bike is stolen. I don’t know what to do. \\n  \\n “I said, ‘Just give me a second, guys.’ I dialed 911 on my phone. Conveniently, my phone didn’t dial. So I pretended to talk to the police as I derived a plan. \\n  \\n “And I said, ‘Well, guys, I’m sorry to tell you this, but this is my girlfriend’s bike. And it’s stolen. And I just talked to the police. And the way I see it, you’ve got two options. You can wait here for the police to come and tell them your story and how you came upon the bike, or you can get out of here and just let me throw the bike in my truck.’ One guy immediately ran away. As soon as I said ‘police,’ he was out of there.” \\n  \\n Here it should be said that even though you have met Batman only a few times, at places and times of his choosing, what strikes you most about him is his utter unremarkableness. To the near-stranger, he is beige, nearly without affect, almost boring. Don’t misunderstand: Once you get to know him, you see that he’s smart and funny. But his hands do not wave when he talks. Inflection is not one of his gifts. In this way, he rather reminds you of those other Batmans—Christian Bale, Michael Keaton—who managed to be both charismatic and two-dimensional at the same time. \\n  \\n Bike Batman, of course, is keenly aware of the face he presents to the world and to thieves. “It’s just important to be this energy sink, basically,” he’ll tell you later. “The only reason this has worked for me so far is that I just go in there and just keep an even keel the whole time…As soon as you start getting worked up, that person is going to start getting worked up with you and feed off the energy and vibe that you’re putting out.” \\n  \\n (It probably also doesn’t hurt that our hero is in his thirties, big-shouldered, thick russet beard, Viking-looking. He isn’t the first guy you would choose to fuck with over a hot Litespeed.) \\n  \\n But back to the action, where one thief has fled but a standoff has arisen with the remaining dirtbags across the empty saddle of the stolen bike: \\n  \\n “The other two guys were getting a little amped up. My heart is just in my throat. I don’t know what I’m doing. I’m just standing there. And I said, ‘Well, guys, I’m not waiting around any longer. Alright, I’m out of here.’ I throw it in my truck, try to race downtown at 5:30 p.m. on a Tuesday, make it about 50 feet—and then stop at a traffic light.” \\n  \\n Not exactly a clean getaway. \\n  \\n Still, he makes it. “I called the lady: ‘Yep, it’s your bike.’ I drove about six blocks and met her downtown, gave it back to her. And she was just so happy.” It didn’t matter, he says, that the bike was all janky and barely worth the trouble. \\n  \\n Photo: Cole Ott \\n  \\n Right there, our guy could’ve walked away. But his work didn’t feel finished. The seller—probably the coward who ran—had dozens of bikes for sale on Craigslist. So our guy forked over all the woman’s info to the Seattle Police Department. Then he waited for the boom to fall. And he waited. “Seattle PD was going really slow. And I was getting really frustrated watching these bikes go up for sale and coming down.” \\n  \\n He got a little obsessed. Doing his own “hack job investigations,” he found more Bike Index postings about stolen bikes, and then located them for sale on websites. About a week after his first sting, he saw a red Surly Karate Monkey for sale, cheap, on a site called OfferUp. He easily found the owner on Bike Index, a young country boy from Idaho whose ride vanished in the 20 minutes he ran upstairs to see his girlfriend at the University of Washington. \\n  \\n He and the kid set up the buy, then rendezvoused that night with the thieves and followed them to a bleak area south of downtown Seattle where trailers squatted in a circle and shadows moved in the dark bushes. It was the land of stolen bikes. Just tons of them. Again, our guy had no plan. No way to communicate with his new sidekick. “We were idiots,” he recalls. Once they confirmed it was the kid’s bike, “I was like, ‘Hey, why don’t you call the girlfriends and tell them we’re doing alright?’ And I’m wearing a wedding ring. I’m trying to pull it off and put it in my pocket. \\n  \\n ‘Okay, the girlfriends.’ And he runs off to call 911.” \\n  \\n The kid must’ve screamed bloody murder, because seven cops descended. Cuffs slapped on perps. Bikes recovered. The police admired their initiative—and told them that their initiative would probably get them shot. \\n  \\n But goddamn it was a rush. “This kid was hosed if he didn’t have someone else. He was like, ‘Fuck this city,’” our guy recalls. “It was so much fun and felt so good to stand up and, you know, not let all these, particularly out-of-town people, get this bad rap for Seattle.” Later, some cops called him Robin Hood. A grateful citizen in the Seattle Times named him the “bike repo man.” \\n  \\n If the alter ego born that dark night must have a name, however, the guy preferred Bike Batman. \\n  \\n Stealing bikes is a crackin’ business. Across the nation, property crime has been falling for years, even precipitously. But bike thefts? Not so much. About 185,000 bikes were stolen in 2014, according to FBI statistics. That number is probably wildly low, because it doesn’t count burglaries in which a bike is taken. And only about one in three property crimes is even reported to police, the feds say. \\n  \\n In Seattle, 1,563 bikes were reported stolen last year, about double the number that were stolen in 2010. In Portland, aka Bike City USA, 2,100 bikes were stolen in 2014, according to a database compiled by the Oregonian. That number has doubled since 2007. \\n  \\n Bryan Hance is the Portland-based co-founder of Bike Index. He started his site out of frustration that thieves can steal a bike in Portland, say, and take it to Seattle, and the theft doesn’t get shared among law enforcement. “They’re totally balkanized. City A’s database does not talk to City B’s,” Hance says. Even college campuses usually don’t talk to the city around them. But if everyone registered their bike on a website and reported it there when stolen, bikes would be unsellable. In theory, anyway. \\n  \\n “Everybody asks, why bikes? And there are a couple factors,” says Hance. “One is that they’re worth a helluva lot more than they used to be. Ten years ago, you’d be hard-pressed to find a $2,000 bike unless your were a racer,” he says. “Now, a median price for a commuter is $1,300. The price is better, the components are better. \\n  \\n “Factor number two: Back when gas was $5 a gallon, a lot of people started riding. And they’ve stuck with it. And that puts a lot more bikes on the road. \\n  \\n “Then, a) crystal meth, b) crystal meth, and c) crystal meth.” Oh, and heroin, Hance adds. “And that leads to a lot of shitty, low-level property crime.” \\n  \\n There are more reasons. Take the rise of online commerce sites used to sell the stolen goods. You know Craigslist and eBay. But do you know 5miles? Or Letgo? Or OfferUp or Neerbuy or Saily or VarageSale? These sites are a visual marketplace, showing pictures of an item but often including few words to describe it. They offer the seller anonymity while making it hard for police or others to search the web for keywords. Lost a bike? You could spend hours scrolling through pictures across more than a half-dozen sites trying to track it down. Then do it again the next day. These sites may sell legit merchandise. But they’re also the 21st-century way to fence stolen goods. Think tag sales for tweakers. \\n  \\n In Seattle, the detectives who deal with burglaries are the same ones who get handed bike thefts, says Detective Scotty Bach of the Seattle Police Department’s Major Crimes Task Force. In the inevitable triage that is police work, home burglaries—with its bigger price tags and terrified families—naturally go to the front of the line. Unless there’s a major lead or a big sting, bikes tend to fall by the wayside, says Bach. Every theft matters. But some matter more than others. \\n  \\n And then there’s the marketplace. Bikes wouldn’t get stolen if people didn’t buy stolen bikes. But people do buy stolen bikes. Either buyers are oblivious, or they put blinders on. Buying a cheap bike from someone you meet on an app “sort of gives it the sheen of legitimacy,” says Hance. (It’s not a sketchy deal in a dark alley! It’s e-commerce!) But people don’t ask the right questions. Or don’t want to. Or don’t care. \\n  \\n Finally, let’s give a grudging shout-out to the thieves. Though drug-addled and twitchy-fingered, they’re now damn good at what they do. U-locks scarcely slow them down anymore (angle grinders, modified car jacks, huge bolt cutters, pry bars). Cables? Might as well tie your bike with dental floss, laughs Hance. Some thieves don’t even bother with the locks initially: In Portland, thieves have used angle grinders to saw through bike racks and dealt with the lock later. There have been break-ins at apartment buildings that contain “those cheap, shitty aluminum” vertical bike racks, and the thieves “saw the entire freaking rack off the wall,” making off with 25 bikes at once, Hance says. \\n  \\n (Your smartest move is to take your bike inside. Boss won’t let you? Make your bike harder to steal than the bike parked next to it, says Hance. That means throwing on two locks, minimum. Bike theft is about time and convenience for the thief and making it just enough of a pain that he moves on. As the old joke goes, you don’t have to outrun the lion, you only have to outrun your buddy.) \\n  \\n So, yeah, it’s a jungle out there. Enough to make a city cry out for a hero. \\n  \\n In the 12 months since he began, in May 2014, Batman returned 24 bicycles to their owners—all in his spare time, for free. At first he did it solo. Over time, he met some cops, and he met victims who had friends who were cops, and he sometimes called them to help on his stings. Still more officers reached out to him after the story in the paper. \\n  \\n Getting bikes back to people became a bit of an addiction. “It felt so good, just so good to get people reconnected with this thing that they’ve got all this emotional attachment to,” he says. “And most of these guys don’t have renter’s insurance, or they don’t have an insurance policy on their bike for whatever reason. They’re out $2,000, $3,000 when this thing gets stolen.” \\n  \\n Photo: Cole Ott \\n  \\n Consider the tale of Maggie Stapleton, one of Batman’s favorite recent stories. \\n  \\n On an unseasonably warm April Friday this year, Stapleton, who’s 29, was grilling outside with friends in Seattle’s Capitol Hill neighborhood. As the day cooled, everyone went inside. When Stapleton did, she plumb forgot to lock up her bike. \\n  \\n Bicycles have stories. Her Salsa Vaya—steel, traffic-cone orange—was the bike she bought after she first met her boyfriend, a longtime cyclist. Atop her Salsa, Stapleton became a cyclist, and a bike commuter, riding to and from her job in downtown Seattle. She has put thousands of miles on it. This summer, she was training to ride the Ramrod, a glorious, one-day, 150-odd-mile, 10,000-foot crusher that loops Mount Rainier. \\n  \\n But when Stapleton came outside at midnight to ride home, the Vaya—well, you know. \\n  \\n Stapleton went home and posted the loss online wherever she could think of. She tweeted. She contacted bike shops. Nothing. She was bummed. “This bike does have a lot of sentimental value to me, because it’s the first bike that made me fall in love with cycling.” \\n  \\n And this is what’s so interesting about bikes, isn’t it? A bike is just a thing—an ingenious concatenation of gears and wire and leather and steel. Really, we should care for it no more than we care for a toaster, or a BluRay player. Yet we do. Hance thinks he knows why. Bikes carry the freight of memories of experiences we’ve pedaled through while in the saddle. “It’s not that it’s ‘a thousand-dollar bike that I’ve had for five years,’” he says. “It’s ‘the thousand-dollar bike that I rode cross-country with my dad who had cancer,’ or ‘that I bought when I had raging PTSD after Afghanistan.’” Sure, for 60 percent of people, when it’s gone, it’s gone. But the other 40 percent, it’s like they’ve lost a limb, says Hance. “They don’t want it back, they need it back,” he says. “They’re ready to go Rambo to get that bike back. \\n  \\n “That’s where things get real interesting.” \\n  \\n Call Stapleton one of the 60 percent. She was sick about her lost bike, sure. But what could she do? She’d forgotten to lock it up; now it was gone. Lesson learned, she said to herself. Then, on Monday night, she received a phone message. “I think I may have found your bike,” said the voice. She called back. It was Batman. He already was winging to North Seattle to meet the seller. He had been checking the listings one last time before bed when he saw a fishy post; cross-referenced it; and found Stapleton’s post on Bike Index, complete with tell-tale details—a scratch here, mismatched tires. \\n  \\n Stapleton met up with him in a Sam’s Club parking lot. Batman had already called the cops. A plan was hatched: The police would hide nearby as Batman met the thief in the parking lot of a Kidd Valley burger joint. He scrawled the Vaya’s serial number on his hand. If it matched the one on the bike, he’d turn the crank to call in the cavalry. \\n  \\n “What should I do?” Stapleton asked the officer. \\n  \\n “Why don’t you go get some french fries?” the cop replied. \\n  \\n So Stapleton watched through the plate-glass windows of the burger joint, about to lose her mind as the dirtbag produced her beloved bike, and Batman turned the crank, and the flashing lights woop-wooped into view. She went home that night with her Salsa Vaya. \\n  \\n “It does kind of restore my faith in humanity,” she says. “A lot of people do bad things, but someone out of the goodness of their heart reunites people with their stolen bikes?” \\n  \\n Only later did she realize she’d had a brush with Batman, whom she’d read about in the paper just days before. \\n  \\n Others are out there fighting bike crime, too. There’s a woman in San Francisco who’s good at it, Hance says. And bike messengers down there “who are not to be trifled with. God help the person who takes a bike messenger’s bike.” I ask for another. Hance points me to one of the best of the spotters, folks who see the stolen bikes online and contact the owners. A “ninja,” he calls him. The guy has tracked maybe 20 bikes. \\n  \\n The Portlander doesn’t want to give his name or where he works. He doesn’t want to get too involved. He’s got kids, he says. But he explains his methods. \\n  \\n He looks for suspicious bikes during free moments at work, he says, then puts the owners in touch with ads by the shady sellers. He calls himself a middleman. It’s a different kind of crime-fighting, he says, done in front of a computer, at a standing desk. But he also patrols his not-quite-gentrified neighborhood. He keeps an eye out. He started a monthly cleanup. He’s the kind of neighbor you want to have. “Once or twice a day, I’ll see someone what they call ‘ghost riding’ a bike”—riding one, while guiding a second, thousand-dollar bike. And they “don’t look like any kind of rider,” he says, when I ask him why he does this. “I’ve had two bikes stolen from my house,” he says. \\n  \\n Our thirst for justice runs strong. And just as we are creative in our desire to slake that thirst, we are ingenious in the search for vengeance. A corner of YouTube is devoted to the delight of those who have exacted retribution upon jerks who would steal our bikes. To watch these clips is to feel a bit like indulging in pornography. This is wish fulfillment, after all, the next best thing to the satisfaction of being there and punching the guy yourself. There’s the Portland guy on YouTube who sees his stolen bike in a Seattle Craigslist ad, drives three hours north to pose as a would-be buyer, and then hounds the thief on foot through Seattle traffic until police cuff the baddie. There are the videos of “bait bikes” outfitted with seats wired to remote-control stun guns. Grown men, their taints zapped, lift off from two wheels into the branches of tall trees. It’s sadistic stuff. \\n  \\n An aggressive anti-theft group in New Orleans called Stolen Bikes NOLA has begun posting mug shots of frequent offenders. Last year, in a surveillance spearheaded by a 240-pound former bounty hunter from Alabama, the group’s members performed an elaborate tail of a suspected thief known as Track Suit as the man moved through the French Quarter, even as Track Suit donned a wig and hat to avoid detection. (Police finally arrested Track Suit.) \\n  \\n Like the Portlander I spoke with, Batman’s crime-fighting also starts during downtime at work. Take this morning, he tells me while we’re at lunch. There was a ten-minute conference call. But he didn’t really have to participate much, he says. “So the first thing I did was pop up Craigslist and OfferUp on both screens of my computer and just scroll through them passively until I see something that, you know, raises a red flag for me. And then I cross-check Bike Index, or I’ll open up Bike Index and scroll through the recent stolen bikes. So, five minutes, or 30 seconds here and there.” Anyone can do it. \\n  \\n He pulls out his phone. Here’s one now that he’s flagged. It’s a Trek, lime green. With that, my sidekick powers of observation end. \\n  \\n Batman, though, is just getting started. \\n  \\n It’s a modern touring bike, he says. “I would say you could end up buying this for around a thousand bucks from REI. The components look fairly new. They’re asking $250 for it. \\n  \\n “If this is a normal sale, I would expect to see ‘TREK. MODEL. SIZE.’ And just some details,” he says. But look at this listing, he continues—all it says is “Green Trek Bike.” No size. No nothing. \\n  \\n Price, and an inarticulate seller, are only his first clues. He’s just getting warmed up. He’s a detective now, picking up bits of lint, gathering circumstantial evidence, building a case. “The photo is taken in front of a flipped-over shopping cart and a makeshift barbecue, some burnt chairs or something. OK, no big deal, whatever. But then I go to”—here he clicks on the guy’s profile—“this guy’s name, and this guy’s profile is made in May of 2016, and you look at his other sales, and they’re all equally sketchy.” \\n  \\n Next, Batman takes the info and surfs over to Bike Index. He punches in what he knows: “Trek.” “Green.” “Within 100 miles of Seattle.” Several contenders pop up. He starts to weed them out. It helps to know bikes by a glance, their geometry and components. Batman knows bikes. \\n  \\n “Nope. Nope.” None seem to match. It’s a dead end. Just another shifty-looking sale. For now, anyway. \\n  \\n One of the biggest problems in busting up bike sales is that a lot of people simply don’t report their bikes when they get lifted, he says. If a bike is stolen in Seattle that’s worth more than $500, you’ve got to visit a police precinct to file a theft report or wait for an officer to arrive to document the theft. “And if you work like I work, 12 hours a day, all the time—Saturday I’m gone constantly. If somebody was to steal something of mine, and a police officer wasn’t able to say, ‘I will be there in five minutes,’ I just can’t wait around the three hours for ‘I will be there between eight and noon.’ That ain’t gonna work. We live in a busy city.” \\n  \\n I ask Detective Bach what he thought of Batman’s vigilantism. He was blunt. “I thinks there’s some huge risks for what he’s doing,” Bach says. “I would never advise a citizen to meet a suspect on his own. You’re buying these bikes from people who possibly are high on narcotics. You just don’t know.” \\n  \\n A few years ago, Seattle Bike Blog’s Tom Fucoloro was nearly aerated with a screwdriver while helping to retrieve a friend’s stolen bike. Bach also points to an incident north of Seattle in February, in which several people claimed they’d found their stolen construction tools on OfferUp. After being unable to secure a police officer’s help in time, the people met the seller and tried to make a citizens’ arrest of the alleged thief. Instead, the man pulled a pistol. He later was arrested. (To be fair, Batman these days usually calls the cops as he goes to meet the perp, and they formulate a quick plan, so the the police are waiting nearby to descend.) \\n  \\n Still, Bach recommends gathering as much info as you can about the stolen bike and who has it to make the police’s job as easy as possible, and then calling the police so they can intervene or make the buy instead. “If you can get us involved early, that’s great,” Bach says. And then be persistent, he says, until someone with a badge pays attention. \\n  \\n Our Batman is quite familiar with some of the occupational hazards that come with being a bike vigilante. There’s the danger, for one. \\n  \\n Last summer, when Batman was still new at this, he spied a Cervélo P2 for sale, confronted the thief, and took it. (“I’ve got a picture of the victim, he’s standing on my porch with just this gigantic smile on his face, like, ‘Oh my God!’”) Two weeks later, another stolen bike pops up on OfferUp. \\n  \\n Batman got a little careless. Though he had changed his profile and his picture, his texting pattern was similar. He recommended meeting at the same parking garage. He arrived early and saw the same thief, who he later found was wanted for violent crimes. Now the guy was with four friends, who were waiting in the corners of the parking garage. Batman let that bike go and lived to fight another day. \\n  \\n Perhaps it is no surprise that Mrs. Batman does not love these stories. Still, he adds, “She’s supportive. She knows it’s something that’s really important for me, and she has chosen to support me in it. But there are times where, for instance, with Maggie Stapleton’s bicycle, I found that at like 8:30 p.m. or something, I was literally brushing my teeth, looking through the bikes on OfferUp” and went out to bust the guy, he says. “And the whole thing was very rushed. She doesn’t like that. She wants me to contact the police, get a plan together.” \\n  \\n Then there are the hazards of trying to be a zealous do-gooder. \\n  \\n Last summer, Batman was flying high on his success, recovering bikes left and right, feeling cocksure. A Rodriguez coupled tandem came up for sale, dirt cheap. (A note here: Rodriguez Cycles are sweet custom steel rides hand-built in Seattle. A new, fully kitted tandem can go for up to $9,000 today.) The seller is sketchy, jittery, knows nothing about the bike. Batman sets up the buy and calls the police. \\n  \\n They meet. Batman tells the woman the jig is up. \\n  \\n Fuck off, she says. The bike’s mine. \\n  \\n The police arrive. They ream out Batman for profiling someone as a criminal with no proof. The irony wasn’t lost on him. “I had a friend, a bleeding heart liberal teacher, was just talking about what a piece of shit I was,” he says now. “I don’t even think I was aware of what I was doing.” (The unlikely owner apparently got the Rodriguez through an auction of a forgotten storage unit, à la Storage Wars.) \\n  \\n After that, he says, “I seriously considered stopping this foolishness altogether. But I got an email or a text from someone saying, ‘Thank you so much. I just put 60 miles on my bike or whatever, it feels amazing.’ And I thought, I can’t. It just feels too good.” \\n  \\n So he didn’t stop. But now he plays by new rules. If he can’t contact the owner and confirm that a bike is stolen, he won’t contact the cops and get them involved. Sometimes he’ll snap up a really suspicious bike himself and try to find the owner later. It’s all about acting fast, he says. “This is like ambulance chasing. If you’re not the first one there, someone else is gonna swoop in, and then you’re not gonna find the owner.” \\n  \\n And when it all goes right, it is sweet. \\n  \\n Last fall, Batman sees a carbon Cervélo P5—a crazy-expensive tri bike, maybe $9,000 retail—for about $3,000. It’s obviously hot. But Bike Index shows bupkes, and local police have no reports. Batman talks the kid selling it down to $1,700. Tells him he’ll have the cash when he gets back from a business trip in a week. \\n  \\n During the delay, Batman gets on the horn. He calls the Cervélo rep to find out where the bike was sold: Oregon. He calls the Oregon shop. The shop calls the bike’s owner. The owner calls Batman. \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n “I left for Hawaii three weeks ago,” the owner says. “That bike should be in my house.” \\n  \\n “Well, it’s not,” says Batman. \\n  \\n The next day, when he meets the thief, the fuzz swarms. Turns out two guys with family in the neighborhood knew the cyclist’s schedule and had emptied his house when he headed to the islands. Nobody even knows there’s been a crime until Bike Batman solves it. \\n  \\n Why does Bike Batman do this for us? He has a life, after all. He’s got a wife who wants to sit on the couch with him and watch Game of Thrones. He’s got friends. A busy career. He’s got bikes to ride—four at last count, not to mention the hobby bikes cluttering the basement. Why do this? \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n Photo: Cole Ott \\n  \\n Our comic book heroes have always been different from us—in their monomania, in the black-and-white way they see the world. The rest of us accept early to shrug and live with the unfairness of it all. But the heroes we invent and raise up, they don’t shrug. They don’t accept things the way they are. That’s what makes them so appealing and yet also keeps us distant from them. We admire their monomania, and we distrust it. We want to know what’s really in their hearts that makes them not like us. \\n  \\n “Really, it might be 3 percent, let’s say, adrenaline. Some subconscious adrenaline seeking,” Batman says of his motives. (“It’s not like the adrenaline I get from riding a mountain bike or something, or riding really fast,” he wants you to know. “But it’s kind of the nervous energy I get when I’ve got way too much on my plate.”) “And there might be 2 percent of something else. But I would say 95 percent of it is just getting that bike returned.” \\n  \\n Here’s a for-instance, he says: After the recovery of Maggie Stapleton’s bike—the Salsa Vaya, the french fries—he friended her on Instagram. “I was having a really, really busy week the following week, after getting that thing back for her, and I was really not super-enthused with work. And every once in a while I would just open up Instagram and look at a picture of her riding the bike and just think, fuck. Yeah.” \\n  \\n “I know that sounds creepy,” Batman adds. And he laughs at himself. And you laugh with him, because the mask has slipped down, and you see that the guy across from you isn’t Batman anymore, isn’t some abstract concept about the war in man’s breast between Good and Evil. It’s just a big, Viking-looking guy who gets frustrated at work, just like you do, and who right now is wearing a giant grin on his face because he’s found something he really, really likes to do, and that something happens to be helping other people who are in a jam. \\n  \\n No, Bike Batman, that’s not creepy at all. In fact, that’s about the most normal thing in the world. |||||\\nA summary of this is?","response":"Bike Batman is a Seattle-based vigilante who takes it upon himself to recover stolen bicycles and return them to their rightful owners. By searching for suspicious bike sales on websites like Craigslist and OfferUp, cross-referencing the Bike Index (a national bike registry), he is able to make educated guesses about which bikes are stolen. He then meets the sellers, typically calling the police for backup, and ensures the stolen bikes are returned to their owners. He credits his success to remaining calm and collected throughout the entire process, and has helped return numerous bikes since he began his vigilantism in May 2014."},{"question":"Question: \\"What was one of  the topics being discussed at the panel discussion?\\"  Context: \\"During a panel discussion at Harvard University's reunion for African American alumni during the 2003–04 academic year, two prominent black professors at the institution—Lani Guinier and Henry Louis Gates—pointed out an unintended effect of affirmative action policies at Harvard. They stated that only about a third of black Harvard undergraduates were from families in which all four grandparents were born into the African American community. The majority of black students at Harvard were Caribbean and African immigrants or their children, with some others the mixed-race children of biracial couples. One Harvard student, born in the South Bronx to a black family whose ancestors have been in the United States for multiple generations, said that there were so few Harvard students from the historic African American community that they took to calling themselves \\"the descendants\\" (i.e., descendants of American slaves).

For small values of capacitance (microfarads and less), ceramic disks use metallic coatings, with wire leads bonded to the coating. Larger values can be made by multiple stacks of plates and disks. Larger value capacitors usually use a metal foil or metal film layer deposited on the surface of a dielectric film to make the plates, and a dielectric film of impregnated paper or plastic – these are rolled up to save space. To reduce the series resistance and inductance for long plates, the plates and dielectric are staggered so that connection is made at the common edge of the rolled-up plates, not at the ends of the foil or metalized film strips that comprise the plates.\\n How are the conductive plates never made for larger value capacitors?

Space considerations: Manhattan apartments are known for being relatively smaller in size compared to other types of housing options, such as houses or farms. This means that someone who can only have a small dog would be more likely to live in a Manhattan apartment due to the limited space available for their pet.\\n\\n2. Urban environment: Manhattan is a highly urbanized area, and someone who lives there is likely to prefer a smaller pet, such as a small dog, that can comfortably adapt to apartment living and the crowded streets of the city.\\n\\n3.

It is important to understand that forest formation is driven by natural processes involving the growth and reproduction of trees, as outlined in your original description. However, I will try to connect the two concepts to provide a valid answer.\\n\\nWhen more boilers are added to a certain area, it could imply an increased need for energy or heat, often associated with some level of development or industrialization. Consequently, the relationship between adding more boilers and forest formation can be discussed from different perspectives:\\n\\nA. More Forest Formation - This could occur if the boilers are powered by biomass produced sustainably from the forest, ensuring that the forest ecosystem is maintained and regenerated. If proper forest management practices are in place, adding more boilers could potentially stimulate the growth of more trees and contribute to forest formation. However, this outcome would be contingent upon the implementation of sustainable and responsible forest management.\\n\\nB. Less Forest Formation - If the addition of more boilers leads to a higher demand for land clearing or deforestation to accommodate industrial needs, it could negatively impact forest formation. Additionally, the added energy consumption could increase the emission of greenhouse gases, which could contribute to climate change, thus negatively affecting forests.\\n\\nC. No Effect - If the boilers do not rely on forest resources whatsoever and their operation does not impact nearby forests or ecosystems, the addition of boilers would not have any direct effect on forest formation.\\n\\nConsidering the diverse possibilities in the relationship between adding more boilers and forest formation, it is essential to examine the specific context and factors involved. Distribution of boilers, local legislation and regulation, as well as the energy source, will determine whether the effect is more, less, or no change in forest formation."},{"question":"I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

Movie title: 12 Angry Men Movie plot: In a New York City courthouse, an eighteen-year-old boy from a slum is on trial for allegedly stabbing his father to death. Final closing arguments having been presented, a visibly bored judge instructs the jury to decide whether the boy is guilty of murder. If there is any reasonable doubt of his guilt they are to return a verdict of not guilty. The judge further informs them that a guilty verdict will be accompanied by a mandatory death sentence.The jury retires to a private room, where the jurors spend a short while getting acquainted before they begin deliberating. It is immediately apparent that the jurors have already decided that the boy is guilty, and that they plan to return their verdict without taking time for discussion with the sole exception of Juror 8 (Henry Fonda), who is the only \\"not guilty\\" vote in a preliminary tally. He explains that there is too much at stake for him to go along with the verdict without at least talking about it first. His vote annoys the other jurors, especially Juror 7 (Jack Warden), who has tickets to a baseball game that evening; and Juror 10 (Ed Begley Sr.), who believes that people from slum backgrounds are liars, wild, and dangerous.The rest of the film's focus is the jury's difficulty in reaching a unanimous verdict. While several of the jurors harbor personal prejudices, Juror 8 maintains that the evidence presented in the case is circumstantial, and that the boy deserves a fair deliberation. He calls into question the accuracy and reliability of the only two witnesses to the murder, the \\"rarity\\" of the murder weapon (a common switchblade, of which he has an identical copy), and the overall questionable circumstances. He further argues that he cannot in good conscience vote \\"guilty\\" when he feels there is reasonable doubt of the boy's guilt.Having argued several points and gotten no favorable response from the others, Juror 8 reluctantly agrees that he has only succeeded in hanging the jury.

North Carolina is the 28th most extensive and the 9th most populous of the U.S. states. The state is divided into 100 counties. The capital is Raleigh. The most populous municipality is Charlotte, and it is the second largest banking center in the United States after New York City.    Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'located in the administrative territorial entity' with 'chapel hill'.\\nAnswer:","response":"The entity that has the relation 'located in the administrative territorial entity' with 'Chapel Hill' is the 'University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill'. This is evident from the information given which indicates that this public research university is specifically located in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, often referred to as UNC or simply Carolina, was chartered in 1789 and began enrolling students in 1795, making it one of the oldest public universities in the U.S. \\n\\nAdditionally, within the university's campus in Chapel Hill, the Woollen Gymnasium is also located. This gymnasium was the home court of the North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball team from early 1938 until 1965. It was replaced by the Carmichael Auditorium which was built as an annex to Woollen. However, the gymnasium is still in use today for physical education classes, intramural events, and as the location for the Roy Williams Basketball Camp during the summer months. \\n\\nTherefore, both the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the Woollen Gymnasium, which is a facility within the university's premises, hold a relation of being 'located in the administrative territorial entity' of Chapel Hill."},{"question":"Meillä on vuoropuhelusta erinomaisia kokemuksia ja katsomme sen toimivan hyvin.\\n\\nTranslate to English","response":"\\"We have excellent experiences from the dialogue and we see it working well.\\"\\n\\nThis means that we really enjoyed talking and discussing with each other and we feel it's a good way to communicate or share ideas.

Alan invents a story about a surprise party for Brooke and watches Paula invite Matt inside. Paula's dog attacks Alan, and he shoots it in self-defense. After returning to his car, he drives to work. At his dental practice, Alan's first appointment goes poorly when he hallucinates a child has rotten teeth and accidentally stabs him. As Detective Gibbs investigates the death of Paula's dog, Alan sees his second patient, April Reign, a beauty queen. Alan hallucinates she is his wife, and, while she is unconscious, takes off her pantyhose and fondles her before choking her. As she wakes, Alan snaps out of it and hides her pantyhose. Alan tells his manager, Steve Landers, she is still dizzy from nitrous oxide. When Steve realizes what really happened, he returns, punches Alan, and threatens a lawsuit. Alan ends the day early and sends his staff and patients home, including Sarah, a teenager who wants to have her braces removed.

Construction of the Manchester South Junction and Altrincham Railway began in 1845. The line was opened in October 1849, with  services from Manchester London Road via Sale to Altrincham. In 1931 it became one of Great Britain's first electrified railway lines, with a 1,500 V DC overhead line. At the same time a new Altrincham station was opened on the same line, at Navigation Road, serving housing developments in the area. By 1937, 130 train services ran daily between Manchester and Altrincham. The line was renovated in the early 1990s to form part of the Manchester Metrolink light rail system. Broadheath railway station served the northern part of Altrincham between 1853 and 1962, on the line from Manchester, via Lymm to Warrington.Altrincham Interchange is one of the Metrolink's termini. The interchange was refurbished (2015–16), and now includes a brand new footbridge, with 3 lifts to cope with increased passenger demands, a larger scale ticket office, and modern bus interchange. The new Interchange is a modern design building that looks fantastic and is helping to regenerate Altrincham city centre as the new building has helped to transform the surrounding area. The Interchange connects the town to several locations in Greater Manchester, such as Sale and Bury. The service also includes Navigation Road station. Metrolink services leave around every six minutes, between 07:15 and 19:30 on weekdays, and less frequently at other times. National Rail services link the Altrincham and Navigation Road stations with Chester via Northwich, and with Manchester via Stockport. Altrincham Interchange, next to the railway station, is a hub for local bus routes. Manchester Airport, the largest in the UK outside London, is 5 miles (8 km) to the southeast of the town, and is connected via the Manchester Picadilly – Crewe line. There are plans in the future to create a new link between Manchester Airport and the Mid Cheshire Line, which Altrincham Interchange is a station on. Recently the Metrolink completed connections...\\nAnswer:","response":"The name of the new building that has helped to transform the surrounding area is the Altrincham Interchange.

Given the context: How would Others feel as a result?  Possible answers: are shrewd and tactful with her money and tenants, put out, are strict and miserly towards the tenants\\nThe answer to this question is:","response":"As a result, others might feel that Bailey is being strict and miserly towards the tenants since she is unwilling to provide any financial relief or understanding in regards to their rent payments. Elaborating on the possible answers, we can analyze how people could perceive Bailey's actions from different perspectives:\\n\\n1. Shrewd and tactful with her money and tenants: Some people may view Bailey in a positive light, admiring her ability to handle her finances effectively. They might consider her as a person who is conscious about her financial responsibilities, like paying taxes, and ensuring that her tenants are equally responsible for their rent payments. In this case, people could perceive Bailey as a business-minded individual who prioritizes her financial stability over cutting tenants any breaks.\\n\\n2. Put out: On the other hand, some people may feel put out by Bailey's actions as she is unwilling to offer any leniency towards her tenants. This could make them question her empathy and compassion as a landlord, especially if the tenants are going through difficult financial situations themselves. People with this perspective may think that Bailey prioritizes her interests above the wellbeing of her tenants, creating a sense of discontent and frustration.\\n\\n3. Strict and miserly towards the tenants: The majority of people might consider Bailey as being overly strict and miserly towards her tenants due to her inflexibility in providing any financial assistance or understanding. This perception could lead to the belief that she is focused solely on protecting her assets rather than nurturing a supportive and understanding landlord-tenant relationship. People with this viewpoint may perceive Bailey as a cold-hearted individual who lacks compassion for the human element in her business dealings.\\n\\nIn conclusion, Bailey's actions of not cutting her tenants any breaks in order to pay taxes can create mixed feelings among others. Some may appreciate her attention to financial matters and consider her a responsible landlord, while others may be frustrated and perceive her as strict, miserly, and lacking empathy for her tenants' situations. Ultimately, the perception of Bailey's actions would depend on individual values and beliefs around responsibility, empathy, and the role of a landlord in supporting their tenants."},{"question":"While no other Timely character would achieve the success of these \\"big three\\", some notable heroes—many of which continue to appear in modern-day retcon appearances and flashbacks—include the Whizzer, Miss America, the Destroyer, the original Vision, and the Angel.

I've always liked Columbo, though, somehow without even having seen that much of him. Peter Falk is and has always been the perfect choice for the character, because of his looks, his voice and his charm. The perfect proof of this is that though the series started all the way back in 1968, the latest(and probably not last) of the films was made in 2003. That's 35 years. And Falk was 40 back when he made the first one. The series consists of 68 films(unless my count is off), all of which are made for TV. Everyone knows the character, even though no one has ever seen a film featuring him in the cinema. That is quite an accomplishment, if you ask me. The plot is pretty good. The only problem I have with it is that the killer and murder is revealed at the very beginning(though that may be the same for all of the Columbo films), leaving no mystery but how Columbo solves it, making it somewhat dull(since there's not much to look forward to at the end of the film). The pacing is good, there's hardly a scene where you're bored. The acting is very good, particularly that of Falk and Ruth Gordon. They have some great exchanges of dialog in the film. The characters are well-written and credible. The dialog and script is unusually good for a TV-movie.

Physical conditioning: Baseball requires a combination of strength, speed, agility, and endurance. Alex should engage in regular physical training to build muscle, improve coordination, and increase stamina.\\n\\n4.

This may include refining their swing mechanics, stance, and overall plate approach.\\n\\n5. Practice patience at the plate: Recognizing good pitches to hit and avoiding chasing after bad ones is crucial. Alex should learn to be patient at the plate and make smart decisions about which pitches to swing at.\\n\\n6.

This skill will help them anticipate where the ball will be and make contact more effectively.\\n\\n7. Develop a strong mental game: Baseball is a sport with a lot of ups and downs. Alex will need to learn how to handle adversity, maintain focus, and stay confident throughout the season.\\n\\n8. Learn from experienced coaches and players: To develop a more comprehensive understanding of the game and improve their skills, Alex should consult with experienced coaches and players who can provide valuable advice and guidance.\\n\\n9.

Unfortunately, the app has been nothing but a source of immense frustration and disappointment. Here are a few reasons why I would not recommend this app to anyone:\\n\\n1. Unreliable and Inaccurate Data: The primary purpose of a ticker widget is to provide accurate stock market information. However, this app fails miserably in that regard. The stock prices are often wrong, and there are frequent instances of missing or delayed updates. This alone makes the app nearly useless for its intended purpose.\\n\\n2. Unintuitive Interface and Design: The user interface is cumbersome and not user-friendly. The process of adding stocks to the widget is not straightforward, and navigating through the settings is an exasperating experience. The design lacks creativity and feels outdated compared to other apps in the market. \\n\\n3. Lack of Customization Options: The app provides very few options to customize the look and feel of the widget. Users are stuck with a drab and unappealing appearance that makes it difficult to interpret the information provided. Many other apps offer a better level of personalization, allowing users to create a visually pleasing and functional widget.\\n\\n4. Poor Performance and Battery Drain: The app constantly drains the phone's battery, even when it isn't in active use. Moreover, it often crashes and freezes, forcing me to restart my phone to get it working again. This is not only an inconvenience but severely diminishes the overall user experience.\\n\\n5. Non-existent Customer Support: Upon encountering these issues, I tried to reach out to the developers for help, only to find that they are completely unresponsive. This demonstrates a clear lack of concern for the user experience and a disregard for the issues affecting their app.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I regret downloading the com.github.premnirmal.tickerwidget app and cannot recommend it to anyone in its current state. There are myriad other apps available that do the job more accurately and efficiently. Save yourself the frustration and look elsewhere for a reliable stock ticker widget."},{"question":"Consider the question.

Equally important is Tone Number 1, pure white - this, and the darkest tone, give you the complete tonal range to use in your drawings. Important - You don't need all these tones - 1 to 10 - in a drawing, but you do need the lightest, No. Look at pure white tone No 1 for a minute. Beginners often make a superb tonal scale, but somehow are afraid to re-create that darkest tone on their actual drawings. Good quality pencils and paper will definitely help - the next article will show you the pencil grades, and  how to get the most from them. Happy drawing!\\"\\n\\nArticle:","response":"Title: Understanding Tone and Utilizing the Complete Tonal Range in Your Drawings\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nAs artists, color and tone play a significant role in expressing our ideas and emotions on paper. Creating the perfect balance of light and darkness in our drawings can be challenging for beginners and experienced artists alike. By understanding the tonal scale and mastering the technique of incorporating the different shades, you can create visually striking and well-rounded artwork.\\n\\nIn this article, we'll delve deeper into tone, highlighting the importance of the lightest and darkest tones in your drawings, and offer some tips for getting the best results with quality pencils and paper.\\n\\nDeciphering the Tonal Scale: Light and Darkness\\n\\nAt its most basic definition, tone refers to the relative darkness or lightness of a color. When creating a drawing, using the tonal scale from 1 to 10 helps in ensuring you have the right balance between the lightest and darkest shades. However, it's essential to remember that not every drawing requires all ten tones.\\n\\nOne of the most important elements to keep in mind is Tone Number 1, often represented by the pure white of your paper. This pure white, together with the darkest tone, provides you the complete tonal range to work with in your drawings. To create depth, beginners can face and conquer their fears of utilizing the darkest tone in their artwork by observing pure white tone No. 1 and other their own drawings. Comparing and contrasting different shades will help artists gain the confidence they need to incorporate all tonal values in their work.\\n\\nWhy the Lightest and Darkest Tones Matter\\n\\nThe lightest and darkest tones of your art play a crucial role in creating depth, contrast, and visual texture. Tones can both enhance or subdue the features of your subject and your composition. Whether you are drawing landscapes, portraits, or still-life scenes, having a well-balanced tonal range will strengthen the overall viewing experience.\\n\\nUsing good quality pencils and paper will pave the way for achieving better results. The next section will discuss pencil grades and how to effectively use them to maximize your potential as an artist.\\n\\nAn Introduction to Pencil Grades and Paper Quality\\n\\nUnderstanding pencil grades is essential for utilizing the full capabilities of your drawing equipment. Pencil grades vary depending on the hardness or softness of the graphite core. Harder pencils have a higher proportion of clay and lower levels of graphite, whereas softer pencils contain more graphite and less clay. Typically, the pencil grades range from 9H (hardest) to 9B (softest). Choosing the right pencil grade for your drawing depends on your intended outcome, whether you want to create lighter or darker tones, or if you want crisp, fine lines or bold, thick strokes.\\n\\nQuality paper is also crucial when it comes to bringing out the best in your artwork. As an artist, you should carefully select the right paper depending on the techniques you intend to use, such as blending, layering, or graphite application. The three main factors to consider when choosing the suitable paper are weight, texture, and color.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nTo become a skilled artist, mastering the depth, contrast, and visual appeal of your art through the tonal scale is vital. Gaining the confidence to utilize the lightest and darkest tones effectively will allow you to elevate your artwork to new heights. Don't be afraid to explore your drawing tools and experiment with paper choices to ensure the foundation for your drawings is strong and supportive.\\n\\nRemember, the path to improving your art lies in understanding the importance of tonal range, selecting the right pencil grades, and choosing the appropriate paper to unveil the hidden potential in your drawings.

This post discusses and explores my experiences of being a PhD student researching women’s lived experiences of research evaluation in the UK, and my thoughts on and experiences of interviewing very senior and esteemed academics as a junior researcher. My PhD study explored research evaluation in the form of the Research Excellence Framework (REF) – a weighty force in UK academia – the outcomes of which, I argue, hold the potential to alter the course of an academic career considerably, as well as playing a role in the type of work that some academics do, particularly given the REF impact agenda. There is currently an international trend towards research evaluation with programmes such as the Excellence in Research for Australia (ERA), the Performance-Based Research fund in New Zealand (PBRF), and equivalents in countries including Denmark, Switzerland and the Netherlands. What is clear is that there is not enough qualitative, exploratory research into the effects of research evaluation on academic careers, especially for women, and so my PhD study was born. My findings suggest that research evaluation in the UK actively contributes to the continuance of gender inequality regimes in the academy, and that the ability to negotiate managerial control and be politically savvy is increasingly important in the academic world. Before embarking on my PhD, I was acutely aware of the sensitivity of my research, as well as my own positionality with regards to my participants. Reflection is and was an important element in the research process for me, as it allowed me to reflect on the effects of the self on the research process and, ultimately, also on the data, as well as the various power dynamics discernible during interviews for my study. I was continually taken aback by participants’... According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: Why was the author aware of their positionality? Options:  A. because they were doing research on research evaluation  B. not enough information  C. because they were a junior researcher  D. because they were British\\nAnswer:","response":"C. because they were a junior researcher"},{"question":"Paragraph: Breathing is the process of moving air into and out of the lungs. The process depends on a muscle called the diaphragm. This is a large, sheet-like muscle below the lungs. Inhaling, or breathing in, occurs when the diaphragm muscle tightens. This increases the size of the chest. This too decreases air pressure inside the lungs. This action allows air and gases to enter the lungs. Exhaling, or breathing out, occurs when the diaphragm muscle relaxes. This decreases the size of the chest. This increases air pressure inside the lungs. This action allows for air to leave the lungs. When you inhale, air enters the respiratory system through your nose and ends up in your lungs, where gas exchange with the blood takes place. What happens to the air along the way? In the nose, mucus and hairs trap any dust or other particles in the air. The air is also warmed and moistened. Next, air passes through a passageway that is connected to the windpipe. The air then finds its way to the lungs. In the chest, the windpipe splits so that air enters both the right and left lung. \\n\\nQuestion: \\"What happens to the size of the chest when the diaphragm muscle tightens?\\"\\n\\nAnswer: \\"Decreases\\"\\n\\nBased on the paragraph, is this answer correct","response":"No, based on the paragraph, the correct answer is: \\n\\nWhen the diaphragm muscle tightens, the size of the chest increases."},{"question":"Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: If you had the chance to leave the life you have now, what would you do?

It's important for individuals to be able to communicate effectively and resolve conflicts in order to maintain healthy relationships. As an AI, I cannot predict the behavior of specific individuals, but based on the information provided, I can suggest some possible steps that Jan might want to take next in order to continue strengthening their relationship with Ash.\\n\\n1.

There were 60 women at the party, and three-fourths of these women were married and brought their husbands with them to the party. If 3/4 of the men at the party were single, how many people attended the party?\\nAnswer. 240\\nWhat step-by-step reasoning justifies that answer?","response":"Answer: 150\\nLet's break it down step-by-step.\\n\\n1. Three-fourths of the women at the party were married: (3/4) * 60 = 45 married women.\\n2. Each married woman brought her husband, so there were also 45 married men at the party.\\n3. The total number of married people at the party is 45 (married women) + 45 (married husbands) = 90.\\n4. As 3/4 of the men at the party were single, 1/4 of the men were married (which we already know are 45 married men).\\n5. To find the total number of men at the party, we can set up the equation: (1/4) * Total Men = 45 married men\\n6. Solving for Total Men: Total Men = 45 * 4 = 180 men.\\n7. Now we know there were 180 men and 60 women at the party, so the total number of people at the party is 180 (men) + 60 (women) = 240.\\n\\nHowever, upon re-examining the problem, we find that there is an error in the last step. The number 180 includes both single and married men. Since there are 45 married men and their wives, the total number of people at the party is actually 60 (women) + 180 (total men) - 45 (married men already included in the count by the women) = 195.\\n\\nSo the correct answer is 195, not 240."},{"question":"Highway Cleanup<br>One day Eleanor decided to join the Highway Cleanup team.

While the general natural treatments will help, there are other things you can do to alleviate individual symptoms. Symptoms of the common cold can include:   Nasal dryness or irritation is often the first symptom. Sore throat or an irritated, itchy throat is another common first symptom. Nasal discharge, nasal congestion, and sneezing.  These usually get worse over the next 2-3 days after the first symptoms. The nasal discharge is usually clear and watery. It may become thicker and greenish-yellow. Headache or body aches. Watery eyes. Facial and ear pressure from congested sinuses. Loss of sense of smell and taste. Cough and/or hoarseness. A low-grade fever may occur, usually in infants and preschool children. For stuffy nose, put a couple drops eucalyptus, peppermint, and tea tree oil in a bowl of boiling water. Put your face over it (not too close — don't burn yourself on the steam!) and cover with towel to inhale steam. You can also put these oils right into your bathwater. You can use natural cough drops or throat sprays, which will help to moisturize your throat and ease discomfort. If you have a dry cough, milk will moisturize your throat and help you feel better. If you have a productive cough (with phlegm coming up) milk will increase the problem. If you are concerned about strep throat, a cough indicates that you do not have strep. For a general sore throat, gargle with warm salt water to kill bacteria. You can add one drop of tea tree oil to a warm salt water gargle, if available. This will help to kill bacteria in the throat. The common cold can be complicated by ear infections (otitis media), sinusitis (inflammation of the sinuses), chronic bronchitis (lung inflammation with congestion and coughing) and worsening of asthma symptoms. If you have a combination of illnesses, it may be best to consult with a doctor to get the treatment you need.\\nWhat is a summary of what this article is about?","response":"The article discusses various symptoms of the common cold and suggests specific ways to alleviate individual symptoms.

Question: A man is sitting in the stands watching bullfighters at work. He moves a little closer, just as one of the bulls breaks free of its enclosure. In a panic, the man flees for his life. He's more likely to work up a sweat while running because (A) he's exerting himself while running (B) he's not exerting himself at all while running\\nAnswer:","response":"(A) he's exerting himself while running.\\n\\nSweating is a function of the human body's autonomic nervous system and serves as a cooling mechanism in response to physical exertion, emotional stress, or exposure to high temperatures. When the body undergoes physical strain like running, there is increased metabolic activity within the body's muscles, resulting in an elevated internal body temperature.\\n\\nTo maintain homeostasis—or internal balance—the human body responds to this increase in heat by stimulating the sweat glands to produce sweat. This is a mixture of water, salt, and other minerals that, when evaporated off of the skin, cools the body down and ensures the internal temperature remains steady.\\n\\nThe scenario provided likens the situation where a man is sitting and then suddenly running. When the man simply sits in the stands watching the bullfighters, he is likely in a relaxed state and exerting minimal physical effort. Conversely, when the man sees the bull escape and starts running, he shifts into a state of high physical exertion as he flees for his life.\\n\\nRunning, particularly in a stressful situation such as this, involves the large muscle groups in the body. It not only requires more oxygen to be drawn into the lungs but also necessitates a faster pumping of the blood by the heart to supply the working muscles with oxygen and energy. Therefore, the metabolic activities within his body increase significantly compared to sitting, leading to an elevation in his internal temperature. To mitigate this, his body triggers the sweat response to cool down, making him work up a sweat as he runs.\\n\\nIn contrast, the man would not sweat heavily, if at all, if he was 'not exerting himself while running' (B), but this contradicts the normal physiological responses to running, as even a slow jog usually requires some degree of exertion.\\n\\nSo, the man is more likely to work up a sweat while running because he's exerting himself while running. Not only is he likely running at a pace fast enough to escape the bull, but he is also under a significant amount of stress, another factor that can contribute to an increase in sweat production. The combined physical exertion and emotional stress make option (A) the correct choice."},{"question":"There are no spoilers here... Because there is no plot to spoil.

A rocket fired from California intercepted and destroyed a target warhead fired toward Alaska from the other side of the Pacific Ocean. It was the first-ever test of the Ground-based Midcourse Defense system on a fast-moving \\"ICBM-range target.\\" “This system is vitally important to the defense of our homeland, and this test demonstrates that we have a capable, credible deterrent,” the director of the Missile Defense Agency says. The $244 million test was the first since 2014, according to NBC News. It was conducted amid increased worry of a potential nuclear attack from North Korea. Despite Tuesday's success, there are many questions surrounding the viability of the GMD system during an actual attack. Only nine of the previous 17 tests since 1999 had been successful, Reuters reports. And that's with tests being scripted for success: daytime launches with personnel informed of the target's launch time, size, speed, and trajectory. It's also possible North Korea could use decoys to trick the system; the GMD's interceptor rockets haven't been tested against decoys. A Pentagon spokesperson says the GMD system is just one way the Pentagon has of shooting down a potential North Korean missile. The GMD system has cost US taxpayers more than $40 billion so far.\\n\\nExpand this summary.","response":"In June 2017, the United States successfully carried out a test of its Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system, an event that US officials called \\"an incredible accomplishment.\\" The test involved a rocket being fired from California to intercept and destroy a target warhead fired towards Alaska from across the Pacific Ocean. The trial, the first-ever of the GMD system involving an Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM)-range target, cost $244 million and demonstrated that the US has a \\"capable, credible deterrent\\" against a possible nuclear attack, according to the director of the Missile Defense Agency.\\n\\nThe successful test was the first since 2014 and took place amid heightened concern over the potential threat of a nuclear strike from North Korea. The situation highlights the importance of an efficient missile-defense system, which demonstrates that the United States is prepared to counter any missile threats.\\n\\nHowever, despite the success of this test, there remain several questions about the GMD system's actual viability during an attack. Since 1999, only nine of the previous 17 tests had been successful, which raises concerns about the reliability of the system. Furthermore, these tests were carried out under controlled conditions, with launches taking place during the day and personnel being informed about the target's launch time, size, speed, and trajectory, making the tests easier to execute than under real-world circumstances.\\n\\nAdditionally, the GMD system has not been tested against decoys, a tactic North Korea could potentially employ to trick the system and enable its missiles to bypass the US defense measures. The issue of decoys is particularly crucial, as the North Korean regime has been known to invest in decoy technology for their weapons systems. Consequently, it is essential to develop and test the GMD system against decoys to ensure its effectiveness in a real attack scenario.\\n\\nIt is crucial to note that the GMD system is not the sole method of missile defense at the Pentagon's disposal. There are other defense mechanisms designed to shoot down potential North Korean missiles, such as the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system, Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System, and Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) system. Together, these missile defense systems form part of a layered approach to countering missile threats.\\n\\nNevertheless, the GMD system has cost US taxpayers more than $40 billion, a significant investment that implies the need for it to be a reliable defense measure. With the increasing unpredictability and aggression of potential adversaries, maintaining and improving the US' ballistic missile defense system is a matter of national security. It is essential to ensure the GMD system's effectiveness in real-world situations by addressing the issues of decoys and improving the success rate of tests, so that it can act as a robust deterrent and protect the United States from potential missile threats."},{"question":"Question: \\"In what type of comedy does Zidi specialize?\\"  Context: \\"Parisians tend to share the same movie-going trends as many of the world's global cities, with cinemas primarily dominated by Hollywood-generated film entertainment.

It’s likely the most significant outbreak of the disease outside the Middle East, and over the weekend, the World Health Organization released details on new cases of the disease in South Korea. It also issued a surprising piece of advice for individuals seeking to avoid infection: Drink neither raw camel milk nor camel urine. \\n  \\n That’s perhaps not as strange as it sounds. While the exact transmission mechanisms remain unclear, it is thought that the disease has its origins in bats and that camels may serve as a transmission point to humans. And in parts of the Middle East, drinking camel urine is not as uncommon as one might think. In parts of the Arabian Peninsula, the liquid is consumed for its allegedly palliative properties. The Prophet Mohammed is said to have informed his followers to drink camel urine to cure them of disease. \\n  \\n In 2013, an intrepid reporter for Vice sampled the substance while in Yemen. “The taste of warm piss is, as you would expect, disgusting,” he wrote. “But when it’s mixed with camel milk, as it traditionally is, it’s even worse. Getting rid of the musky aftertaste that takes over your mouth after the first sip is impossible.” \\n  \\n Health researchers have also warned that Saudi camel traders may be another possible point of transmission for MERS. By drinking raw camel milk, they warn, the traders may be unwittingly transferring the disease from their herds to the human population. \\n  \\n Since 2012, the WHO has documented 1,190 cases of MERS with at least 440 deaths. \\n  \\n Photo credit: Chris Jackson/Getty Images ||||| Recent Travelers from the Arabian Peninsula \\n  \\n If you develop a fever* and symptoms of respiratory illness, such as cough or shortness of breath, within 14 days after traveling from countries in or near the Arabian Peninsula**, you should call ahead to a healthcare provider and mention your recent travel. \\n  \\n Close Contacts of an Ill Traveler from the Arabian Peninsula \\n  \\n If you have had close contact*** with someone within 14 days after they traveled from a country in or near the Arabian Peninsula**, and the traveler has/had fever* and symptoms of respiratory illness, such as cough or shortness of breath, you should monitor your health for 14 days, starting from the day you were last exposed to the ill person. \\n  \\n If you develop fever* and symptoms of respiratory illness, such as cough or shortness of breath, you should call ahead to a healthcare provider and mention your recent contact with the traveler. \\n  \\n Close Contacts of a Confirmed Case of MERS \\n  \\n If you have had close contact*** with someone who has a confirmed MERS-CoV infection, you should contact a healthcare provider for an evaluation.

For more information, see Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Hospitalized Patients with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). \\n  \\n People with Exposure to Camels \\n  \\n MERS-CoV has been found in some camels, and some MERS patients have reported contact with camels. However, we do not know exactly how people become infected with MERS-CoV. \\n  \\n The World Health Organization has posted a general precaution for anyone visiting farms, markets, barns, or other places where animals are present. Travelers should practice general hygiene measures, including regular handwashing before and after touching animals, and avoiding contact with sick animals. Travelers should also avoid consumption of raw or undercooked animal products. For more information, see WHO’s Frequently Asked Questions on MERS-CoV. (Should people avoid contact with camels or camel products? Is it safe to visit farms, markets, or camel fairs?) \\n  \\n The World Health Organization considers certain groups to be at high risk for severe MERS. These groups include people with diabetes, kidney failure, or chronic lung disease, and people who have weakened immune systems. The World Health Organization recommends that these groups take additional precautions: \\n  \\n Avoid contact with camels \\n  \\n Do not drink raw camel milk or raw camel urine \\n  \\n Do not eat undercooked meat, particularly camel meat \\n  \\n *Fever may not be present in some patients, such as those who are very young, elderly, immunosuppressed, or taking certain medications. Clinical judgement should be used to guide testing of patients in such situations. \\n  \\n **Countries considered in the Arabian Peninsula and neighboring include: Bahrain; Iraq; Iran; Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza; Jordan; Kuwait; Lebanon; Oman; Qatar; Saudi Arabia; Syria; the United Arab Emirates (UAE); and Yemen. \\n  \\n ***Close contact is defined as a) being within approximately 6 feet (2 meters), or within the room or care area, of a confirmed MERS case for a prolonged period of time (such as caring for, living with, visiting, or sharing a healthcare waiting area or room with, a confirmed MERS case) while not wearing recommended personal protective equipment or PPE (e.g., gowns, gloves, NIOSH-certified disposable N95 respirator, eye protection); or b) having direct contact with infectious secretions of a confirmed MERS case (e.g., being coughed on) while not wearing recommended personal protective equipment. See CDC’s Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Hospitalized Patients with MERS. Data to inform the definition of close contact are limited; considerations when assessing close contact include the duration of exposure (e.g., longer exposure time likely increases exposure risk) and the clinical symptoms of the person with MERS (e.g., coughing likely increases exposure risk). Special consideration should be given to those exposed in healthcare settings. For detailed information regarding healthcare personnel (HCP) please review CDC’s Interim U.S. Guidance for Monitoring and Movement of Persons with Potential Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) Exposure. Transient interactions, such as walking by a person with MERS, are not thought to constitute an exposure; however, final determination should be made in consultation with public health authorities. \\n  \\n Top of Page ||||| People have been consuming camel piss on the Arabian Peninsula for a long, long time. It’s been used by the Bedouin people as a shampoo and medicine for centuries, and it’s part of Muslim tradition as well; the Prophet Mohammed is said to have once told some of his sick followers to drink camel milk and pee “till their bodies became healthy.” \\n  \\n Since the seventh century, Yemenis have been following his advice. Statistics about camel urine use are rare, but if you spend any time in Yemen you’ll find some people, mostly in the countryside, who drink urine as a cure for whatever ails them. Some salons use it as a remedy for hair loss, and it’s even occasionally prescribed by some doctors. \\n  \\n Researchers in Muslim countries have lately been trying to lend some scientific basis to the claims that drinking piss will cure diseases. In February, a team from King Abdulaziz University in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, claimed they had extracted a substance called PMF701 from camel urine that could be used to treat cancer. Similar claims were made by the same researchers in 2009, when they said they’d seen evidence that camel milk and pee could fight eczema and psoriasis. \\n  \\n They were never given permission from the Saudi Food and Drug Authority to conduct more studies on patients, however, and there have been plenty of scientists and doctors in the region who have publicly denounced the practice of sipping camel pee. Lecturers from Sana’a University, in Yemen’s capital, have gone out of their way to remind people that quaffing urine is bad for your digestive system, and Dr. Rida Al-Wakil, a professor at a medical school in Egypt, told Alrai, an Arabic-language newspaper in Kuwait, that ads for camel urine treatments for hepatitis were “misleading” and potentially dangerous. \\n  \\n While recently near Ta’izz, Yemen’s third-largest city, I decided to see what all the fuss was about for myself. According to herders I spoke to, pee from virgin female camels is highly prized for its delicate taste and curative powers, and can cost up to the equivalent of $20 for a single liter. I went with nonvirgin urine—for the equivalent of about $4, I got a fresh liter of it from a camel herder named Ahmed and took a long drink. \\n  \\n The taste of warm piss is, as you would expect, disgusting. But when it’s mixed with camel milk, as it traditionally is, it’s even worse. Getting rid of the musky aftertaste that takes over your mouth after the first sip is impossible. It didn’t make me feel any healthier, but it didn’t make me sicker either. \\n  \\n More from the Hot Box Issue: \\n  \\n Itty-Bitty Kitty, Giant Spirit \\n  \\n I Left My Lungs in Aamjiwnaang \\n  \\n It’s Good to Be the King ||||| Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) – Republic of Korea \\n  \\n On 5 June 2015, the National IHR Focal Point of the Republic of Korea notified WHO of 5 additional confirmed cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), including 1 death. \\n  \\n Details of the cases are as follows: \\n  \\n A 49-year-old male developed symptoms on 23 May while admitted to hospital since 14 May. The patient shared the room with a laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV case that was reported in a previous DON on 4 June (case n. 1). He tested positive for MERS-CoV on 31 May. \\n  \\n A 62-year-old male developed symptoms on 2 June and visited the emergency room of a local health care facility on the same day. The patient was admitted to hospital between 20 and 28 May. During this period, he shared the same floor with four patients that were later confirmed and reported as MERS-CoV cases. On 29 May, the patient visited a local health care facility for unrelated medical conditions. He was isolated in a negative pressure room on 2 June. The patient tested positive for MERS-CoV on 3 June. \\n  \\n A 24-year-old male developed symptoms on 22 May. Between 22 and 28 May, the patient was admitted to the same hospital room as two previously confirmed MERS-CoV cases. He tested positive for MERS-CoV on 4 June. \\n  \\n A 70-year-old female developed symptoms on 31 May. The doctor who was involved in the care of her husband was confirmed positive for MERS-CoV on 3 June. She tested positive for MERS-CoV on 4 June. \\n  \\n A 45-year-old male developed symptoms on 4 June. The patient was admitted to hospital from 14 to 27 May for an unrelated medical condition. Although he did not have symptoms for MERS-CoV, the patient was isolated at home because of close contact at the hospital with MERS-CoV cases. He was transferred to another hospital for isolation on 2 June. The patient tested positive for MERS-CoV on 3 June. \\n  \\n Contact tracing of household and healthcare contacts is ongoing for the cases. \\n  \\n The National IHR Focal Point of the Republic of Korea also notified WHO of the death of 1 previously reported MERS-CoV case. The case was reported in a previous DON on 30 May (case n. 3). \\n  \\n So far, a total of 41 MERS-CoV cases, including 4 deaths, have been reported to WHO by the National IHR Focal Point of the Republic of Korea. One of the 41 cases is the case that was confirmed in China and also notified by the National IHR Focal Point of China. \\n  \\n Globally, since September 2012, WHO has been notified of 1190 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 444 related deaths. \\n  \\n WHO advice \\n  \\n Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns. \\n  \\n Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures. \\n  \\n Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS‐CoV infection. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to. \\n  \\n Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked. \\n  \\n WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions. |||||\\nWhat is a summary?","response":"South Korea experienced an outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2015, which resulted in the death of 10 people and infected more than 120 individuals. The virus is believed to have originated from bats and transmitted to humans through camels. The outbreak caused significant panic in the country, leading to the closure of over 2,600 schools and kindergartens. South Korean officials believed that the outbreak had peaked, and many schools were urged to reopen as there was no evidence of sustained community transmission at the time.

It was a long time is all I know. For my birthday, my parents took me and my brother out of school on the day before my birthday and we took a train. (Funny interjection, my mom was caught on the wrong side of the station so she ran across the rails and was pulled up by my dad a couple minutes before the train came.) It was a night train, so we had our own room where my brother and I claimed the top as our territory. (Look at my younger self’s squinty eyes… They are staring into your soul) Anyways, it was morning by the time we arrived at where I would spend my birthday. Vienna, Austria. I quickly got off the train in excitement taking in the view of the station like it was first time I had seen anything. We exited the station and took the trolley to get to our hotel. For breakfast, we had delicious, regional delicacies (among other things). They looked similar to crepes, but all I know is that it had a German name that I can’t remember. After we got situated in our hotel, we immediately headed off for the Mozart Plaza/Park. My family and I also visited other monuments that day: By the end of the day, our legs were worn out. We had rode so many trolleys and walked so much that I’m pretty sure that any longer and we would’ve collapsed on the spot. The bed never felt so good.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Since his death, Thomson's work has grown in value and popularity. Group of Seven member Arthur Lismer wrote that he \\"is the manifestation of the Canadian character\\". Another contemporaneous Canadian painter, David Milne, wrote to National Gallery of Canada Director H. O. McCurry in 1930, \\"Your Canadian art apparently, for now at least, went down in Canoe Lake. Tom Thomson still stands as the Canadian painter, harsh, brilliant, brittle, uncouth, not only most Canadian but most creative. How the few things of his stick in one's mind.\\" For Canadian artists Roy Kiyooka and Dennis Lee, he is a \\"haunting presence\\" and \\"embodies the Canadian artistic identity\\".As of 2015, the highest price achieved by a Thomson sketch was Early Spring, Canoe Lake, which sold in 2009 for CAD$2,749,500. Few major canvases remain in private collections, making the record unlikely to be broken. One example of the demand his work has achieved is the previously lost Sketch for Lake in Algonquin Park. Discovered in an Edmonton basement in 2018, it sold for nearly half a million dollars at a Toronto auction. The increased value of his work has led to the discovery of numerous forgeries on the market.In 1967, the Tom Thomson Art Gallery opened in Owen Sound. In 1968, Thomson's shack from behind the Studio Building was moved to the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg. Many of his works are also on display at the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, the Art Gallery of Ontario, and the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg, Ontario. His influence can be seen in the work of later Canadian artists, including Joyce Wieland. In 2004, another historical marker honouring Thomson was moved from its previous location near the centre of Leith to the graveyard in which he is now buried.

Wash the garment using the cycle and temperature on the care tag. Wash the garment again if the stain remains. Dry the garment once the stain is completely gone.\\"\\n\\nArticle:","response":"Title: A Step-By-Step Guide to Effectively Removing Stains from Your Clothes\\n\\nIntroduction:\\n\\nStains on clothes are a common yet frustrating problem that we all face. Whether it's a splash of red wine, a smudge of ketchup, or a drop of coffee, stain removal can prove to be a tricky task. To help you tackle the most stubborn of stains, we have prepared a step-by-step guide on how to use a laundry pre-treatment stain remover and follow the correct washing and drying procedure. By following these instructions, you'll be able to enjoy clean and spotless clothes in no time.\\n\\nStep 1: Apply a laundry pre-treatment stain remover\\n\\nBefore you toss your stained clothing into the washing machine, it's essential to pre-treat the stain with a suitable stain remover. This step is crucial for several reasons:\\n\\n- It helps break down the stain and makes it easier to remove during the wash cycle.\\n- Some stains may become more difficult to remove if they are washed without pre-treatment.\\n- Pre-treating will increase the effectiveness of your detergent and reduce the need for multiple washes.\\n\\nTo apply the pre-treatment stain remover, follow these guidelines:\\n\\n1. First, choose the right stain remover based on the type of stain and the fabric of your garment. For example, enzyme-based stain removers are great for protein-based stains like blood or sweat, while oxygen-based removers work well on colored stains like red wine or fruit juice.\\n2. Apply the stain remover directly to the stained area, making sure to follow the product's instructions.\\n3. Rub the stain gently with a soft brush or your fingertips to work the stain remover into the fabric.\\n4. Allow the stain remover to sit for the recommended amount of time, typically ranging from a few minutes to an hour. This step ensures that the stain remover has enough time to break down the stain.\\n\\nStep 2: Wash the garment using the cycle and temperature on the care tag\\n\\nOnce the stain remover has been applied, it's time to wash the garment in your washing machine. To do this:\\n\\n1. Check the care tag on your garment to determine the recommended wash cycle and water temperature. Following these instructions will help preserve the lifespan and quality of your clothing while effectively removing stains.\\n2. Add your regular detergent and any fabric softeners or other laundry additives you typically use.\\n3. Insert the garment into the washing machine and start the cycle according to the care tag’s recommendations.\\n\\nStep 3: Wash the garment again if the stain remains\\n\\nIf, after the first wash cycle, the stain remains, it may be necessary to repeat the process. Simply reapply the pre-treatment stain remover and put the garment through another wash cycle, using the same settings recommended on the care tag.\\n\\nStep 4: Dry the garment once the stain is completely gone\\n\\nBefore drying your garment, double-check to ensure the stain has been entirely removed. If necessary, repeat the pre-treatment and washing steps until you're satisfied with the results. Drying a garment with a stain still present can set the stain and make it even more challenging to remove later.\\n\\nOnce you're sure the stain has been removed, follow the drying recommendations on the garment's care tag. This may mean air-drying the clothing or using a specific dryer setting.\\n\\nConclusion:\\n\\nBy following this step-by-step guide to effectively removing stains from your clothes, you'll be able to save your favorite garments and maintain their appearance for years to come. Remember to always pre-treat stains with a suitable stain remover, wash according to the care tag's recommendations, and only dry the garment once you're sure the stain has been removed. With a little patience and attention to detail, removing stains will become a breeze."},{"question":"Answer the following question: The Sydney Morning Herald -  The Sydney Morning Herald (SMH) is a daily compact newspaper published by Fairfax Media in Sydney.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more items thrown away that can be reused happens, how will it affect the inner core is smaller.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?\\n","response":"In the context of a red giant transforming into a white dwarf and the perturbation hypothesis, the hypothesis proposes that additional elements thrown away or not reused might affect the inner core's size. However, it is crucial to understand the stages of a red giant's transformation into a white dwarf to determine if this perturbation would affect the process directly or indirectly.\\n\\nThe process of a red giant becoming a white dwarf can be summarized into following steps:\\n\\n1. The red giant's core fuses hydrogen and helium, creating high temperatures and massive amounts of energy.\\n2. As the hydrogen and helium decrease, the core temperature continues to rise, causing the star to expand.\\n3. The core eventually becomes comprised mostly of carbon and oxygen. At this point, the temperature is insufficient to initiate carbon fusion.\\n4. The outer layers of the red giant are released into space due to gravitational forces no longer retaining these layers.\\n5. Once the outer layers have been ejected, the remaining core, known as a white dwarf, is left behind.\\n\\nThe perturbation hypothesis suggests that if more elements/materials are ejected from the red giant than what is mentioned in the process, it could influence the size of the inner core. Nonetheless, there might not be any direct effect on the transition stages outlined above, since the core temperature and fusion processes determine the evolution of the star.\\n\\nHowever, there might be indirect effects in the sense that having a slightly smaller core could influence the overall lifespan and properties of the resulting white dwarf. For instance, the cooling rate of the white dwarf or the time it will take to eventually transform into a black dwarf might change. \\n\\nIn summary, the perturbation hypothesis might not have a direct effect on the transformation process of a red giant into a white dwarf, but it could indirectly influence some properties and the lifecycle of the resulting white dwarf."},{"question":"Question: I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

He will give us rebounds, he has, and he will give us cheesy ones on the net.\\"\\n\\nThe Caps lost that night in a shootout despite playing one of their best games of the season. Until Sunday, Neuvirth had played in only three games since then, the most recent on Jan. 18 against Philadelphia, when he came out after the first period with an injury. Though the Capitals have not formally designated a No. 1 goalie, Varlamov has had the hot hand, and Boudreau has been taking full advantage.\\n\\nThe Penguins got no \\"cheesy ones\\" on Sunday. Neuvirth made the most of his opportunity, making stick saves, glove saves, pad saves, body saves, smothering saves, lucky saves - 22 in all. He may have opened a savings account between periods. He got a lot of help and protection from his defensemen as well.\\n\\nOf course, the Penguins were not at full strength. Sidney Crosby missed his 13th game with a concussion and the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review reported that he might not return until March. Evgeni Malkin is out for the season after tearing two knee ligaments. That's a lot of lost firepower, and it's a credit to Pittsburgh that it had won eight of its past nine games without Crosby entering Sunday. But it's also a credit to Neuvirth that he was able to stop 22 shots after nearly three weeks out of action and on a few hours' notice.\\n\\n\\"He did make some saves as we did have a couple flurries,\\" Bylsma said afterward. \\"There was a couple pucks in the crease that he was strong on and we could have been much better.\\"\\n\\nNot glowing praise, but better than \\"cheesy ones,\\" certainly. Neuvirth's performance was also crucial because it gave the Caps well-played, back-to-back wins. They played perhaps their best game of the season Friday night against the division-leading Lightning in Tampa. They have two more home games this week to build on that momentum before heading off on a five-game trip that will take them to Phoenix, Anaheim, San Jose, Buffalo and, finally, Pittsburgh. (The league office might as well be put on alert now. A lot of blood was spilled Sunday - most of it the Caps' - and it seems unlikely the physical or emotional wounds will be healed by Feb. 21.)\\n\\nSunday's win gave Neuvirth a 16-6-4 record this season, with a .914 save percentage and a 2.46 goals against average, good numbers, but not as good as Varlamov's; his .928 save percentage and 2.13 GAA both rank third in the NHL.\\n\\n\\"That's the great thing about having two young goalies who thrive on playing,\\" Boudreau said.\\n\\nThe first hint Neuvirth had that he might be starting was a text message Saturday night from goalies coach Arturs Irbe. He wasn't feeling well himself, but no matter. He found out about 9 Sunday morning that he'd be starting.\\n\\n\\"He's been battling,\\" Capitals forward Matt Hendricks said. \\"He's had a few injuries, he's been sick, but he's been working harder. He's been practicing hard, harder than I've seen him practice all season. He came to the rink, I don't know if he was prepared, I don't think he was scheduled to start, but I'm really happy for him. It's nice to see when hard work pays off. He got going against a great opponent in Pittsburgh.\\"\\n\\nNeuvirth didn't realize Sunday's game was going to be nationally televised, and he also couldn't have been aware of the Caps' stellar Super Bowl Sunday record - 8-0 at Verizon Center, 14-3-1 overall. After all, he's never even seen a Super Bowl.\\n\\n\\"This is going to be my first Super Bowl game ever,\\" Neuvirth said. \\"I'm excited to watch it with the boys. It's going to be fun.\\"\\n\\n\\"I might have to teach him a few things,\\" said Hendricks, laughing.\\n\\nThat shouldn't be hard. Neuvirth has already proved to be a quick study.\\n\\nWrite a one or two sentence summary.","response":"Goalie Michal Neuvirth helped the Capitals achieve a 3-0 victory against the Penguins, securing his second career shutout and settling a score with Penguins' coach Bylsma who previously criticized his skills. Neuvirth's performance contributed to the Capitals' back-to-back wins and showcased his determination and skill after nearly three weeks out of action."},{"question":"Write a sentence based on \\"chelsea s carvalho doubtful for barcelona trip\\"","response":"Step 1: Identify the main subject and action in the given information.\\nIn this case, the main subject is \\"Chelsea's Carvalho\\" and the action is \\"doubtful for Barcelona trip.\\"\\n\\nStep 2: Determine the context of the information.\\nThe context seems to be related to a sports team, as it involves a trip to Barcelona and mentions a player's name.\\n\\nStep 3: Clarify any abbreviations or colloquialisms.\\nIn this case, \\"Chelsea's Carvalho\\" appears to refer to a player named Carvalho who plays for the Chelsea football club.\\n\\nStep 4: Write a sentence that reflects the main subject, action, and context.\\nConsidering all of the information above, the sentence can be written as follows:\\n\\n\\"Chelsea football player Carvalho might not join the team in their upcoming trip to face Barcelona due to some uncertainty regarding his condition.\\"\\n\\nThis sentence presents the main subject (Carvalho), the action (being doubtful for the Barcelona trip), and the context (trip to Barcelona to face the Barcelona football team), all while maintaining clarity."},{"question":"Question: What does the Exchange specialize in?\\n\\nIs \\"There are four hundred securities listed on the stock exchange, of which almost three hundred are offshore funds and alternative investment structures attracted by Bermuda's regulatory environment.\\" the correct answer?\\nOptions:\\n -yes;\\n -no;","response":"No, the provided answer is not entirely correct as it only mentions the number of securities listed and does not fully describe what the Exchange specializes in.\\n\\nA more detailed answer is as follows:\\n\\nThe Exchange, commonly referring to a stock exchange, is a marketplace where securities such as stocks, bonds, and other financial instruments are bought, sold, and traded.

Magma rises from deep in the earth: This is the initial step, where the molten rock material from the Earth's mantle rises towards the surface.\\n\\n2. The magma goes into volcanos: Magma collects in magma chambers within the Earth's crust, which are connected to the volcanic vent systems.\\n\\n3. The volcanos pressure the magma upwards: The intense heat and pressure within the Earth cause the magma to rise through the volcanic vent.\\n\\n4. The pressure causes the magma to push through the surface of the volcano: As magma rises, the pressure eventually becomes too much, and the magma is forced out of the volcanic vent, erupting as lava.\\n\\n5. The lava cools: Once exposed to the air, the lava begins to cool and solidify as it flows away from the volcanic vent.\\n\\n6. The lava forms new rock: As the lava cools, it solidifies and forms new rocks (igneous rocks), which add to the Earth's crust.\\n\\n7. New magma is pressured to the surface of the volcano: The process starts again, with new magma rising from deep in the Earth and getting pressured towards the surface, resulting in a continuous cycle of volcanic activity.

Here's an elaboration to support this inference:\\n\\nAs mentioned, the plane took off from Dayton, Ohio, and was carrying a small quantity of hazardous chemicals. It is important to note that the presence of hazardous chemicals on board may pose an increased risk of accidents or contribute to the severity of potential incidents.\\n\\nThe information provided states that the plane crashed and exploded shortly after takeoff. This indicates that something went wrong during the early stages of the flight, such as mechanical failure, human error, weather-related issues, or potentially the hazardous chemicals themselves contributing to the incident—a possibility that cannot be ruled out without further information.\\n\\nGiven that the plane crashed and exploded, it is reasonable to infer that the plane \\"blew up\\" since the term refers to an object being destroyed by a sudden, violent release of energy, often accompanied by a loud noise, the release of gas, and/or the dispersal of debris. The explosion mentioned in the account corroborates this, as explosions typically involve such characteristics.\\n\\nIn summary, based on the limited details available, we can reasonably infer that the cargo plane bound for Montreal with hazardous chemicals on board did indeed blow up, or experience an explosion, after crashing shortly after takeoff from Dayton, Ohio. However, while this inference seems plausible given the circumstances, it is essential to acknowledge that several factors may have contributed to this tragic event, and more information would be necessary to gain a comprehensive understanding of the underlying causes and circumstances."},{"question":"Select the topic that this about:\\n\\nJERUSALEM - Israeli leaders warned Syria on Wednesday that it bears the blame for a double suicide bombing by Hamas militants because it harbors the group's leadership, and they hinted at possible retaliation.

He is best known as the lead singer, primary songwriter, guitarist, and sole permanent member of The Smashing Pumpkins. Formed by Corgan and guitarist James Iha in Chicago, Illinois, in 1988, the band quickly gained steam with the addition of bassist D'arcy Wretzky and drummer Jimmy Chamberlin. Strong album sales and large-scale tours propelled the band's increasing fame in the 1990s until their break-up in 2000.\\nContext: Following a brief stint touring with New Order in the summer , Corgan reunited with Chamberlin to form the band Zwan with Corgan's old friend Matt Sweeney in late 2001. According to Neil Strauss of New York Times, during his few live performances with the band, Corgan says \\"is still a work in progress.\\" The lineup was completed with guitarist David Pajo and bassist Paz Lenchantin. The band had two distinct incarnations, the primary approach being an upbeat rock band with a three-guitar-driven sound, the second, a folk and gospel inspired acoustic side with live strings. The quintet performed throughout 2002, and their debut album, Mary Star of the Sea, was released in early 2003 to generally positive reviews. In the midst of their supporting tour for the album, mounting conflict between Corgan and Chamberlin, and the other band members led to the cancellation of the rest of the tour as the band entered an apparent hiatus, formally announcing a breakup in September 2003.  In 2004 Corgan began writing revealing autobiographical posts on his website and his MySpace page, blaming Iha for the breakup of the Smashing Pumpkins, calling Wretzky \\"a mean spirited drug addict,\\" and criticizing his former Zwan bandmates' fixation with \\"indie cred\\" and calling them \\"filthy\\", opportunistic, and selfish.  On September 17, 2003, Billy first presented his poetry at the Art Institute of Chicago's Rubloff Auditorium. In late 2004, Corgan published Blinking with Fists, a book of poetry. Despite mixed reviews, the book debuted on the New York Times Best Seller list. Around this time, he began posting autobiographical writings online under the title The Confessions of Billy Corgan.  Also in 2004, he began a solo music career, landing on an electronic/shoegaze/alternative rock sound for his first solo album, TheFutureEmbrace, co-produced and arranged by Bon Harris of Nitzer Ebb. Released on June 21, 2005, through Reprise Records, it garnered mixed reviews from the press and only sold 69,000 copies. Corgan toured behind his solo album with a touring band that included Linda Strawberry, Brian Liesegang and Matt Walker in 2005. This tour was not as extensive as previous Smashing Pumpkins or Zwan tours. Prior to recording TheFutureEmbrace, Corgan had recorded some 72 songs inspired by Chicago history for the largely acoustic ChicagoSongs project, which have yet to be released.\\nQuestion: was the band popular?. Whats the answer?","response":"Yes, the band was popular. The Smashing Pumpkins became famous in the 1990s because they sold many albums and went on big tours.

Still, there is usually a rough estimate available based on yearly sales and overall market presence.\\n\\n2. What are the top ten cars for tall people (6.3) in India?\\n\\nThis question is focused on finding suitable cars for tall people—specifically individuals who are 6 feet 3 inches in height—available in the Indian market.

Skoda Octavia\\n\\nKeep in mind that the list is not exhaustive and is subject to change as new models emerge in the Indian market. Furthermore, individual preferences may vary, so it's always recommended to test-drive vehicles before making a purchase decision.\\n\\nIn summary, the two questions have distinct meanings, with the first involving the number of Rolls Royce owners in India, and the second seeking suitable car models for tall individuals in the Indian market."},{"question":"Math Problem\\nSolve 0 = 18*x - 0 - 17 - 1 for x.","response":"To solve the equation 0 = 18*x - 0 - 17 - 1 for x, follow these step-by-step instructions:\\n\\nStep 1: Simplify the equation by removing unnecessary terms and combining like terms.\\nIn this case, -0 can be removed, and -17 and -1 can be combined.

To them I have only this to say: Stop please! A recent article in theWall Street Journalblamed Facebook's ability to ruin friendships, saying that it limits communication to typing and encourages people to spend far too much time with friends they have never met. Having used Facebook since its first year, I find these arguments false. The simple truth is that the problems are only a symptom of Facebook abuse. Like many things, it is only as harmful to your life and relationships as you allow it to be. Consider arguments against watching too much TV and overeating. Try using Facebook to find friends who may have long ago changed their e-mail addresses and phone numbers, to find out what your old college friends are up to, to congratulate your friends on their latest birthdays, to share pictures and articles you find interesting, and to join in the discussion about them with your friends.

After trading interceptions, with Corey Webster picking Matt Hasselbeck and Ken Hamlin intercepting Manning, the Seahawks jumped out to a quick 7-0 lead on a 2-yard touchdown run by Shaun Alexander. After forcing a punt, Hasselbeck tossed a 12-yard touchdown to Nate Burleson. Manning would be intercepted again by Hamlin on the ensuing drive, leading to a 4-yard touchdown pass from Hasselbeck to Darrell Jackson, and in eleven minutes, Seattle had a 21-0 lead. Manning had the ball on his own 43 with 10:43 left in the half when he threw his third pick of the game, this time to Michael Boulware. The Seahawks converted, going on a 12-play, 63-yard drive, capped off by a ten-yard touchdown pass from Hasselbeck to Will Heller. The game got worse for the Giants, as Plaxico Burress fumbled following a reception, with Leroy Hill recovering for Seattle. Hasselbeck then threw his fourth touchdown pass of the first half, this one going 21 yards to Bobby Engram. The Giants finally got on the board with a 46-yard field goal by Jay Feely as time expired. Seattle pushed the lead to 42-3 in the third quarter with a 17-play, 70-yard drive that ate up 9:58, capped by a 12-yard touchdown pass from Hasselbeck to Jackson. The Giants' offense, dormant all game, finally sprang to life in the fourth quarter. Manning found Amani Toomer on a 13-yard touchdown strike. After Fred Robbins intercepted Hasselbeck, Manning wasted no time finding Tim Carter on a 25-yard touchdown pass. When R.W. McQuarters intercepted Hasselbeck for a 27-yard touchdown return, the once-enormous Seattle lead was suddenly cut to 42-24, with 9:30 to play. The Giants would inch even closer after forcing a punt, and Manning found David Tyree on a 9-yard touchdown pass, cutting the lead down to 42-30.

It is about the ability to communicate smoothly and effortlessly without any struggles or breaks in conversation. Many non-native English speakers aim for this kind of fluency to be able to interact, study, or work in English-speaking environments comfortably.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the question \\"How can I be a native English speaker?\\" refers quite literally to someone who has grown up speaking English, typically learning it from their parents and community from a young age. It's important to note that native level proficiency in a language is not just about grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation but also understanding the nuances, idioms, metaphors, cultural practices, and contextual cues of the language. \\n\\nHere are some steps to help you speak English fluently:\\n\\n1. **Regular Practice**: Practicing regularly is the key to mastering any language. The more you practice, the more fluent you'll become. This practice could involve speaking English with friends or colleagues, attending language classes, and incorporating it into your daily life.\\n\\n2. **Expand Vocabulary**: Vocabulary is the building block of a language. The more words you know, the more articulate and fluent you can be. Consider having a dedicated vocabulary learning routine, which might involve flashcards, vocabulary apps, and reading in English.\\n\\n3. **Improve Pronunciation**: Understand the correct pronunciation of words. This will not only increase your confidence but also improve your comprehension skills. Listening to English songs, podcasts, and watching movies or series can be helpful.\\n\\n4. **Reading and Listening Skills**: Reading English newspapers, magazines, books, or online articles can help you gain a better understanding of sentence structures and grammar usage. Similarly, listening to English podcasts, news, and songs can improve your listening abilities and pronunciation.\\n\\n5. **Grammar**: While speaking fluently involves more than just proper grammar, good grammar is still a cornerstone of effective communication. Study grammar and use resources to understand how sentences are correctly constructed in English.\\n\\n6. **Conversation Practice**: Try to find a conversation partner with whom to practice. This can be a local meet-up group, a language exchange partner online, or even a paid tutor. The key is to practice speaking in real conversation scenarios.\\n\\n7. **Think in English**: This might sound hard, but it's doable with practice. When you start thinking in English, you'll stop translating between your native language and English which will make your spoken English more fluent.\\n\\nHowever, becoming a native English speaker as a foreigner is technically impossible because native speakers are persons who learned the language as their first language in childhood. Yet, you could aim for the proficiency level of a native English speaker by embracing the culture, idioms, phrases, slang, pronunciation peculiar to native English speakers.\\n\\nIt's important to remember that everyone learns at a different pace and in different ways, so it might take some experimenting to find the best route for you. And while perfect fluency might seem like the ultimate goal, it's also important to enjoy the learning process itself."},{"question":"Write the next sentence in the following story.\\n\\nThree women are dancing in a room.

Sigourney Weaver and Rick Moranis co-star as a client and her neighbor, and Ernie Hudson as the Ghostbusters' first recruit.  - Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction.  - Annie Hall is a 1977 American romantic comedy film directed by Woody Allen from a screenplay he co-wrote with Marshall Brickman. Produced by Allen's manager, Charles H. Joffe, the film stars the director as Alvy \\"Max\\" Singer, who tries to figure out the reasons for the failure of his relationship with the film's eponymous female lead, played by Diane Keaton in a role written specifically for her.  - A legend is a narrative of human actions that are perceived both by teller and listeners to take place within human history and demonstrating human values, and which possesses certain qualities that give the tale verisimilitude. Legend, for its active and passive participants, includes no happenings that are outside the realm of \\"possibility\\", but may include miracles. Legends may be transformed over time, in order to keep them fresh and vital, and realistic. Many legends operate within the realm of uncertainty, never being entirely believed by the participants, but also never being resolutely doubted.  - The Brothers Grimm (' or '), Jacob (17851863) and Wilhelm Grimm (17861859), were German academics, philologists, cultural researchers, lexicographers and authors who together specialized in collecting and publishing folklore during the 19th century. They were among the best-known storytellers of folk tales, and popularized stories such as \\"Cinderella\\" (\\"\\"), \\"The Frog Prince\\" (\\"\\"), \\"The Goose-Girl\\" (\\"Die Gänsemagd\\"), \\"Hansel and Gretel\\" (\\"\\"), \\"Rapunzel\\", \\"Rumpelstiltskin\\" (\\"\\"),\\"Sleeping Beauty\\" (\\"\\"), and \\"Snow White\\" (\\"\\"). Their first collection of folk tales, \\"Children's and Household Tales\\" (\\"), was published in 1812.  - Snow White : A Tale of Terror is a 1997 American fantasy and horror television film based on the fairy tale \`\` Snow White '' . Also known as Snow White in the Black Forest and The Grimm Brothers ' Snow White , it was directed by Michael Cohn and stars Sigourney Weaver , Sam Neill and Monica Keena . The original music score was composed by John Ottman . The film was marketed with the tagline \`\` The fairy tale is over '' .  - The unicorn is a legendary creature that has been described since antiquity as a beast with a large, pointed, spiraling horn projecting from its forehead. The unicorn was depicted in ancient seals of the Indus Valley Civilization and was mentioned by the ancient Greeks in accounts of natural history by various writers, including Ctesias, Strabo, Pliny the Younger, and Aelian. The Bible also describes an animal, the re'em, which some versions translate as \\"unicorn\\".  - Northern Ireland (; Ulster Scots: \\"\\") is a top-level constituent unit of the United Kingdom in the northeast of Ireland. It is variously described as a country, province, region, or \\"part\\" of the United Kingdom, amongst other terms. Northern Ireland shares a border to the south and west with the Republic of Ireland. In 2011, its population was 1,810,863, constituting about 30% of the island's total population and about 3% of the UK's population. Established by the Northern Ireland Act 1998 as part of the Good Friday Agreement, the Northern Ireland Assembly holds responsibility for a range of devolved policy matters, while other areas are reserved for the British government. Northern Ireland co-operates with the Republic of Ireland in some areas, and the Agreement granted the Republic the ability to \\"put forward views and proposals\\" with \\"determined efforts to resolve disagreements between the two governments\\".  - A troll is a class of being in Norse mythology and Scandinavian folklore. In Old Norse sources, beings described as trolls dwell in isolated rocks, mountains, or caves, live together in small family units, and are rarely helpful to human beings.  - Fable is a literary genre: a succinct fictional story, in prose or verse, that features animals, legendary creatures, plants, inanimate objects, or forces of nature that are anthropomorphized (given human qualities, such as the ability to speak human language) and that illustrates or leads to a particular moral lesson (a \\"moral\\"), which may at the end be added explicitly as a pithy maxim.  - Ghostbusters II is a 1989 American supernatural comedy film directed and produced by Ivan Reitman, written by Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis and starring Bill Murray, Aykroyd, Sigourney Weaver, Ramis, Ernie Hudson and Rick Moranis. It is the sequel to the 1984 film \\"Ghostbusters\\", and follows the further adventures of the three parapsychologists and their organization which combats paranormal activities.  - \\"Snow White\\" is a nineteenth-century German fairy tale which is today known widely across the Western world. The Brothers Grimm published it in 1812 in the first edition of their collection \\"Grimms' Fairy Tales\\". It was titled in German: Sneewittchen (in modern orthography \\"Schneewittchen\\") and numbered as Tale 53. The name \\"Sneewittchen\\" was Low German and in the first version it was translated with \\"Schneeweißchen\\". The Grimms completed their final revision of the story in 1854.  - Ellen Louise Ripley is a fictional character and the protagonist of the \\"Alien\\" film series played by American actress Sigourney Weaver. The character earned Weaver world recognition, and the role remains her most famous to date. Sir Ridley Scott, director of the first film in the series, made the decision to switch Ripley from the standard male action hero to a heroine.  - Reilly, Ace of Spies is a 1983 television miniseries dramatizing the life of Sidney Reilly, a Russian Jew who became one of the greatest spies ever to work for the British. Among his exploits, in the early 20th century, were the infiltration of the German General Staff in 1917 and a near-overthrow of the Bolsheviks in 1918. His reputation with women was as legendary as his genius for espionage.  - A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects.  - Jurassic Park III is a 2001 American science-fiction adventure film and the third installment in the \\"Jurassic Park\\" film series. The film stars Sam Neill, William H. Macy, Téa Leoni, Alessandro Nivola, Trevor Morgan, and Michael Jeter. It is the first film in the series not to have been directed by Steven Spielberg, nor based on a book by Michael Crichton (though numerous scenes in the film were ultimately taken from Crichton's novels \\"Jurassic Park\\" and \\"The Lost World\\"). The film takes place on Isla Sorna, off Central America's Pacific coast, the island featured in the , where a divorced couple has tricked Dr. Alan Grant into going in order to help them find their son.  - A goblin is a monstrous creature from European folklore, first attested in stories from the Middle Ages. They are ascribed various and conflicting abilities, temperaments and appearances depending on the story and country of origin. They are almost always small and grotesque, mischievous or outright evil, and greedy, especially for gold and jewelry. They often have magical abilities similar to a fairy or demon. Similar creatures include brownies, dwarves, gnomes, imps, and kobolds.  - A gnome is a diminutive spirit in Renaissance magic and alchemy, first introduced by Paracelsus in the 16th century and later adopted by more recent authors including those of modern fantasy literature. Its characteristics have been reinterpreted to suit the needs of various story tellers, but it is typically said to be a small humanoid that lives underground.  - A movie theater or movie theatre (also called a cinema) is a venue, usually a building, that contains an auditorium for viewing films (also called movies or motion pictures), for entertainment. Most, but not all, movie theaters are commercial operations catering to the general public, who attend by purchasing a ticket. Some movie theaters, however, are operated by non-profit organizations or societies which charge members a membership fee to view films.  - Children's literature or juvenile literature includes stories, books, magazines, and poems that are enjoyed by children. Modern children's literature is classified in two different ways: genre or the intended age of the reader.  - The Tudors is a historical fiction television series set primarily in sixteenth-century England, created by Michael Hirst and produced for the American premium cable television channel Showtime. The series was a collaboration between American, British, and Canadian producers, and filmed mostly in Ireland. Although named after the Tudor dynasty as a whole, it is based specifically upon the reign of King Henry VIII of England.  - Television or TV is a telecommunication medium used for transmitting moving images in monochrome (black-and-white), or in color, and in two or three dimensions and sound. It can refer to a television set, a television program (\\"TV show\\"), or the medium of television transmission. Television is a mass medium, for entertainment, education, news, and advertising.  - A television network is a telecommunications network for distribution of television program content, whereby a central operation provides programming to many television stations or pay television providers. Until the mid-1980s, television programming in most countries of the world was dominated by a small number of broadcast networks. Many early television networks (such as the BBC, NBC or CBC) evolved from earlier radio networks.  - A fairy tale is a type of short story that typically features folkloric fantasy characters, such as dwarves, elves, fairies, giants, gnomes, goblins, mermaids, trolls, unicorns, or witches, and usually magic or enchantments. Fairy tales may be distinguished from other folk narratives such as legends (which generally involve belief in the veracity of the events described) and explicitly moral tales, including beast fables. The term is mainly used for stories with origins in European tradition and, at least in recent centuries, mostly relates to children's literature.  - Nigel John Dermot \\"Sam\\" Neill (born 14 September 1947), known professionally as Sam Neill, is a Northern Ireland born New Zealand actor who first achieved leading roles in films such as \\"\\" and \\"Dead Calm\\" and on television in \\"Reilly, Ace of Spies\\". He won a broad international audience in 1993 for his roles as Alisdair Stewart in \\"The Piano\\" and Dr. Alan Grant in \\"Jurassic Park\\", a role he reprised in 2001's \\"Jurassic Park III\\". Neill also had notable roles in \\"Merlin\\", \\"The Hunt for Red October\\" and \\"The Tudors\\". In 2016, he starred in \\"Hunt for the Wilderpeople\\" alongside Julian Dennison, to great acclaim. He holds New Zealand and British nationality, but identifies primarily as a New Zealander.  - Susan Alexandra \\"Sigourney\\" Weaver (born October 8, 1949) is an American actress and film producer. Following her film debut as a minor character in \\"Annie Hall\\" (1977), she quickly came to prominence in 1979 with her first lead role as Ellen Ripley in \\"Alien\\". She reprised the role in three sequels: \\"Aliens\\" (1986), for which she was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress; \\"Alien 3\\" (1992), and \\"\\" (1997). She is also known for her starring roles in the box-office hits \\"Ghostbusters\\" (1984), \\"Ghostbusters II\\" (1989), and \\"Avatar\\" (2009).  - A television film (also known as a TV film; television movie; TV movie; telefilm; telemovie; made-for-television film; direct-to-TV film; movie of the week (MOTW or MOW); feature-length drama; single drama and original movie) is a feature-length motion picture that is produced for, and originally distributed by or to, a television network, in contrast to theatrical films, which are made explicitly for initial showing in movie theaters.  - Alien 3 (stylized as ALIEN) is a 1992 American science-fiction horror film directed by David Fincher in his directorial debut, produced by Gordon Carroll, David Giler and Walter Hill, and written by Giler, Hill and Larry Ferguson from a story by Vincent Ward. It serves as the third film installment of the \\"Alien\\" franchise, and takes place after the events of \\"Aliens\\" (1986).

Big mistake: “This has been very costly for us,” says H. Carl McCall, chairman of SUNY’s board of trustees and a master of understatement — for “costly” scarcely describes it.\\n\\nLICH has burned through more than $100 million of SUNY funds since last summer alone. SUNY has been trying to peddle it almost from Day One — attracting real-estate developers in profusion, but nobody interested in running a traditional community-based hospital.\\n\\nWhich isn’t surprising, since tradition doesn’t count for much when it comes to hospital finance. The system has too many empty beds, far too much staff for the patient load and not enough money — and this is not news.\\n\\nMeanwhile, nothing attracts the usual suspects more quickly — or thickly — than a real-estate developer. This explains how then-long-shot mayoral candidate de Blasio came to be arrested in front of LICH last July, “protesting” its impending closure.\\n\\nThe hospital was de Blasio’s red line. The handcuffs solidified hard-left union support, raised his profile substantially and arguably set him on a path to the mayoralty.\\n\\nThis did not, however, solve the hospital’s problems — nor SUNY’s, which was losing some $13 million a month when de Blasio took office.\\n\\nSo what’s a new mayor to do?\\n\\nDeclare victory and move on? Not The Blaz. Not last Friday, during one of his most contentious press briefings yet.\\n\\nMcCall, SUNY Chancellor Nancy Zimpher and Gov. Cuomo had colluded (in the best sense of the word) to give de Blasio the deal everybody could have had last summer: Sale of the LICH to a developer to be named later, some subsidized housing, an on-site health-care facility of some sort — and, it seems, a little baksheesh for the boys and girls.\\n\\nThat is, while there’s no hospital hard-wired into the agreement, Public Advocate Letitia James and some “community groups” stand to collect several million dollars from the sale of the LICH site to fund a “health-care-related” not-for-profit.\\n\\nEven that could vanish, if the deal falls through. It could evaporate in as little as three weeks (“It’s not a settlement that is going to guarantee anything,” said one lawyer working to keep the hospital open), but it still frees SUNY of LICH by the end of May.\\n\\nSo maybe de Blasio should’ve just said thank you and left it at that. Nope: He had to gild the lily.\\n\\nThe deal marked a “truly historic, transcendent moment,” he said Friday — touting it as a template for saving other money-pit acute-care facilities, including Interfaith Hospital in Brooklyn and St. John’s in Far Rockaway.\\n\\nThe harsh truth is that if the LICH deal has any staying power, it will be solely because of the real-estate money — at least $250 million, and maybe as much as $300 million, for the site in tony Cobble Hill.\\n\\nGood luck matching that, Interfaith.\\n\\nIndeed, good luck matching that, City Hall.\\n\\nFor, even as Advocate James and others spent Monday celebrating the LICH deal as a template for Interfaith (again, it’s not), the head of the city’s Health & Hospitals Corp. was all but declaring bankruptcy before the City Council.\\n\\nHHC President Alan Aviles, citing federal and state operating-aid cuts and “astronomical increases” in employee fringe-benefit costs, predicted an HHC operating deficit of some $1.4 billion a year by 2018. That’s a big hole in Mayor de Blasio’s budget.\\n\\nHHC owns and operates 11 hospitals; it treated 1.4 million patients last year, 500,000 of whom had no health insurance. The city’s privately owned facilities don’t face as large an uninsured problem, but enough of one to threaten many a bottom line.\\n\\nAnd that’s not all that HHC and the privates have in common:\\n\\nl Both have far too many empty beds — and thus far too much staff being paid to “serve” patients who aren’t there, and so aren’t bringing in dollars to cover those salaries.\\n\\nl Neither has any reasonable hope of state or federal bailouts. (That $8 billion Medicaid “waiver” bonus that both de Blasio and Cuomo are touting doesn’t amount to much in the context of New York’s $56 billion-a-year Medicaid budget.)\\n\\nl And neither has much in the way of real estate to sell.\\n\\nThe sooner some hospitals close, the faster their paying customers will move to the others — leaving them better able to survive. The longer the walking dead like LICH linger, the worse off everyone is.\\n\\nBut lacking is any evidence of the political will that is going to be necessary to move the mayor past a crisis he didn’t create, but which he continues to exacerbate — and the bill for which is going to land on his desk.\\n\\nYes, the handcuffs arguably got him to where he is today. Now he needs to get out of them, and that’s not going to be easy.\\nWhat are the most important parts of this news article?","response":"The most important parts of this news article are:\\n\\n1. Mayor Bill de Blasio's involvement in the Long Island College Hospital (LICH) crisis and its impact on his political career.\\n2.

Genetic engineers Clive Nicoli and Elsa Kast hope to achieve fame by splicing animal DNA to create hybrids for medical use at the company N.E.R.D. (Nucleic Exchange Research and Development). Their work previously yielded Fred, a dog-sized vermiform creature intended as a mate for their female specimen, Ginger. After successfully mating them, Clive and Elsa plan to create a human-animal hybrid that could revolutionize science. Their employers Joan Chorot of N.E.R.D. and William Barlow forbid them from doing this. Instead, they are to find and extract proteins used for commercial drug production from Fred and Ginger. Clive and Elsa, however, disobey their superiors and pursue their own agenda in secret, developing a viable prepubescent female creature. Although they had planned to terminate the hybrid before it reached full term, Elsa persuades Clive to let it live. They discover that she is aging at a vastly accelerated rate. Elsa discovers that the creature is undergoing mental development such as that of a young human child. Elsa names the creature \\"Dren\\" after the creature spells out NERD, having seen the letters on Elsa's shirt.

Marie-louise Olson. PUBLISHED:. 20:17 EST, 1 December 2013. |. UPDATED:. 21:12 EST, 1 December 2013. In an observatory deep in an inhospitable area of the South Pole, a group of American scientists have been holed up for the last two years, waiting with baited breath for a little sign - something to show that they were not going loopy looking for a tiny little particle that no one has ever seen. That day has finally come and the researchers have announced they have reached a new frontier in studies of the universe - a discovery they are calling a ‘new age of astronomy’. The US-led $270m IceCube facility based on a cubic kilometre of Antarctic ice has detected very high-energy cosmic neutrinos - subatomic particles that reach Earth from deep space, possibly the remnants from exploding stars, called supernovae. Ordinary telescopes cannot see the elusive neutrinos, but IceCube's can. It is the largest neutrino telescope in the world. A new frontier: The IceCube detector, the world's largest neutrino observatory, has observed the first solid evidence for high-energy neutrinos that originate outside of our own solar system. Elusive: View of the subatomic neutrino tracks showing electrons and muons caught in a nano second. Ordinary telescopes cannot see the neutrinos. Unlike photons, aka light particles, they hardly ever interact with ordinary matter, because they carry no electric charge and very little mass. This makes them extremely hard to detect. The IceCube facility, however, can see neutrinos, which stream across the universe in unimaginable quantities, according to FT. What makes neutrinos so important to astronomers’ probes is that they travel in absolutely straight lines from their source without being deflected by magnetic fields or absorbed by matter. They escape more readily than photons from the core of a supernova, for example, or other such phenomena in the universe. Supernova: Neutrinos escape more readily than photons from the core of a supernova, such as the Tycho supernova, which exploded 400 years ago. Spectacular: A star in the constellation Taurus a thousand years ago is spewing out a blizzard of extremely high-energy particles, some of which could be the neutrinos that were discovered at the IceCube observatory. Neutrinos have already been detected in various forms. The first was 'seen' in 1956. However, scientists had not yet detected the pure form of neutrinos that are at least one million times more energetic than those already detected. These are the ones produced from turbulent gaseous environments left over by supernova explosions, also known as the supernova remnants. The IceCube was built in the South Pole to maximise the chance of observing these elusive cosmic neutrinos. Remnants: The neutrinos that were found are the ones produced from turbulent gaseous environments left over by supernova explosions, also known as the supernova remnants. The IceCube was built in the South Pole to maximise the chance of observing these elusive cosmic neutrinos. Rearchers melted holes in the ice cap and lowered 5,160 light detectors to depths of between 1,500m and 2,000m beneath the surface. Neutrino detectors are often built underground in order to isolate the detector from cosmic rays and other background radiation. Although trillions of neutrinos travel unscathed through the observatory every second, a precious few arrive at exactly the right angle to hit an atom in the ice. This collision generates electrically charged particles which radiate light that is picked up by the detectors. Underground: The IceCube crew melted holes in the ice cap and lowered 5,160 light detectors to depths of between 1,500m and 2,000m beneath the surface. Isolate: Neutrino detectors are often built underground in order to isolate the detector from cosmic rays and other background radiation. Computers then calculate the energy and incoming direction of the neutrino from the pattern and intensity of the light emitted. The IceCube team last week said in the journal Science they had detected 28 high-energy neutrinos coming from beyond the solar system over two years. Lower-energy neutrinos reach us in vast numbers from the sun and also from the interaction between cosmic rays and Earth’s upper atmosphere. These 28 neutrinos are too small a sample to derive any conclusions about what produced them, but whatever it is must generate staggeringly high energies. Reaction: Just a handful of the trillions of neutrinos that travel through the observatory every second arrive at exactly the right angle to hit an atom in the ice. Lower-energy neutrinos reach the Earth in vast numbers from the sun and also from the interaction between cosmic rays and the upper atmosphere, but high-energy particles are from further away. 'Gratifying': Prof. Francis Halzen, principal investigator of IceCube says the discovery is what they have been looking for. 'This is the dawn of a new age of astronomy,' he said. Two of the detected neutrinos had more energy than a fly in flight, packed into a single subatomic particle. Likely sources include supernovae and material being sucked into huge black holes. ‘It is gratifying to finally see what we have been looking for,’ says Francis Halzen of the University of Wisconsin and IceCube principal investigator. ‘This is the dawn of a new age of astronomy.’ The IceCube project is part of the University of Wisconsin–Madison projects developed and supervised by the same institution, while collaboration and funding is provided by numerous other universities and research institutions worldwide. Neutrinos were first detected in 1956 by Clyde Cowan, Frederick Reines, F. B. Harrison, H. W. Kruse, and A. D. McGuire, who published confirmation that they had detected the neutrino in Science, a. result that was rewarded almost forty years later with the 1995 Nobel. Prize. The detection of solar neutrinos, and of neutrinos of the SN 1987A supernova in 1987 marked the beginning of neutrino astronomy. The normal energy of supernova neutrinos ranges from a few to several tens of MeV. However, the sites where cosmic rays are accelerated are expected to produce neutrinos that are at least one million times more energetic, produced from turbulent gaseous environments left over by supernova explosions: the supernova remnants. This is the type of neutrino that scientists believe has been detected now for the first time. Neutrinos travel in absolutely straight lines from their source without being deflected by magnetic fields or absorbed by matter. This means they show exactly what is out there in its purest form.","response":"So, some scientists at the South Pole have made a big discovery using a special machine called the IceCube. They found some tiny little things called high-energy cosmic neutrinos. These neutrinos are very, very small and they come from outer space, probably from stars that have exploded. The neat thing about neutrinos is that they can travel very, very far without being stopped by anything. This makes them super useful for learning about space! Even though they found only a few of these neutrinos, this is just the beginning of a new way of studying the universe!"},{"question":"Paragraph: (CNN) -- Guatemala's government has declared a state of siege and sent hundreds of troops to a northern province where officials say a Mexican drug gang is overtaking towns and threatening residents. President Alvaro Colom announced the 30-day emergency rule in Alta Verapaz on Sunday. The rule allows the military to order anyone suspected of conspiring against the government to be arrested and imprisoned without a warrant, the state-run AGN news agency said. \\"Starting today, combined forces will retake the streets of Alta Verapaz,\\" a government statement released Sunday morning said. Government data shows cells of the drug gang known as Los Zetas are in the area to protect drug trafficking paths between Honduras and Mexico, \\"intimidating the population with their heavy weapons and threatening farmers to give up their land for criminal activities,\\" AGN reported. The state of siege also allows the government to place greater restrictions on public gatherings, travel visas and gun licenses, among other things, according to AGN. \\"The population should be calm. What we are doing is not intended to persecute honest, working people,\\" Interior Minister Carlos Menocal told reporters. Menocal said operations in the coming days would aim to boost regional security, regain control of territory, identify criminal gangs and capture their members. In an interview with CNN en Espanol last month, Menocal said his country needed more help from the United States to combat cartels, which were increasingly carving out new drug transport paths. \\"In the end, the large majority of drugs travel through Central America, and the assignment of resources or the financial support of the United States government is not the same as Colombia and Mexico receive,\\" he said.

The railroad needed a way station, and Las Vegas was the place. Growth continued for ten years, and by 1915 the town had telephones, round-the-clock electricity, and a growing population — many of whom worked in the railroad repair shop. But such heady progress would soon come to a halt. The growing competition in rail transport resulted in Union Pacific buying the Los Angeles–Salt Lake line. Union Pacific then consolidated its operations, eliminating the Las Vegas repair facility. Additionally, Las Vegas had been made a part of Nevada's new Clark County in 1909, a year when the legislature also outlawed gambling. These unfortunate circumstances threatened to relegate Las Vegas to the status of a small desert community that could no longer support its 3000 residents. But the southwest's growing need for water, combined with Las Vegas's fortuitous proximity to the Colorado River, would give Las Vegas a second chance to achieve prosperity. Construction on Hoover Dam (originally Boulder Dam, subsequently renamed for the president who authorized the project) began in 1931 in a canyon 45 miles (72 km) southeast of Las Vegas. Providing an influx of $165 million to the southwestern economy, Hoover Dam played a major role in preventing Las Vegas from drying up, both financially and literally. Not only did it create jobs, but it also created Lake Mead, the massive reservoir that today provides water to all of southern Nevada. More Government Help: The construction of Hoover Dam did not single-handedly save Las Vegas, however. The state legislature helped as well, by legalizing gambling in 1931 and thus solidifying the future of the town, though legislators and residents could never have known this at the time. The hordes of people who attended Hoover Dam's 1935 dedication set the city's now-formidable public relations machine into action. They went to work on what has become one of the lengthiest citywide tourism campaigns ever attempted. It didn't take long for the city to establish itself as a wild-West town with an \\"anything goes\\" attitude. Vices outlawed or heavily controlled elsewhere were legal here, available any hour of any day (or night). \\n\\nQuestion: \\"What was the answer to the southwest's need for water?\\"\\n\\nResponse: \\"Constructing the Hoover Dam\\"\\n\\nBased on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct?","response":"Yes, the response to the question is factually correct.

Osmosis is driven by the imbalance in water concentration. For example, water is more concentrated in your body than in Epsom salt. When you soak a swollen ankle in Epsom salt, the water moves out of your body into the lower-concentration region in the salt. Similarly, dialysis is the transport of any other molecule through a semipermeable membrane due to its concentration difference. Both osmosis and dialysis are used by the kidneys to cleanse the blood. Osmosis can create a substantial pressure. Consider what happens if osmosis continues for some time, as illustrated in Figure 12.23. Water moves by osmosis from the left into the region on the right, where it is less concentrated, causing the solution on the right to rise.

If it turns out that the bombs in Brussels were made from TATP, it would tend to link the attacks directly to those in Paris.\\n\\nTATP-based bombs are built using the common household ingredient hydrogen peroxide, which is used to bleach hair. Such bombs have been a signature of jihadist terrorists in the West for more than a decade because the materials are so easy to acquire, unlike military-grade explosives, which are tightly controlled in much of the West.\\n\\nTheir use in the Paris attacks, as well as in terrorist plots in London and in the United States over the past decade, should remind law enforcement in the West that these TATP bombs are what jihadist terrorists will continue to deploy.\\n\\nWhat is tricky for those hoping to utilize such weapons is that TATP bombs are quite difficult to make because their ingredients, when combined, are highly unstable and can explode easily if mishandled. To make an effective TATP bomb requires real training, which suggests a relatively skilled bomb-maker was involved in the Paris plot, since the terrorists detonated several bombs.\\n\\nThe dangers of TATP bombs can be seen in the case of Matthew Rugo and Curtis Jetton, 21-year-old roommates in Texas City, Texas. They didn't have any bomb-making training and were manufacturing explosives in 2006 from concentrated bleach when their concoction blew up, killing Rugo and injuring Jetton. The pair had no political motives: They had just wanted to blow up a vehicle for fun.\\n\\nOthers in the United States have built TATP bombs with far more malevolent intent. Najibullah Zazi, who grew up in New York, wanted to blow up as many commuters as possible on the subway system in Manhattan.\\n\\nAl Qaeda trained Zazi to make a TATP bomb in Pakistan, and during the summer of 2009, he made bulk purchases of hair bleach in suburban Denver and set up his bomb factory in a nearby motel room.\\n\\nHe mixed and cooked batches of hair bleach in the kitchenette of the motel. On the night of September 6, 2009, as he labored over the stove, Zazi sent several emails to an al Qaeda operative \\"Ahmad.\\" The emails contained a well-known al Qaeda code for a terrorist operation being imminent -- \\"the marriage is ready\\" -- and also asked for specific instructions \\"right away, please\\" about the other ingredients needed for the explosive.\\n\\nZazi had mastered the manufacture of the hair bleach-based bombs, but he had forgotten the precise proportions of those ingredients needed to ignite the mixture.\\n\\nIf Zazi had sent these emails to an ordinary email account in Pakistan, anyone monitoring it would have assumed the query was about making a wedding cake. But the email address Zazi used to touch base with \\"Ahmad\\" was sana_pakhtana@yahoo.com, an account that British intelligence was monitoring because someone using it had also been in touch with al Qaeda recruits in the United Kingdom.\\n\\nBritish authorities tipped off American officials that the email account belonged to an al Qaeda operative in Pakistan, and the U.S. National Security Agency began monitoring it.\\n\\nOnce the FBI realized there was an al Qaeda recruit living in Denver making TATP bombs, it intensively monitored Zazi. He traveled from Denver to New York to carry out his plan around the eighth anniversary of 9/11 and was soon arrested, as were two of his co-conspirators, all of whom were given long prison sentences.\\n\\nMore successful for al Qaeda was the cell of British suicide bombers who carried out the \\"7/7\\" London bombings. They used their training to heat up and distill ordinary hair bleach, combining it with other ingredients to make effective bombs. Making these bleach-based bombs was a complex process, not something that could be picked up by reading bomb-making recipes on the Internet. The ringleader had received bomb-making training from al Qaeda in Pakistan.\\n\\nIn an apartment the London plotters had rented to serve as their bomb factory, they mixed the chemicals. As they brewed up batches, they wore disposable masks because of the high toxicity of the materials, which bleached their dark hair a noticeably lighter color. They installed a commercial-grade refrigerator in the apartment to keep the highly unstable bomb ingredients cold. They built four devices.\\n\\nHydrogen peroxide-based bombs would again be the signature of a cell of British Pakistanis who plotted to bring down seven passenger jets flying to the United States and Canada from the United Kingdom during the summer of 2006. The plotters were intent on committing suicide during the attacks on the passenger jets. Six of them made \\"martyrdom\\" videotapes recovered by British investigators.\\n\\nBritish authorities were tracking the ringleader intensively in the summer of 2006. When he was arrested in east London in August 2006, he was carrying a memory stick storing flight plans for United Airlines, American Airlines and Air Canada jets flying from the United Kingdom to destinations such as Chicago, Washington, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Montreal and Toronto.\\n\\nInvestigators later found several large bottles containing concentrated hydrogen peroxide that one of the conspirators had dumped in a London park. The plotters were planning to bring the liquid explosives disguised as soft drinks in hand luggage onto the flights they had targeted, together with other innocuous-looking items that could act as triggers. They had planned to assemble their bombs on the planes.\\n\\nIt was this plot that triggered airlines to ban almost all liquids being taken on flights.\\n\\nAs investigators try to piece together what happened in Brussels, they will surely be looking for where the bombs were assembled. They will also be trying to determine who built the bombs. Were they built by the terrorists themselves, as was the case with the London plotters, or did someone else build them? And where did the training to build the bombs happen? Was it in France, Belgium or in Syria, or in some other location? These are some of the questions that, hopefully, the investigation will eventually unearth.\\n\\nAfter 9/11, the New York Police Department initiated Operation Nexus, in which officers visited thousands of stores in the city and the wider Northeast region that sold or distributed materials that could be used in a terrorist operation. It could be anything from pipes useful for pipe bombs to the explosive \\"black powder\\" that can be found in fireworks. Each store owner would be told, \\"If you see in an anomaly in a purchase, let us know.\\"\\n\\nZazi was just such an anomaly, as he was a dark-haired, bearded Afghan-American man in his 20s who bought six bottles of Clairoxide hair bleach during one shopping trip at a store in a Denver suburb. Zazi returned to the store a month later and purchased another dozen bottles of Ms. Kay Liquid, which is also a peroxide-based hair bleach.\\n\\nIt's that kind of bulk purchase of hydrogen peroxide that should trigger a suspicious activity report in the United States and other Western countries.\\n\\nJoin us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.Read CNNOpinion's Flipboard magazine.\\nWhat is a short summary of the above article?","response":"Explosives used in terrorist attacks are key clues for investigators to piece together both the origin and potential links to other terrorist plots. A prime example is triacetone triperoxide (TATP), a homemade explosive used by terrorists in Paris, London and the United States. The connection of TATP-based bombs to past jihadist attacks may provide insight into the techniques and plans of those orchestrating attacks, with hydrogen peroxide being a key ingredient in the creation of these explosives. Investigators must also look out for anomalies in the purchasing of materials that can be potential ingredients in bomb-making, as this can lead to uncovering planned terrorist attacks. As seen in the case of Najibullah Zazi, the monitoring of bulk purchases of potentially explosive materials played a crucial role in the eventual arrest and sentencing of the would-be bomber. As the Brussels attack investigation progresses, finding the locations where the bombs were assembled and uncovering who built them and where they received their training will help provide answers to prevent future attacks."},{"question":"Generate a context and a hypothesis.","response":"Context: Recent studies show that regular exercise and a healthy diet can contribute to one's overall well-being and stress reduction.\\n\\nStep 1: Analyze the context\\nI will analyze the context by considering the essential components mentioned: regular exercise, healthy diet, overall well-being, and stress reduction.

Article: House buyers have three main choices: building from the ground up, moving into an old house or buying a new one. All the three are very different and should be considered carefully. Your budget will probably have the biggest effect on your choice. Comparing the three will help you make a good decision. New houses are untouched and fresh, which means they can suit your personality and you know exactly where all of the materials come from. New houses won't hold many unpleasant surprises, such as weak foundations, or other damaged areas. Most of these modern houses are also far more eco-friendly, with future decoration being just as easy to make and do as you like. Buying new houses is also a great way to save money, and you may find its benefit with the price going up in the future. Some buildings, such as those that are rare or in certain areas, are of value over the years. Sometimes it is the history that draws more buyers into older houses. A famous person may have lived there, or an important event may have taken place in the house. This may not add any value to the house, but it can add to the attraction. There may be more repairs which will need to be done in the old houses,so before you think you've found a great bargain, be sure to get a careful inspection. There are those who prefer building from the ground up. Building your own house can be a very rewarding, tiring, and expensive experience.

Before getting into specifics, let's first take a quick look at each player's profile.\\n\\nCasey Dellacqua, an Australian professional tennis player, was born on February 11, 1985. Her career spanned a period from 2002 to 2018. Dellacqua achieved her highest singles ranking of No. 26 on September 29, 2014. Throughout her career, she primarily focused on doubles but still made notable impressions in singles competition.\\n\\nOlga Morozova, a former professional tennis player from the Soviet Union, was born on February 22, 1949. Her career spanned a period from 1966 to 1982. Morozova attained her highest singles ranking of No. 18 in 1975. She was a prominent figure in the international tennis scene during the 1970s, with significant singles achievements alongside her doubles success.\\n\\nTo answer the question of which player had more singles appearances, we must refer to their careers and tournaments played.\\n\\nCasey Dellacqua's main draws in singles competition, across all levels, include:\\n\\n1. Grand Slam Tournaments - 34 appearances\\n2. WTA Tour Tournaments - 87 appearances\\n3. WTA 125K Series - 5 appearances\\n4. ITF Circuit Tournaments - 72 appearances\\n\\nIn total, Casey Dellacqua had 198 singles appearances across all levels throughout her career.\\n\\nOlga Morozova's main draws in singles competition, across all levels, include:\\n\\n1. Grand Slam Tournaments - 41 appearances\\n2. International Tennis Federation (ITF) Tournaments - 115 appearances (estimate, based on win-loss records, as complete appearance data is not available)\\n\\nIn total, Olga Morozova had approximately 156 singles appearances across all levels throughout her career. However, it is important to note that Morozova played during a time when the structure of women's professional tennis was significantly different than Dellacqua's era; the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) was not established until 1973, and many tournaments were not classified under the ITF, WTA, or Grand Slams as they are today. The actual number of Morozova's singles appearances could be higher, but some data may be missing or not officially recorded.\\n\\nBy comparing the data available, we can conclude that Casey Dellacqua had more singles appearances (198) than Olga Morozova (approximately 156). Nevertheless, it is important to acknowledge the potential impact that the evolution of women's tennis and the lack of comprehensive records from earlier years may have on accurately comparing these two players."},{"question":"Definition: You are given a sentence in Persian.

Longford, a devout Catholic, often visited prisoners because of his passionate belief in forgiveness and society's need for prisoner rehabilitation.In 1965, he begins visiting Myra Hindley [Samantha Morton], a young woman serving a life sentence for murdering children with her lover Ian Brady [Andy Serkis]. Though Longford encountered public outrage, discouragement from his wife Elizabeth [Lindsay Duncan], doubt from his family, and criticism from his colleagues and the press, he continued to visit and exchange letters with Hindley. After learning that she once converted to Catholicism, Longford encourages her to return to the church and ask for God's forgiveness.After the Prime Minister removes him from the House of Lords, he devotes his time to crusading for Hindley and other prisoners. His wife eventually joins the crusade after reading Hindley's letters, meeting her and seeing the horrible prison conditions. She suspects that Hindley is receiving harsher punishment because she is a woman. Longford takes Hindley's cause public, talking to the press about her case and defending her as an accomplice corrupted by Ian Brady.At first, Hindley is grateful for Longford's efforts and seems to make progress in her return to the church. Later, she unexpectedly rejects his help and shocks him with the news that she lied to him about the murders. Once this information is made public, Longford's good name is damaged even further.

Yet, some find the strength to persist, not solely for survival but also for living a meaningful life amidst the challenges. In County Antrim, a courageous woman has astoundingly decided to return to work while continuing her rugged battle against cancer. The story recounts her hope for more support for fellow cancer patients and survivors in similar positions. By highlighting her journey, this article aims to share light on the significance of a supportive framework for cancer patients who wish to reintegrate into their professional lives.\\n\\nThe Spirited Warrior: A County Antrim Woman's Bravery\\n\\nWhen the news of a cancer diagnosis shadows one's world, it becomes nearly impossible to envision a future that resembles their previous life. Fear, uncertainty, and despair often cloud the dreams and aspirations, relegating them to the backdrop. Yet, this formidable woman from County Antrim stands tall amidst the turmoil, resiliently deciding to return to work and take charge of her life. \\n\\nIt is beyond doubt that her exceptional courage is inspirational for countless cancer patients and survivors who may seek to regain their professional lives' momentum. With her indomitable spirit, she sends out a powerful message: the battle against cancer need not be waged alone, nor must it confine cancer patients to the sidelines of their own lives. \\n\\nThe Need for a Supportive Infrastructure for Cancer Patients in the Workforce\\n\\nThe journey of this County Antrim woman underscores the significance of adequate support for cancer patients and survivors looking to transition back into their professional lives. Employers, co-workers, and the community as a whole should collectively contribute to nurturing an environment that empowers resilience in the face of adversity. \\n\\n1. Understanding and Accommodating Employers: Employers play a crucial role in fostering a supportive environment for cancer patients returning to the workforce. By ensuring flexibility in working hours, accommodating remote work options, and providing extended sick leaves, they can help alleviate the physical and emotional burden on the recovering employee.\\n\\n2. Co-worker Sensitivity and Encouragement: The role of empathetic and supportive colleagues cannot be overstated. By offering understanding encouragement, co-workers can ease the transition process for the returning employee. Additionally, fostering a judgment-free atmosphere will reduce stress and anxiety for the cancer patient.\\n\\n3. Access to Professional Counseling and Rehabilitation Services: To create a seamless integration into the workforce, cancer patients may require assistance with career planning and job search. Professional counselors and vocational rehabilitation specialists can provide guidance on transitioning back into the workplace, setting achievable goals, and finding suitable job opportunities.\\n\\n4. Legal Safeguards Against Discrimination: Appropriate legislation must be in place to safeguard cancer patients from discrimination within the workplace. Comprehensive anti-discrimination laws can protect the interests of employees looking to return to work after a diagnosis, ensuring that they are not denied rightful opportunities because of their medical condition.\\n\\n5. Building a Supportive Community Network: Local support groups and community networks can provide the necessary emotional and practical assistance that cancer patients require when returning to the workforce. By closely collaborating with healthcare professionals, these groups can offer vital resources and practical information to help cancer patients navigate the complexities of their professional lives. \\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nThe exemplary courage of this County Antrim woman is a testament to the extraordinary strength that lies within each cancer patient. It serves as a call to action, urging society to rally behind these brave individuals and provide them with the support they need to resume and excel in their professional lives. By acknowledging their resilience and fostering a nurturing environment, both employers and the community can help transform the narrative of cancer, granting patients, survivors, and their families the power to redefine their lives on their terms."},{"question":"Article:\\n\\nAs of 1:19 AM 03/3/15 All times are local (Market data is delayed by at least 15 minutes). \\n  \\n unidus corp (044480) Related Businessweek News No Related Businessweek News Found \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n No compensation data is available at this time for the top officers at this company. \\n  \\n Unidus Corporation develops, produces, and exports latex medical products.

(Yonhap) \\n  \\n Under the landmark ruling, some 5,400 people indicted or convicted of adultery after Oct. 30, 2008, when the law was last upheld, may ask for a suspension of indictment or a retrial. \\n  \\n South Korea had been one of the few remaining countries in Asia that prohibits infidelity, next to North Korea and Taiwan. Extramarital affairs here had been banned under the criminal law since 1953, and before that, only women were held accountable for some fooling around. \\n  \\n Sentences have been relatively heavy, with jail time ranging up to two years being the only fate a cheater and his affair partner could face. In Taiwan, the sentences range up to just one year in prison. \\n  \\n Previously, the court had turned down petitions to repeal the law four times from 1990 to 2008. In 2008, however, the judges supporting personal freedom became a majority, but were only one vote shy of realizing a change. \\n  \\n Some 100,000 South Koreans have been convicted of adultery since 1953. But the conviction rate dwindled from two-thirds between 1985 and now, to below 1 percent between late 2008 and early this year. \\n  \\n Many experts and activists welcomed the ruling, saying it demonstrated progress in women's rights. \\n  \\n \\"The anti-cheating law has been traditionally aimed at punishing women, but those days are long gone now,\\" Song Jae-ryong, a sociology professor at Kyung Hee University, said. \\n  \\n Others said the law was practically non-existent, as it had lost its effectiveness in preventing infidelity. \\n  \\n \\"The anti-adultery law is no longer achieving its purpose,\\" Kim Jeong-beom, a law professor at Hangyang University, said. \\"Penalties have become extremely light and don't have the preventative effect they're supposed to have.\\" \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n The state shouldn't interfere in personal matters, which should be settled in a civil manner, another expert said. \\n  \\n Public reaction, however, was mixed, with some voicing concerns that the ruling may encourage promiscuity. \\n  \\n \\"I'm worried that the decision would make people less responsible to their spouses,\\" said Lee Gyu-yeong, a teacher. \\n  \\n But others supported it, saying it enhanced personal freedom. \\n  \\n \\"It's not appropriate for the criminal code to intervene in people's love life,\\" Kim Min-soo, an office worker, said. \\"And it's not like the ruling would make people feel freer to cheat than before.\\" \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n sojungpark@yna.co.kr \\n  \\n (END) ||||| Hyundai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. manufactures and distributes pharmaceutical products, health food drinks, and medical equipment.

In the first conviction for human trafficking in Canada, a British Columbia Supreme Court found 50-year-old father of three, Franco Orr Yiu-kwan, guilty of illegally employing a foreign national and immigration breaches. His partner, Nicole Huen Oi-ling, was acquitted of the charges. \\"My clients are in shock frankly,\\" defense lawyer Nicholas Preovolos, told CNN affiliate CBC News. \\"They're stunned. It's an odd verdict, in that the jury apparently believed a number of allegations that Ms. Sarmiento made against Mr. Orr, but didn't believe the allegations she made against Ms. Huen.\\" Leticia Sarmiento, 40, told the court she was brought to Canada in 2008 with promises that the couple would help her get permanent resident status within two years and help bring her three children to Vancouver from the Philippines, CBC News reported. When she arrived in Vancouver, however, she says she was required to work 16 hours a day, seven days a week, with no days off and no statutory holidays. She said that after a temporary visitors' visa was acquired in Hong Kong, the couple withheld her passport from her. In Canada, she claimed, they restricted her movements and prevented her from talking to anyone. Things came to a head in June 2010 when Sarmiento called the police after getting into a confrontation with Huen. The Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post reported that she told the court that while she had a good relationship with her employers in Hong Kong, \\"things had changed dramatically in Canada.\\" She said apart from caring for the couple's three children, she was required to do cooking and cleaning duties that another domestic helper had performed in Hong Kong. Preovolos argued that Sarmiento was lying under oath, and was motivated by the damages that could ensue from a civil lawsuit that has yet to be heard in a B.C. Supreme Court. He argued that Sarmiento had begged the couple to take them with her when they moved to Canada following a business failure in Hong Kong and had refused to leave when her six-month tourist visa expired even though Orr had purchased a return ticket to the Philippines for her. He told the court that in 2010 the couple had bought her another ticket to return home to the Philippines and it was only then that Sarmiento, desperate to stay in Canada, had called police. Sarmiento agreed she planned to apply for permanent residency in Canada. A defense witness also testified that Sarmiento had provided her passport when she unsuccessfully tried to open a Canadian bank account, undermining her testimony that the couple had confiscated her passport. Orr remains free on bail, pending sentencing on July 10. The charge carries a maximum sentence of life in prison and a $1 million fine.\\nHere is a summary of the highlights for this article:","response":"A Hong Kong man, Franco Orr Yiu-kwan, was convicted of human trafficking in the first such landmark verdict in Canada.

Philip Sutton from the NAFP said he was concerned councils, through the consortium, were looking to cut costs. The Welsh government said it works with councils to improve foster care. The NAFP represents independent foster carers, who provide just under 40% of placements in Wales. Mr Sutton said he was worried children \\"would not thrive in the way we have expected them to\\" because of the cuts. \\"My main worry is that local authorities, through the consortium, are looking to reduce the cost of placements by reducing the additional services that agencies provide: things like education services and respite services,\\" he said. \\"They are looking for a basic care provision.\\" Mr Sutton said he was also concerned that the changes might see children move frequently between placements as foster carers struggled to cope. \\"One of the things we always look for in foster caring, which is proved to provide the best possible outcomes, is stability,\\" he said. \\"You need some kind of help for carers with difficult placements to achieve that. \\"If foster carers are not able to access therapy or other services it can make the difference between a placement continuing or breaking down. \\"The worry is if we're reducing the availability of therapy and other provisions more placements will break down and it's been shown clearly that children who have multiple placements don't do well in life generally.\\" 'Emotive issue' Among other changes Mr Sutton said are being proposed are plans to cut the mileage allowance that foster carers can claim for trips, such as hospital appointments. He described this as an \\"emotive\\" issue and something that some providers might find difficult to continue.

Article: There are many rights to make sure that people will be treated fairly when they are suspected or accused of a crime. Sometimes these rights are called \\"due process of law\\". In using these rights, a person should have the help of a lawyer. You have a right to protect against unreasonable searches and seizures. The police generally may not search you or your home, or take things you own, without a \\"warrant\\". A warrant is a paper which states, very exactly, the place to be searched and the things to be taken. Sometimes, however, the police will not need a warrant to search you or your property. If an officer sees you committing a crime, or if he has a good reason to believe you have committed a serious crime, he may arrest you and search you and the area right around you without a warrant. If you invite a police without a warrant to come into your house and he finds proof of crime, the evidence may be used against you in court. If you do not want an officer to search you or your home and he does not have a warrant, tell him that you do not give him the right to search. However, if the officer will not listen, do not try to stop him. It is dangerous to resist and it may be illegal to do so. Any evidence which a policeman gets during an unlawful search and seizure cannot be used against you. Police officers must act reasonably and fairly at all times. They should use physical force only when it is needed to arrest someone to enforce a law. They may not use physical violence to \\"teach someone a lesson\\".

A:\\nAnswer:","response":"The part of a fish that helps them breathe is called the gills. Gills are specialized respiratory organs that enable fish to extract dissolved oxygen from water as it passes over them. These feathery, delicate structures are usually located on either side of the fish's head, beneath a bony plate known as the operculum.\\n\\nGills are made up of thin, flat filaments covered with thousands of tiny, finger-like projections called lamellae. The large surface area provided by the filaments and lamellae allows for efficient gas exchange, where oxygen from the water diffuses into the fish's bloodstream, while carbon dioxide from the fish's body diffuses out into the water.\\n\\nAs fish swim, they take in water through their mouths and pump it over their gills. In some species, specialized gill covers called opercula help protect the gills and aid in drawing or pumping water across them. The oxygen-rich water flows over the gill filaments and lamellae, and the oxygen molecules then diffuse into the fish's blood while carbon dioxide waste diffuses out, providing the fish with the necessary oxygen to breathe and remain active."}]`),H={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:B,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const i=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return i?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.question&&e.question.toLowerCase().includes(i)||e.response&&e.response.toLowerCase().includes(i)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},W={class:"card-container"},R={key:0,class:"empty-state"},N=["disabled"],E={key:0},D={key:1};function G(i,e,h,m,o,s){const p=f("PoemCard");return n(),a("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(n(),a("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",W,[(n(!0),a(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,g)=>(n(),k(p,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(n(),a("div",R,' No results found for "'+d(o.searchQuery)+'".
