The 6-foot, 4-inch former high school history teacher from Long Island demonstrated that a strong opinion could translate into a powerful platform and big profits long before social media — or even President Trump — was a thing. O’Reilly helped boost Rupert Murdoch’s Fox News Channel into a 1-billion-plus-a-year business. But in the wake of his dismissal Wednesday over allegations of sexual harassment, it remains to be seen whether the scandal would mortally wound his reputation or dent his business prospects. “He had a massive megaphone to talk to the people — and that has been taken away,” said Fred Cook, director of the USC Center of Public Relations at the Annenberg School. “I think he's a little like Donald Trump in that he has a loyal following. Those hardcore supporters will continue to support him and may even be more supportive of him after this.” O’Reilly, who has been on vacation for the last week, including a visit with Pope Francis at the Vatican, has asserted that the allegations that he sexually harassed women who appeared on his show are “unfounded.” Parent company 21st Century Fox said in a statement: “After a thorough and careful review of the allegations, the company and Bill O’Reilly have agreed that Bill O’Reilly will not be returning to the Fox News Channel.” It is a harsh fall from grace for one of television’s most bankable stars. “The O’Reilly Factor” long has been one of the most popular programs on cable TV, this year averaging 4 million viewers an episode, according to ratings company Nielsen. O’Reilly masterfully turned his Fox News bully pulpit into a springboard for his publishing pursuits. He is one of the country's most popular nonfiction authors with his “Killing Lincoln,” “Killing Kennedy” and “Killing Jesus” books, several of which have been made into TV movies on the National Geographic Channel (also owned by Fox). O’Reilly’s “Killing” series books have consistently sold 1 million or more copies in hardcover, a rare achievement in publishing. He had other best-sellers, including “Bill O’Reilly: Culture Warrior,” the memoir “A Bold Fresh Piece of Humanity” and his most recent work, “Old School,” which includes passages urging the respectful treatment of women. “His show was a massive platform for him and supported everything he's doing,” Cook said. “It will be harder for him to reach the same number of people.” In recent years, the 67-year-old TV host and author mentioned during various talk show appearances that he would eventually slow down. But he remained busy outside his Fox News studio. He has headlined live shows around the country with comedian Dennis Miller called “The Spin Stops Here Tour,” which is still scheduled to make stops in Baltimore, Las Vegas and Anaheim later this year. “This [scandal] has definitely hurt his brand in the broad sense, but he will undoubtedly bounce back,” said Marlene Morris Towns, an adjunct marketing professor at Georgetown University in Washington. “He will find a home because his super-loyal fan base will still support him.” He will find a home because his super-loyal fan base will still support him. — Marlene Morris Towns, Georgetown University marketing professor Industry insiders suggested that O’Reilly might concentrate his efforts on his books and turning them into TV movies. O'Reilly and coauthor Martin Dugard are due to release another book in the “Killing” series in September, and a spokeswoman for publisher Henry Holt and Co. said that plans had not changed. Some suggested he could earn big fees by hitting the speaking circuit. And others said he might even re-create some of his cable news success with a show on radio or an upstart Internet streaming service. O’Reilly also could resurface as a commentator on traditional television, such as for the conservative Sinclair Broadcasting Group, a Maryland TV station chain that has shown an appetite for owning TV content and this month hired Trump’s former spokesman, Boris Epshteyn, to be its chief political analyst. (A Sinclair executive could not be reached for comment). \\"He has a broad loyal viewership that has an almost universally favorable view of him,” said Kyle Dropp, co-founder and chief research officer of Morning Consult, a Washington polling and market research firm. “When other hosts switch platforms, they usually have a large base that moves with them.\\" Former Fox News personality Glenn Beck, for example, started a digital network called The Blaze, which initially attracted a sizable audience. However, some TV executives noted that O’Reilly’s audience — largely older white men — might not follow O’Reilly if he opted to make a comeback through an Internet venture. According to Nielsen data, the median age of his television audience is 67 — the same age as O’Reilly. “His audience will be less likely to find him on an alternative platform,” predicted Towns of Georgetown. O’Reilly worked hard to build himself into a bigger brand than many TV news celebrities. In addition to his books and live tour, his website offers a collection of “No Spin” merchandise, including hats, ties, mugs, t-shirts, lapel pins, key chains shaped like the United States and “Patriots Welcome” doormats. Over the years, O’Reilly also inspired copycats, serving as the model for the pompous TV pundit that Stephen Colbert played, tongue-in-cheek, for years on Comedy Central before Colbert decamped for CBS. O’Reilly relished his role as a foil, and he might even benefit from a perception that he was unfairly targeted by liberal activists. Trump said earlier this month that he didn’t think his friend, O’Reilly, did anything wrong. And on Wednesday, Beck suggested that his former colleague was the victim of a smear campaign by liberal activists. The group Media Matters for America, which is a vociferous critic of Fox News, said Wednesday that its efforts to organize an advertiser boycott of O’Reilly’s show were legitimate. “It's not a smear campaign,” Angelo Carusone, president of Media Matters for America, said in an interview. “This has been a deeper problem at Fox News — it's the larger culture at Fox News and that Fox was handling this in a blithe way.\\" ||||| Bill O'Reilly will be paid tens of millions of dollars on his way out of Fox News, two well-placed sources told CNNMoney. \\"It is a staggering amount,\\" said a source personally involved in the exit maneuverings. After this story was originally published Thursday morning, a third source said the payout totals 25 million. 21st Century Fox and O'Reilly's representatives will not acknowledge the existence of a payout. A confidentiality agreement limits what the two sides can say. But the sources confirmed that O'Reilly does have a parachute, partly because O'Reilly signed a new contract right before being ousted. The two original sources, who spoke independently of one another, said the new contract was worth about 25 million per year. (Previous news reports have pegged O'Reilly's past contract at 18 to 20 million a year.) O'Reilly commanded a higher sum for obvious reasons: he dominated the ratings and helped Fox News deliver record profits for its parent company. The two sources also said the contract extended through the next presidential election, meaning it was set to expire either at the end of 2020 or sometime in 2021. However, O'Reilly will not be paid the entire amount he was owed. That's because Fox incorporated language in the new contract that gave the network some \\"outs.\\" Fox is only on the hook for one years' salary, according to one of the sources. That's why the payout totals 25 million. Roger Ailes, on the other hand, was paid the entire remainder of his contract when he resigned under pressure last summer. Ailes, the founding CEO of Fox News, was accused of harassment by Fox employees. Ailes was paid more than 40 million on the way out. He recently bought a 36 million oceanfront home in Florida. As for O'Reilly, the sources declined to say exactly how much money he will receive. But regulatory filings may drop some hints in the coming months. The Washington Post reported that the new deal was signed in March -- just weeks before The New York Times' investigation into O'Reilly was published on April 1. Related: What will Bill O'Reilly do now? The Murdochs knew that the Times story was in the works, and that's why \\"outs\\" were added to the contract. But the Murdochs underestimated just how severe the fallout would be, one of the sources said. Dozens of advertisers abandoned the \\"O'Reilly Factor\\" and other women came forward with new accusations of harassment. When Ailes was sued, Fox asked the law firm Paul, Weiss to conduct an internal investigation. Precisely two weeks later, Ailes resigned. This month, the timeline repeated itself. When O'Reilly accuser Wendy Walsh and her attorney Lisa Bloom called Fox's hotline on April 5, the Murdochs put Paul, Weiss on the case. The results of the internal probe were not shared publicly on Wednesday, but it apparently influenced the Murdochs' decision. Exactly two weeks later, O'Reilly was dismissed. At an event in New York on Wednesday night, James Murdoch, the company's CEO, was asked by a New York Times reporter about the abrupt exit. Murdoch said \\"we did a thorough investigation, a thorough review, and we reached a conclusion. Everything that we said in our statement is all you need to know.\\" O'Reilly issued a statement that reaffirmed his innocence, saying \\"it is tremendously disheartening that we part ways due to completely unfounded claims. But that is the unfortunate reality many of us in the public eye must live with today.\\" ||||| Bill O’Reilly could walk away with as much as 20 million to 25 million as part of his separation from Fox News Channel, according to a person familiar with the situation, signaling the high value the cable-news outlet placed on its best-known anchor. As part of the terms of a contract recently signed between the veteran anchor and the 21st Century Fox cable-news outlet, O’Reilly is entitled to as much as a year of his current salary, this person said. O’Reilly is believed to make as much as 20 million to 25 million per year. O’Reilly is leaving the network after a New York Times investigation revealed 13 million in settlements made to women who levied charges of sexual harassment and inappropriate behavior at the former host of the popular “The O’Reilly Factor.” Advertisers subsequently defected from his program. In a statement released Wednesday, O’Reilly said: “It is tremendously disheartening that we part ways due to completely unfounded claims. But that is the unfortunate reality many of us in the public eye must live with today. I will always look back on my time at Fox with great pride in the unprecedented success we achieved and with my deepest gratitude to all my dedicated viewers. I wish only the best for Fox News Channel.” He has said he entered into settlements to protect his children and suggested his fame made him a target. A Fox News spokesperson declined to comment, as did a spokesman for O’Reilly. O’Reilly would not be the first to walk away from Fox under a cloud but with substantial money under his arm. Roger Ailes, the network’s former chairman and chief executive, was ousted last summer in the wake of an investigation made into allegations of sexual harassment, and was said to be paid a settlement valued at the remaining time on his contract. Ailes was said to make around 20 million per year. ||||| With the ouster of Roger Ailes and now Bill O’Reilly, Rupert Murdoch's son has overthrown his own network as he moves to reinvent the family company's profit machine at great risk. After The New York Times wrote about the sexual harassment claims leveled at Fox News anchor Bill O’Reilly and the settlements made by the company and O’Reilly himself, James Murdoch, according to 21st Century Fox sources, kept repeating with horror to his friends and executives: \\"This is on the front page of The New York Times!\\" These sources say James Murdoch’s longtime annoyance if not disgust with Fox News became cold fury after the Times' April 1 story — even though several of the O’Reilly settlements had happened when James was CEO of the parent company. This was a similar reaction to what had followed the harassment suit by former anchor Gretchen Carlson against Fox News chief Roger Ailes in July. Every time Fox controversies spilled over into the wider world, James took it personally. “It was somehow against him,\\" says one person close to the Murdochs. Fox News is a business he should not be in, he had told people before, despite its major contribution to 21st Century Fox's bottom line — 20 percent of its profits came from Fox News last year, the biggest-earning division in the company. Presumably, he meant the in-your-face world of conservative cable news with its mega personalities. Indeed, James regarded many of the people at Fox News as thuggish Neanderthals and said he was embarrassed to be in the same company with them. But, likewise, it would be hard to imagine how James could have been regarded with more contempt by many of the people at Fox News. James was rather exhibit No. 1 of the liberal elite entitlement that Fox had so profitably programmed against. “Fox [News] is an important brand, but it needs to develop, and, to some extent, be reformed,” James said when I interviewed him 10 years ago in his office as the chief executive of the Murdoch-controlled Sky TV in Britain, whose significantly less-partisan news operation he extolled as a ratings and journalistic model. He seized his first opportunity for reform in July when, over his father Rupert's protests and his brother and co-executive Lachlan’s ambivalence, he pushed for the ouster of Ailes, the network’s founder and almost all-powerful executive. When the O’Reilly story hit the Times, he overrode his father and brother again — and, by the same method he had used with Ailes, hiring a Democratic-associated law firm, Paul Weiss, to perform a rubber-stamp investigation. (In neither the Ailes nor O’Reilly investigations were the targets of the investigation interviewed.) It was, he proudly told friends, a right decision rather than a business decision. The billionaire scion was aligning himself, profits be damned, with a new generation of corporate responsibility. That put him quite directly at odds with his father. It would be quite inconceivable to imagine Rupert sacrificing sure profits for greater good or a better image; indeed, his company had always been a pirate company. But that really is the larger point — in which O’Reilly and Ailes were in the end just collateral damage — it isn't his father’s company anymore. If the expulsion of Ailes, and, even more dramatically, O’Reilly, mean anything, it means most of all that James is in charge. And, most immediately, this means that Fox News, that constant irritant in James’ view of himself as a progressive and visionary television executive, will begin to change. Virtually overnight. In some sense, with the ouster of Ailes and now O’Reilly, James has overthrown his own network. With them there, both men possessing vast industry, institutional, political and corporate powers, it would have been impossible for the owner’s jejune son to have forced change. Now with them gone, it’s nearly a clean slate. Fox News must become something else. The almost certain instant erosion of Fox’s primetime audience, built on the spillover of O’Reilly’s long-unbeaten 8:00 hour, means the existential moment begins, practically speaking, immediately. Rupert, 86, is said to be watching this in some disbelief, but with some pride, too. He has long believed that what many others see as his son’s arrogance and superciliousness is actually brilliance. And while Rupert may disagree with much of James' instincts and actions — quite proved inadequate in the London phone-hacking scandal for which James received much of the blame — he yet seems pleased that he would be up to taking them. James’ dream, wherein he hopes to match his father’s accomplishments, and which he has been spinning for all who might listen for many years now, is of combining Sky News and Fox News with the vast Murdoch reach and producing some ultimate global news brand. Where Fox News is parochial and America First, the new global brand is worldly and unlimited. It will give his family’s company, once the pirate company, new meaning and new stature — a force for stability instead of upheaval. Murdoch media, in an age of populist disruption, will stand for the established world order. Risk, in Murdochland, is good. Risk is one of Rupert's top business virtues. But where his father took risks in defiance of the respectable world, James, with some kind of head-smacking irony, is now risking the profits and influence his father created (with no small help from Ailes and O’Reilly) in pursuit of some ultimate respectability. ||||| There are few forces on television more powerful than Tucker Carlson’s skepticism. Subjected to it, a pundit or politician will wilt, or stammer, or stand firm, or (very occasionally) respond with a convincing argument. Whichever way things go, the results are often compulsively watchable—at least for those with an appetite for televised discomfort. This skepticism has driven the success of Carlson’s show, “Tucker Carlson Tonight,” on Fox News, which will now become the cornerstone of the network’s prime-time lineup. On Wednesday, Fox News announced that Bill O’Reilly, who is under the cloud of a sexual-harassment scandal, was leaving the company. His replacement in the network’s 8 P.M. time slot is Carlson, a former antagonist of O’Reilly (he once called him a “thin-skinned blowhard”) who is now called upon to do what O’Reilly did for two decades: provide ratings big enough to insure that, night after night, Fox News remains the most-viewed cable-news network in the country. For many years, for most viewers, the identity of Fox News has been closely linked to the identity of O’Reilly, who was flinty and utterly self-assured—and who took pains to present himself, not always convincingly, as conservative but nonpartisan. In his new book, “Old School: Life in the Sane Lane,” O’Reilly goes out of his way to praise Michelle Obama, writing, “I watched Michelle Obama on a few occasions treat strangers so well that I was floored. Believe Mrs. Obama is Old School.” Carlson once wrote that O’Reilly’s regular-guy persona made him uniquely vulnerable to scandal, because fans wanted to believe in him. But O’Reilly wasn’t much hurt by a widely reported 2004 lawsuit in which a colleague accused him of sexual harassment. It seems possible that the more recent revelations damaged O’Reilly less than they damaged Fox News: its founding C.E.O., Roger Ailes, resigned last year amid multiple allegations of sexual harassment. The allegations against O’Reilly made it appear as if the network still wasn’t committed to protecting the women who worked there. Judging from the ratings, O’Reilly’s viewers stayed loyal to him—even as advertisers fled—and O’Reilly will surely find an audience for whatever he does next. His regular-guy persona will outlive the extraordinary television career it enabled. The devotion of O’Reilly’s regular viewers surely made this decision more difficult for Rupert Murdoch, the executive chairman of Fox News. On a typical night, O’Reilly would draw the biggest audience in all of cable news; Carlson, at nine o’clock, would draw a smaller audience than O’Reilly, and Sean Hannity, at ten, would draw a smaller audience than Carlson. Reading the Nielsen numbers, it was possible to imagine that the nightly success of Fox News depended on how long O’Reilly’s viewers could stay awake. And the hosts who followed O’Reilly certainly worked in his shadow: Carlson was more intellectual and more mischievous; Hannity was more politically engaged and more partisan. Carlson is inheriting O’Reilly’s time slot but not his stature—and a network is not necessarily defined by its 8 P.M. show. At MSNBC, Rachel Maddow draws a bigger audience, at nine, than Chris Hayes does, at eight. On Wednesday, Fox News also announced that the nine-o’clock hour will now belong to “The Five,” a panel-discussion show that includes another mischief maker: Greg Gutfeld, the sardonic former host of “Red Eye,” a highly entertaining late-night show that Fox News recently cancelled. When many people think of Fox News, they picture a confident man in a business jacket telling viewers what to think. Now the only prime-time show matching that description will be Hannity’s. The departure of O’Reilly—like the departure, last summer, of Ailes—suggests that the network’s old way of operating has become unsustainable. But much of the network’s old guard remains: the network’s co-president, Bill Shine, is known as Ailes’s former “right-hand man.” And nothing about the Fox News' public response to the latest scandal has conveyed the impression that it is eager to remake its corporate culture. It seems possible, though, that Carlson’s promotion to eight o’clock will, in a small but noticeable way, change the way people think about what Fox News does. The network developed a reputation, in the aughts, for being ferociously loyal to President George W. Bush. (In fact, O’Reilly’s support for the war in Iraq was more lukewarm than most people remember. On the eve of war, he said that he was inclined to support Bush, but added, “Nobody knows for sure what the absolute right thing to do is.”) Carlson, who is something of a contrarian, loves to criticize the most intemperate critics of President Trump—he can be particularly withering on the topic of immigration. But that doesn’t mean Carlson always supports the President. And, from time to time, he has shown himself willing to aim the force of his industrial-strength skepticism at the current Administration. On April 7th, in the wake of the news that Trump had ordered fifty-nine missiles fired into Syria, Carlson had on Lindsey Graham, the senator from South Carolina, a noted critic of Trump who was also a full-throated supporter of the missile strike. What followed was one of the most memorable segments that Carlson has broadcast so far, as the host—deeply skeptical of the budding war effort—pushed his guest to explain what the Administration was up to. “I can’t tell who the main enemy is here,” Carlson said. “You said that ISIL is the main enemy. And then you said Iran is the main enemy. But they’re fighting each other, so I’m confused.” (Carlson excels at feigning confusion.) Graham tried to explain that Syria was a client state of Iran, and that America’s seemingly incompatible military goals were, in fact, inseparable. “Radical Sunni Islam hates the Iranians, because they’re a bunch of Shiites,” Graham replied. “They hate us, too. How are we connected here? Radical Islam, in the Sunni side, did 9/11. I don’t think Iran is going to attack us tomorrow, but I think if they had a nuclear capability they would share it with terrorist organizations, and our homeland would be at risk.” Carlson did not seem convinced by this rather complicated explanation. “Like most Americans, I’m pretty skeptical about starting an entire new war, given the track record of the wars that you’ve supported so far has been, I think, most people would say, abysmal,” he said. This was a bracing exchange, and perhaps a revealing one. Carlson used to relish playing the role of resident skeptic at Fox News. Now, perhaps, he will become the leading voice of a network that is a little bit more skeptical than it used to be. ||||| Lurid Claims Burst Into View Fox News has been aware of complaints about inappropriate behavior by Mr. O’Reilly since at least 2002, when Mr. O’Reilly stormed into the newsroom and screamed at a young producer, according to current and former employees, some of whom witnessed the incident. Shortly thereafter, the woman, Rachel Witlieb Bernstein, left the network with a payout and bound by a confidentiality agreement, people familiar with the deal said. The exact amount she was paid is not known, but it was far less than the other settlements. The case did not involve sexual harassment. Two years later, allegations about Mr. O’Reilly entered the public arena in lurid fashion when a producer on his show, Andrea Mackris, then 33, filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against him. In the suit, she said he had told her to buy a vibrator, called her at times when it sounded as if he was masturbating and described sexual fantasies involving her. Ms. Mackris had recorded some of the conversations, people familiar with the case said. Ms. Mackris also said in the suit that Mr. O’Reilly, who was married at the time (he and his wife divorced in 2011), threatened her, saying he would make any woman who complained about his behavior “pay so dearly that she’ll wish she’d never been born.” Fox News and Mr. O’Reilly adopted an aggressive strategy that served as a stark warning of what could happen to women if they came forward with complaints, current and former employees told The Times. Before Ms. Mackris even filed suit, Fox News and Mr. O’Reilly surprised her with a pre-emptive suit of their own, asserting she was seeking to extort 60 million in return for not going public with “scandalous and scurrilous” claims about him. “This is the single most evil thing I have ever experienced, and I have seen a lot,” he said on his show the day both suits were filed. “But these people picked the wrong guy.” ||||| Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images Bill O’Reilly has returned from his Italian holiday without a day job. On Wednesday, Fox News axed the most popular host on cable news following an advertiser walkout over O’Reilly’s alleged history of sexual harassment, which he and the network had kept hidden by paying millions in lawsuit settlements. For now, though, O’Reilly still has his lucrative book-writing, his live appearances, and, of course, his millions. And he may yet continue to darken America’s screens. Advertisement O’Reilly possesses a fan base that clings to him with Bieberian levels of devotion. His audience is more than happy to whitewash his bad behavior, blaming the victims and the liberal media, showering him with love and denial. They won’t all follow O’Reilly to his next act, but plenty will. So what’s O’Reilly’s next step? How does he monetize (such a 21st century word for such a 20th century character) his rabid fans, the people who made sure his ratings went up even as advertisers began jumping ship? The answer is OTT. Get Slate in your inbox. That’s over-the-top, a term used to describe not O’Reilly’s bombastic style, but rather the technology for delivering television over the open internet. (In olden days, the cables to connect the devices that allowed for internet-based transmission literally snaked over the top of the TV set, hence the name.) O’Reilly is one of the few media stars with enough name recognition and the sort of devoted fan base to make a standalone TV network a realistic possibility. Glenn Beck did it, and O’Reilly is arguably far more popular than Beck. Advertisement Launching an OTT network—as Donald Trump might have done had he lost the election—is not rocket science. There are plenty of high-quality software and hardware solutions that would allow him to launch a network quickly and easily, and to actually produce his show, at least in DIY style, all O’Reilly really needs is a couple of cameramen, stage lights, and microphones that can handle really, really loud voices. He’d also need to decide on a business model—a monthly subscription plan; a transactional model, where each show is available individually; or, more likely, a hybrid, where subscribers save money over the cost of individual downloads, while also providing O’Reilly with a recurring revenue stream. Throw in some red, white, and blue graphics and an easy-to-remember URL and you’re pretty much set. A deal with the larger streaming devices like Roku, Apple TV, and Amazon Firestick would help—assuming they don’t deem an O’Reilly channel too toxic to host—but otherwise a basic Chromecast, to stream the show from the web browser to their TVs, would work for his fans. (And really clear, really well-thought-out instructions: O’Reilly’s audience, after all, skews older.) Perhaps like Glenn Beck, O’Reilly would decide to expand his show into a full-on network, adding other like-minded commentators, and otherwise make a go of it as a digital property. How much could O’Reilly make? If just over one-quarter of the 3.76 million people who watched his show on Tuesday, April 4 signed up for a 10 monthly subscription, he’d be grossing 10 million each month—or 120 million a year. In order to launch a successful OTT network, you need to have the sort of devoted audience who will follow you into uncharted waters, fans who will gladly download your app and pay for the privilege. As such, O’Reilly is one of a small number of celebrities who could pull something like this off. There’s Oprah. Howard Stern. Maybe Rachel Maddow or Jerry Seinfeld. The most enticing thing for O’Reilly might be this: He wouldn’t need to rely on the advertisers who were scared off by his alleged extracurricular activities. He just needs the support of his loyal fans. When you’ve got a built-in audience of millions, the options are fairly endless. (Then again, given the fleeting nature of fame in America and the advanced age of O’Reilly’s fan base, he probably would want to make his move fast.) ||||| The emergence of those strains explained why Fox News occasionally appeared to be at war with itself over the past year. Those who were in the more traditional conservative and neoconservative camps lined up against Mr. Trump — or, at least, were not enthusiastically behind him — and those who were more aligned with Mr. Trump’s brand of nationalism lined up behind him. Will Fox News embrace the more traditional conservatism represented by Dana Perino, the former Bush press secretary and co-host of “The Five,” who has won high marks as a substitute for Mr. O’Reilly over the past few days? Or will it do more to highlight the more populist, antiglobalist brand of her “Five” co-host Eric Bolling, who will take over the 5 p.m. time slot and won’t join Ms. Perino and his other co-hosts in prime time? The family that will ultimately decide, the Murdochs, has its own funhouse-mirror version of those competing strands. There is the founding executive chairman and family patriarch, Rupert Murdoch, who after being suspicious of Mr. Trump, has swung solidly — but not blindly — behind him. Then there are his successors-in-waiting, James Murdoch, said to be the most liberal-leaning of the three, and Lachlan Murdoch, said to be somewhere in between them, according to those who know them. People briefed on the internal discussions said it was James Murdoch — whose wife, Kathryn, once worked at the Clinton Climate Initiative — who first saw Mr. O’Reilly’s removal as essential, followed by Lachlan and finally Rupert, who despite his own promotion of women in his companies showed the most willingness to stand behind Mr. Ailes and then Mr. O’Reilly as the allegations piled up. But Fox’s ultimate look in the post-Ailes, post-O’Reilly era — and therefore, its place in the conservative media movement — will come down to the two things all three of them always agree on: ratings and revenue. ||||| Tucker Carlson has become the quick fix for Fox News. Already a surprising success in the 9 p.m. hour where he succeeded the popular Megyn Kelly in January, Fox News is now asking Mr. Carlson to fill the very big shoes of Bill O’Reilly at 8 p.m., a much more daunting task. Mr. O’Reilly’s show averaged around four million viewers a night in... |||||Summary:","response":"Bill O'Reilly - the powerful presence behind Rupert Murdoch's Fox News - has been dismissed over allegations of sexual harassment, leading to questions over whether the scandal will ruin his reputation or damage his business prospects.

Zwingli was a scholar and preacher, who in 1518 moved to Zurich. Although the two movements agreed on many issues of theology, some unresolved differences kept them separate. A long-standing resentment between the German states and the Swiss Confederation led to heated debate over how much Zwingli owed his ideas to Lutheranism. The German Prince Philip of Hesse saw potential in creating an alliance between Zwingli and Luther.

Context: I had this one guy, who enjoyed being a part time bully and part time neutral to me. To say the least he was annoying. He'd take the liberty to hide my backpack, borrow my books without consent, doodle scandalous stuff on my notebooks with a pen and yada yada. So one day, I was showing this cool trick I learned on an anatomy program on the TV to a couple of classmates who used to sit around me. The thing was that you can't flex your ring finger upwards if you put your middle finger under the palm (try that) We were all kids, and soon everyone in the class started staring at us weirdos looking laughing at out hands. The bully noticed it too, and came near to inquire about this hand stuff. I described the trick and he was impressed. And then, I saw our teacher walking up the corridor, just a couple paces behind the class door. So, I asked him (the bully) if he wanted to see another trick and to that he nodded a big yes. Cool, What I did was, that I grabbed his right arm by the thumb and put it on my throat right above the larynx. Then I quickly shifted my grip to his wrist. He without batting an eye, asked what I was doing, but then I started beating the desk with my other hand and made squeaking noises while pushing his hand against my throat harder with every turning head. And voilà! Every one in the class (including the teacher) thought he was smothering me. After a few ifs and buts between him and the teacher, he was summoned at the principal’s chambers, from where, later he was sent home, where presumably judging from the look on his face for the next few days, he was beat to crap by his folks. And after that, never was I ever bothered by anyone in the school.(^^) Question: How does the bully probably feel about his past actions now that he no longer bothers anyone? Answer: Answer:","response":"It is likely that the bully feels a combination of embarrassment, regret, and possibly a sense of fear or caution regarding his past actions. After being caught in a compromising situation and facing consequences at school and at home, he may have realized the potential negative outcomes of his behavior. Furthermore, he might have also learned the importance of respecting others and their belongings. As a result, he probably decided to change his behavior and avoid causing trouble in the future, which led him to refrain from bothering anyone in the school."},{"question":"Read the bio below and try to give details on steve shanahan 's: - party - spouse - predecessor - office - term start - name Bio: steven léo shanahan -lrb- born september 16 , 1970 -rrb- is a politician in montreal , quebec , canada . he has served on the montreal city council since november 2013 as a member of vrai changement pour montréal .

Movie title: Flesh for Frankenstein Movie plot: Baron von Frankenstein neglects his duties towards his wife/sister Katrin, as he is obsessed with creating a perfect Serbian race to obey his commands, beginning by assembling a perfect male and female from parts of corpses. The doctor's sublimation of his sexual urges by his powerful urge for domination is shown when he utilizes the surgical wounds of his female creation to satisfy his lust. He is dissatisfied with the inadequate reproductive urges of his current male creation, and seeks a head donor with a greater libido; he also repeatedly exhibits an intense interest that the creature's \\"nasum\\" (nose) have a correctly Serbian shape.[6][7] As it happens, a suitably randy farmhand, Nicholas, leaving a local brothel along with his sexually repressed friend, brought there in an unsuccessful attempt to dissuade him from entering a monastery, are spotted and waylaid by the doctor and his henchman, Otto; mistakenly assuming that the prospective monk is also suitable for stud duty, they take his head for use on the male creature. Not knowing these behind-the-scene details, Nicholas survives and is summoned by Katrin to the castle, where they form an agreement that he will gratify her unsatisfied carnal appetites.[6][7] Under the control of the doctor, the male and female creatures are seated for dinner with the castle's residents, but the male creature shows no signs of recognition of his friend as he serves the Baron and his family. Nicholas realizes at this point that something is awry, but himself pretends not to recognize his friend's face until he can investigate further. After a falling-out with Katrin, who is merely concerned with her own needs, Nicholas goes snooping in the laboratory and is captured by the doctor. Frankenstein muses about using his new acquisition to replace the head of his creature, who is still showing no signs of libido. Nevertheless, Katrin is rewarded for betraying Nicholas by being granted use of the creature for erotic purposes, but is killed during a bout of overly vigorous... A:","response":"Baron von Frankenstein's relationship to Katrin in the film \\"Flesh for Frankenstein\\" is both complex and twisted. They are husband and wife but are also siblings. Katrin is neglected by her husband, Baron von Frankenstein, due to his fixation on creating the perfect Serbian race. This obsession leads him to prioritize assembling a perfect male and female from parts of corpses rather than fulfilling his spousal duties to Katrin. The film's plot revolves around Baron von Frankenstein's ambition to create obedient, perfect Serbian beings through his male and female creations. His domination impulse is expressed through his use of the surgical wounds of his female creation to satisfy his lust. The Baron is focused on finding a head donor with a strong libido for his male creation, as the current one does not meet his expectations. Nicholas, a farmhand with a promiscuous disposition, becomes an unwitting participant when he and his friend are targeted by the doctor and his henchman Otto. They mistakenly take the head of Nicholas's sexually repressed friend, assuming he is suitable for the Baron's experiment. Nicholas eventually becomes involved with Katrin, who seeks him out to satiate her unmet sexual desires, not knowing what the Baron has done to his friend. As the story unfolds, Nicholas becomes suspicious of the goings-on in the castle and begins investigating the laboratory. Meanwhile, the Baron contemplates using Nicholas to replace the head of his male creation, still unsatisfied with its lack of libido. Katrin, for her part, betrays Nicholas and is rewarded with the use of the male creature for her own pleasure. However, she ends up being killed during an overly vigorous encounter with the creature. To summarize, Baron von Frankenstein and Katrin have a dysfunctional relationship characterized by neglect, as the Baron's obsession with creating a perfect Serbian race takes precedence over his relationship with Katrin. As husband and wife as well as siblings, their relationship adds a layer of complexity and tension to the film's storyline. Katrin's desires and eventual betrayal of Nicholas are fueled by her husband's mistreatment and emotional distance, leading to her tragic demise at the hands of the Baron's male creation."},{"question":"Definition: You will be asked how to do a certain task.

She was officially broke. She didn't have enough money to get on the subway, but she looked rich. She was a television producer, earned 900 a week, and had a closetful of designer labels like Gucci and Louis Vuitton. But she also had a 20,221.40 credit card bill and an empty bank account. Karyn decided that it was time for a change. She built a website and simply asked people to help her out by sending her a dollar or two. On the site, Karyn honestly explained her situation. \\"If 20,000 people gave me just 1, I'd be home free.\\" Amazingly, it worked. Her website was visited by more than a million people. Although most donors just gave a few dollars, one generous donor sent 1,000. She was on TV and in newspapers and magazines. She was offered a book deal and a movie contract. And of course, she was able to pay off her credit card debt. She also sold her designer clothes on eBay. In her closet, where the Gucci purse once sat, Karyn keeps all the letters that people have sent her. It's hard to understand why so many people helped a total stranger pay off her huge credit card bill. Karyn explains, \\"I was just honest about what happened; I didn't make up some sob story about saving the world.\\" Her donors think it's funny and original, and view it less as a charity than as an entertainment site. Imitators have appeared all over the Internet, some with extremely selfish requests for things like a BMW or a house. Actually, Karyn was not the first person to put up a website asking strangers for money. The practice has a name: \\"cyber-begging.\\" Most sites receive little traffic and even less cash.

Each home had a household shrine at which prayers and libations to the family's domestic deities were offered. Neighborhood shrines and sacred places such as springs and groves dotted the city. The Roman calendar was structured around religious observances. Women, slaves, and children all participated in a range of religious activities. Some public rituals could be conducted only by women, and women formed what is perhaps Rome's most famous priesthood, the state-supported Vestals, who tended Rome's sacred hearth for centuries, until disbanded under Christian domination.\\" Answer: Answer:","response":"Slaves were not offered to domestic deities."},{"question":"For each cell in Row 6 where you have an account enter the following formula: \\"=[Letter]2*[Letter]3/12\\" in the cell and hit the Enter key. For example, if you were going to enter the formula in B6, you would enter: \\"=B2*B3/12\\" and press the Enter key. Copy the formula in cell B6 and paste it into all other cells in Row 6 that have columns for accounts. Excel will automatically adjust the formula for any cells you copy/paste the formula into. You will have previously entered all the credit card information in columns C, D, E, etc., depending on how many credit cards you have. The copied formula will calculate the new data from each column automatically. The annual interest rate is divided by 12 to arrive at a monthly interest charge. For this example of a 1,000 balance at 18% annual interest, the formula will return a monthly interest charge of 15. Once you have entered your data and the formulas have been calculated, you will see how much you are paying in interest on each card and how much your minimum payment of principal is each month. It's important to note the proportion of your payment that is allocated to interest and the amount that is being used to reduce your principal. You want your monthly payments to reduce your principal amount as much as possible, which you can do with a lower interest rate. To pay down your credit cards as quickly as possible, transfer your balances to cards with a lower interest rate or a zero percent introductory rate. See elsewhere in this article for ways to do this. Create a formula using the \\"SUM\\" function. The syntax is \\"=SUM(B6:E6)\\" where E6 represents the last cell in row 6 that has a number.

Well, guess what? Some people from BBC Pop Up, a group who travels and tells us stories about different countries, went to India! This time, they tried to find out the answer to this cool question. So let's explore and learn together! India is a big country with lots of people and many ways to travel. In Delhi, a huge city in India, there are two popular ways to get around: by autorickshaw or by using Uber, an app where you can ask a driver to pick you up in their car. Autorickshaw, also known as auto, is like a small three-wheeled vehicle that can carry people from one place to another. It's very common on Indian roads, and it is super colorful! Now, back to the fun race. BBC Pop Up decided to see which one was faster: if they called an Uber driver or if they hopped onto an autorickshaw. They wanted to know which one could take people around Delhi quicker. To make it a fair competition, they started the race from the same place and at the same time. They also needed to go to the same destination, so nobody would have an advantage. During the race, the autorickshaw zoomed through the busy streets, weaving in and out of traffic. It was small and could fit into tight spaces that the car couldn't. On the other hand, the Uber car was very comfortable, and the driver could use a GPS to find the fastest route, which is a smart computer thing that shows the best way to go. The people watching the race were very excited and curious to see which one would win. After some time, they finally found the answer: it seemed that the autorickshaw was a little bit faster! Hurray for the autorickshaw! So kids, next time you or your family visit India, you know that taking an autorickshaw might actually be faster than calling an Uber car. Plus, it can be a fun and exciting adventure! Just remember that sometimes, finding the fastest way to get around a city might not always be in a big and fancy car. Sometimes, a small, colorful, and lively vehicle like an autorickshaw can do the trick too!

These components are derived from a person's blood, and each one serves a specific purpose in various types of tests and analyses. Whole Blood refers to the blood that is drawn directly from an individual's body. It is the unprocessed blood containing all of its components, such as red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, and plasma. Whole Blood is typically used in blood transfusions, certain diagnostic tests, and for certain research purposes. Serum is the liquid part of blood that remains after the clotting process has taken place, and the blood cells and clotting factors have been removed. Serum contains proteins, electrolytes, antibodies, antigens, and hormones, but it does not contain any blood cells. Serum is used in numerous diagnostic tests to determine the presence of various substances and to investigate the functioning of organs such as the liver, kidneys, and thyroid. Additionally, Serum is used in the development of vaccines and various therapeutic treatments. Plasma is the liquid component of blood in which the blood cells are suspended. It is a clear, straw-colored fluid and makes up around 55% of the total blood volume. Plasma contains water, proteins, electrolytes, glucose, clotting factors, hormones, and carbon dioxide. It plays a crucial role in supporting various bodily functions, including transporting nutrients, hormones, and proteins to the cells, as well as removing waste products from these cells. Plasma is used in therapies to treat certain medical conditions, such as autoimmune diseases, coagulation disorders, and immune deficiencies, and it is also utilized in research. In conclusion, Whole Blood, Serum, and Plasma are essential components of the blood that serve distinct and vital purposes in medical testing, diagnostics, and therapeutic treatments.

Removing the spaces between the words, the text now reads: 24andhegoeth,andalionfindethhimintheway,andputtethhimtodeath,andhiscarcaseiscastintheway,andtheassisstandingneartoit,andthelionisstandingnearthecarcase.25 However, let's discuss the context and meaning behind this verse while presenting you with a detailed and long answer to help you understand its significance. The verse is taken from 1 Kings, which is a part of the Hebrew Bible and the Christian Old Testament. This particular verse comes from a narrative about a prophet who was sent by God to deliver a message to King Jeroboam. The prophet is unnamed, often referred to simply as \\"the man of God.\\" In the story, God commands the prophet to travel to Bethel and denounce the idolatrous religious practices established by King Jeroboam. God gives the prophet specific instructions regarding his journey: he is not to eat bread nor drink water in the region, and he is not to return by the same route that he took to Bethel. After the prophet delivers God's message to Jeroboam, he leaves Bethel following God's directions. On his journey back, the prophet encounters an old prophet who lives in the area. The old prophet invites the man of God to his house for food and drink, lying that an angel had told him it was permissible. Initially, the man of God refuses the invitation, citing God's commandments. However, after the old prophet lies about receiving a message from an angel, he acquiesces and goes to the old prophet's house. While they are dining, God communicates with the man of God through the old prophet, rebuking him for disobedience and predicting his death. The verse in question, 1 Kings 13:24-25, describes the fulfillment of this prophecy: 24 - \\"and he goeth, and a lion findeth him in the way, and putteth him to death, and his carcase is cast in the way, and the ass is standing near it, and the lion is standing near the carcase.\\" 25 - (Verse numbering) The man of God leaves the old prophet's house, and on his way, he encounters a lion, which kills him. His body is left on the road, with both the lion and the donkey standing near it. This serves as evidence of God's judgment against the disobedience, which is especially significant for a prophet who had been tasked with delivering a message of divine judgment to others. The lesson conveyed by this narrative is the importance of obedience to God's commands, even when faced with the deception of others. The story also serves as a warning against the dire consequences that may arise from disobedience."},{"question":"Translate the following sentence to Russian: After years of taking a passive, low-profile approach to the epidemic, health officials have stepped up their anti-HIV campaign.","response":"После многих лет пассивного и неприметного подхода к эпидемии, чиновники в области здравоохранения активизировали свою кампанию против ВИЧ.

But some teachers think the changes are not all for the better. Eleanor Johnson, an English professor, thinks that text messaging has made students believe that it is far more acceptable than it actually is to just make terrible spelling and grammatical errors. And she says her students over the past several years have increasingly used less formal English in their writing. Words and phrases like \\"guy\\" and \\"you know\\" now appear in research papers. Professor Johnson supposes there is a strong relationship between the rise of informal online communication and an increase in writing mistakes. But she says there may not be much scientific information, at least not yet. David Crystal, a British linguist , says the actively changing nature of the Internet makes it difficult to keep up-to-date in studying its effects. But he believes its influence on language is small. The main effect of the Internet on language is the way it has added to the expressive richness of language, providing language with a new set of communicative tools that haven't existed in the past. Erin Jansen is founder of NetLingo.com, an online dictionary of the Internet and text messaging terms. She says the new technology has not changed existing language but has greatly added to its vocabulary. Basically it's freedom of expression. And what about those teachers who find these new kinds of mistakes in spelling and grammar in their students' work? What is her message to them? Erin Jansen said, \\"I am always on the students' side and won't get angry or upset about that. If it's helping the kids write more or communicate more, that's great. That's what teachers and educators want--to get kids communicating.\\" But Erin Jansen and David Crystal agree with Eleanor Johnson on at least one thing. Teachers need to make sure students understand the uses and rules of language. David Crystal and Erin Jansen share the view that the Internet _ .

Language, as a system of communication, varies greatly in terms of complexity, structure, and contextual implications. Each language has unique elements and characteristics that differentiate it from others, mirroring the cultural and historical traits of the languages' speakers. The development of language has evolved with the rise of human societies, enabling individuals to express their thoughts, feelings, and ideas. It has played a crucial role in the advancement of human civilization, as various languages have influenced one another over time. In the process, this has led to enriching and extending vocabulary, grammar, and syntax. Furthermore, languages consist of various components, including phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics, which all work together to convey meaning. Phonetics and phonology focus on the sounds and sound patterns of a language, while morphology and syntax deal with word formation and sentence structure. Semantics and pragmatics, on the other hand, explore the meaning and context of words, phrases, and sentences. A sentence is a fundamental element of language, and its primary purpose is to convey meaning by combining words in a structured form. Sentences can be simple or complex, but they all consist of a subject and a predicate. They may also include direct and indirect objects, depending on their needs and the language in question. In linguistics, a brief sentence is commonly referred to as a simple sentence, consisting of just one independent clause (subject and predicate) that conveys a complete thought. Although it is important to know how to create such concise expressions, it is also essential to consider the context in which these sentences are used. For instance, when attempting to communicate complex concepts or engage in an in-depth conversation, longer sentences comprising several clauses and conveying intricate ideas might be more appropriate. Adopting a diverse approach when constructing sentences will enable users to maintain a dynamic and engaging conversation style, navigating across different topics, and responding to varying interpersonal requirements effectively. In summary, as an AI language model, my purpose is to engage with your questions and provide detailed and informative answers that help you expand your understanding of language and its nuances. Language is versatile, and although brief sentences can fulfill specific communication purposes, expanding on ideas in greater depth is crucial for facilitating thorough conversations essential for personal and intellectual growth."},{"question":"Translate to Czech: The EESC points out that electronic communications are a service of general economic interest which, by definition, should be universally available and accessible at affordable prices.

So, when facing that challenge, it is important to know how to reach your weight-loss goal. Of course, you have to decide you want to lose weight and be committed to doing so; then, you must stick to your guns and stay motivated or the goal will never be realized. There is no magic bullet, but there are two important tips that can help you reach your weight-loss goal. #1 – Take It a Week at a Time You must break your ultimate goal into smaller chunks and have bench marks that will indicate you are moving in the right direction. According to the Mayo Clinic, “Over the long term, it’s best to aim for losing 1 to 2 pounds (0.5 to 1 kilogram) a week.” When you have a realistic weekly weight-loss target, you will be more confident in your efforts and you will know exactly what you are going to measure at the end of each week. Your long-term goal may be 40 pounds, but take it “one week at a time” (1 to 2 pounds/week = 20 to 30 weeks) In addition to choosing a healthy diet that fits your lifestyle and current health conditions, plus a solid commitment to stay with it, don’t forget to get plenty of rest and exercise. . BUT . . . the primary target should be the number of pounds you plan to lose each week. That target should be clear – and realistic.

How to measure your truck bed Measure your truck bed's length with the tailgate closed. Have a friend help you stretch a tape measure from the front left corner to the back left corner of your truck bed, on the inside. The tape measure should be running in a straight line that's even with the top of the bed (make sure it isn't sagging in the middle).","response":"Now that you have measured the length of your truck bed, it’s essential to get the complete dimensions to determine its capacity accurately. To do this, you will need to measure the width and height as well. Here is a step-by-step guide to help you measure the other dimensions of your truck bed: 1. Measuring the Width: First, you will need to measure the truck bed width from side to side. This measurement should be taken from the inside edges of the bed to ensure accuracy. To do this, follow these steps: a. Secure the starting point of your measuring tape to one of the inside edges of the truck bed. You can either hook the tape or have a friend hold the starting point. b. Stretch the tape measure horizontally across the truck bed, ensuring the tape is straight and parallel to the ground. c. Measure the distance to the other inside edge of the bed, at both the widest part near the cab and the narrowest part near the tailgate. This will account for any differences in width due to the wheel wells or bed design. d. Record these measurements as the maximum and minimum width of your truck bed. 2. Measuring the Height: The height of a truck bed, commonly referred to as the depth, is also an essential dimension to consider when calculating its overall capacity. To measure the height, follow these steps: a. Decide on a location where you want to measure the height of the truck bed. Ideally, this should be at least a couple of feet from either corner to help balance out any differences in bedliner or construction. b. Hold the measuring tape vertically at the chosen spot, with the starting point resting on the bed's floor inside. c. Stretch the tape measure upward until you reach the top edge of the truck bed. d. Record this measurement as the height of your truck bed. You may want to take a couple of additional height measurements at different locations along the bed, just to ensure accuracy and account for any variations in height due to bedliner or design. With the length, width, and height measurements of your truck bed in hand, you can now calculate its overall capacity. To do this, use the following formula: Truck Bed Capacity = Length × Width × Height Remember to use the appropriate width measurement depending on the specific area you want to calculate. For example, if you measured different widths due to wheel wells, you'll want to consider them when determining the available space for specific items. Finally, it's essential to compare your calculated capacity with the manufacturer's specifications for your specific make and model of truck to ensure that the measurements align and that you do not exceed the recommended payload limits. This information can typically be found in your owner's manual or on the manufacturer's website."},{"question":"Leo: Premise: \\"A pilot is bending down to assist a man that is crying.\\" Based on this premise, can we conclude that the hypothesis \\"A man crying after a flight.\\" is true?

Which Swiss painter who lived from 1879 to 1940 was responsible for works such as 'The Red Balloon' in 1922, 'Landscape with Yellow Birds' in 1923 and 'Around the Fish' in 1926?","response":"The Swiss painter who lived from 1879 to 1940, responsible for creating the works 'The Red Balloon' in 1922, 'Landscape with Yellow Birds' in 1923, and 'Around the Fish' in 1926 is Paul Klee. Born on December 18, 1879, in Münchenbuchsee near Bern, Switzerland, Klee was an influential figure in the world of art, particularly during the 20th century. He is well-known for his distinctive and unique style that blended elements of Expressionism, Surrealism, and Abstraction. Paul Klee's inclination towards art began during his early years, and he pursued his passion by studying at the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich from 1898 to 1901. He developed his personal style through experimenting with various mediums, including drawing, printmaking, and painting, working with watercolor, ink, and oil. Klee's first significant breakthrough came in 1911 when he was introduced to the group Der Blaue Reiter (The Blue Rider), a prominent and influential German expressionist group founded in Munich by Wassily Kandinsky and Franz Marc. During this time, Klee had the opportunity to work alongside other eminent artists like August Macke, Alexej von Jawlensky, and Gabriele Münter. Der Blaue Reiter's influence had a profound impact on Klee's artistic approach, enabling him to explore color theory and create deeply emotive compositions. Paul Klee's unique artistic style was marked by his inventive use of form, color, and symbolism. He was inspired by various art movements, including Cubism, Expressionism, and Surrealism, which often blended his work, creating powerful compositions that transcended the conventional boundaries of artistic genres. In 1922, Klee created 'The Red Balloon,' which features a harmonious blend of geometric shapes with vibrant colors dominating the foreground. This captivating image of a child holding a red balloon edges towards abstraction while maintaining a dreamlike quality that resonated with Klee's reputation for the spiritual in art. 'Landscape with Yellow Birds,' a painting created in 1923, further demonstrates Klee's exploration of color and form. Using delicate watercolor techniques and composition, he portrayed birds perched along the sweeping, multicolored lines representing the landscape, evoking a sense of harmony between nature and form, showcasing the artist's enchanting universe. 'Around the Fish,' which he painted in 1926, is another example of Paul Klee's unique blend of artistic styles. This piece incorporates geometric fish, natural elements, and various culinary objects all beautifully arranged in surreal, dreamlike composition rendered through a rich color palette that embodies Klee's mastery over color. After a prolific career, Paul Klee passed away on June 29, 1940.

How would you accomplish this goal? Pick your answer from: 1). Start by layout out your frame using 4 long strips of tape, your handsaw and a pencil; 2). Start by layout out your frame using 4 long strips of tape, your level and a pencil;","response":"2). Start by layout out your frame using 4 long strips of tape, your level and a pencil. To accomplish this goal, you should begin by using a level and a pencil to mark the points where you want your frame edges to be on the wall. This ensures that your frame will be straight and aligned properly. Then, use the electrical tape to create the four sides of the frame by connecting the marked points. The first option is incorrect because a handsaw isn't necessary for creating wall art with electrical tape. A handsaw is used for cutting wood or other materials, which is not involved in this task. The level is more important in this process because it helps ensure that the frame is straight and properly aligned."},{"question":"In 1989, filmmakers Joel and Ethan Coen began writing the script for a film eventually released as Miller's Crossing. The many threads of the story became complicated, and after four months they found themselves lost in the process. Although biographers and critics later referred to it as writer's block, the Coen brothers rejected this description. \\"It's not really the case that we were suffering from writer's block,\\" Joel said in a 1991 interview, \\"but our working speed had slowed, and we were eager to get a certain distance from Miller's Crossing.\\" They went from Los Angeles to New York and began work on a different project. In three weeks, the Coens wrote a script with a title role written specifically for actor John Turturro, with whom they'd been working on Miller's Crossing. The new film, Barton Fink, was set in a large, seemingly-abandoned hotel. This setting, which they named the Hotel Earle, was a driving force behind the story and mood of the new project. While filming their 1984 film Blood Simple in Austin, Texas, the Coens had seen a hotel which made a significant impression: \\"We thought, 'Wow, Motel Hell.' You know, being condemned to live in the weirdest hotel in the world.\\" The writing process for Barton Fink was smooth, they said, suggesting that the relief of being away from Miller's Crossing may have been a catalyst. They also felt satisfied with the overall shape of the story, which helped them move quickly through the composition. \\"Certain films come entirely in one's head; we just sort of burped out Barton Fink.\\" While writing, the Coens created a second leading role with another actor in mind: John Goodman, who had appeared in their 1987 comedy Raising Arizona. His new character, Charlie, was Barton's next-door neighbor in the cavernous hotel. Even before writing, the Coens knew how the story would end, and wrote Charlie's final speech at the start of the writing process. The script served its diversionary purpose, and the Coens put it aside: \\"Barton Fink sort of washed out our brain and we were able to go back and finish Miller's Crossing.\\" Once production of the first film was finished, the Coens began to recruit staff to film Barton Fink. Turturro looked forward to playing the lead role, and spent a month with the Coens in Los Angeles to coordinate views on the project: \\"I felt I could bring something more human to Barton. Joel and Ethan allowed me a certain contribution. I tried to go a little further than they expected.\\" As they designed detailed storyboards for Barton Fink, the Coens began looking for a new cinematographer, since their associate Barry Sonnenfeld - who had filmed their first three films - was occupied with his own directorial debut, The Addams Family. The Coens had been impressed with the work of English cinematographer Roger Deakins, particularly the interior scenes of the 1988 film Stormy Monday. After screening other films he had worked on (including Sid and Nancy and Pascali's Island), they sent a script to Deakins and invited him to join the project. His agent advised against working with the Coens, but Deakins met with them at a cafe in Notting Hill and they soon began working together on Barton Fink.

In fact, having a “parasitic twin” is the plot of Stephen King’s novel \\"The Dark Half\\" and an episode of \\"The X-Files.\\" But for one teenage boy in Malaysia, this isn’t a part of a fictional plot, this his reality. Mohd Zul Shahril Saidin, 15, was hospitalized for the last four months after he complained of stomach pain. It turned out the teen had been carrying his unborn twin inside him for 15 years, and he recently underwent surgery to remove the mass in what may be the first case of its kind in Malaysia, Fox News reported. “The fetus removed from my son's stomach was formed with organs like those of a baby -- only the nose and mouth were not complete,” said Hasmah Ahmad, the teen’s mother, according to The Mirror. This included an almost complete genitalia and hair. A teenage boy in Malaysia underwent surgery to have his unborn twin removed after 15 years. Christopher Furlong/Getty Images This condition, known as \\"fetus in fetu,\\" is rare, occurring about once in every 500,000 births. It was first described by German anatomist Johann Friedrich Meckel in the late 18th century and is characterized as having the presence of one of the twins in the body of the other. It's usually located in the retroperitoneal area — or the space between the membrane lining the cavity of the abdomen and the posterior abdominal wall. Some scientists have speculated this condition is a result of a teratoma,which is a tumor that may contain several types of body tissue, including muscle, teeth, and bone. However, Meckel has determined that the fetus in fetu condition is the result of an underdeveloped twin. The difference between a fetus in fetu and teratoma is that a fetus in fetu displays “evidence of body plan organization, such as having vertebrae, limb buds, or organ tissue,” Medical Daily previously reported. Saidin, who is the fifth of eight children, had an “oddly rounded shape tummy” since he was a year old, Malaysian Digest reported. However, it didn’t adversely affect him physically until he reached secondary school. His movements became more restricted due to his growing, protruding stomach. He was taken to the doctor once he started complaining of intense stomach pains. The teen and his family held a funeral for the fetus, and buried the remains in a cemetery. The last recorded case of fetus in fetu occurred in 2015, when a 45-year-old woman discovered that a 10-centimeter mass growing on her left ovary was her unborn twin. Similar to Saidin’s case, the mass also looked like an underdeveloped human with a partially formed face, an eye, a tooth, and long black hair. ||||| Since birth, a teenage boy in Malaysia has carried around the unborn fetus of his twin. Recently, the teen successfully underwent surgery to remove the mass, which is believed to be the first such case in the country, Central European News (CEN) reported. Mohd Zul Shahril Saidin, 15, is the fifth of eight children and a native of the town of Baling. He was only hospitalized within the last four months after complaining of pain, CEN reported. After the surgery, reports suggest the fetus had hair, legs, hands and genitals. “The fetus removed from my son’s stomach was formed with organs like those of a baby— only the nose and mouth were not complete,” Hasmah Ahmad, the teen’s mother, told CEN. The condition is known as “fetus in fetu,” a rare congenital anomaly in which a malformed and parasitic fetus is located in the body of its twin, according to the National Institutes of Health. The mass resided in Saidin’s abdomen. The phenomenon occurs in 1 in every 500,000 live births, CEN reported. The family has performed funeral rites on the fetus, which has been buried in a cemetery. ||||| Get daily updates directly to your inbox + Subscribe Thank you for subscribing!

It is estimated that the phenomenon occurs in 1 in every 500,000 live births. ||||| A teenage boy from Sungai Petani, Kedah has made history after a parasitic twin was found living in his tummy in what could be the first case of its kind in Malaysia. Sinar Harian reported that the boy, who prefers to only be known as Shahril underwent a surgery recently to remove the ‘mass’ from his body following persistent stomach aches and the worsening condition of his unusually rounded tummy. Doctors were shocked when a ‘creature’- a mass of tissue with lengthy hair, partially formed limbs and almost complete genitalia instead emerged from the young teen’s body. The rare condition is scientifically known as “foetus-in-fetu,” which occurs when one half of a twin forms in the body of the other, making this by far the first of its kind to be reported in Malaysia and only a handful of cases have been reported around the world. That parasitic twin has since been safely removed out of the 15-year-old who had a history of seeking medical attention since he was a year old for his oddly rounded shape tummy. Sharil has been an active child growing up, playing football and other sports like any other young boys his age without facing any complications. He also displayed a big appetite and at one point remarked, “I have to feed the baby in my stomach,” while downing food in large quantities. However, his physical movements became more restricted once he entered secondary school due to his ever growing protruding stomach, which has also made him became self-conscious of his appearance. After complaining of intense stomach pain last month he was eventually taken to the hospital where doctors finally caught on to the cause for his pain. Foetus-in-fetu is said to only occur in only 1 out of 500,000 births. The last recorded case of the condition was of a 36-year-old man in India back in 1999. - mD |||||","response":"There was once a teenage boy in Malaysia who had a very strange tummy.

The word \\"půlnoční\\" is the adjective form of \\"midnight\\" (půlnoc). \\"Toulavka\\" is a noun that is derived from the verb \\"toulat\\" (to roam), with the \\"-ka\\" suffix added, which means a female rambler. The male rambler would be \\"toulavý\\" or \\"toulavec\\" (in the context of a person). Finally, let's put these translated words together to form the Czech sentence: Tak, mluvím o půlnoční toulavce. In this translation, we used \\"Tak\\" as an informal interjection, \\"Jsem\\" followed by \\"mluvím\\" as a first-person verb, \\"o\\" to indicate \\"about,\\" and \\"půlnoční toulavce\\" to depict \\"midnight rambler\\"."},{"question":"Q:Information: - Jamie Principle is an American house music artist and producer born in Chicago , Illinois .

To break it down: 1. \\"Hace 3 meses\\" is Spanish for \\"3 months ago\\". In Spanish, \\"hace\\" is used to express the amount of time that has passed since an event occurred. This is different from English where we would typically put \\"ago\\" after the time phrase. For example, the English equivalent \\"3 months ago\\" has \\"ago\\" at the end, not the start. 2. \\"Chicago\\" remains the same in both languages as it is a proper noun, the name of a city in the United States. Importantly, in Spanish, the name of the cities, countries and other geographic names are pronounced in a way that is as close as possible to the language these belong to. 3. \\"Hombre\\" translates to \\"Male\\" in English. This is a category often used when sorting data or specifying personal information such as gender. Therefore, if this phrase was being used to label some data, perhaps on a demographic survey or a user profile, it would indicate that the information relates to a male individual who lived in Chicago 3 months ago or that the information was from 3 months ago from a male in Chicago. However, the exact meaning would depend on the larger context in which this phrase is being used."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Jesse shared Jordan's love of Harry Potter.

He used to work for company A. Bob noticed that company A is mostly financed by debt. Recently, he changed job and now working as a financial analyst for another company, company B. Company B has completely different culture than company A. Company B is mostly financed by equity. But I can use this background: The trade-off theory of capital structure is the idea that a company chooses how much debt finance and how much equity finance to use by balancing the costs and benefits. The classical version of the hypothesis goes back to Kraus and Litzenberger[1] who considered a balance between the dead-weight costs of bankruptcy and the tax saving benefits of debt. Often agency costs are also included in the balance. This theory is often set up as a competitor theory to the pecking order theory of capital structure. A review of the literature is provided by Frank and Goyal.[2] An important purpose of the theory is to explain the fact that corporations usually are financed partly with debt and partly with equity. It states that there is an advantage to financing with debt, the tax benefits of debt and there is a cost of financing with debt, the costs of financial distress including bankruptcy costs of debt and non-bankruptcy costs (e.g. staff leaving, suppliers demanding disadvantageous payment terms, bondholder/stockholder infighting, etc.). The marginal benefit of further increases in debt declines as debt increases, while the marginal cost increases, so that a firm that is optimizing its overall value will focus on this trade-off when choosing how much debt and equity to use for financing. What is an answer for this question: Would company B have or not have tax benefits of debt?","response":"Company B, which is mostly financed by equity, would not have as much tax benefits of debt compared to a company that is mostly financed by debt, like Company A. The tax benefits of debt come from the fact that interest payments on debt are tax-deductible, which reduces a company's taxable income. Since Company B has a lower amount of debt in its capital structure, the tax benefits it receives from debt would be smaller compared to a company with a higher proportion of debt financing."},{"question":"Answer the following question: \\"Acrotemnus\\", given a list of categories: company, educational institution, artist, athlete, office holder, mean of transportation, building, natural place, village, animal, plant, album, film or written work, what category does the title belong to?

Which of the following two sentences does not make sense? Options: - Sentence A: \\"He zipped up his hamster.\\" - Sentence B: \\"He zipped up his jacket.\\" If the answer is 'Sentence A'; explain the reasoning:","response":"The answer is 'Sentence A.' Reasoning: - Sentence A: \\"He zipped up his hamster.\\" - Sentence B: \\"He zipped up his jacket.\\" In Sentence A, the action \\"zipped up\\" is applied to a hamster, which is a small animal. It does not make sense to zip up a live creature, as zippers are typically associated with clothing and bags. The combination of the verb \\"to zip\\" and a hamster as the object is not logical. In Sentence B, the phrase \\"zipped up\\" is used in conjunction with a jacket, which is a piece of clothing. Jackets often have zippers, so the action of zipping up a jacket is a logical and coherent statement. Therefore, Sentence A does not make sense because the action \\"zipping up\\" is not appropriate for the object \\"hamster\\", while Sentence B makes perfect sense."},{"question":"Denny asked: If \\"A little girl is watering the plants using a water hose.\\" does that mean that \\"A girl picking fruit.\\"?

Only 14 per cent see officers on daily basis. Results in spite of PCSO 'Blunkett bobbies' introduced to boost police visibility. Article:","response":"Title: Home Office Survey Reveals Decline in Police Visibility Despite PCSO Initiation Introduction In a recent Home Office survey involving 50,000 participants, it was revealed that only 14 per cent of the respondents claimed to see police officers on a daily basis. This comes as a cause for concern, considering the introduction of the Police Community Support Officer (PCSO) scheme, known as 'Blunkett bobbies,' which aimed to boost police visibility on the streets. This article explores the factors underlying this development and its potential implications for public safety as well as trust in law enforcement agencies. Background: The Introduction of PCSOs In the early 2000s, the British government introduced the PCSO initiative, also known as 'Blunkett bobbies,' named after David Blunkett, the then Home Secretary. The main goal of this scheme was to enhance police visibility and presence within neighborhoods across the country, thereby promoting public safety and fostering trust between the police and the communities they serve. Over the years, thousands of PCSOs have been employed to work alongside traditional police officers in various jurisdictions. The Home Office Survey Findings According to the recent study commissioned by the Home Office, only a fraction of respondents (14%) reported seeing police officers on a daily basis. Considering the goals of the PCSO initiative, these findings have raised multiple questions and concerns among citizens and law enforcement agencies. Several factors might have contributed to this decline in police visibility. The most obvious one is the significant reduction in the overall number of frontline police officers across the country in the past decade. This decline has put pressure on the remaining officers, forcing them to focus on attending to more critical incidents and investigations, leaving less time for regular patrols or public engagement. Another factor affecting police visibility might be the shift in policing strategies in recent years with the emergence of new technologies. Many law enforcement agencies are adopting data-driven and intelligence-led policing models, which focus on identifying and addressing the root causes of criminal activities. This approach might limit the physical presence of officers on the streets since they spend more time analyzing information and identifying trends. Implications of Reduced Police Visibility Decreased visibility of police officers has multiple consequences for both the public and the law enforcement agencies. Firstly, it can negatively impact the community's perception of police effectiveness and trust in their ability to maintain public safety. A diminishing police presence on the streets might create the impression that crime levels are on the rise, increasing fear among citizens, and potentially leading to a decline in public confidence in the police department. Secondly, reduced police visibility might hamper the flow of information from the public to the police. When officers are regularly seen walking the beat or patrolling neighborhoods in their vehicles, community members are more likely to approach them with useful information, which can be vital in preventing or solving crimes. This interaction between the police and the public can be an invaluable tool that might be hindered by decreased police presence. Conclusion The findings of the Home Office survey point out an alarming reduction in police visibility, despite the implementation of the PCSO initiative. This development calls for a critical evaluation of the policing strategies and resource allocation to ensure that communities continue to benefit from an accessible, present, and effective police force. Law enforcement agencies should explore innovative ways to maintain and enhance their visibility through the use of technology, such as deploying CCTV cameras, utilizing social media to engage with the public, and investing in community policing programs that build trust and collaboration. These efforts will be crucial to restoring public confidence and ensuring safety in our neighborhoods."},{"question":"Given the question: - Rain picks up carbon dioxide as it falls to earth - The rain falls on the soil over the limestone - The carbon dioxide in the rain washes through the soil - The carbon dioxide turns into acid - The acid in the rain gets to the limestone below the soil - The acid dissolves the limestone - Acid continues to erode the limestone with more rain over time - The eroded limestone sometimes forms caves. What might be the first step of the process? The answer is:","response":"The first step of the process is the rain picking up carbon dioxide as it falls to earth. When rain forms in the atmosphere, it interacts with various gases, including carbon dioxide. In this interaction, carbon dioxide gets dissolved in the rainwater and forms a weak carbonic acid (H2CO3). This weak acid is what gives the rain its mildly acidic nature. Carbon dioxide is a naturally occurring greenhouse gas in the atmosphere, and its concentration has been significantly increasing due to various human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation. Consequently, the amount of carbon dioxide being dissolved in the rainwater has also increased, leading to a mild increase in the acidity of rain. This phenomenon, commonly known as \\"acid rain,\\" has various environmental implications, including the weathering and erosion of limestone rocks. As rainwater carrying dissolved carbon dioxide makes its way through soil and reaches the underlying limestone rock, the dissolved carbonic acid reacts with calcium carbonate (CaCO3), which is the primary mineral constituent of limestone. This reaction results in the dissolution and subsequent erosion of the limestone rock. Over time, the continuous erosion of limestone by acid rain leads to the formation of various geological features, such as caves, sinkholes, and underground drainage systems. In conclusion, the first step in the process of limestone erosion due to acid rain is the formation of carbonic acid in rainwater, which occurs when rain picks up carbon dioxide as it falls to the earth. This weak acid then initiates the chain of events leading to the erosion of limestone rocks and the eventual formation of caves and other unique geological features."},{"question":"Data: name = Clowns, eatType = coffee shop, food = Fast food, customer rating = 5 out of 5, area = riverside, near = Clare Hall.

Alexia and Ermias are inflating balls, with Alexia inflating 20 balls and Ermias inflating 5 more balls than Alexia. Calculate the total time in minutes they took to inflate all the soccer balls. Thoughts? Step-by-step reasoning:","response":"Step 1: Find the total number of balls Ermias inflates. Ermias inflates 5 more balls than Alexia, so we can write that as: Ermias's balls = Alexia's balls + 5 Since we know that Alexia inflates 20 balls, we can plug that value into the equation: Ermias's balls = 20 + 5 = 25 balls So, Ermias inflates 25 balls. Step 2: Calculate the total number of balls both Alexia and Ermias inflate. Total balls = Alexia's balls + Ermias's balls Total balls = 20 + 25 Total balls = 45 balls Step 3: Calculate the total time taken to inflate all the soccer balls. Since it takes 20 minutes to inflate a single soccer ball, we need to multiply the total number of balls by the time taken to inflate a single ball: Total time = Total balls × Time to inflate one ball Total time = 45 balls × 20 minutes/ball Total time = 900 minutes So, the total time taken to inflate all the soccer balls is 900 minutes."},{"question":"Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: the brain is what Context: The brain is an organ that serves as the center of the nervous system in all vertebrate and most invertebrate animals. Only a few invertebrates such as sponges, jellyfish, adult sea squirts and starfish do not have a brain; diffuse or localised nerve nets are present instead. The brain is located in the head, usually close to the primary sensory organs for such senses as vision, hearing, balance, taste, and smell. The brain is the most complex organ in a vertebrate's body. In a typical human, the cerebral cortex (the largest part) is estimated to contain 15–33 billion neurons, each connected by synapses to several thousand other neurons. These neurons communicate with one another by means of long protoplasmic fibers called axons, which carry trains of signal pulses called action potentials to distant parts of the brain or body targeting specific recipient cells.

New calls for protests went out in Algeria , Bahrain and Libya . From festive scenes of just days ago, the revolt has become more martial, as exhausted men defend what they describe as the perimeter of a free Egypt around Tahrir Square. Their demands have grown more forceful and the uprising more radical. After pitched clashes of two days that left at least seven dead and hundreds wounded, banners in Tahrir Square declared Mr. Mubarak “a war criminal,” and several in the crowd said that the president should be executed. Major television networks were largely unable to broadcast from the square on Thursday. The United States joined a chorus of criticism, with Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton saying, “We condemn in the strongest terms attacks on peaceful demonstrators, human rights activists, foreigners and diplomats.” The government’s strategy seems motivated at turning broader opinion in the country against the protests and perhaps wearing down the demonstrators themselves, some of whom seemed exhausted by the clashes. Vice President Omar Suleiman , appointed Saturday to a position that Mr. Mubarak had until then refused to fill, appealed to Egypt’s sense of decency in allowing Mr. Mubarak to serve out his term, and he chronicled the mounting losses that, he said, the uprising had inflicted on a crippled Egyptian economy. “End your sit-in,” he said. “Your demands have been answered.” Mr. Mubarak said in an interview with ABC that he was eager to step down but if he did, “Egypt would sink into chaos.” In interviews and statements, the government has increasingly spread an image that foreigners were inciting the uprising, a refrain echoed in the streets. The suggestions are part of a days-long Egyptian media campaign that has portrayed the protesters as troublemakers and ignored the scope of an uprising with diffuse goals and leadership. “Millions turn out to support Mubarak,” read the banner headline on Thursday on the front page of Al Ahram, the leading government newspaper.

Al Jazeera , the influential Arabic channel, said government supporters stormed the Hilton Hotel in Cairo , searching for journalists, and two of its reporters were attacked. A Greek journalist was stabbed with a screwdriver and others were beaten and harassed. Police also raided the Hisham Mubarak Law Center, a headquarters for many of the international human rights organizations working in Egypt. The human rights workers were told to lie on the floor and the chips were removed from the telephones, someone present in the building said, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution. As the day wore on, tension descended across parts of the city, which is still guarded by popular committees that banded together after the police withdrew Saturday. Government supporters roamed parts of the downtown, itching for a fight, and looters set fire to a shopping mall along the Nile that was already looted and burned Friday. The menace was a counterpoint to Tahrir Square, where the literati and well-off demonstrators mixed with the poorest of rough-and-tumble neighborhoods in scenes of camaraderie and determination that have made the square an emblem of the revolt. Protesters flashed V-for-victory signs at dawn, celebrating their success in holding the square and even pushing the barricades forward in clashes that dragged through the night. Protesters accused government supporters of trying to block them from delivering supplies to the square, but boxes of water, bananas, yogurt and medicine still made it in. The Internet was working. Volunteers swept the streets, pushing piles of rocks to the curb that looked like bluffs of snow. Doctors staffed first-aid clinics, near graffiti that read, “We are writing the history of a free Egypt,” and men frisked people entering for weapons. “Don’t incite them!” shouted Mahmoud Haqiqi, holding aloft a sign that read, “No to shedding of blood.” But even those who lamented the turn to violence blamed Mr. Mubarak’s supporters for provoking them and vowed not to relinquish the square. “Right now, it’s all here, protecting Tahrir Square,” said Hisham Kassem, a veteran activist and publisher, who kept a wary eye on barricades built with corrugated tin, wrecked cars and trucks, barrels, buckets filed with sand and metal railing torn from the curb. “We keep it tonight, and tomorrow the whole country is going to come out.” He surveyed the crowd and shook his head. “I can’t face the idea of this failing.” For days, the government seemed to stagger at the scale of an uprising that overwhelmed Egypt’s once ubiquitous security forces on Friday. The concessions on Thursday marked its most concerted attempt to address at least some of the longstanding demands in a country that many believe has stagnated under Mr. Mubarak’s rule. The newly appointed prime minister, Ahmed Shafiq, apologized for the violence and vowed to investigate who instigated it. Mr. Suleiman followed with a lengthy television interview in which he recognized what he described as “the revolution of the youth.” Mr. Suleiman sought to project an image of good will, offering dialogue with the Muslim Brotherhood, which remains banned, even though it is the country’s most influential opposition group. In a sign of the new landscape, Mr. Suleiman referred to it by name rather than the government’s usual coded language, though he and Mr. Mubarak have both suggested it was behind the revolt. Its followers have played a forceful role in the protests, but its leaders have, so far, tried to remain in the background. Advertisement Continue reading the main story “We have contacted the Muslim Brotherhood and invited them, but they are still hesitant about the dialogue,” he said. “I think that their interest is to attend the dialogue.” Other concessions came from Egypt’s public prosecutor, who issued a travel ban on former government ministers and an official of the ruling National Democratic Party on suspicion of theft of public money, profiteering and fraud, state television reported. Among the four was the hated former interior minister, Habib el-Adly, who commanded a police force that was widely despised for its corruption and routine use of torture. So far, the government’s concessions have done little to diminish the protests, but the relentless message of officials that Egypt faced chaos seemed, at least anecdotally, to be finding an audience. ||||| As the situation intensifies in Egypt, journalists are increasingly targeted [AFP] Journalists in Egypt – domestic and foreign – are increasingly under siege, with Egyptian authorities detaining reporters and gangs of young men roaming the streets looking for anyone with camera equipment. Some of the pressure has come from the government: Six Al Jazeera journalists were detained for several hours earlier this week, and while they were eventually released, their equipment remains with the police. Earlier on Thursday concerns were raised as another three reporters went missing. They have now returned, safe and well, to their hotel. Two New York Times reporters were reportedly arrested – or \\"taken into protective custody\\", as the government termed it. 'Israeli spy' rumours Spotters stand outside many hotels, watching balconies with high-powered binoculars. When they see balconies with camera equipment or photographers, they use radios to call in the details. Egyptian police sources say that information from those spotters has been used to conduct several raids on journalists' hotel rooms in recent days. And the government has reportedly pressured several hotels not to extend the reservations of foreign journalists. But most of the intimidation and violence has come from unofficial sources: Young men loiter outside the hotels where many reporters are staying, shouting at (and sometimes attacking) anyone with equipment. Hotel lobbies are filled with journalists and camera crews wearing bandages, and many have been restricted to watching the events in Tahrir Square from their hotel balconies. Click here for more on Al Jazeera's special coverage Egyptian state television has actively tried to foment the unrest by reporting that \\"Israeli spies\\" have infiltrated the city – which explains why many of the gangs who attack reporters shout \\"yehudi!\\" (\\"Jew!\\"). The area around Tahrir Square has become a virtual no-go zone for camera crews, which were assaulted on Wednesday almost as soon as they entered the area controlled by supporters of Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak. Several of them were mistaken for Al Jazeera crews, and were chased off by young men wielding sticks and chanting, \\"Jazeera! Jazeera!\\". CNN anchor Anderson Cooper said his crew was also assaulted on Tuesday night after being mistaken for an Al Jazeera crew. A reporter for the Al Arabiya network was kidnapped for several hours during Wednesday’s protest. The violence has come exclusively from the Mubarak supporters: There have been no reports of pro-democracy demonstrators attacking or intimidating the media. Egyptian journalists, too, have been the victims of angry mobs, all of them affiliated with the pro-Mubarak crowd. Sarah El Sirgany, an editor with the Daily News Egypt, tweeted that her brother was assaulted while trying to protect a group of reporters attacked by an angry mob. An Al Jazeera reporter was held at knifepoint by a group of young men on Thursday morning. One man’s face was still bloodied from the previous night’s fighting. Bloggers, too, have become targets: The popular Egyptian blogger Sandmonkey has reportedly been arrested (it's unclear by who). International condemnation The United States and Britain have condemned what they call the intimidation of foreign journalists reporting on events in Egypt. Robert Gibbs, White House spokesman, called for the release of any journalist who had been detained in the country and said acts to intimidate the media were \\"completely and totally unacceptable\\". PJ Crowley, state department spokesman, added: \\"There is a concerted campaign to intimidate international journalists in Cairo and interfere with their reporting. We condemn such actions.\\" Britain's foreign minister also said the intimidation and harassment of journalists was \\"unacceptable and disturbing\\". The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists called the attacks on journalists an attempt at \\"blanket censorship\\" by the government, and listed a number of reported assaults against Egyptian, Arabic and international media. ||||| Write a summary.","response":"The uprising in Egypt has captivated the attention of the Arab world, with the revolt growing increasingly radical. Banners in Tahrir Square have declared President Mubarak a war criminal, and some protesters have called for his execution. The Egyptian government's strategy has aimed at turning public opinion against the protests, attempting to portray the demonstrators as troublemakers with foreign influence. Meanwhile, journalists in Egypt face increasing pressure, with some being attacked or arrested, as well as having equipment confiscated. The United States and other countries condemn the attacks on peaceful demonstrators, human rights activists, foreigners, and diplomats. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said, \\"We condemn in the strongest terms attacks on peaceful demonstrators, human rights activists, foreigners and diplomats.\\" Egypt's government continues to make concessions, but protesters remain undeterred. The government has been making attempts to engage in dialogue with the Muslim Brotherhood, the country's most influential opposition group. Despite international condemnation, the situation is not showing signs of resolution, and the message that Egypt faces chaos if the protests continue is gaining traction among some of the population."},{"question":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

UPDATED:. 07:57 EST, 2 November 2013. A pet rabbit has apparently become the latest victim of false widow spiders. Only hours earlier one-year-old Molly had been hopping happily around the garden. But she was found dead in her hutch after it was infested by the poisonous creatures. Recently false widow spiders have put several people in hospital after biting them and even caused a school to be closed temporarily. Victim: The body of the pet rabbit, called Molly, was found next to a spider's web with five false widows crawling around. Molly’s owner Samantha Davies found her dead when she went to feed her two rabbits, Molly and Milly. When the 21-year-old removed Molly’s body, she found a hammock-shaped web and up to five spiders scuttling around the hutch. After using the internet to identify them as false widows, Miss Davies became worried for the safety of her 18-month-old daughter, Rosie. She contacted her local environmental health department in the hope of having her home treated for infestation. Her request was declined, but an officer told her he was 98 per cent certain the spider was responsible for Molly’s death. Yesterday Miss Davies, a kitchen assistant, said: ‘We couldn’t believe it when we saw the spiders. I was really upset when Molly died. Devastated: Samantha Davies, 21, pictured with her 18-month-old daughter Rosie and partner Scott Barnes, was told by an environmental health officer he was 98 per cent certain the pet's death was caused by the spiders. ‘I really didn’t want the spiders around my daughter. We asked environmental health if they could help us, but they refused. ‘If it had been a rat, they would have done something, but not with poisonous spiders.’ Miss Davies, who lives with her partner Scott Barnes and their daughter in Mountain Ash, South Wales, has since disinfected the hutch where Milly still lives, and killed the spiders she found last weekend. Venomous: The false widow spider has caused a school to be closed and has left people with horrific injuries after the attack in recent weeks. The false widow is the most dangerous of the 12 species of biting spider known to be in Britain and cases of people being bitten by the venomous creature have been on the rise. John Catlin, 66, from Bromley, Kent, is still recovering a year after a bite that caused his organs to start shutting down. Bodybuilder Gary Meadows from Teesville, Middlesbrough, required a skin graft when he was bitten in 2011 and has suffered severe reactions to any insect bite since. Layla Benton, 14, was off school for three weeks after her knee swelled up when she was bitten in her bathroom in Basildon, Essex. And last month Dean Academy in Lydney, Gloucestershire, had to close its doors to pupils after the dangerous spiders were found there. The spiders are shiny and black with distinctive cream markings on the abdomen that resemble a horseshoe – or, to some eyes, a skull. They have long, spindly legs and are easily confused with the black widow, a far more venomous cousin not found in Britain. As with most species of spider, it is the female false widow which is the force to be reckoned with. Males tend not to grow much bigger than two centimetres, while females reach up to three centimetres. The first false widow is thought to have come to Britain from the Canary Islands or Madeira in the 1870s in a bunch of bananas. The first recorded sighting was in Torquay, Devon, in 1879.

Forced to move back to her hometown in New England (the fictional Mainhead), Gloria reunites with her childhood friend Oscar, who now runs his late father's bar. Oscar is warm and welcoming to Gloria; he brings her an old television set for her unfurnished house and offers her a job at the bar to help her, which Gloria accepts. Working at the bar aggravates Gloria's alcohol problem. Each shift, she hangs out and drinks until morning with Oscar and his friends, Garth and Joel, while sleeping it off on a bench near a children's playground. At the same time, a giant reptilian monster appears in Seoul, leaving death and destruction in its wake. Gradually, Gloria realizes that when she walks through the playground at exactly 8:05 am, she causes the monster to manifest and is able to remotely control the monster's movements, which mirror her own. Gloria reveals her secret to Oscar and his friends; however, when Oscar steps onto the playground, he causes a giant robot to appear in Seoul. Gloria ultimately tries to make amends by having the monster spell out an apology in Korean, to the delight of the South Koreans and the media, and begins to avoid both the playground and alcohol. After spending the night with Joel, Gloria discovers that a drunken Oscar is using the robot to taunt South Korea. After a tense confrontation, Gloria manages to make him leave. Oscar is jealous, believing that something happened between Gloria and Joel. Later that night at the bar, he drunkenly insults his friends and demands that Gloria drinks, then orders her to do so by threatening to return to the playground if she does not.

This is because the premise does not provide us with enough information to determine the validity of the hypothesis. Let's analyze both the premise and the hypothesis in detail. Premise: Wedding couple posing in front of a water fountain The premise tells us that there is a wedding couple posing for photos or simply enjoying the moment in front of a water fountain. Nowhere in the premise does it indicate that the water fountain is secluded, public, or private. Nor does the premise provide any context to the possibility of people being around the area. Hypothesis: No one is by the water fountain. The hypothesis states that there are no people present by the water fountain. By referring to 'no one,' it could be inferred that there is not a single other person around, which means the wedding couple would be completely alone in front of the water fountain. To conclude the hypothesis as true based solely on the premise, we would have to assume that the wedding couple is the only ones present in the area around the water fountain. However, this assumption is unfounded considering the information provided by the premise. It is possible that there are spectators, wedding guests, photographers, or other people in proximity to the water fountain.

Their sound is hard rock mixed with blues rock influences, with songs including \\"Bad Boy for Love\\", \\"Rock 'n' Roll Outlaw\\", \\"Nice Boys\\", \\"We Can't Be Beaten\\" and \\"Scarred for Life\\". Their first four albums were produced by Harry Vanda and George Young who also worked with AC/DC. They disbanded in 1987, subsequently reforming briefly in 1993 to support Guns N' Roses on an Australian tour. Context: One-time Buster Brown bass guitarist Geordie Leach was recruited to record their self-titled debut LP, Rose Tattoo, which reached the top 40 on the Australian Kent Music Report Albums Chart in November 1978. The album, produced by Vanda & Young, was released in some markets as Rock N' Roll Outlaw after their second single, \\"Rock N' Roll Outlaw\\" which did not reach the top 50. Leach left the band in May 1979 to be replaced in October by guitarist Lobby Loyde filling in on bass (Coloured Balls, Purple Hearts, Wild Cherries). During his brief tenure, they recorded \\"Legalise Realise\\" which was released as an independent single in March 1980, backed with the track \\"Bong on Aussie\\" by country singer Colin Paterson, to publicise a campaign to legalise marijuana. Later in 1980, they toured the United States and then toured Europe (including UK), but by September Loyde had left and Leach had returned. Early in 1981, \\"Rock N' Roll Outlaw\\" started to chart in Europe, peaking at No. 2 in France, No. 5 in Germany and No. 60 in UK. The line up of Anderson, Cocks, Leach, Royall and Wells toured Europe from April. Three years after their debut the band issued the follow-up album, Assault and Battery in September, which reached the top 30 in Australia. Both Rock N' Roll Outlaw and Assault and Battery peaked at No. 1 on the UK heavy metal albums chart. Rose Tattoo's 1981 tour of Europe included an appearance at the Reading Festival, where Anderson repeatedly head butted the amp stacks until his scalp started bleeding. They were hailed as the loudest band to play London's Marquee Club since Led Zeppelin. Returning to Australia, the band began work on their third album; with new guitarist Robin Riley replacing Cocks, who went on to join Heaven, they issued Scarred for Life in 1982, subsequently touring the US in support of Aerosmith and ZZ Top. The band's US visit was not a major success but proved to be influential on the underground sleaze metal scene in Los Angeles, with bands such as Guns N' Roses which later cited Rose Tattoo as a favourite and recorded a cover of \\"Nice Boys\\" on Live ?!*@ Like a Suicide in 1986. Question: Are there other band members?. Whats the answer?","response":"Yes, there have been other members in Rose Tattoo throughout the years since their formation in 1976. As with many bands, the lineup has experienced several changes in various positions. The original lineup of Rose Tattoo consisted of Angry Anderson on vocals, Peter Wells on slide guitar, Mick Cocks on guitar, Ian Rilen on bass, and Dallas 'Digger' Royall on drums. However, due to various reasons such as personal issues, departures to join other bands, passing away, or internal conflicts, some of the original members left the band. Some other notable members in Rose Tattoo's history include: 1. Geordie Leach - He joined the band in 1978 as a bass guitarist, replacing Ian Rilen. He left the band for a brief period in 1979, but later returned. His tenure with the band was on and off. 2. Lobby Loyde - He filled in as a bass guitarist for a short period in 1979-1980 during Geordie Leach's absence. 3. Robin Riley - He replaced Mick Cocks as the guitarist in 1982. 4. Dai Pritchard - He joined the band as a slide guitarist in 2004, taking over for Pete Wells, who passed away in 2006. Apart from these, there have been other musicians who have joined the band for short periods or replacement roles. Some of these members are Andy Cichon (bass), Scott Johnston (drums), Paul DeMarco (drums), Mick O'Shea (drums), Steve King (bass), and Mark Evans (bass). To summarize, Rose Tattoo has had multiple members throughout its history, covering various roles such as guitarists, bassists, and drummers. The band has experienced lineup changes, but its core sound and style have always been maintained by the lead singer, Angry Anderson, and the band's signature hard rock and blues rock influences."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: His long walk home wasn't over, he lived on the tenth storey of a walk up what? Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options: - skyscraper - book of stories - tall building - apartment building - mall Answer:","response":"The most suitable option to answer the question \\"His long walk home wasn't over, he lived on the tenth storey of a walk up what?\\" is \\"apartment building.\\" An apartment building is a multi-unit residential structure, where individual units are separated into various apartment homes or residences. These buildings can range from just a few storeys to tall structures that accommodate dozens of families. The other options provided are not as appropriate for the given question: - Skyscraper: Although a skyscraper is a tall building, it typically serves various purposes and is not solely residential. It may contain commercial spaces, offices, and other mixed uses. Therefore, the specific context of a person living on the tenth storey does not directly point to a skyscraper as the most appropriate option. - Book of stories: A book of stories is a work of literature, not a place where someone could live or have a residence. Thus, it is unrelated to the context of the question. - Tall building: While this option is not entirely wrong, it is too broad and does not specifically cater to the residential aspect of the context. Apartment buildings, on the other hand, are designed specifically for residential purposes. - Mall: A mall is a commercial structure that primarily serves as a shopping center. Although some malls may include residential units, this is not their primary function, and it is much less likely for someone to have their home on the tenth storey of a mall. Therefore, considering the specific context of someone living on the tenth storey of a walk-up building, an \\"apartment building\\" is the most suitable and relevant answer. These residential structures are designed and built to house multiple residents, and it is common to find people living on various storeys in an apartment building."},{"question":"Information: - Agira (Sicilian: \\"Aggira\\") is a town and \\"comune\\" in the province of Enna, Sicily (southern Italy).

Though it sounds a little nuts, a court in Madrid has ruled that 54-year-old Maria Angeles Duran has the right to have her case heard, reports the International Business Times. The court won't rule on the larger issue of whether Duran's claim of ownership is legit, but on the narrower one of whether she violated eBay's seller agreement. She had been selling parcels of about 11 square feet for about 1 each and had racked up 600 orders before eBay shut her down. Because nothing tangible was sold, it feared a scam. Duran says she was never able to collect her money and is suing for about 11,000 in damages, reports the Consumerist. “I am not a stupid person and I know the law,” Duran has said of her solar real estate gambit. She's basing her claim on a loophole in the UN's Outer Space Treaty that says no nation can stake ownership to a heavenly body but makes no mention of individuals—borrowing the strategy used by this entrepreneur's claim on the moon. Duran, as you might imagine, is an eclectic character, observes the Washington Post. \\"She’s studied nursing and law, dreamt up her own religion, and penned a kinky romance novel,\\" writes Caitlin Dewey. The story notes that Duran is framing her sun fight as a statement against the corporate world and promises that any profits will go to charity. For those who want in, Duran is still selling parcels on her own website. (Or check out eBay's haunted dolls.)","response":"Once upon a time, there was a 54-year-old woman named Maria Angeles Duran who believed she owned the sun. Yes, that's right, the big, bright ball of fire in the sky! She decided to sell pieces of the sun for 1 each on a website named eBay, which is a giant online marketplace. Maria was able to sell 600 orders of her sun pieces before eBay stopped her. They were worried that since she wasn't selling something you could touch or hold (like a toy or a book), it might be a scam. A scam is when someone tricks you to take your money without giving you what you paid for. Maria was very upset and wanted her money. She claims to know the law very well and found a special gap in the rules that allowed her to sell the sun. So, she took eBay to court in Spain, where kind judges said her case could be heard. Maria is quite an interesting person. She has studied nursing and law, created her own religion, and even written a romantic novel. She wants to fight the big companies and promises that the money she gets from selling the sun will go to charity. Now, Maria has built her own website to sell pieces of the sun.

However, I have been thoroughly disappointed with my experience so far. First and foremost, the app's functionality has been utterly confusing. It seems like it's meant to handle some services for other Google apps, but it's not directly usable for any of its features. I don't even understand why it needs to be a separate app in the first place. Furthermore, I have noticed a significant decline in overall performance ever since I installed this app, with my device lagging more frequently and consuming more battery. That alone makes it a nuisance. Moreover, there's no proper documentation or support available for users who are looking for guidance. The lack of tutorial or help section makes the user feel completely lost and stranded. This ultimately leads to a terrible user experience, especially for those who aren't tech-savvy and need assistance with their apps. Lastly, the app seems to be pushing unnecessary and intrusive app permissions, which raises some privacy concerns. Why does this app need access to some sensitive information when it doesn't even provide any direct features or services? It was highly disappointing to see Google, a company that I previously held in high regard, developing an app that is anything but user-friendly and confusing. In conclusion, I cannot recommend the com.google.android.gms app, as it has been nothing but a confusing, frustrating, and disappointing experience.

During this time the climate was a mixture of two different seasons , a dry season and a shorter rainy season . The climate during this period was a mixture of two different seasons , a rainy season and a shorter dry season .","response":"While these two sentences may seem similar at first glance, they do not convey the same meaning. The main difference between them lies in which season is described as shorter, which alters the overall understanding of the climate during the specified time period. In the first sentence: \\"During this time the climate was a mixture of two different seasons, a dry season and a shorter rainy season.\\" This conveys that the climate consisted of two seasons: a dry season of a standard length and a rainy season that was shorter in comparison to the dry season. The focus is on the dry season being longer and a significant portion of the time. Consequently, someone reading or hearing this sentence would likely get the impression that this area or time period had an overall dry and arid climate, with some periods of rainfall. In the second sentence: \\"The climate during this period was a mixture of two different seasons, a rainy season and a shorter dry season.\\" This sentence indicates that the climate consisted of two seasons as well, but here the rainy season is of standard length, and the dry season is shorter in comparison. The focus shifts to the rainy season being longer and taking up a significant portion of the time. As a result, readers or listeners would likely interpret this climate as predominantly wet or humid, with occasional dry periods. Considering the main difference is which season is shorter, the two sentences express different information about the prevalent climate during the mentioned time. The first sentence indicates a more arid climate with a shorter rainy season, while the second sentence suggests a moister climate with a shorter dry season."},{"question":"What is the sentiment of the following review?

The early release is part of Obama's effort to correct what he views as unreasonably long mandatory minimum sentences. The president's push to lessen the burden on nonviolent drug offenders reflects his long-stated view that the nation should remedy the consequences of decades of onerous sentencing rules, which have put tens of thousands of Americans behind bars for far too long. Among those affected by Wednesday's presidential order were 67 individuals serving life sentences - almost all for nonviolent drug crimes, although a few also were charged with firearms violations related to their drug activities. To date, Obama has granted 562 commutations, more than the previous nine presidents combined, and more clemency actions that by any other president in nearly a century. White House counsel Neil Eggleston said in the White House blog that Obama examines each clemency application on its specific merits to identify the appropriate relief, including whether the prisoner would be helped by additional drug treatment, educational programs or counseling. Presidents tend to use their powers to commute sentences or issue pardons more frequently near the end of their terms of office. Administration officials said the rapid pace will continue before Obama's leaves the White House in January 2017. \\"We are not done yet,\\" Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates said. \\"We expect that many more men and women will be given a second chance through the clemency initiative.\\" Obama has long called for phasing out strict sentences for drug offenses, arguing they lead to excessive punishment and incarceration rates unseen in other developed countries.

A three-year-old girl has taken her first paragliding flight after her father strapped the daredevil toddler to his chest and took to the air - climbing to a height of 6,500 feet. Luisa Broschart clung tightly to her 49-year-old father Mik throughout the flight as the pair soared above the lush Bavarian hills of Lenggries in southern Germany for more than 20 minutes. Mr Broschart said Luisa had been pestering her father to take her paragliding with him ever since she could speak, but until now she wasn't big enough to fit into the safety harness.

In this case, I will choose \\"the impact of technology on mental health.\\" Step 2: Conduct research I will perform basic research on the subject to understand the common views, findings, and arguments related to the chosen topic. This will help me create a detailed and relevant context. Step 3: Create context Based on my research, I can create a context, which is a description of the current situation, findings, and debates around the impact of technology on mental health. In this case, the context might be: \\"Over the past two decades, there has been a rapid increase in the development and adoption of technology, particularly in the form of smartphones, social media, and constant connectivity. While technology has its numerous benefits, it has also raised concerns about its potential effects on mental health, especially among adolescents and young adults. Some studies have shown a significant correlation between screen time and mental health issues such as anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem, while others argue that technology can serve as a useful tool to improve mental well-being through increased access to resources and support systems.\\" Step 4: Formulate the research question Based on the context, I will identify a specific research question that seeks to address a specific aspect of the subject. In this case, the research question might be: \\"Does the excessive use of smartphones and social media negatively influence the mental health of adolescents and young adults?\\" Step 5: Generate a hypothesis A hypothesis is a testable prediction often based on the existing literature on the subject.

It is justifiable, as the hypothesis focuses on the relationship between excessive technology use and mental health issues. Furthermore, the hypothesis can be tested through empirical studies, by comparing the mental health outcomes of groups with different levels of smartphone and social media usage. In conclusion, the context and hypothesis generated are as follows: Context: The rapid increase in technology adoption, particularly smartphones and social media, has raised concerns about its potential effects on mental health, especially among adolescents and young adults. Hypothesis: Excessive use of smartphones and social media is associated with an increased risk of anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem among adolescents and young adults."},{"question":"How is \\"And the necklace.\\" said in Czech?","response":"To translate the phrase \\"And the necklace.\\" to Czech, I will follow these steps: 1. Identify the respective Czech words for 'and', 'the', and 'necklace'. 2. Verify correct grammar and word order for the Czech language. 3. Combine the words into a coherent translated phrase. Step 1: Identifying Czech words - 'And' in Czech is 'a'. - 'The' in Czech does not have a direct equivalent, as Czech articles are not used. However, the gender of the noun needs to be reflected in the adjective if one is used. - 'Necklace' in Czech can be translated as 'náhrdelník'. Step 2: Verify correct grammar and word order - In Czech, the word order typically follows the pattern: subject, verb, object. However, for short phrases like this one, the word order stays the same as in English. - Since there is no need to reflect gender with an adjective in this phrase, we can proceed with combining the words. Step 3: Combine words into a coherent translated phrase - 'And the necklace' can be translated as 'a náhrdelník'.

It didn't take long to find them. As the Royal Navy ship lowered her landing craft to begin rescuing the first three boats filled with migrants, reports were coming in of more on route from Libya. The first boat we saw illustrated their desperation to reach Europe. A small wooden vessel was packed with around 400 people. There was barely any room to move on deck. Below, another load of migrants had been loaded like cargo. They were drifting without an engine, just hoping for salvation. It would have needed a miracle for that boat to complete the journey to Europe. Nearby Bulwark's crew were also coming to the rescue of two perilous rubber dinghies, each carrying around a hundred more people. The fact that many didn't even have life jackets was another reminder that the gangs who trafficked them had little regard for their lives. In Bulwark's docking bay we watched wave after wave of landing craft arrive, each full with another load of people. The injured were among the first to be offloaded. We watched as a women was stretchered off - she was pregnant and suffering from dehydration. For most their only belongings were the clothes they were wearing. They were marshalled to an area to be processed. First they were searched to ensure none was carrying any weapons. Then they were asked to give their names and the countries they came from. They had travelled from Pakistan, Bangladesh, and sub-Saharan Africa. There were Syrians who had fled one civil war only to find another in Libya. After they had been given some food and water, we spoke to them about their journey. They told us that they had paid around 1,000 (Â£650) to the gangs who had smuggled them. Many had come to Libya to find work but as the country descended into chaos they found they were the victims of discrimination. Tor, a Christian man from South Sudan, said he'd been victimised because he didn't have a Muslim name. He broke down in tears when I asked him about the family he had left behind. He claimed as well that some of the people involved in the smuggling had also been rescued. Moussa from Ghana, who was just 17, said he had been beaten by the people who trafficked him. Whatever the reasons that had taken them to Libya, they all agreed that it was now too dangerous to stay. They were making the journey to Europe because they thought it was their only hope. Esaw, another man from Ghana, told me that he wasn't even expecting to survive the journey. By the end of the day Bulwark and her crew had taken on board 1,200 people with the ship declared in \\"overload\\" conditions. Some survivors were taken onto the upper open decks, because there wasn't enough room below to accommodate them. In the words of Bulwark's captain this \\"may well be the tip of the iceberg\\". This is supported by some estimates that say there are already half a million people waiting to make the same journey. The captain can't be sure they picked up everyone at sea on this day. All he can say is that Bulwark and her crew have done all they can to bring as many as possible to safety. The Royal Navy ship is now on her way to Sicily to hand the migrants over to the Italian authorities. But soon Bulwark will set sail again to look for the next wave coming in.

Percy Tyrone Sledge (November 25, 1940 - April 14, 2015) was an American R&B, soul and gospel singer. He is best known for the song \\"When a Man Loves a Woman\\", a No. 1 hit on both the Billboard Hot 100 and R&B singles charts in 1966. It was awarded a million-selling, Gold-certified disc from the RIAA. Having previously worked as a hospital orderly in the early 1960s, Sledge achieved his strongest success in the late 1960s and early 1970s with a series of emotional soul songs. Sledge's career enjoyed a renaissance in the 1980s when \\"When a Man Loves a Woman\\" re-entered the UK Singles Chart, peaking at No. 2 behind the reissued Ben E. King classic \\"Stand by Me\\", after being used in a Levi's commercial. In the early 1990s, Michael Bolton brought \\"When a Man Loves a Woman\\" back into the limelight again on his hit album Time, Love, & Tenderness. On the week of November 17 to November 23, 1991, Bolton's version also hit No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart, exactly 25 1/2 years to the week after Percy's did in 1966. In 1994, Saul Davis and Barry Goldberg produced Sledge's album, Blue Night, for Philippe Le Bras' Sky Ranch label and Virgin Records. It featured Bobby Womack, Steve Cropper, and Mick Taylor among others. Blue Night received a Grammy nomination for Best Contemporary Blues Album, Vocal or Instrumental, and in 1996 it won the W.C. Handy Award for best soul or blues album. In 2004, Davis and Goldberg also produced the Shining Through the Rain album, which preceded his induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. Songs on the CD were written by Mikael Rickfors, Steve Earle, the Bee Gees, Carla Olson, Denny Freeman, Allan Clarke and Jackie Lomax. The same year Percy recorded a live album with his band Sunset Drive entitled Percy Sledge and Sunset Drive - Live in Virginia on WRM Records produced by Warren Rodgers. In May 2007, Percy was inducted into The Louisiana Music Hall Of Fame in his home city of Baton Rouge, LA. In December 2010, Rhino Handmade issued a four-CD retrospective, The Atlantic Recordings, which covers all of the issued Atlantic masters, as well as many of the tracks unissued in the United States (although some were simply the mono versions of songs originally issued in stereo; Disc 1 comprises Sledge's first two LPs which were not recorded on stereo equipment).

Attorney General Loretta Lynch described her Monday meeting with Bill Clinton aboard a private plane as “primarily social,” but some Democrats are struggling to stomach the optics of the attorney general’s meeting with the former president while his wife is under federal investigation — while others are fiercely defending her integrity. Lynch said she and Clinton talked only of grandchildren, golf, and their respective travels, but the fact that the two spoke privately at all was enough to rekindle concerns about a possible conflict of interest. Republicans have long called into question the ability of a Democratic-led Department of Justice to conduct an independent investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server, based inside her Chappaqua, New York, home, during her tenure as secretary of state. Story Continued Below Once news of their meeting on the tarmac at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport broke, Democrats made clear that while the meeting was likely as innocent as Lynch described, it did not give the Justice Department the appearance of independence. “I do agree with you that it doesn’t send the right signal,” Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) said Thursday in response to a question about the meeting from CNN “New Day” host Alisyn Camerota. “She has generally shown excellent judgment and strong leadership of the department, and I’m convinced that she’s an independent attorney general. But I do think that this meeting sends the wrong signal and I don’t think it sends the right signal. I think she should have steered clear, even of a brief, casual social meeting with the former president.” Coons, through his office, later walked back his assessment. \\"Senator Coons believes that Attorney General Lynch has addressed this question and said they talked about their grandchildren, travels and golf, and nothing about matters involving the Department,\\" Coons spokesman Jonathan Kott said. \\"Senator Coons, as a member of the Senate Judiciary committee knows Attorney General Lynch, has worked with her and believes that she is honest and trustworthy.\\" David Axelrod, a former top aide to President Barack Obama, tweeted that he took Lynch and the former president “at their word” that the Justice Department’s probe into Hillary Clinton’s email server did not come up, “but foolish to create such optics.” Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump was not convinced by the attorney general's assurances, attacking the judgment of both Lynch and Bill Clinton. The Manhattan billionaire decried the meeting as \\"terrible,\\" \\"horrible,\\" \\"amazing\\" and \\"really a sneak\\" in a radio interview with \\"The Mike Gallagher Show.\\" “It’s a massive story now. It’s all over the place” he said. “Even the liberal media’s making it a big story, which is shocking to me, because it’s so out of bounds. Wow, that’s an amazing thing.” Democratic leaders in the Capitol defended Lynch and Clinton's gathering, even as it comes during a Justice Department investigation and the heat of the presidential campaign. They pointed to Lynch's strong reputation among members of both parties (10 Republicans voted to confirm her last year). \\"I can't control who meets with whom,\\" said Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.). \\"No one can ever question [Lynch's] strong feelings about the rule of the law. And her ethics, I repeat, are the best.\\" \\"She's an honorable person, we know that,\\" said Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, Reid's presumptive successor next year. \\"She has said nothing was discussed related to the investigation. So you have two choices: to say this didn't matter or that she's lying. I think that it didn't matter. I don't think she lying.\\" In April, President Obama told Fox News host Chris Wallace that he can \\"guarantee\\" that he would not interfere with the FBI's investigation. \\"I do not talk to the Attorney General about pending investigations,\\" he said. \\"I do not talk to FBI directors about pending investigations. We have a strict line, and always have maintained it.\\" On Monday, Lynch had just arrived in Phoenix for a community policing event when Bill Clinton, who was on his way out of the airport, found out the two were in the same place and asked to visit with her. Lynch told reporters Wednesday in Los Angeles that she and the former president did not discuss the ongoing investigation into his wife. Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) has been perhaps the most vocal lawmaker arguing that the Justice Department’s investigation into Hillary Clinton constituted a conflict of interest. He called for a special prosecutor to handle the case as far back as last September and renewed his concerns Thursday morning on Twitter. “Lynch & Clinton: Conflict of interest?” Cornyn wrote. “An attorney cannot represent two parties in a dispute and must avoid even the appearance of conflict.” Reid and Schumer bristled when asked if Lynch's meetings feeds critics more ammunition to attack Hillary Clinton during the same week that Republicans teed off on her over her handling of the Benghazi attacks. \\"Look at the other side. You've got Donald Trump. So we're satisfied with our candidate. I think she's doing pretty damn good,\\" Reid said. Lynch's meeting with the former president came a day before top Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin was deposed as part of a lawsuit brought by Judicial Watch, a case separate from the ongoing FBI investigation into the former secretary of state’s email server. During the deposition, Abedin testified about an email exchange from November 2010 in which Clinton asked if she could get a “separate address or device” but added that she did not “want any risk of the personal being accessible.” Abedin, who serves as vice chairwoman of Clinton’s presidential campaign, said during the Tuesday deposition, according to a transcript released Wednesday, that she had suggested to Clinton going on a State Department email address or informing the department of her personal address so that they could make sure her emails were not going to their spam folders. The particular exchange stemmed from Clinton apparently missing an important phone call with a “foreign minister” because her email confirming the event went to spam. “She seems frustrated because she’s not able to do her job,” Abedin testified, describing the exchange. “I seem frustrated back because I’m not.” In his deposition on Wednesday, State Undersecretary for Management Patrick Kennedy testified that Clinton's use of a private email address \\"did not register\\" or \\"strike any bells,\\" according to a transcript released Thursday. Asked whether Clinton’s emails to him struck him as out of the ordinary when compared to her use of more traditional communication tools, Kennedy said it was not surprising because of the “very small volume” of emails he received from the secretary of state during her time at the department. ||||| As his wife is under federal investigation for her use of a private email server, former President Bill Clinton met privately with U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch at the Phoenix Airport Monday evening in what both sides say was an unplanned encounter. An aide to Bill Clinton confirmed to CBS News that the meeting wasn't planned in advance: President Clinton saw the attorney general on the tarmac and wanted to say hello, so he boarded her plane to talk. The meeting comes as former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is still under investigation for her email practices--and also came the day before House Republicans released a report criticizing the Obama administration's response to the 2012 Benghazi attacks. Lynch told reporters that the topics of Benghazi and Clinton's email server did not come up, and that she and Clinton spoke largely about his grandchildren, golf and travel. \\"Actually, while I was landing at the airport, I did see President Clinton at the Phoenix airport as I was leaving, and he spoke to myself and my husband on the plane,\\" she said. \\"Our conversation was a great deal about his grandchildren. It was primarily social and about our travels. He mentioned the golf he played in Phoenix, and he mentioned travels he'd had in West Virginia.\\" \\"There was no discussion of any matter pending for the department or any matter pending for any other body,\\" Lynch added. \\"There was no discussion of Benghazi, no discussion of the State Department emails, by way of example.\\" Asked further whether there was any \\"impropriety\\" to meeting with Clinton while the email investigation is ongoing, Lynch replied merely that the case is being handled by \\"career investigators and career agents.\\" \\"My agency is involved in a matter looking at State Department policies and issues,\\" she said. \\"It's being handled by career investigators and career agents. It will always follow the facts and the law and do the same independent and thorough investigation that they've done in all.\\" Regardless of Lynch's downplaying of the conversation, CBS News Justice reporter Paul Reid called it \\"shocking, absolutely shocking.\\" \\"The most high-profile national security investigation under the attorney general is the investigation into whether or not classified information was mishandled in connection with Hillary Clinton's server,\\" Reid told CBSN. \\"Now, President Clinton and his foundation are also tangentially involved in that investigation, so the appearance of impropriety is just stunning.\\" Reid also noted that the explanation that it wasn't a scheduled meeting is unlikely to quiet critics. \\"Loretta Lynch is no shrinking violet. This is a tough lady,\\" Reid said. \\"She's stood up to El Chapo, she has taken on FIFA -- she is not incapable to telling someone, 'Look, you can't come on my plane' or 'Look, I don't want to talk to you.' The optics of this for the investigation going forward are horrible.\\" \\"It will definitely be fuel for those who do not believe this is an objective investigation,\\" Reid added.

Flowing in every day, these data are added to the Wayback Machine after an embargo period. ||||| (CNN) A meeting this week between Attorney General Loretta Lynch and former President Bill Clinton is creating headaches for Hillary Clinton's campaign. Lynch and Bill Clinton met privately in Phoenix Monday after the two realized they were on the same tarmac, an aide to the former president said. The encounter took place ahead of the public release Tuesday morning of the House Benghazi Committee's report on the 2012 attack on a U.S. consulate in Libya. The meeting is raising questions about whether the independence of the Justice Department, which is conducting an investigation of Hillary Clinton's private email server, might have been compromised. Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump said Thursday the meeting was \\"terrible.\\" \\"It was really a sneak,\\" Trump told conservative talk show host Mike Gallagher . \\"You see a thing like this and, even in terms of judgment, how bad of judgment is it for him or for her to do this? Who would do this?\\" Trump continued his criticism during an interview with New Hampshire-based CNN affiliate WBIN-TV Thursday night, calling the meeting \\"shocking\\" and \\"very disappointing.\\" Texas Sen. John Cornyn, a Republican, said the incident is why a \\"Special Counsel\\" should take over the email investigation \\"This incident does nothing to instill confidence in the American people that her department can fully and fairly conduct this investigation, and that's why a Special Counsel is needed now more than ever,\\" Cornyn said in a statement. And Judicial Watch, a conservative legal watchdog group that has sued for access to records pertaining to Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while leading the State Department, is asking for the Justice Department's inspector general to investigate the meeting. \\"Attorney General Lynch's meeting with President Clinton creates the appearance of a violation of law, ethical standards and good judgment,\\" the group said in a statement. \\"Attorney General Lynch's decision to breach the well-defined ethical standards of the Department of Justice and the American legal profession is an outrageous abuse of the public's trust. Her conduct and statements undermine confidence in her ability to objectively investigate and prosecute possible violations of law associated with President Clinton and Secretary Clinton.\\" Even some Democrats say the optics don't look good. Sen. Chris Coons, D-Delaware, said he believes Lynch will remain objective in her role but would have advised against the meeting, which he says sends the wrong signal even if it was \\"a brief, casual, social meeting with the former president.\\" \\"I think she should have said, 'Look, I recognize you have a long record of leadership on fighting crime but this is not the time for us to have that conversation. After the election is over, I'd welcome your advice,'\\" Coons told CNN's Alisyn Camerota Thursday on \\"New Day.\\" Clinton's campaign hasn't commented on the meeting. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest reiterated Thursday President Barack Obama's commitment to avoiding \\"political interference\\" in Department of Justice investigations after the airport meeting. Referring back to Lynch's comments about the meeting, Earnest said Lynch understands investigations should be \\"conducted free of political influence and consistent with the facts.\\" He said Obama has also made clear he expects the Department of Justice investigation into Clinton's emails to proceed without political interference. The huddle could feed into one of the biggest hurdles facing Clinton's campaign: that she's untrustworthy. Clinton herself acknowledged that challenge in unusually direct terms this week. \\"I personally know I have work to do on this front,\\" she said in Chicago Monday. According to a law enforcement official familiar with the matter, the former president saw Lynch's plane on the tarmac and walked onto her aircraft. Lynch's FBI security detail did not stop Clinton and he proceeded to initiate an extended conversation that included discussion of grandchildren. Lynch was surprised to see Clinton walking onto her plane, the official said, and no Justice Department business was discussed. Speaking at a news conference in Phoenix on Tuesday, Lynch confirmed the meeting and denied the two spoke about any matter pending before the Justice Department or the Benghazi probe. She also said the former president \\"did not raise anything\\" about an ongoing case or anything of that nature. \\"I did see President Clinton at the Phoenix airport as he was leaving and spoke to myself and my husband on the plane,\\" Lynch said according to CNN affiliate KNXV/ABC15 . \\"Our conversation was a great deal about grandchildren, it was primarily social about our travels and he mentioned golf he played in Phoenix.\\" The former president's aide said nothing beyond Lynch's characterization of the account was discussed, and that Clinton \\"always\\" extends this courtesy when he is around cabinet secretaries, members of Congress and other dignitaries, pointing to the former president's unplanned meeting with Sen. Ted Cruz at an Alabama airport in May. Asked in Los Angeles on Wednesday whether the meeting risked the department's impartiality in its investigation, Lynch said the email probe is \\"being handled by career investigators and career agents who always follow the facts and the law.\\" Top Democrats on Capitol Hill defended Lynch Thursday. \\"All I can say is Loretta Lynch is one of the most outstanding human beings I've ever known,\\" Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, told reporters. \\"Her ethics is above reproach.\\" Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-New York, called Lynch an \\"honorable person.\\" \\"She has said nothing was discussed related to the investigation so you have two choices: To say this didn't matter or she's lying,\\" Schumer said. \\"I think it didn't matter.

Answering a reporter's question about the appearance of impropriety over the unscheduled meeting on the tarmac, Lynch said the State Department email matter is being handled by career agents and prosecutors \\"who always follow the facts and the law and do the same thorough independent examination in this matter that they've done in all\\" matters. Still, word of the meeting could fuel new calls from Sen. John Cornyn of Texas and other congressional Republicans for a special prosecutor outside the Justice Department chain of command to lead the email investigation. The controversy has trailed Hillary Clinton for more than a year. She has said the use of a private server was a mistake. But her closest aides have been subjected to questioning from federal investigators and conservative watchdogs like Judicial Watch. Just this week, Huma Abedin, Clinton's former deputy chief of staff and now a key campaign operative, told Judicial Watch lawyers she didn't recall talks with State Department officials about Clinton's server arrangement. Abedin added in the deposition that \\"it wasn't a secret that [Clinton] was using this email address to be communicating with U.S. government officials, because they were receiving emails from her.\\" ||||| Output:","response":"US Attorney General Loretta Lynch continues to face criticism over her private meeting with former President Bill Clinton at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport. Lynch insists their conversation aboard the private plane was \\"primarily social\\", involving discussions of their families and golf, while both Republicans and Democrats raise concerns over a possible conflict of interest. The meeting occurred while Hillary Clinton is still under federal investigation over her use of a private email server. Notably, the meeting also took place the day before the release of the House Benghazi Committee's report on the 2012 attack on the US consulate in Libya."},{"question":"Question: Some cultures find it odd that other cultures have this kind of bathroom in an apartment?

The question is asking which type of bathroom in an apartment might some cultures find odd. Step 2: Evaluate the choices. - habitual: This choice does not describe a type of bathroom, so it is not a suitable answer. - outhouse: Refers to a detached outdoor bathroom, which is not usually found in an apartment. - normal: This choice is subjective and does not describe a specific type of bathroom. - common: Refers to a bathroom that is shared by multiple people or rooms, which can be present in an apartment setting. - regular: This choice is also subjective and does not describe a specific type of bathroom. Step 3: Determine the best answer. The rationale to choose \\"common\\" as the answer is that a shared bathroom located in an apartment may seem unusual or odd to some cultures, particularly those who place a high value on privacy and personal space.

There, Dudovitz, a longtime poverty lawyer and executive director of the San Fernando Valley's 36-year-old legal aid program, continues to struggle with his hostile takeover of the neighboring San Gabriel-Pomona Valleys service area one year after it was accomplished. On the bright side, Dudovitz has extended his respected program to clients in the San Gabriel-Pomona Valley, and he now operates on a much larger budget, 6.5 million last year. However, his clash with the old San Gabriel program resulted in litigation, bitter feelings and a mission that some say is not clearly focused on serving poor people. \\"It was a difficult situation that was probably mishandled by everyone,\\" a longtime observer of the public interest community said of the San Fernando Valley-San Gabriel-Pomona Valley merger. \\"There are very few people who come out as the heroes. Personalities got involved when they shouldn't have. Things were said that caused bad feelings and couldn't be unsaid.\\" Iwasaki's merger with the smaller, 48-year-old Long Beach program was friendly and fast, and no one - not even Long Beach board members - lost a job. When it was over, Iwasaki had 1 million more in federal dollars and two new offices. Long Beach clients regained services they had lost years ago when federal budget cuts and dwindling grants reduced the staff of 15 lawyers to five and cut immigration and consumer law programs. Iwasaki said, \\"[I judged the transition] better than I could have hoped for.\\" According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"In the eyes of the public interest community, was Dudovitz's hostile takeover well-handled?\\" is \\"Handled Well\\"?","response":"No, according to the above paragraph, Dudovitz's hostile takeover was not well-handled in the eyes of the public interest community. The passage states that the San Fernando Valley-San Gabriel-Pomona Valley merger was \\"a difficult situation that was probably mishandled by everyone\\" and that \\"there are very few people who come out as the heroes.\\" Personalities getting involved, things being said that caused bad feelings, and unclear focus on serving poor people contributed to the perception that Dudovitz's takeover was not handled well. In contrast, Iwasaki's friendly takeover was seen as more successful, as it led to a smoother transition and better outcomes for the involved parties."},{"question":"Kevin Pietersen launched new book in a stunning Franciscan monastery.

Write an article based on these highlights.","response":"Title: Kevin Pietersen Ignites Controversy With His New Autobiography and Accuses ECB of Character Assassination; Leaked Dossier Adds Fuel to the Fire In a sensational turn of events, Kevin Pietersen, former England batsman, unveiled his new autobiography at a stunning Franciscan monastery, sparking controversy and igniting debate. The book, which delves into Pietersen's cricketing career and personal experiences, sheds light on the darker side of English cricket and has raised eyebrows amongst fans, players, and administrators alike. Adding more fuel to the fire is a dossier of information on Pietersen put together by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB). The document, leaked on Tuesday, alleges that Pietersen disobeyed then-coach Andy Flower's instructions ahead of the second Test. According to the dossier, Pietersen took two young players out drinking until late, defying Flower's orders. In response to these allegations, Pietersen has vehemently defended himself, stating, \\"My character has been assassinated for five or six years by the ECB press machine, but I can go to bed at night and sleep easy.\\" These strong words underscore the tumultuous relationship that Pietersen has had with the ECB and the English national team. The unveiling of the autobiography at a picturesque Franciscan monastery only added to the drama surrounding the launch. The choice of the venue and the significant revelations in the book have together given rise to speculation about Pietersen's intentions and the larger implications of this extraordinary affair. Pietersen's autobiography has, undoubtedly, lit bonfires around the national team. The book addresses a range of issues that have plagued English cricket in recent years, from the culture of bullying within the dressing room to the inefficiency of the team management. In doing so, Pietersen has opened a Pandora's box that could lead to further repercussions and inquiry into the inner dynamics of the team. The allegations in the leaked dossier have sent shockwaves through the cricketing community. Several former players and experts have weighed in on the ongoing controversy, with opinions ranging from support for Pietersen to outright condemnation. Some argue that Pietersen’s claims of character assassination by the ECB hold water, bearing in mind his impressive record and contributions to the England team. They contend that the organization should be held accountable for its targeted campaign against one of its most prominent players. Others, however, believe that Pietersen's actions, as stated in the dossier, warrant scrutiny and criticism, especially given the responsibilities he had as a senior team member. In conclusion, Kevin Pietersen's new autobiography, the leaked ECB dossier, and the Franciscan monastery launch have together created a perfect storm of controversy in the world of cricket. While Pietersen's character and actions have once again come under the spotlight, the underlying issues he has unearthed have sparked a broader debate about English cricket's management, culture, and performance. With passions running high, the fallout of this episode will be keenly watched and dissected for a long time to come."},{"question":"Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: A young American computer engineer (Shane West as Max Petersen) acquires a mobile phone that receives strange text messages.

Passed down through generations, this ring held a special place in Amy's heart, not only for its beauty but also for the history it represented. The intricately crafted band of yellow gold, adorned with a single shining emerald, was symbolic of her family's love, unity, and strength. As Amy carefully slipped the ring onto her finger, she reflected on her grandmother's stories about the many strong women that had worn it before. Each of these women had faced their own struggles and trials but, at the end of the day, they stayed true to their family roots. The emerald, a distinct choice of gemstone among her ancestors, symbolized growth and new beginnings, guiding each generation forward. Rebecca, intrigued by the shimmering piece of jewelry, gently examined Amy's finger. She delicately traced the delicate engravings along the gold band, in wonderment of the craftsmanship. She became curious about the stories behind the ring and listened attentively as Amy shared her family's tales - the adventures, heartbreaks, and victories. Rebecca, though envious of the beautiful heirloom, felt a sense of vulnerability knowing her own family did not possess such a tradition. Despite this, Amy believed that every family had a story to tell, however unconnected it may be to a physical object.

One which celebrates the journeys of their families while symbolically intertwining their friendship. The two women spent hours brainstorming and decided on a simple and meaningful idea: a journal. This journal would capture their thoughts, dreams, and journeys so their descendants could relive their lives. The idea brought them closer than ever, as they became active participants in preserving their heritage. Rebecca, who initially felt uneasy about her lack of a family heirloom, embraced her newfound role in creating a legacy. Together, Amy and Rebecca embarked on a journey, with the knowledge that their stories would be treasured by generations to come. As for the ring, it continued to serve as an emblem of their unbreakable bond and the resilient spirits of the women who had worn it before."},{"question":"Which construction was officially titled the Anti-Fascist Protection Rampart? What is the answer?","response":"The Anti-Fascist Protection Rampart, also known as the Antifaschistischer Schutzwall in German, was the official name given to the Berlin Wall that separated East and West Berlin from 1961 to 1989. The term \\"Anti-Fascist Protection Rampart\\" was coined by the East German government to justify the construction of the wall and to ostensibly indicate that its purpose was to protect East Germany from alleged fascist elements in West Germany. The construction of the Berlin Wall began on August 13, 1961, under the orders of the East German government led by Walter Ulbricht, the General Secretary of the Socialist Unity Party (SED). Physically, the wall was a massive concrete barrier, approximately 155 kilometers (96 miles) long, accompanied by various watchtowers, military checkpoints, and a heavily guarded \\"death strip.\\" The construction of the wall was motivated by political, social, and economic factors that arose during the years of the Cold War. The term \\"Anti-Fascist Protection Rampart\\" was intended as a propaganda tool to convince the East German population that the wall was necessary for their security and protection, rather than a measure to prevent them from fleeing to West Germany. By alluding to the shared history of World War II and the fight against Fascism, the East German government tried to create a narrative where the West was painted as the enemy, drawing upon memories of fascism and transforming the wall into a symbol of national defense. In reality, the primary purpose of the Berlin Wall was to prevent East Germans from leaving the country amidst a growing refugee crisis, as thousands of East Germans were crossing into West Berlin in search of better economic opportunities and political freedom. The Communist government in East Germany was struggling both economically and politically, so the wall served as a means to stabilize their situation and to maintain control over the population. The Berlin Wall stood for 28 years and became the iconic symbol of Cold War-era division, not only in Germany but also around the world. It was finally demolished in 1989, following a series of political changes and social unrest within East Germany. The fall of the Berlin Wall was one of the key events leading to the eventual reunification of Germany in October 1990, marking the end of the Cold War era and the separation of East and West Germany."},{"question":"A text is given in Bengali.

When Will arrives for the party â wearing stockings, garters, clown makeup, and a trench-coat â he is attacked and brutally beaten by a middle-aged man, Ed, and his sons Gino and Frankie. The three men then proceed to gang rape Will, taking turns videotaping the attack. The trio hold Will hostage in the motel room for an indeterminate amount of time, during which they subject him to a series of violent and humiliating sexual assaults. They also break a bottle over his head and drug him. A tearful Will goes home and spends the remainder of the night and part of the next morning crying while he washes himself clean in the bathtub. Will spends a considerable amount of time after the attack in a crippling depression, which nearly costs him his home.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Twister Context: In June 1969, 5-year-old Jo Thornton (Alexa Vega), her parents, and the family dog Toby seek shelter in their family storm cellar as a powerful F5 tornado hits their farm in Oklahoma. This tornado is so strong that the storm cellar door is ripped off, causing Jo's father (Richard Lineback) to be pulled into the storm to his death. Jo, her mother (Rusty Schwimmer), and Toby survive. 27 years later in 1996, 32-year-old Jo (Helen Hunt), now a meteorologist, is reunited with her estranged husband, Bill \\"The Extreme\\" Harding (Bill Paxton), a former weather researcher and storm chaser, who has since become a weather reporter. He is planning to marry reproductive therapist Melissa Reeves (Jami Gertz). They need Jo's signature on the divorce papers and have tracked her down during an active bout of stormy weather. Jo has built four identical tornado research devices called DOROTHY, based on Bill's designs. The device is designed to release hundreds of sensors into the center of a tornado to study its structure from the inside, with the purpose of creating a more advanced storm warning system. Bill and Melissa join Jo and her team of storm chasers, and the team encounters Dr. Jonas Miller (Cary Elwes), a smug, corporate-funded meteorologist and storm chaser. When Bill discovers that Jonas has created a device based on DOROTHY, called DOT-3, he vows to help Jo deploy DOROTHY before Miller can claim credit for the idea. During the first tornado, Jo's truck and DOROTHY I are both destroyed (the truck is picked up and lands upside-down). They continue storm chasing in Bill's truck, with Melissa in the back seat. They find a second tornado, a confirmed F2, and head off on a back road when the twister shifts its track. They soon find themselves driving through heavy rain, and instead collide with a cluster of two violent waterspouts, one of which splits, spinning them around on the highway until the waterspouts dissipate. They're fine, but Melissa becomes hysterical from the ordeal, and Bill has to calm her down. The team...

Tom gained weight and started not dressing up as much. His girlfriend didn't like his laziness. She broke up with him over it. Can we draw the following conclusion? Tom's girlfriend broke up with him over the phone.","response":"Based on the information provided, it is not possible to draw a definitive conclusion that Tom's girlfriend broke up with him over the phone. The passage states that Tom gained weight and started not dressing up as much, which led to the girlfriend's dissatisfaction and eventual breakup. However, the mode of communication during the breakup was not mentioned. There are various reasons that could contribute to the rising dissatisfaction in a relationship. In Tom's case, his weight gain and lack of effort in dressing up were noted as major factors. One could argue that his girlfriend might have perceived his laziness as a lack of commitment or interest in the relationship, leading to her decision to end it. Relationships often rely on communication and mutual understanding to grow and flourish. When one partner feels that the other is neglecting their shared bond, it could potentially result in a decrease in the overall satisfaction within the relationship and be a catalyst for a breakup. While the passage does not provide enough context to determine the exact method of communication during the breakup, it is important to focus on acknowledging and comprehending the factors that led to the relationship's collapse. Breaking up in person or over the phone (or via any other medium) is a separate issue that may contribute to how the breakup was experienced or processed, but it does not alter the fundamental issue: that Tom's girlfriend was unhappy with the changes in his behavior and how it impacted their relationship. In conclusion, it is not possible to definitively say whether Tom's girlfriend broke up with him over the phone based on the information provided. However, the focus should be on understanding the overarching issues that contributed to the breakup, in order to facilitate learning and personal growth."},{"question":"Produce a sentence which mentions all of these concepts: grove, orange, tree","response":"In the warm sunlight of a beautiful summer morning, all the fragrant orange trees stood tall and proud in the lush grove, their branches laden with vibrant, juicy fruit that demonstrated the wondrous bounty of nature's generosity."},{"question":"Continue writing the following text.

While viscosity and surface tension increase as the strength of intermolecular forces increase, vapor pressure decreases . This is because the stronger the intermolecular forces are, the harder it is for liquid molecules to escape into the gas phase. Vapor pressure a measure of how much of a substance is in the gas phase when that substance is at equilibrium; that is, the number of molecules in the gas and liquid phases are not changing. The more molecules that are able to escape into the gas phase, the higher the vapor pressure. Vapor pressure is also proportional to temperature. As temperature increases, vapor pressure also increases. Now, I have a new situation: Jacob is performing a chemistry experiment using two different liquids. Before starting the experiment, Jacob is told that liquid A molecules have strong intermolecular forces, while liquid B molecules have weak intermolecular forces. Jacob now has to decide how to use this information to guide him as he develops the experimental procedures for these two liquids. Answer this question please: When both liquids are at equilibrium, which liquid will have less molecules in the liquid phase? A:","response":"Liquid B will have less molecules in the liquid phase.

Article: I was reading these interesting stories behind a group of great logos in the world. Personally Nike is my favorite one--it's so simple. And I liked the stories behind them, which made me forget all other things. McDonald's, Apple, Mercedes Benz and Adidas own great logos as well, and they are among my favorites. Nike In the Greek myth, Nike is the goddess of victory and the source of inspiration for soldiers. This logo represents the wing in the famous statue of the Greek goddess. Nike's logo was designed by Carolyn Davidson in 1971 for 35, and was registered as a trademark in 1995. McDonald's The logo was designed in 1962 by Jim Schindler to resemble the archshaped signs on the side of the company's then walk-up hamburger stand. Later on, the two golden arches were combined together to form the M. The McDonald's name was added to the logo in 1968. Apple There are different stories behind Apple's logo. The first logo was a reference to the religious story of Adam and Eve, in which the apple represented the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge. One year later, the second logo was designed in 1977 by Steven Jobs and Ronald Wayne, and it described Sir Isaac Newton sitting under an apple tree. This logo didn't stay long. One year later it was replaced almost immediately by graphic designer Rob Janoff's \\" rainbow apple\\", a rainbow- colored silhouette of an apple with a bite taken out of it. And then the rainbow- colored apple was replaced by the one- colored logo in 1998. It has not been changed so far. Mercedes Benz The Mercedes Benz logo, which was originally created by Gottlieb Daimler in 1909, consists of a simple description of a three- pointed star that represents its rule of the land, the sea and the air. The company was founded by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach. Marcedes is the name of Maybach's elder daughter, while Benz came as a result of a combination with Benz, Cie.and DMG in 1926.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Following the Seven Years' War (1756–63) and the forced migration of Native American tribes westward, German, Scots-Irish, and other European immigrants settled in the central Susquehanna Valley, including in the area that would become Northumberland, Pennsylvania. Northumberland was laid out around a central village green in 1772, on land originally purchased from the Iroquois by the Province of Pennsylvania in 1768, as part of the first Treaty of Fort Stanwix. During the American Revolution, the village was evacuated as part of the Big Runaway in 1778, and only finally resettled in 1784. In 1794, when the Priestleys moved there, it included Quaker and Wesleyan meeting houses, a brewery, two potteries, a potash manufacturer, a clock maker, a printer (who issued a weekly newspaper), several stores, and approximately one hundred houses. The Priestley property, purchased in 1794 at a total cost of £500 (£ 56,400 in 2019) from Reuben Haines, who had secured the patent to the land for Northumberland, comprised four lots of the original village plan (numbers 29–32). Currently, the house and grounds occupy 1 acre (4,000 m²) at 472 Priestley Avenue. (The address of the house was originally \\"North Way\\", but the street was later renamed in honor of Joseph Priestley.) This street forms the northwest boundary of the property; the other boundaries are Hanover Avenue to the northeast, Wallis Street to the southwest, and the North Shore Railroad to the southeast. Beyond the railroad line is a baseball field, and beyond that lies the Susquehanna River, which was the original southeastern boundary of the property. The confluence of the West Branch Susquehanna River with the main (or North) branch of the Susquehanna is a short distance southwest of the property, which is at an elevation of 456 feet (139 m).The property's original area was 2 acres (8,000 m²), but this was reduced by about half around 1830 when the Pennsylvania Canal (North Branch Division) was dug through the house's front yard, between the house and river.

Robert \\"Barney\\" Barnhart ticks off names of comrades killed by roadside bombs, pausing at the mention of a sergeant Barnhart had persuaded to re-enlist for the fight. His face darkens. This Taliban tactic of lacing the countryside with explosives, he says, is \\"a more cowardly way to fight.\\" He and other Marine commanders say they understand why the Taliban uses the devices: Killing and maiming U.S. troops as they surge into Taliban strongholds let retreating insurgents live to fight another day. \\"It creates survivability\\" for the Taliban, says Barnhart, operations officer for the 1st Battalion, 2nd Marine Regiment, fighting in this hilly northern district of Helmand province. The surge of 30,000 servicemembers ordered by President Obama — bringing the total U.S. presence here to 100,000 — is in place and moving into areas where the Taliban has operated freely for years, the Pentagon says. On Sunday, the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), which oversees military operations in Afghanistan, said an \\"important phase\\" of the surge began this weekend in areas where the Taliban is strong in numbers. Dubbed Operation Dragon Strike, it is an aggressive push in the southern part of the country where the Taliban awaits. \\"We expect hard fighting,\\" said Brig. Gen. Josef Blotz, ISAF's spokesman. Coalition commanders fighting here for months say they have been pushing Islamist fighters out of village safe havens, but the toll on troops is high. U.S. soldiers and Marines fighting in the provinces of Helmand and Kandahar — traditional strongholds of the Taliban — encounter numerous IEDs, or improvised explosive devices. Troops injured seriously by the mines arrive daily at a NATO hospital at Kandahar Air Base. In Helmand province, the 1st Battalion, 2nd Marine Regiment led by Marine Lt. Col. Michael Manning had been hit by 240 bombs (an average of more than one a day) and disarmed an additional 331 during a six-month tour that ended this month. Manning and Brig. Gen. Joseph Osterman, who commands all Marine ground combat forces in Helmand province, say the increase in IEDs is proof the military's surge is working. \\"The more you disrupt, the more he tries to find ways to disrupt what you're doing,\\" Manning said. Taliban fighters have suffered significant casualties when they battled coalition troops, Manning and Osterman say. When that happens, the Taliban tends to fall back and seed fields, roads and orchards with IEDs during the night. Such minefields are a last-ditch effort to hold off defeat, they say. \\"The enemy would be glad to box us off and put an IED belt, essentially an area minefield, all the way around us,\\" says Osterman, adding that Marines will not let that happen. \\"We're constantly pressing the envelope, we're always pushing the (Taliban) farther out,\\" he says. Obama campaigned on a promise to ratchet up the war in Afghanistan, which he called the center of the U.S. fight against al-Qaeda and the Islamic extremists who attacked the United States on Sept. 11, 2001. As a U.S. senator, Obama opposed the troop surge in Iraq backed by President Bush. Now he is turning to a similar strategy to win in Afghanistan. Additional troops have been deploying in stages for months and are in place, according to Defense Secretary Robert Gates. Gates said last week that the U.S.-led coalition has the resources \\"to partner with the Afghans and have some prospect of dealing with a resurgent Taliban.\\" Adm. Michael Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said it's too soon to tell how things will go. \\"I do not in any way underestimate the degree of difficulty or the challenge,\\" he said. Helmand province in southwest Afghanistan has long been a haven for the Taliban, the clerical movement that imposed harsh Islamic rule until its ouster by the U.S.-led invasion in 2001. In February, Marines pushed the Taliban out of the Helmand city of Marjah and are advancing farther into jihadist sanctuaries. As the Marines move from village to village, a pattern of combat has emerged. Insurgents initially engage in hours of firefights with Marines over a period of days or weeks, Manning says. After suffering losses, they turn to a \\"cat and mouse\\" tactic of firing on patrols from concealed spots for several seconds, then fleeing. \\"They got to get fairly close to do direct fire. When they do that, we kill them,\\" Manning says. Manning says radio intercepts of Taliban communication show the enemy force takes too many \\"significant casualties\\" from the engagements. Unable to prevail in man-to-man combat, the insurgents turn to the mines, commanders say. Pentagon and military experts say such tactics can threaten to alter the course of the war and the effectiveness of the surge. Mackenzie Eaglen, a military analyst at the Heritage Foundation, says insurgents hope mounting casualties during the coalition offensive will demoralize troops and erode public and political support for the war at home. \\"They're after headlines,\\" Eaglen says. They hope \\"to influence the international narrative of what's happening in Afghanistan.\\" A recently released report by the Pentagon's Joint IED Defeat Organization (JIEDDO) identified IEDs as \\"the most serious threat\\" to coalition forces. Roadside bombs wounded or killed 6,200 allied troops and Afghan forces in fiscal year 2009 compared with 3,800 in 2008. Casualties are even higher this year. In Helmand province alone, 272 IEDs exploded and 231 were found and cleared in the month of August. Nine troops were killed and 148 wounded. The surge \\"has led to the highest rate of IED attacks on (coalition troops) since the conflict began in 2001,\\" according to the Pentagon report. Because the bombs cause such carnage on a daily basis, they must be neutralized, JIEDDO says. Manning's battalion has suffered more IED attacks than any other Marine battalion in the province. He lost a dozen Marines in six months, nine killed by bombs, including two explosives experts and an engineer who died trying to disarm the devices. Fifteen of his Marines lost limbs. The threat is on the minds of U.S. servicemembers. \\"That's what gives me the biggest headache is wondering if I should walk around. Staring at the ground. Going cross-eyed over it,\\" Marine Sgt. Jason Westenkow says. At an outpost outside the village of Kunjak, Marine Sgt. John Ellis, 26, squad leader, holds up a yellow, 5-gallon jug, the type used routinely for chores in any Afghan home or merchant shop. \\"This is what they use for IEDs,\\" he says. The jugs are filled with 15 to 40 pounds of explosives and can be stuffed with ball bearings, nuts, bolts and screws for shrapnel. They are fitted with a simple pressure-plate detonator constructed of two pieces of plastic-wrapped wood sandwiching electric wire, Ellis says. Bombs are set off remotely by radio or triggered from the end of a wire. The fine dust that powders roads and dry riverbed crossings conceals pressure plates. Lush irrigated fields are ripe for tripwires. Many armored trucks have been damaged or disabled by the bombs. The first line of defense for a foot patrol is the metal detector. Lance Cpl. Matthew Dickens, 20, slowly swings the device back and forth searching for a signal. He has found half a dozen bombs listening for the beep that becomes more rapid when the detector is over an explosive. Dickens then lies on his stomach, his heart pounding, and slowly uncovers enough earth to reveal whether a bomb is there. He tries not to think about what might happen. \\"It if goes off, you're probably not going to feel a lot of anything. You'll just be done,\\" he says. \\"Afterward, it's relief knowing that I'm away from it. It's not going to blow me up.\\" You share in the USA TODAY community, so please keep your comments smart and civil. Don't attack other readers personally, and keep your language decent.

Summary:","response":"The increasing number of roadside bombs (IEDs) being encountered by U.S. forces indicates that the troop surge in Afghanistan is disrupting Taliban strongholds, according to U.S. Marine officers. As the U.S. forces move into areas historically operated by the Taliban, they are driving them out of village safe havens and causing significant casualties. Unable to effectively confront the coalition forces, the Taliban have relied more heavily on IEDs as a method to resist the U.S. advances. Despite the increasing use of IEDs by the Taliban, military experts argue these tactics threaten the course of the war and the effectiveness of the surge by causing mounting casualties and eroding morale."},{"question":"Answer the following question: In ancient China, the State of Wu made an attack on the State of Yue.

Look, your coat is very old.\\" But Einstein answers, \\"It doesn't matter . Nobody knows me here.\\" After a few years, Einstein becomes a famous scientist . But he still wears the old coat. His friend meets him again and asks him to buy a new one. But Einstein says, \\"I don't need to buy a new one. Everyone knows me here.\\" Some years later Einstein _ . A) buys a new one B) becomes a great scientist C) still wears the old clothes D) Both B and C","response":"D) Both B and C Over the years, Einstein goes through different phases of his life. At first, when nobody knows him in New York, he is comfortable wearing his old coat. He believes that since nobody knows him, it doesn't matter what he wears. However, as time passes and he makes significant contributions to the field of science, he becomes a globally renowned scientist – a transformation that highlights option B. But even with this newfound fame, Einstein’s mindset towards his coat remains more or less the same. Though he is aware of his recognition and the expectations people have of him, he still doesn't see the need to buy a new coat. He believes that since everyone knows who he is, it shouldn't matter what he wears. This idea reflects option C. Additionally, the story of Einstein and the old coat could also be seen as an allegory for his general attitude towards materialism. For Einstein, the pursuit of knowledge and understanding the world around him held more importance than superficial appearances or possessions. Hence, his reluctance to replace his old coat illustrates his preference to focus on his work and research rather than on materialistic endeavors. In conclusion, as Einstein becomes a great scientist (option B), he still continues to wear his old clothes, specifically the old coat (option C). Hence, the answer is D) Both B and C."},{"question":"Sentence: name = The Punter, eatType = coffee shop, food = French, priceRange = less than £20, familyFriendly = no, near = Café Sicilia Can you represent the content in this sentence in data form?","response":"Sure, I can represent the content of the given sentence in data form.

It features two octaves of double melody strings in the key of C major ( middle C to C '' ) , and four sets of chord strings ( C major , G major , F major , and D7 ) . Sounding somewhat like a mandolin , the Marxophone 's timbre is also reminiscent of various types of hammered dulcimers . The player typically strums the chords with the left hand . The right hand plays the melody strings by depressing spring steel strips that hold small lead hammers over the strings . A brief stab on a metal strip bounces the hammer off a string pair to produce a single note . Holding the strip down makes the hammer bounce on the double strings , which produces a mandolin - like tremolo . The bounce rate is somewhat fixed , as it is based on the spring steel strip length , hammer weight , and string tension -- but a player can increase the rate slightly by pressing higher on the strip , effectively moving its pivot point closer to the lead hammer . Numerically coded sheet music prepared specifically for the Marxophone indicates when and in what order to play melody and chord strings . This type of music , similar to tablature , was produced for those who could not read standard notation . A rectangular piece of metal provides a backstop for the spring steel hammers , displays the name Marxophone and the patent number , and has clips that hold sheet music . It also marks the 15 keys by letter ( C , D , etc. ) , by number ( 1 - 15 ) and in standard musical notation . When the instrument is moved or stored , the metal rectangle bends down , holding the keys against the strings , so the Marxophone can fit into its case -- which is the size of a large briefcase . - A plectrum is a small flat tool used to pluck or strum a stringed instrument. For hand-held instruments such as guitars and mandolins, the plectrum is often called a pick, and is a separate tool held in the player's hand. In harpsichords, the plectra are attached to the jack mechanism. - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\" - F major (or the key of F) is a major scale based on F, with the pitches F, G, A, B, C, D, and E. Its key signature has one flat, B. - A soprano is a type of classical female singing voice and has the highest vocal range of all voice types. The soprano's vocal range (using scientific pitch notation) is from approximately middle C (C) = 261 Hz to \\"high A\\" (A) =880 Hz in choral music, or to \\"soprano C\\" (C, two octaves above middle C) =1046 Hz or higher in operatic music. In four-part chorale style harmony, the soprano takes the highest part, which usually encompasses the melody. The soprano voice type is generally divided into the coloratura, soubrette, lyric, spinto, and dramatic soprano. The lyric soprano is the most common female singing voice. - Mandobass is the largest (and least common) member of the mandolin family, sometimes used as the bass instrument in mandolin orchestras. It is so large that it usually isn't held in the lap, but supported on a spike which rests on the floor. The neck-scale length on a full-size mando-bass is similar to that of a standard orchestral double bass viol: about 43\\" (110 cm). The instrument is otherwise similar to the smaller, higher-pitched members of the mandolin family, having a fretted neck, a headstock with geared tuning machines, and a large resonating body oftenbut not alwaysshaped like that of other mandolins. - Lute can refer generally to any string instrument having the strings running in a plane parallel to the sound table (in the HornbostelSachs system), more specifically to any plucked string instrument with a neck (either fretted or unfretted) and a deep round back, or more specifically to an instrument from the family of European lutes. - In music, unison is two or more musical parts sounding the same pitch or at an octave interval, usually at the same time. - C major (or the key of C) is a major scale based on C, with the pitches C, D, E, F, G, A, and B. Its key signature has no flats and no sharps. - The harp is a stringed musical instrument which has a number of individual strings running at an angle to its soundboard, which are plucked with the fingers. Harps have been known since antiquity in Asia, Africa, and Europe, dating back at least as early as 3500 BC. The instrument had great popularity in Europe during the Middle Ages and Renaissance, where it evolved into a wide range of variants with new technologies, and was disseminated to Europe's colonies, finding particular popularity in Latin America. While some ancient members of the harp family died out in the Near East and South Asia, descendants of early harps are still played in Burma and in Sub-Saharan Africa, while other defunct variants in Europe and Asia have been revived by musicians in the modern era. - The mandocello is a plucked string instrument of the mandolin family. It has eight strings in four paired courses, tuned in fifths like a mandolin, but is larger, and tuned CC-GG-dd-aa (low to high in pitch). It can be described as being to the mandolin what the cello is to the violin. - G major (or the key of G) is a major scale based on G, with the pitches G, A, B, C, D, E, and F. Its key signature has one sharp, F. - The mandola (US and Canada) or tenor mandola (Ireland and UK) is a fretted, stringed musical instrument. It is to the mandolin what the viola is to the violin: the four double courses of strings tuned in fifths to the same pitches as the viola (C-G-D-A low-to-high), a fifth lower than a mandolin. The mandola, although now rarer, is the ancestor of the mandolin, the name of which means simply \\"little mandola\\". - The major scale or Ionian scale is one of the most commonly used musical scales, especially in Western music. It is one of the diatonic scales. Like many musical scales it is made up of seven notes: the eighth duplicates the first at double its frequency so that it is called a higher octave of the same note (from Latin \\"octavus\\", the eighth). - In musical notation, a key signature is a set of sharp, flat, and rarely, natural symbols placed together on the staff. Key signatures are generally written immediately after the clef at the beginning of a line of musical notation, although they can appear in other parts of a score, notably after a double barline. - The cello (; plural cellos or celli) or violoncello is a bowed string instrument with four strings tuned in perfect fifths. The strings from low to high are generally tuned to C, G, D and A, an octave lower than the viola. It is a member of the violin family of musical instruments, which also includes the violin and viola. - A mandolin (; literally \\"small mandola\\") is a musical instrument in the lute family and is usually plucked with a plectrum or \\"pick\\". It commonly has four courses of doubled metal strings tuned in unison (8 strings), although five (10 strings) and six (12 strings) course versions also exist. The courses are normally tuned in a succession of perfect fifths. It is the soprano member of a family that includes the mandola, octave mandolin, mandocello and mandobass. - The octave mandolin is a fretted string instrument with four pairs of strings tuned in fifths, G, D, A, E (low to high), an octave below a mandolin. It has a 20 to 23-inch scale length and its construction is similar to other instruments in the mandolin family. Usually the courses are all unison pairs but the lower two may sometimes be strung as octave pairs with the higher-pitched octave string on top so that it is hit before the thicker lower-pitched string. Alternate tunings of G, D, A, D and A, D, A, D are often employed by Celtic musicians. What object entity has the relation of 'subclass of' with the subject 'marxophone'?

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: Chytridiomycota: The Chytrids The only class in the Phylum Chytridiomycota is the Chytridiomycetes. The chytrids are the simplest and most primitive Eumycota, or true fungi. The evolutionary record shows that the first recognizable chytrids appeared during the late preCambrian period, more than 500 million years ago. Like all fungi, chytrids have chitin in their cell walls, but one group of chytrids has both cellulose and chitin in the cell wall. Most chytrids are unicellular; a few form multicellular organisms and hyphae, which have no septa between cells (coenocytic). They produce gametes and diploid zoospores that swim with the help of a single flagellum. The ecological habitat and cell structure of chytrids have much in common with protists. Chytrids usually live in aquatic environments, although some species live on land. Some species thrive as parasites on plants, insects, or amphibians (Figure 24.10), while others are saprobes. The chytrid species Allomyces is well characterized as an experimental organism. Its reproductive cycle includes both asexual and sexual phases.

Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people. - Kurixalus is a genus of frogs in the family Rhacophoridae. The taxonomy of small rhacophids is difficult and has been subject to many revisions, but molecular genetic data do support monophyly of \\"Kurixalus\\". These frogs are distributed from Himalayan front ranges of eastern India southward and eastward to Cambodia, Vietnam, southern China, Taiwan, and the Ryukyu Islands. - South India is the area encompassing the Indian states of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, and Telangana as well as the union territories of Andaman and Nicobar, Lakshadweep and Puducherry, occupying 19.31% of India's area. Covering the southern part of the peninsular Deccan Plateau, South India is bounded by the Bay of Bengal in the east, the Arabian Sea in the west and the Indian Ocean in the south. The geography of the region is diverse with two mountain ranges - the Western and Eastern Ghats, bordering the plateau heartland. Godavari, Krishna, Kaveri, Tungabhadra and Vaigai rivers are important non-perennial sources of water. Bangalore, Chennai, Hyderabad, Visakhapatnam, Vijayawada, Coimbatore and Kochi are the largest urban areas. - Sub-Saharan Africa is, geographically, the area of the continent of Africa that lies south of the Sahara desert. According to the UN, it consists of all African countries that are fully or partially located south of the Sahara. It contrasts with North Africa, whose territories are part of the League of Arab states within the Arab world. Somalia, Djibouti, Comoros and Mauritania are geographically in Sub-Saharan Africa, but are likewise Arab states and part of the Arab world. - A tree frog is any species of frog that spends a major portion of its lifespan in trees, known as an arboreal state. Several lineages of frogs among the Neobatrachia have given rise to tree frogs, although they are not closely related to each other. - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water. - China, officially the People's Republic of China (PRC), is a unitary sovereign state in East Asia. With a population of over 1.381 billion, it is the world's most populous country. The state is governed by the Communist Party of China, and its capital is Beijing. It exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and two mostly self-governing special administrative regions (Hong Kong and Macau), and claims sovereignty over Taiwan. The country's major urban areas include Shanghai, Guangzhou, Beijing, Chongqing, Shenzhen, Tianjin and Hong Kong. China is a great power and a major regional power within Asia, and has been characterized as a potential superpower. - Chiromantis ( commonly known as the foam - nest frog or foam - nest tree frog ) is a genus of frogs in the family Rhacophoridae . It contains species from the Sub-Saharan African tropics as well as from South and East Asia ( northeastern India , Bangladesh , China , Mainland Southeast Asia , and Borneo ) . The Asian species were formerly assigned to Chirixalus , but this taxon was shown to be paraphyletic with respect to African Chiromantis . Consequently , Chirixalus were included in Chiromantis . Monophyly of Chiromantis also required erecting a new genus Feihyla for \`\` Chirixalus palpebralis '' . - The Rhacophoridae are a family of frog species, which occur in tropical sub-Saharan Africa, South India and Sri Lanka, Japan; northeastern India to eastern China south through the Philippines and Greater Sundas, and Sulawesi.

Among the most spectacular members of this family are numerous \\"flying frogs\\". - Theloderma is a genus of frogs in the family Rhacophoridae, subfamily Rhacophorinae. They are found in South, Southeast and East Asia. They are sometimes known as bug-eyed frogs or warty treefrogs. Their sister taxon is \\"Nyctixalus\\". The taxonomy of this genus and \\"Nyctixalus\\" as well as \\"\\"Theloderma\\" moloch\\" has been in flux; as of early 2017, the AmphibiaWeb includes \\"Nyctixalus\\" in \\"Theloderma\\" whereas the Amphibian Species of the World keeps them separate. - Chirixalus is a now-synonymized genus in the moss frog family (Rhacophoridae).

Deism, according to Thomas Paine, is the simple belief in God the Creator, with no reference to the Bible or any other miraculous source. Instead, the Deist relies solely on personal reason to guide his creed, which was eminently agreeable to many thinkers of the time. Atheism was much discussed, but there were few proponents. Wilson and Reill note that, \\"In fact, very few enlightened intellectuals, even when they were vocal critics of Christianity, were true atheists. Rather, they were critics of orthodox belief, wedded rather to skepticism, deism, vitalism, or perhaps pantheism.\\" Some followed Pierre Bayle and argued that atheists could indeed be moral men. Many others like Voltaire held that without belief in a God who punishes evil, the moral order of society was undermined. That is, since atheists gave themselves to no Supreme Authority and no law, and had no fear of eternal consequences, they were far more likely to disrupt society. Bayle (1647–1706) observed that in his day, \\"prudent persons will always maintain an appearance of [religion].\\". He believed that even atheists could hold concepts of honor and go beyond their own self-interest to create and interact in society. Locke said that if there were no God and no divine law, the result would be moral anarchy: every individual \\"could have no law but his own will, no end but himself. He would be a god to himself, and the satisfaction of his own will the sole measure and end of all his actions\\".\\". Can you tell me what it is? Answer:","response":"The answer to the question \\"Who is supposed by a religious scholar of the time to place themselves in the position of god?\\" is found in the part where Locke states, \\"He would be a god to himself, and the satisfaction of his own will the sole measure and end of all his actions.\\". In this context, the person who places themselves in the position of god is an individual who does not believe in any God or divine law. This person follows their own will and desires, acting as a god to themselves. This view was of concern to some thinkers like Locke, who believed that the absence of a belief in God could lead to moral anarchy."},{"question":"Answer the following question. Which king appointed John Dryden as the first official Poet Laureate?","response":"John Dryden was appointed as the first official Poet Laureate by King Charles II of England. Charles II was the monarch of the three kingdoms of England, Scotland, and Ireland, reigning from the year 1660 until his death in 1685. Born on May 29, 1630, Charles II was a prominent figure of the British Restoration period that commenced with the monarchy's restoration after the demise of the Commonwealth of England, Scotland, and Ireland. During the Restoration period, there was a revival of arts, literature, and culture. Charles II was a patron of the arts and took an active interest in the promotion of literary works. His reign witnessed the rise of many artists and writers who went on to achieve prominence in their respective fields. John Dryden, an English poet, literary critic, and playwright, was appointed the first official Poet Laureate in 1668. Born on August 9, 1631, Dryden was a major literary figure in Restoration England. Prior to his appointment as Poet Laureate, Dryden had written several successful plays, poems, and works of literary criticism. He played an influential role in refining the English language and defining the literary style of the time, which made him a deserving candidate for the role of Poet Laureate. The role of Poet Laureate in the United Kingdom is an honorary one, traditionally given to a poet who is expected to create verse for significant national occasions and events. While there were earlier poets who served in similar capacities before John Dryden, it was during King Charles II's reign that the position was officially recognized and sanctioned. The appointment of Dryden as the first official Poet Laureate by King Charles II set the stage for a long line of poets who would hold this prestigious position, contributing greatly to English literature and history in the process. It is worth noting that John Dryden's appointment as Poet Laureate was influenced by his political inclination towards the Stuart court. During his tenure as Poet Laureate, Dryden published several odes and poems on themes related to politics, religion, and the monarchy. However, after the ascension of the Protestant King William III and Queen Mary II in the Glorious Revolution of 1688, Dryden, a Roman Catholic convert, lost his position as Poet Laureate due to his religious and political affiliations. Despite losing his title, Dryden continued to make significant contributions to English literature until his death on May 12, 1700."},{"question":"Answer the following question.

Nothing could be smarter, not anything better calculated to disguise a man. Disguise, as any actor or detective can tell you, is not so much a matter of make- up as suggestion. It is little mannerisms--unstudied habits that identify. The suggestion that you are some one else is the thing to strive for, not the concealment of who you really are. Grim's skin had been sun-tanned in the Arab campaign under Lawrence against the Turks. The Shereefian helmet is a compromise between the East and West, having a strip of cloth hanging down behind it as far as the shoulders and covering the ears on either side, to take the place of the Arab head-dress. The khaki uniform had just enough of Oriental touch about it to distinguish it from that of a British officer. No man inexperienced in disguise would dream of choosing it; for the simple reason that it would not seem to him disguise enough.

Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) has found himself in a very bright spotlight. The third-term congressman and former federal prosecutor is being floated as a potential candidate for House majority leader, someone who could upend the race between Reps. Tom Price (R-Ga.) and Steve Scalise (R-La.). On Tuesday morning, the Draft Gowdy movement picked up steam, but by Tuesday midday it looked like the South Carolina congressman wasn’t interested, though could still be convinced. [The roller coaster rise and fall of Trey Gowdy for House majority leader] But who is Gowdy? An intense and popular South Carolinian who avoids personal attention from the media, he’s best known for leading the House Select Committee on Benghazi, a long-running investigation that Democrats criticize as a ploy to undermine Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. The Benghazi effort made Gowdy a conservative champion, even though his appointment was mostly thanks to his trajectory as a rising star on the House Oversight Committee, sanctioned and propelled by leadership. His ties between establishment and conservative Republicans give Gowdy a unique position within the Republican Conference. He would be an attractive choice to both members of the conservative Freedom Caucus, who count him as a friend and compatriot, and establishment-leaning reps like Oversight Chair Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), another Gowdy confidant. Elected in 2010, Gowdy was immediately awarded a plum spot as an Oversight subcommittee chair, overseeing healthcare and the District of Columbia. This perch — unusual for a freshman with no legislative experience — made Gowdy a go-to voice on the right for criticism of Obamacare and a variety of other Obama administration controversies such as the “Fast and Furious” gun-running episode. For a sign of his popularity, one need only look to Twitter, where Gowdy’s followers outnumber Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy’s (R-Calif.) by 147,000. Credit regular prime-time appearances on Fox News for that. Of course, more than anything else, the Benghazi panel promises to most define Gowdy’s legacy should he not seek a leadership position, and he has poured considerable energy into defending the necessity, even the righteousness, of the probe. Outside of a potential leadership race, the next big event for Gowdy will take place on Oct. 22, when Hillary Clinton comes to Capitol Hill to testify on the 2012 Benghazi attacks. Democrats already are showing signs of stepping up their criticism of Gowdy’s approach, and the event next month will be challenging because of its political sensitivity and the sheer level of media chaos. Republicans are confident that Gowdy can weather the madness, pointing to his hardened public persona as a sign of strength. A souvenir of his days in court, Gowdy’s style — polished, dogged and no-nonsense, with a strong measure of disdain for the press — elicits significant respect from Republican colleagues and has evolved into an unusual charisma of its own (watch below). Gowdy was elected in 2010 as part of the first tea party wave, and he entered Congress alongside Reps. Raul Labrador (R-Idaho), Justin Amash (R-Mich.) and Mick Mulvaney (R-S.C.), core members of the House’s conservative wing. McCarthy was Republican whip when the 2010 freshman class came to Capitol Hill, and he actively courted their friendship, turning his office in H-107 into a kind of flophouse for new members. Though Labrador, Amash and Mulvaney might not be close to McCarthy now, Gowdy is, and this could help him advance a leadership bid if he so chooses. Plus, this isn’t the first time his name has been floated for leadership. Last December, the Tea Party Leadership Fund launched an online campaign to draft Gowdy as a challenger to Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio). At the time, through a spokeswoman, Gowdy said he had no interest. The same pattern appears to be repeating itself. But you can be sure Gowdy, regardless of what position he holds in the new House order, will still relish wielding his particular brand of power as everyone’s friend, the bridge between the establishment and the right flank. Elise Viebeck is a national enterprise reporter for The Washington Post.

Malaysia's police chief, Khalid Abu Bakar, said an examination of the simulator, taken from the home of pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah, 53, showed its data log had been cleared on February 3, more than a month before the airliner, carrying 239 people, disappeared on a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. \\"The experts are looking at what are the logs that have been cleared,\\" he told a news conference. No wreckage has been found from Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370, which vanished from air traffic control screens off Malaysia's east coast at 1:21 a.m. local time on March 8 (1721 GMT March 7), less than an hour after taking off. Malaysia has now made available to the FBI electronic data generated by both pilots of Flight MH370, including data from a hard drive attached to the captain's flight simulator, and from electronic media used by the co-pilot, Fariq Abdul Hamid, a U.S. law enforcement official told Reuters. The official said he could not confirm that some data had been wiped from the simulator and stressed that there was no guarantee the FBI analysis would turn up any fresh clues. U.S. investigators had become increasingly frustrated in recent days that Malaysian authorities had not asked them for more help. The FBI has extensive experience investigating airplane crashes, including those of TWA 800 and EgyptAir 990 off the U.S. east coast in the 1990s and Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland. In the case of EgyptAir 990, the FBI helped air safety investigators establish that the crash was caused by a suicidal co-pilot, while in the case of Pan Am 103, the agency worked with British and U.S. intelligence to build a case against the government of Libya. In Kuala Lumpur, at the headquarters of a search operation that has so far turned up few leads, Chinese relatives' anger over sparse information on the fate of their relatives sparked chaotic scenes on Wednesday. Malaysia's transport minister ordered an inquiry after security guards carried out the distraught mother of a passenger from a briefing room where she had protested about a lack of transparency. \\"They are just saying wait for information. Wait for information. We don't know how long we have to wait,\\" cried the woman before being whisked away from a massive media scrum. Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said he regretted the anguish. \\"Malaysia is doing everything in its power to find MH370 and hopefully bring some degree of closure for those whose family members are missing,\\" he said in a statement. DWINDLING HOPES Prospects that a 26-nation operation would lead to quick results appeared to be dwindling, however, as investigators confirmed they were focusing on the remote southern Indian Ocean after failing to find any traces of the jet further north. \\"Our top priority is being given to that area,\\" Hishammuddin told the news conference, confirming an earlier Reuters report. Australia is leading the search in the southern part of the southern corridor, with assistance from the U.S. Navy. It has shrunk its search field based on satellite tracking data and analysis of weather and currents, but it still covers an area of 600,000 sq km (230,000 sq miles), roughly the size of Spain and Portugal. The unprecedented search for the Boeing 777-200ER had focused on two vast search corridors: one arcing north overland from Laos towards the Caspian Sea, the other curving south across the Indian Ocean from west of Indonesia's Sumatra island to west of Australia. \\"The working assumption is that it went south, and furthermore that it went to the southern end of that corridor,\\" said a source close to the investigation. That view is based on the lack of any evidence from countries along the northern corridor that the plane entered their airspace, and the failure to find any trace of wreckage in searches in the upper part of the southern corridor. Some sources involved in the investigation have voiced fears it could stall due to the reluctance of countries in the region to share militarily sensitive radar data that might shed new light on the direction the jet took. Two people familiar with the investigation said the search had been hampered in some cases by delays over the paperwork needed to allow foreign maritime surveillance aircraft into territorial waters without a formal diplomatic request. \\"These are basically spy planes; that's what they were designed for,\\" said one source close to the investigation, explaining the hesitance of some nations to give blanket permission for other countries to scour their waters. Hishammuddin confirmed that some assets that could be involved in the search were waiting for diplomatic clearance. \\"The search for MH370 involves diplomatic, technical and logistical challenges,\\" he told the news conference, held in a Kuala Lumpur airport hotel that has served as a temporary crisis coordination centre and a base for dozens of news organizations. DELIBERATELY DIVERTED Malaysian and U.S. officials believe the aircraft was deliberately diverted perhaps thousands of miles off course, but an exhaustive background search of the passengers and crew aboard has not yielded anything that might explain why. If the plane did indeed end up in the southern Indian Ocean, one of the remotest places on Earth and also one of the deepest seas, it increases the chance it may never be found - and investigators may never know for sure what happened on board. Officials believe that someone with detailed knowledge of both the Boeing 777 and commercial aviation navigation switched off two vital datalinks: the ACARS system, which relays maintenance data back to the ground, and the transponder, which enables the plane to be seen by civilian radar. U.S. agencies have looked for evidence that anyone other than the pilots knew how disable ACARS but have found nothing.

The aircraft, he added, “could provide the necessary information to lead salvage ships to the wreckage.” Photo As the possible break in what had been a fruitless search was being pursued, the Malaysian authorities were seeking help from the F.B.I. to help retrieve deleted computer data from a homemade flight simulator belonging to the captain of the Malaysia Airlines jet that vanished 11 days ago, their first request for high-level American assistance in solving the mystery of the missing plane.

The investigators face a formidable set of mechanical, avionic and satellite communication puzzles. Flight 370 was about 40 minutes into a six-hour trip to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian capital, early on March 8 when it suddenly stopped communicating with air traffic controllers and turned far off course, cutting back across peninsular Malaysia, over the Strait of Malacca and toward the Indian Ocean. Military radar tracked it for a while, but the operators did not seek to identify the plane or alert anyone. A satellite over the ocean picked up automated signals for several more hours — facts not released publicly for days after the plane vanished.

Mar. 8, 2014 00:41 AM A Boeing 777-200 operated by Malaysia Airlines leaves Kuala Lumpur bound for Beijing with 227 passengers, of which two-thirds are Chinese, and a Malaysian crew of 12.

Detecting a Plane Mar. 8, 2014 01:37 AM The Acars system fails to send its scheduled signal, indicating that it has been shut off or has failed sometime in the past half-hour. Mar. 8, 2014 02:15 AM An unidentified plane flying westward is detected by military radar. It ascends to 45,000 feet, above the approved limit for a Boeing 777, then descends unevenly to 23,000 feet and eventually flies out over the Indian Ocean. Investigators later conclude that it was Flight 370. It was last plotted 200 miles northwest of Panang. Q. and A. Mar. 8, 2014 06:30 AM By now Flight 370 was scheduled to have landed in Beijing. Mar. 8, 2014 07:24 AM Malaysia Airlines announces that it has lost contact with the aircraft. Mar. 8, 2014 08:11 AM The last complete signal is received from an automated satellite system on the plane, suggesting that it was still intact and flying. The Malaysian authorities say the jet had enough fuel to keep flying for perhaps a half-hour after this. Search Area Expanded Mar. 8, 2014 08:19 AM Inmarsat, a satellite communications company, says an incomplete signal representing a “partial handshake\\" may have been received. Further analysis of satellite data confirms that the jet went down in the southern Indian Ocean. Mar. 15, 2014 00:00 AM The Malaysian authorities say the investigation has become a criminal matter because the jet appears to have been deliberately diverted. The plane's first turn off course, to the west, was executed using an onboard computer, probably programmed by someone with knowledge of aircraft systems. The authorities say two passengers were Iranians who boarded using stolen European passports, but no links to terrorist groups are found. The satellite “pings” led investigators to conclude that the plane had made its way to some point along one of two long, arcing corridors that together embrace 2.24 million square nautical miles of sea and land.

The Malaysian police, who found that Mr. Zaharie had built a flight simulator at his home, said Wednesday that some data had been erased from the simulator on Feb. 3, more than a month before the ill-fated flight. Evidence suggests that whoever diverted the plane knew how to disable its communications systems and program course changes, and the data recorded in the pilot’s flight simulator may shed light on whether he was involved. But building and using flight simulators at home is a popular hobby among aviation enthusiasts, and the deletion of data from Mr. Zaharie’s simulator may have been routine housekeeping. Mr. Zaharie did not keep his simulator a secret: He posted a video on YouTube more than a year ago showing him sitting in front of it.

Australian search teams have been at the forefront of the hunt for the missing plane in the remote southern Indian Ocean. The announcement from Abbott raises hopes of finding parts of the plane after a huge search that is now in its 13th day. Previous reports of debris found in the sea have not turned out to be related to the passenger jet, which vanished over Southeast Asia earlier this month. But those reports came before the search area was massively expanded into two large arcs, one that heads northwest into Asia, the other southwest into the Indian Ocean. The Malaysian military is checking the new information from Australian authorities, a source close to the investigation told CNN. \\"Verification might take some time. It is very far and it will take some time to locate and verify the objects,\\" the source said. Malaysia's Acting Transportation Secretary Hishammuddin Hussein said Abbott had informed Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak of the development Thursday. \\"At this stage, Australian officials have yet to establish whether these objects are indeed related to the search for MH370,\\" Hishammuddin said. Other pieces of information related to the investigation into the plane's disappearance had emerged Wednesday. Flight simulator probed Investigators looking at the flight simulator taken from the home of Capt. Zaharie Ahmad Shah, the pilot of the plane, have discovered that some data had been deleted from it, Hishammuddin said at a news conference. What the revelation means is unclear. It could be another dead end in an investigation that has been full of them so far, or it could provide further evidence for the theory that one or more of the flight crew may have been involved in the plane's disappearance 12 days ago. \\"It may not tell us anything. It's a step in the process,\\" one U.S. law enforcement source told CNN. \\"It could be a very insignificant detail in the process.\\" Investigators have been looking into the background of all 239 passengers and crew members aboard the plane that vanished in the early morning hours of March 8 while en route from the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Particular attention has focused on the pilot and first officer on Flight 370, but authorities have yet to come up with any evidence explaining why either of them would have taken the jetliner off course. Hishammuddin didn't say what had been deleted, but simulation programs can store data from previous sessions for later playback. He also did not say who might have deleted the data. FBI examination Specialists are examining the simulator in hopes of recovering the data that was deleted, Hishammuddin said.

Hide Caption 43 of 43 Among them are experts at the FBI's forensics lab in Quantico, Virginia, who are examining a copy of the simulator's hard drive, as well as a copy of the hard drive from the computer of co-pilot Fariq Ab Hamid, law enforcement sources told CNN. The FBI examination of the computer drives involves sorting through a large volume of data, according to a senior U.S. official with knowledge of the investigation. \\"It is going to take some period of time, but we are analyzing it with a great degree of urgency. It is prioritized right at the top because the world is trying to figure this out,\\" the official said on condition of anonymity. Deleted files from Shah's simulator could reveal it had been used to practice diverting the plane and flying it to an unfamiliar airport, experts said. But even if investigators retrieve past simulations showing that Zaharie practiced flying to seemingly odd locations, that doesn't necessarily indicate evidence of anything nefarious, said Mary Schiavo, a CNN aviation analyst and former inspector general for the U.S. Department of Transportation. \\"You put in strange airports and try to land there, just to see if you can do it,\\" said Schiavo, adding that she sometimes does just that on the flight simulation program on her home computer. 'Grasping at straws' President Barack Obama called the search for Flight 370 \\"a top priority,\\" telling KDFW of Dallas on Wednesday that the United States will keep working on it. \\"We have put every resource that we have available at the disposal of the search process,\\" he said. But beyond help with the computer drives, the Malaysian government has not put in a formal request for additional FBI help overseas, according to the senior U.S. official. \\"We have made it clear we are ready to provide help whenever they need it,\\" the official said. \\"We are grasping at straws. No one is running on anything white hot.\\" More than 60 ships and 50 aircraft are participating in the search. But at least two aircraft, a Japanese search plane and a U.S. Navy P-3 Orion, sat on a runway at a Subang air base this week after Indonesia refused to allow the planes to fly through its airspace. \\"From what I understand, this is an international operation,\\" Cmdr. William Marks, spokesman for the U.S. Navy's 7th Fleet, told CNN by telephone. \\"...I'm confident we're going to be flying today or very soon.\\" Later, Indonesia's military spokesman told CNN clearance was given to all search planes. Although the search area spans nearly 3 million square miles, a U.S. government official familiar with the investigation said the missing plane is most likely somewhere in the southern Indian Ocean. \\"This is an area out of normal shipping lanes, out of any commercial flight patterns, with few fishing boats, and there are no islands,\\" the official said, warning that the search could well last \\"weeks and not days.\\" Angry families want answers The lack of progress has angered and frustrated families, who have accused Malaysian officials of withholding information. Some family members staged a protest at the Kuala Lumpur hotel where media covering the search are staying. Their efforts were cut short by security guards who removed them through a crush of reporters, dragging one as she screamed.

They gather daily for a briefing with officials. Ye Lun, whose brother-in-law is on the missing plane, says every day is the same. He and his group leave the hotel in the morning for a daily briefing, and that's it. They go back to the hotel to watch the news on television. In a statement, Hishammuddin said Malaysian authorities \\"regret the scenes at this afternoon's press conference.\\" \\"One can only imagine the anguish they are going through,\\" he said of the families. \\"Malaysia is doing everything in its power to find MH370 and hopefully bring some degree of closure for those whose family members are missing.\\" An abrupt change in direction The disappearance continues to intrigue the public and frustrate officials, who have turned up no sign of the plane despite the involvement of teams from 26 nations. On Tuesday, a law enforcement official told CNN that the aircraft's first major change of course -- an abrupt westward turn that took the plane off its route to China and back across the Malay Peninsula -- was almost certainly programmed by somebody in the cockpit. The change was entered into the plane's system at least 12 minutes before a person in the cockpit, believed to be the co-pilot, signed off to air traffic controllers. Two minutes after the signoff, the plane's transponder stopped communicating details about the plane's altitude, speed and heading. Some experts said the change in direction could have been part of an alternate flight plan programmed in advance in case of emergency; others suggested it could show something more nefarious was afoot. But Hishammuddin said Wednesday that \\"there is no additional waypoint on MH370's documented flight plan, which depicts normal routing all the way to Beijing.\\" The Thai military, meanwhile, said it had spotted the plane turning west toward the Strait of Malacca early on March 8. That supports the analysis of Malaysian military radar that has the plane flying out over the Strait of Malacca and into the Indian Ocean. But it didn't make it any clearer where the plane went next. Authorities say information from satellites suggests the plane kept flying for about six hours after it was last detected by Malaysian military radar. Malaysian authorities, who are coordinating the search, say the available evidence suggests the missing plane flew off course in a deliberate act by someone who knew what they were doing.

They've received background checks for all passengers on board, with the exception of those from Russia and Ukraine, Hishammuddin said. So far, no information of significance has been found about any passengers, Hishammuddin said. China says it has found nothing suspicious during background checks on its citizens on the flight -- a large majority of the plane's passengers. And some experts have warned against hastily jumping to conclusions about the role of the pilots. \\"I've worked on many cases were the pilots were suspect, and it turned out to be a mechanical and horrible problem,\\" said Schiavo. \\"And I have a saying myself: Sometimes, an erratic flight path is heroism, not terrorism.\\" Ticking clock Searchers are racing the clock in their efforts to find the plane and its flight-data and cockpit-voice recorders. The devices have batteries designed to send out pings for 30 days. That leaves 18 days until the batteries are expected to run out. The task is being complicated by the scope of the search area, as well as the depth of some of the waters being searched -- up to 23,000 feet (7,000 meters). Searchers trying to find and retrieve wreckage and bodies from Air France Flight 447, which crashed into the Atlantic Ocean in 2009, had to use unmanned submarines. It took nearly two years to find the bulk of the wreckage, including the flight data recorders, in waters nearly 12,000 feet deep. It took even longer to determine what happened to the plane. ||||| Summary:","response":"An extensive investigation into the missing Malaysian airliner, flight MH370, is ongoing.

People of all ages, from children to older adults, are observed to face increasing levels of stress, anxiety, and depression, often caused by competitive academic and workplace environments and societal pressures. The economical cost of mental health issues globally is immense, with billions of dollars spent annually on healthcare and productivity losses. In addition to traditional approaches, such as psychotherapy and medication, researchers are investigating the potential benefits of physical exercise on mental health. Many studies have explored the correlation between physical activity and the reduction of stress levels, anxiety, and depression symptoms. One common belief is that physical exercise can result in the release of endorphins, which are known to help produce a sense of well-being and happiness. Moreover, exercise may also contribute to better sleep, improved self-esteem, and better cognitive function. Hypothesis: Regular Physical Exercise Leads to Improved Mental Health Outcomes Based on the context provided, the hypothesis to be tested is that regular physical exercise leads to improved mental health outcomes, such as reduced levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. If true, this hypothesis could carry significant implications for healthcare providers, schools, employers, and policymakers, as they could develop interventions to include physical exercise as a preventative or complementary treatment in mental health care plans. To test this hypothesis, one must conduct a series of controlled, randomized experiments involving different exercise programs with participants of varying ages, genders, and socioeconomic backgrounds. These exercises could range from cardiovascular activities like running or swimming to strength training and yoga. By following these participants over a specific period, researchers would track the changes in their mental health status by using various assessment tools and self-report questionnaires. Upon analyzing the collected data, if there is a strong correlation between regular physical exercise and improvements in mental health, that would support the hypothesis. This could potentially pave the way for reassessing mental health treatment approaches, in which physical exercise plays a significant role. It could also encourage public health campaigns or organizational policies to prioritize exercise as a means of promoting mental well-being, ultimately contributing to a healthier and happier society."},{"question":"Answer the following question: You are considering whether to buy a product.

Lottery officials released the winning numbers for the largest multistate Powerball jackpot: 22, 10,13,14, 52, and the Powerball number is 11. One winning ticket was sold at a Publix supermarket in Zephyrhills, Florida, according to David Bishop, deputy secretary of the Florida lottery. Saturday's jackpot is a record 590.5 million. It marks the largest in Powerball history, surpassing a 587.6 million jackpot split by winners in Arizona and Missouri in November. The jackpot has a cash value of 376.9 million. \\"I buy mine here all the time. Yesterday, I was in Naples. I bought it in Naples, That's just my luck,\\" Butch Gonzalez, a regular lottery player, told CNN affiliate Bay News 9 outside the Publix in Zephyrhills. \\"I just hope whoever won really needs the money, and I hope they do right by it,\\" he said. The largest lottery jackpot in U.S. history was 656 million in the Mega Millions game in March 2012. That was split among three tickets sold in Illinois, Kansas and Maryland. If there had been no winner in Saturday's Powerball, the jackpot would have shot up to 925 million for Wednesday's drawing, according to Kelly Cripe, spokeswoman for the Texas Lottery, which is part of the Powerball game. Powerball is played in 43 states, the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands. A single ticket costs 2, and the odds of winning the jackpot are 1 in 175,223,510. Why you keep playing the lottery. Hate to break it to you, but you stand a better chance of walking onto the golf course and hitting two consecutive holes in one than winning the jackpot. But that didn't stop hundreds from driving to the Trex Mart in Dearborn, Missouri, where one of two winning tickets was sold in last year's 587 million Powerball drawing. About 100 people an hour were buying tickets at the store. At a convenience store in Riverside, Missouri, Jim Mansell said he was buying only one ticket. \\"I figure if the good Lord intends you to win, you only need one ticket,\\" he told CNN affiliate KCTV5. \\"But I don't know if the good Lord believes in gambling or not.\\" In Florida, winners must claim prizes at a state lottery retailer or lottery district office on or before the 180th day after the drawing.

In today's age of goaltending there are two common styles, butterfly and hybrid (hybrid is a mix of the traditional stand-up style and butterfly technique). Because of the power of shots, the goaltender wears special equipment designed to protect the body from direct impact. The goalie is one of the most valuable players on the ice, as their performance can greatly change the outcome or score of the game. One-on-one situations, such as breakaways and shootouts, have the tendency to highlight a goaltender's pure skill, or lack thereof. Only one goaltender is allowed to be on the ice for each team at any given time. - Delaware is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic and/or Northeastern regions of the United States.

Built in 1890, the building originally served as a trolley barn, before becoming a multi-purpose arena. The Gardens opened 3 years after a fire destroyed the city's prior sports arena, the Schenley Park Casino, in 1896. Over the years, the Gardens was the home arena of several of Pittsburgh's historic sports teams, such as ice hockey's Pittsburgh Pirates and Pittsburgh Hornets. The Western Pennsylvania Hockey League, which was the first ice hockey league to openly hire and trade players, played all of its games at the Gardens. The arena was also the first hockey rink to ever use glass above the dasher boards. Developed locally by the Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company, Herculite glass was first tested in Pittsburgh. Most rinks were using wire mesh before the shatterproof glass was invented. Finally, the Pittsburgh Ironmen, a charter member of the Basketball Association of America (a forerunner of the National Basketball Association), played at the Gardens from 1946-1947. - Baron Édouard-Émile-Albert de Laveleye (Ghent, 22 October 1854-Brussels, 23 November 1938) was a Belgian mining engineer, financier and writer.

The first Cup was awarded in 1893 to Montreal HC, and subsequent winners from 1893 to 1914 were determined by challenge games and league play. Professional teams first became eligible to challenge for the Stanley Cup in 1906. In 1915, the two professional ice hockey organizations, the National Hockey Association (NHA) and the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA), reached a gentlemen's agreement in which their respective champions would face each other annually for the Stanley Cup. After a series of league mergers and folds, it was established as the \\"de facto\\" championship trophy of the NHL in 1926 and then the \\"de jure\\" NHL championship prize in 1947. - A bronze medal in sports and other similar areas involving competition is a medal made of bronze awarded to the third-place finisher of contests or competitions such as the Olympic Games, Commonwealth Games, etc. The outright winner receives a gold medal and the second place a silver medal. More generally, bronze is traditionally the most common metal used for all types of high-quality medals, including artistic ones. The practice of awarding bronze third place medals began at the 1904 Olympic Games in St. Louis, Missouri, prior to which only first and second places were awarded. - A medal or medallion is, strictly speaking, a small, flat, and round (at times, ovoid) piece of metal that has been sculpted, molded, cast, struck, stamped, or some way marked with an insignia, portrait, or other artistic rendering.

Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning?","response":"To decorate your school folder, there are several solutions that you can consider. To determine which option is best for you, let's break down each method in terms of naive physics reasoning. 1. Using stickers and decals: Stickers and decals provide an easy, low-cost way to personalize your folder. You can select from a wide range of decorative options that represent your interests and hobbies, such as sports, music, animals, or popular culture. This method offers a substantial degree of customization, and if you choose to use non-permanent adhesive stickers, you can always switch things up whenever you want. Naive physics reasoning: Stickers and decals adhere to the folder's surface using fundamental principles of adhesion. As long as they're placed with a bit of pressure and smoothed out to avoid air bubbles, they should maintain their stickiness. 2. Drawing or doodling with markers, pens, or pencils: This method enables you to engage your creativity by designing your own images, patterns, or phrases directly on the folder. If you're talented in the realm of visual arts, this can be an excellent way to express yourself. You can use permanent markers for durability or colored pencils for a more subtle effect. Naive physics reasoning: The interaction between the drawing implements and the folder's surface results in color transfer. By pressing the drawing implement against the folder's surface, the pigments within the implement spread and bind to the material of the folder, creating an enduring design. 3. Collages or mixed media: Using cut-outs from magazines, newspapers, or printed images from the internet, you can create a collage on your folder. This method offers a diverse array of visual elements and is excellent for showcasing multiple interests. You can use glue, double-sided tape, or other adhesive materials to affix the cut-outs to the folder. Naive physics reasoning: The adhesive affixes the cut-outs onto the folder by sticking to both surfaces and creating a bond. The strength of the bond will depend on the type and quality of the adhesive, as well as proper application to both surfaces for the most secure attachment. 4. Painting: With some acrylic or tempera paints, you can decorate your folder with different colors, patterns, or landscapes. This method allows for bold and unique designs, making your folder stand out. However, it's essential to ensure that the paint has fully dried before using or storing your folder to avoid smudging or transferring paint onto other surfaces or objects. Naive physics reasoning: The paint adheres to the folder's surface through a process called \\"mechanical adhesion,\\" in which the paint particles attach themselves to the folder's material and dry. As long as the paint is applied appropriately and allowed to dry completely, the design should be durable and long-lasting. Based on naive physics reasoning, all solutions have a sound foundation in terms of decorating your school folder. The ideal solution depends on your personal preferences, artistic skills, and available resources. Consider factors like practicality, durability, and the level of personal expression before choosing the method that best suits your needs."},{"question":"Write a negative movie review.","response":"Title: Failure to Launch: A Cinematic Catastrophe From the moment the title of the movie, 'Failure to Launch,' appeared on-screen, the audience was left with a sour taste in their mouths. The film, which stars an uninspiring ensemble cast led by Tim Awfulton and Sandra Lackluster, fails so miserably as a romantic comedy that one is compelled to question if the filmmakers were indeed aiming for a comedic result. It's an uninspiring, lackluster attempt at entertainment that can only leave viewers with a sense of what could have been, had the direction, acting, and scriptwriting been in better hands. The disastrous plot revolves around a 30-something man, played by Awfulton, who has become stagnant in his life, reluctant to leave the comfort of his parents' home and unwilling to pursue a meaningful adult relationship. The parents, portrayed by equally unexciting actors, are desperate to set their son on the right path and hire a \\"life coach\\" in the form of lackluster's character to motivate and encourage him. Setting the stage for a predictable and shakily structured storyline, the film meanders through a series of tired clichés and stale jokes, none of which manage to raise more than a half-hearted chuckle from the audience. The lack of on-screen chemistry between Awfulton and Lackluster is palpable; their attempts at forging a romantic bond as hollow and forced as the overused three-dimensional tropes that litter the script. Supporting characters are introduced without substance, playing one-dimensional roles that offer nothing in terms of character arc or development. They seem to exist solely to prop up an already failing narrative, and their efforts constitute only so much wasted screen time. 'Failure to Launch' tries to deliver heartwarming lessons and emotional growth through its characters, but these efforts are stifled by a poorly written script and bland acting. Add to the mix shoddy cinematography and uninteresting visuals, and it is clear that this movie lacks genuine effort or passion from those involved in its creation. Subplots are unclear, strained, and often left unresolved, as if the filmmakers lost interest in their own story. It's rare to find a romantic comedy where even the staple rom-com elements are mistreated. The supposedly heartwarming moments in 'Failure to Launch' instead create an atmosphere of confusion, often leaving one wondering if those involved in the film's production understood what they intended to convey. Composer John Forgettable's score is lackluster and often intrusive, blatantly underlining plot points in case the audience didn’t catch them through the dismal storytelling. This further exemplifies the film's lack of subtlety, leaving no room for interpretation or nuance. The audience is served the story with a proverbial sledgehammer and robbed of the opportunity to engage or invest emotionally. In summary, it's no coincidence that 'Failure to Launch' lives up to its name. Drowning in clichés, laden with lackluster acting, sloppy direction, and subpar scriptwriting, this romantic comedy is a true cinematic catastrophe. A complete waste of time and a testament to the notion that not every story deserves to be told, this film should be avoided by anyone looking for genuine entertainment, intelligent humor, or emotional depth in a motion picture."},{"question":"Test for natural language inference.

But Socialist leader Antonio Costa has been working to build a coalition with far-left parties. Many believe that Mr Passos Coelho will fail to pass the test of a vote of no confidence in Portugal's parliament. President Anibal Cavaco Silva would then be expected to ask the left to form a government. There are fears that weeks of uncertainty could harm Portugal's economic recovery, more than a year after it exited the strict terms of its â‚¬78bn (Â£57bn) international bailout. EU officials have threatened to take action against Portugal for missing a 15 October deadline to present its draft 2016 budget. Portugal is still running one of the highest budget deficits in the eurozone. 12% of the workforce is unemployed 20% of people live below the poverty line 485,000 emigrated from Portugal between 2011 and 2014 125% debt to GDP - the second highest rate in the European Union Mr Passos Coelho's Social Democrats have promised to present a budget, but the two left-wing parties campaigned strongly against his outgoing government's record of harsh austerity. The Left Bloc is seen as allied to the anti-austerity Syriza party in Greece, which for months tried to renegotiate the terms of Greece's eurozone bailout. Portugal's Communist Party is regarded as anti-euro and anti-Nato, although it is thought to have moderated its eurozone policies in recent weeks. If Mr Costa's Socialists are eventually chosen to lead a left-wing coalition, it would be the first time since the fall of Portugal's dictatorship in 1974 that a right-wing president appointed a government backed by communists. After his re-appointment as prime minister leading a right-of-centre coalition, Pedro Passos Coelho has 10 days to appoint ministers and secure parliamentary approval. That may prove impossible, since his coalition lost its majority in the 4 October election and the Socialists have pledged to reject his programme if their talks with other parties succeed. Together, the Socialists, Left Bloc and Communist Party have a majority. All wanted the president to appoint Mr Costa - arguing that anything else was a waste of time. If Mr Passos Coelho does fail, the president could then appoint Mr Costa or keep the incumbent on as caretaker. Fresh legislative elections may only take place from June, after voters have elected a new president early next year. A summary of the above article is?","response":"There was an election in Portugal, and Mr. Passos Coelho's group won the most seats, but they don't have enough to fully control the government. So, Mr. Antonio Costa is trying to create a team with other parties to take control. People think Mr. Passos Coelho might not be able to stay in charge, and President Silva might ask the other group to form a government. This confusion could affect Portugal's money situation and slow down their recovery.

I taught the kitten the way Pa taught me: I threw him into water where he could not stand, and I watched, ready to grab him if he went under. Tiger did not thrash desperately like me. He merely paddled urgently for the edge of the plastic pool with his head high and his thin legs churning. Little Bit said, \\"Dog paddle,\\" and we all laughed. \\"Tiger paddle,\\" I said, and we all laughed some more, even Jordy. That was probably when Ma noticed the kitten swimming lessons and stopped them. Our swimming lessons happened in two places. When Pa took us, we went to Hawkins Springs behind Mrs. DeLyons' Fountain of Youth Motor Hotel. When Ma took us, we drove to Mermaid Springs State Park, where we would sometimes meet Mr. Drake. I liked Mermaid Springs better because I felt safe there. Ma could not swim, so she never made me jump off a dock into deep water, and she always insisted that I wear an orange styrofoam cylinder on my back like a skindiver or spaceman. Ma usually sat on a towel on the grass near the beach, reading a magazine or a book while tanning her legs. Every now and then she would call to us not to go too far or not to splash each other. When she wore her one-piece red swimming suit, she would come in up to her waist, then lower herself to her shoulders, being careful not to get her hair wet. On the rarest occasions, she would wear a swimming cap and float on her back in the shallow water. Often she stayed in her shorts and shirt, adding sunglasses and removing shoes as her concession to summer and the beach. Where does the writer belives to be safe?

She learns that her talent is to be one of the tinkers, the fairies who make and fix things. Two other tinker fairies, Bobble (Rob Paulsen) and Clank (Jeff Bennett), teach her their craft, and tell her about the fairies who visit the mainland to bring each season. Tinker Bell is thrilled and cannot wait to go to the mainland for spring. While out working, she meets Silvermist (Lucy Liu), a water fairy; Rosetta (Kristin Chenoweth), a garden fairy; Iridessa (Raven-SymonÃ©), a light fairy; and Fawn (America Ferrera), an animal fairy. After meeting them, she notices Vidia (Pamela Adlon), a fast-flying fairy who immediately dislikes her because of her unusually strong talent. Vidia challenges her to prove she will be able to go to the mainland, and Tinker Bell creates several inventions, which she shows to the Minister of Spring (Steve Valentine). But Tinker Bell soon learns from Queen Clarion (Anjelica Huston) that only nature-talent fairies visit the mainland. She tries her hand at nature skills; making dewdrops with Silvermist, lighting fireflies with Iridessa, and trying with Fawn to teach baby birds to fly, but she fails miserably at all of these. Meanwhile, Bobble and Clank cover for Tinker Bell when questioned by Fairy Mary (Jane Horrocks), the tinker fairy overseer. When Tinker Bell returns, she tries to explain, but Mary simply responds that she knows, and expresses her disappointment with Tinker Bell's actions. On the beach, Tinker Bell finds parts of a music box and figures out how to put them together. Iridessa, Fawn, Silvermist, and Rosetta witness her doing this, then tell her that she was tinkering and that she should be proud of her talentâif this is what she's good at, the mainland should not matter. But Tinker Bell still wants to go to the mainland. She asks Rosetta if she will still teach her to be a garden fairy, but Rosetta says she thinks...

Which language is this?","response":"The language used in this sentence, \\"Bu şekilde ABD hükümetinin sağladığı başlangıç sermayesini de ikiye katladı,\\" is Turkish. Turkish is a major language spoken in Turkey and the surrounding regions. It belongs to the Turkic language family, and it's written in a Latin script that was established as the official alphabet in 1928 under Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. Turkey itself is located between southeastern Europe and western Asia and holds a unique position as a nation straddling these two continents. The influence of both European and Asian cultures is thus easily observed in its language, traditions, and sociocultural norms. Linguistic characteristics of Turkish include vowel harmony (where the vowels within a word need to harmonise with each other in terms of their placement and characteristics) and agglutination (where a lot of grammatical information is packed into suffixes that are attached to the root of a word). There are no genders in Turkish which simplifies the language for learners somewhat, and word order also differs from most other major languages - typically in Turkish the subject of a sentence comes first, followed by the object and then the verb. The given sentence translates to \\"In this way, it doubled the seed capital provided by the US government.\\" This statement can apply in a wide range of contexts, such as investment, financial aid, or business ventures, among others. The specific context would provide further meaning to this statement. Overall, Turkish, being the most widely spoken of the Turkic languages, has a rich history and plays a significant role in world affairs due to Turkey's geopolitical position. Especially the country's roles in NATO, G20, and other international alliances contribute to the global presence of the Turkish language. Therefore, learning and understanding Turkish becomes useful in many fields, from diplomacy to business and trade."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: This task is about translating a given Yoruba language sentence to English.

As legislators explore the possibilities of legalizing and regulating fantasy sports, companies both large and small are eager to capitalize on market growth. However, certain regulations in these state bills may threaten the survival of smaller companies. This article will discuss various aspects of state legislation that could inadvertently hurt small fantasy sports firms, ultimately requiring them to face an uncertain future in a competitive market. Step 1: Research state bills related to fantasy sports legalization and regulation It is crucial to understand the current landscape of state bills addressing fantasy sports issues. Researching different state bills will help identify their key components, common patterns, and controversies. This step will consist of gathering data, reading news articles, and exploring legal databases to find relevant information. Doing so will ensure that our analysis accurately reflects the realities of the impact of these legislative initiatives on small fantasy sports firms. Step 2: Analyze potential negative effects on smaller firms This step examines how state bills may potentially harm small fantasy sports companies. Regulatory barriers, such as licensing fees and compliance costs, can hinder the growth of these small firms and favor larger companies that possess greater financial resources. During analysis, we will investigate specific provisions within state bills and consider how they may disproportionately affect certain businesses. This process will enable us to pinpoint the most relevant aspects of the bills that could pose challenges for small fantasy sports firms, and use this information to draw informed conclusions. Step 3: Provide examples of smaller fantasy sports firms that may be affected By providing concrete examples of smaller fantasy sports firms that may potentially be negatively impacted by these state bills, this article can help readers develop a more thorough understanding of the situation. This step will involve researching and identifying smaller firms that are potentially at risk. Providing specific examples will also serve to humanize the impact of the legislative changes, highlighting the importance of considering the implications of state bills on the wider fantasy sports ecosystem. Step 4: Discuss potential solutions or adjustments to legislation After examining the challenges posed by state bills to smaller fantasy sports companies, it is necessary to discuss potential solutions or adjustments to these legislative approaches. This step allows us to propose alternatives that may mitigate the negative impact on small firms while still achieving the state's objective of regulating fantasy sports. Solutions may include lower licensing fees for smaller businesses, relaxed regulations for startups, or public-private partnerships to support emerging industry participants. Step 5: Conclude by reiterating the importance of carefully crafted legislation As a conclusion, the article will emphasize the need for state legislators to craft future bills with more attention to the potential impact they may have on small fantasy sports firms. While the regulation of this industry is necessary to ensure consumer protection and maintain fair competition, it is crucial that the process does not hamper innovation or alienate smaller businesses that contribute to the diversity of the fantasy sports market. Ensuring that smaller firms have a viable path forward in a regulated environment will ultimately benefit the industry as a whole and encourage further growth and innovation."},{"question":"Read this article and answer this question Reeling from three straight losses, the Jets made some changes in the lineup, moving Darrelle Revis and inserting Hank Poteat and Abram Elam. QB Chad Pennington got off to a quick start, completing a 57-yard pass to Laveranues Coles. Both New York and Cincinnati were able to move the ball back and forth in the first half, ending the half with the Jets on top 20-10. The fourth quarter would eventually prove to be the Jets undoing, however. After giving up a touchdown in the third quarter to make the score 23-17, the Jets gave up three touchdowns and only scored their last touchdown in the closing seconds of the game, ending with a 38-31 loss. The fourth quarter was marked by many mistakes, including a costly pass interference by Darrelle Revis and a fumble and interception by Chad Pennington. The pass interference kept a Bengals drive alive, and the fumble gave the Bengals the ball at midfield. Finally, with 50&#160;seconds left in the game, Pennington throws a hurried pass into the hands of Bengal Johnathan Joseph, who runs the ball 42&#160;yards for the game-sealing touchdown.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: The Keys of the Kingdom Context: Father Francis Chisholm (Gregory Peck) is visited in his old age by Monsignor Sleeth (Sir Cedric Hardwicke) at his parish in Tweedside. The Monsignor informs Father Francis that the Bishop thinks it would be better if he retires, as Father Francis' somewhat unorthodox recent teachings have become a distraction. The Monsignor retires to his room in the rectory, and finds Father Francis' diary that recounts his story from 1878. As the Monsignor begins to read the diary, a flashback begins. One night during his childhood, Francis' father was beaten by an anti-Catholic mob during a rainstorm. As his mother attempts to lead her husband to safety, they both die in a bridge collapse, leaving young Francis an orphan. He is raised by his aunt, and the next we see of Francis, he is leaving for the seminary with his childhood friend, Anselm \\"Angus\\" Mealey (Vincent Price). Francis studies at seminary for a year, but is unsure about all of the Church's teachings. He still finds himself in love with Nora, a girl from his home. However, he finds out that after he left, Nora had a child out of wedlock with another man, and she dies before Francis can return to see her. This prompts him to go back to seminary and follow through with his studies, and Francis becomes a priest. Francis' first two assignments as a priest are unfulfilling to him, so the Bishop asks Francis to be a volunteer missionary to China. Francis readily accepts the position, even though that means it would take him far from home as well as far from Judy, Nora's daughter. Francis arrives in Paitan, Chekhow Province in China to find the mission destroyed by floods, and not rebuilt because the true Christians all left, leaving only those who attended to receive free rice. Because the Church hadn't given the mission money for rice in over a year, \\"the faith left them when the rice gave out.\\" Francis rents a small room in the city to evangelize, but because he has no money or influence, he is attacked by those same \\"rice Christians\\" who were supposed to help...

There could be a few ways to interpret it depending on the context in which it is used. 1. If \\"committed to film\\" refers to the movie being well-constructed and skillfully made, it could potentially imply a positive opinion of the movie. The reviewer might be applauding the dedication and effort of the entire production team in bringing the film to life. 2. On the other hand, if \\"committed to film\\" is being used to emphasize that the story or concept would have been better left unwritten or unexplored, it can imply a negative opinion of the movie. In this case, the reviewer might have found the film to be poorly executed or unnecessary. 3. \\"Committed to film\\" might also be a neutral statement simply describing the fact that the movie has been produced or adapted from another source, like a book or a play. In this sense, it doesn't inherently express a positive or negative opinion. To determine whether the reviewer has a positive or negative opinion of the movie, more context or additional details would be required. It would be helpful to examine the entire review or further statements made by the reviewer to better understand their viewpoint and opinion on the film."},{"question":"What is the answer for the question: Who later expanded their original idea to include a third opera with mystic or religious tones? from the following article ? The one-act opera genre had become increasingly popular in Italy following the 1890 competition sponsored by publisher Edoardo Sonzogno for the best such work, which was won by the young Pietro Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana. With Tosca essentially completed by November 1899, Puccini sought a new project. Among sources he considered, before proceeding with Madama Butterfly, were three works by French dramatist Alphonse Daudet that Puccini thought might be made into a trilogy of one-act operas.After Butterfly premiered in 1904, Puccini again had difficulty finding a new subject. He further considered the idea of composing three one-act operas to be performed together, but found his publisher, Giulio Ricordi, firmly opposed to such a project, convinced that it would be expensive to cast and produce. The composer then planned to work with his longtime librettist, Giuseppe Giacosa, on an opera about Marie Antoinette, a project frustrated by the librettist's illness. Puccini wrote in November 1905, \\"Will we go back to it? [Maria Antonietta] If I find three one-act works that suit me, I'll put off M.A.\\" Puccini pursued neither project, as Giacosa's illness led to his death in September 1906.In March 1907, Puccini wrote to Carlo Clausetti, Ricordi's representative in Naples, proposing three one-act operas based on scenes from stories by Russian novelist Maxim Gorky. By May the composer had set aside this proposal to concentrate on the project which became La fanciulla del West, although he did not wholly abandon the idea of a multiple-opera evening. His next idea in this vein, some years later, was for a two-opera bill, one tragic and one comic; he later expanded this to include a third opera with a mystic or religious tone. By November 1916 Puccini had completed the \\"tragic\\" element, which became Il tabarro, but he still lacked ideas for the other two works. He considered staging Il tabarro in combination with his own early work Le Villi, or with other two-act operas which might be used to round out the evening's...

If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\". The Appalachians are also home to two species of fir, the boreal balsam fir (Abies balsamea), and the southern high elevation endemic, Fraser fir (Abies fraseri). Fraser fir is confined to the highest parts of the southern Appalachian Mountains, where along with red spruce it forms a fragile ecosystem known as the Southern Appalachian spruce-fir forest. Fraser fir rarely occurs below 5,500 ft (1,700 m), and becomes the dominant tree type at 6,200 ft (1,900 m). By contrast, balsam fir is found from near sea level to the tree line in the northern Appalachians, but ranges only as far south as Virginia and West Virginia in the central Appalachians, where it is usually confined above 3,900 ft (1,200 m) asl, except in cold valleys. Curiously, it is associated with oaks in Virginia. The balsam fir of Virginia and West Virginia is thought by some to be a natural hybrid between the more northern variety and Fraser fir.

Is \\"During this time he contributed to the development of the Monte Carlo method, which allowed solutions to complicated problems to be approximated using random numbers.\\" the correct answer? A). yes B). no","response":"B). no While the given statement partially describes the Monte Carlo method, it does not provide a comprehensive answer. A more detailed explanation follows: The Monte Carlo method is a computational technique that relies on random sampling to approximate solutions to complex problems. It was first developed during the mid-20th century by a group of scientists, including Stanislaw Ulam, John von Neumann, and Nicholas Metropolis. Their work, carried out at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, contributed to the field of nuclear physics research and the development of the atomic bomb during World War II. The Monte Carlo method's name is inspired by the Monte Carlo Casino in Monaco, emphasizing the element of chance within the approach. It utilizes random numbers and stochastic (probabilistic) processes to represent unknown variables, allowing mathematicians, physicists, and engineers to create simulations that can be used to approximate solutions to complex mathematical and statistical issues. This method is particularly useful for solving high-dimensional problems, where straightforward algorithms prove impractical or computationally expensive. The Monte Carlo method takes advantage of the law of large numbers, which states that the average of a sequence of random samples tends to converge to the expected value when the number of samples becomes large. In practice, the Monte Carlo method is employed across various fields, such as finance, engineering, biology, and computer graphics. Some of its applications include: 1. Risk analysis in investment banking and finance: Monte Carlo simulations are used to assess the risk and return of various investment scenarios. 2. Numerical integration: This method helps estimate integrals in multiple dimensions, particularly when traditional methods are inapplicable or inefficient. 3. Statistical physics: Monte Carlo methods have been crucial in understanding the behavior of atoms and particles in complex systems. 4. Optimization: The simulations can approximate global optima in cases of high-dimensional, non-linear optimization problems. 5. Computer graphics: Monte Carlo methods are used in rendering realistic lighting models and shadows in 3D environments. In summary, while the given statement highlights the use of random numbers in the Monte Carlo method, it lacks a more in-depth explanation of its purpose, development, and applications across various industries."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Kendall didn't want to eat the lunch their mother made them so Kendall threw the lunch to the dogs.

Describing Kendall as \\"wasteful\\" is a valid answer. Here is a detailed explanation as to why: Kendall's action of throwing the lunch their mother made for them to the dogs, rather than consuming it or trying to diplomatically address the issue, can be seen as an act of waste, particularly when considering the time, effort, and resources that went into the preparation of the meal. Kendall didn't seem to take these factors into account when they chose to dispose of the lunch in this manner. By discarding the lunch, Kendall wasted the ingredients used to make it, as well as the energy and time their mother devoted to preparing the meal. Moreover, their action could lead to spoilage, as the dogs might not consume the entire lunch. Furthermore, the discarded meal could have had another purpose, such as being offered to another family member or consumed at a later time. In addition to being wasteful, Kendall's behavior might also be seen as disrespectful toward their mother, as they disregarded her efforts in providing sustenance. Instead of discussing their preferences or other solutions with their mother, Kendall chose a more impulsive and thoughtless approach. In conclusion, describing Kendall as \\"wasteful\\" is a valid answer due to the various factors mentioned above. However, it is essential to note that this description might not encompass the entirety of Kendall's character, and it should not be used as a generalization. There might be other aspects of Kendall's personality, and it is possible that they could have been acting out of character in this particular situation.

Two years ago, Shanghai topped the 2012 international PISA tables for maths, while England was ranked in 26th place. The top five were all in Southeast Asia, with 15-year-olds in Shanghai judged to be three years ahead of their peers in maths. The education department said: \\"England's performance in maths has lagged behind while other countries have improved and overtaken us, including Poland and Germany.\\" Actually, it is the latest step in the government's drive to raise standards in maths, looking at what has made schools in the far East the most successful in the world in teaching the subject. \\"Shanghai is the top-performing part of the world for maths--their children are streets ahead. Shanghai and Singapore have teaching practices and a positive mind that make the difference. They have a belief that diligence makes up for lack of ability,\\" Truss said. \\"Our new curriculum has borrowed from theirs because we know it works--early learning of key arithmetic, and a focus on times tables and long division , for instance.\\" She was determined to change the situation as performance in maths is weakening the country's skills base and threatening the productivity and growth. The government is emphasizing maths because of the importance of good grades in the subject... Question: How will students' poor performance in maths affect the country eventually? Yes or no, is the answer \\"By threatening the country's competitiveness of economy.\\"? Answer:","response":"Yes, the answer is \\"By threatening the country's competitiveness of economy.\\" Poor performance in maths can weaken the country's skills base, which may threaten productivity, growth, and overall economic competitiveness."},{"question":"A friend asked me to answer this question: What was the name of the person whose body lay in the tent for several days creating a frightful smell?, using the article: Other health problems persisted; Malloch's frostbitten feet failed to heal, and Mamen's knee, which he had dislocated during the days at Shipwreck Camp, troubled him continuously. A worrying illness began to affect many of the party, the general symptoms were swelling of the legs, ankles and other body parts, accompanied by acute lethargy. Malloch was the worst affected; he died on 17 May, but his tent-mate Mamen was too ill to see to his burial, so the body lay in the tent for several days, creating a \\"frightful smell\\", until McKinlay arrived to help. Mamen himself died ten days later of the same debilitating disease.From early June the diet was augmented with the appearance of birds. These birds and their eggs became a vital source of food; as the supply of seal meat dwindled to nothing, the party was reduced to eating rotten flippers, hide, or any part of a seal that was remotely edible. The sharing of birds became another bone of contention; according to Williamson \\"Wednesday last, [Breddy and Chafe] really obtained 6 eggs and 5 birds instead of 2 eggs and 4 birds as they reported.\\" Breddy was suspected of other thefts. On 25 June, after a gunshot was heard, Breddy was found dead in his tent. The circumstances of his death, whether accident, suicide or in Hadley's view, murder (with Williamson as the chief suspect) could not be determined. Williamson later called Hadley's suspicions \\"hallucinations and absolutely untrue.\\" Various items stolen from McKinlay were found among Breddy's personal effects.Despite the sombre outlook, the Canadian flag was raised at Rodgers Harbor on 1 July in honour of Dominion Day. Later in the month the party's spirits improved when Kuraluk caught a 600-pound (270 kg) walrus, which provided fresh meat for several days. As August came without sign of a ship and the weather began to turn wintry again, hopes of rescue fell; the party began to prepare for another winter., what would be the answer ?

After the August 1998 bombings of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, President Bill Clinton and his chief aides explored ways of getting Bin Laden expelled from Afghanistan or possibly capturing or even killing him. Although disruption efforts around the world had achieved some successes, the core of Bin Laden's organization remained intact. President Clinton was deeply concerned about Bin Laden. He and his national security advisor, Samuel \\"Sandy\\" Berger, ensured they had a special daily pipeline of reports feeding them the latest updates on Bin Laden's reported location. In public, President Clinton spoke repeatedly about the threat of terrorism, referring to terrorist training camps but saying little about Bin Laden and nothing about al Qaeda. He explained to us that this was deliberate-intended to avoid enhancing Bin Laden's stature by giving him unnecessary publicity. His speeches focused especially on the danger of nonstate actors and of chemical and biological weapons. As the millennium approached, the most publicized worries were not about terrorism but about computer breakdowns-the Y2K scare. Some government officials were concerned that terrorists would take advantage of such breakdowns. On November 30, 1999, Jordanian intelligence intercepted a telephone call between Abu Zubaydah, a longtime ally of Bin Laden, and Khadr Abu Hoshar, a Palestinian extremist. Abu Zubaydah said, \\"The time for training is over.\\" Suspecting that this was a signal for Abu Hoshar to commence a terrorist operation, Jordanian police arrested Abu Hoshar and 15 others and informed Washington. One of the 16, Raed Hijazi, had been born in California to Palestinian parents; after spending his childhood in the Middle East, he had returned to northern California, taken refuge in extremist Islamist beliefs, and then made his way to Abu Zubaydah's Khaldan camp in Afghanistan, where he learned the fundamentals of guerrilla warfare. He and his younger brother had been recruited by Abu Hoshar into a loosely knit plot to attack Jewish and American targets in Jordan. After late 1996, when Abu Hoshar was arrested and jailed, Hijazi moved back to the United States, worked as a cabdriver in Boston, and sent money back to his fellow plotters. After Abu Hoshar's release, Hijazi shuttled between Boston and Jordan gathering money and supplies. With Abu Hoshar, he recruited inTurkey and Syria as well as Jordan; with Abu Zubaydah's assistance, Abu Hoshar sent these recruits to Afghanistan for training. After reading the above, is \\"Abu Hoshar\\" the correct answer to the question \\"Who, along with his younger brother, had been recruited in Abu Hoshar?\\"? a. no b. yes","response":"b. yes"},{"question":"Q: You are given a sentence in Hebrew.

The Fed’s institutional credibility is on the line, and the normal decorum that characterizes relations among committee members has become increasingly strained over the summer. Divisions between proponents and opponents of a second round of quantitative easing (QE2) have been on display as never before. It is not clear what members will say to one another to fill two days since all the arguments have already been rehearsed in detail and in public over the last six weeks. In a thinly veiled swipe at his colleagues, Kansas City Fed President Thomas Hoenig has stumped around his patch on the Great Plains denouncing QE as a “dangerous gamble” and “a bargain with the devil”. Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher and Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser have made no secret of their skepticism or outright opposition to launching QE2 at this point. Minneapolis Fed President Narayana Kocherlakota has questioned whether it will work. Richmond Fed President Jeffrey Lacker has seemed to doubt whether it is necessary. In contrast, the New York Fed (always the closest to the major money centre banks) and the St Louis Fed (the spiritual home of monetarism in the Federal Reserve System) have openly campaigned for the benefits of a second round of asset purchases. The final vote to adopt QE2 looks set to be 10-1 (with Hoenig dissenting). But the tally will mask much wider misgivings among the non-voting regional presidents and perhaps among some members of the Board of Governors itself, who will nonetheless fall in line with the chairman to support his authority. FIVE DIMENSIONS The decision to launch QE2 already seems to have been taken. No senior member of the Fed system has sought to downplay market expectations the committee will announce more asset purchases this week. But the details are as important as the overall decision to press ahead. The committee must make choices on at least five points: * First, the headline amount of securities the Fed agrees to purchase — whether it is specified as simply a first phase or the total amount for the program. Most market participants seem to be expecting purchases of around 500 billion in the first phase. This amount has probably been priced in already. Announcing a half-trillion dollar program risks a limited impact on the markets. But announcing a bigger total will stoke fears that Fed policy is being driven by Wall Street and that the central bank has lost control. * Second, the Fed must specify the rate at which securities will be purchased. Most participants seem to expect the 500 billion worth of purchases to be completed over a period of about six months — implying asset buying at around 80 billion per month. The Fed is already buying about 30 billion of Treasury notes each month as a result of its earlier decision to re-invest funds from maturing mortgage-backed securities in its portfolio back into the government bond market. Combined purchases as a result of QE2 and re-investment will thus come to over 100 billion per month — equivalent to the Treasury’s entire borrowing requirement. It will open the Fed to accusations of “monetizing” the government borrowing. Purchasing any more than 80 billion per month as part of QE2 will only make the accusations worse. * Third, the Fed must decide what type of securities to buy — whether to restrict purchases to Treasury notes (and if so what maturities) or broaden the program to include agency notes, mortgage-backed bonds or even corporate bonds. The Fed already controls short-term borrowing costs via the federal funds rate. In theory it is meant to be using QE2 to drive down medium-term borrowing costs. By implication the Fed should be buying medium-term Treasury notes. But there are not enough of them. So the Fed may also buy some shorter-term 2-year and 3-year Treasury securities, or broaden its purchases to include other bonds. The Fed has been trying to pull back from the more unorthodox and interventionist measures it used in 2008 and 2009. When it announced the mortgage-bond reinvestment programme in August the Fed made clear the proceeds would be re-invested in Treasuries. But the scale of QE2 means the Fed may have to consider buying short-term notes or even agency and mortgage bonds to avoid cornering the market for medium-term notes. * Fourth, the committee must make a decision on the program’s duration — whether purchases will be for a finite period or continue indefinitely until some exit condition is met (what policymakers have taken to calling a “state-dependent” strategy). A finite program (e.g. 500 billion over six months) would preserve flexibility, and mollify some of the skeptics. It might prevent Plosser, Fisher, Lacker and Kocherlakota joining Hoenig in outright opposition and denouncing the policy in their speeches. But it also risks disappointing markets that have already priced this much in and are hoping for more. * Fifth, if the program is to continue indefinitely, will the Fed spell out the exit condition in terms of a hard number (an inflation target, price-level target or unemployment rate) or leave it to a softer qualitative judgment by the committee about when the danger of deflation is passed and recovery is sufficiently strong? A state-dependent target linked to inflation, the price level or unemployment would send a strong signal to the markets. But it would lock the Fed into an open-ended and possibly dangerous commitment to buy a lot of government bonds and force it to persist with the policy even if the benefits prove marginal and costs start to mount. It would widen the committee’s divisions even further and risk driving the doubters into opposition. LOSING THE ARGUMENT? The actual announcement on Nov. 3 marks only the beginning. Once the formal decision is taken, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke has to sell the strategy to an increasingly skeptical investment community and public. In a sense, Hoenig has already won the argument even if he has lost the vote. His high-profile campaign has shifted the focus onto the uncertain and possibly marginal benefits of QE2 while pointing up the risks and problems. Bernanke and other supporters of QE have been forced to defend the policy against the criticism that it will be ineffective at best and create a new set of dangerous distortions at worst. It puts the committee in something of a bind. If the FOMC announces a finite 500 billion purchase program it risks disappointing the markets and triggering a sell-off as investors conclude the good news has already been priced in. But if the committee opts for a much higher total or an open-ended commitment to gin up the markets, fears the Fed has lost control and is over-reacting will grow. Monetary policy works as much through its impact on expectations as its actual effect on borrowing costs. Whatever happens on Nov 3, Bernanke and other QE supporters must go out and sell the program. They have to explain how it will work and be managed; dispel the impression QE is being driven by Wall Street and its allies in the New York Fed rather than be the System as a whole; and convince the growing ranks of doubters that the Fed still knows what it is doing.

Genes are fundamental units of heredity that determine the specific traits and characteristics of an individual. These traits include physical attributes, such as height and eye color, as well as predispositions to certain diseases, mental abilities, and behavioral tendencies. Genes are made up of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), which contains the genetic information necessary for cells to grow, reproduce, and perform their functions. Each individual possesses two copies of each gene, one inherited from their mother and the other from their father. Genes are organized into structures called chromosomes, which are located inside the nucleus of a cell. Humans typically have 46 chromosomes, which are arranged in 23 pairs, including one pair of sex chromosomes responsible for determining an individual's sex. The genetic information stored in genes is translated into proteins through a process called gene expression. Proteins are complex molecules that effectively act as the building blocks for cells and play crucial roles in a wide range of physiological functions. Even though genes play a significant role in determining an individual's traits and characteristics, they do not function in isolation. Environmental factors, such as diet, exercise, lifestyle choices, and exposure to various elements, can also influence the expression of genes. This interaction between genes and the environment is a critical area of study within the field of genetics, called gene-environment interactions or GxE. Genetic variations within a population can lead to differences in how individuals respond to environmental factors. For example, variations in genes related to metabolism may cause certain individuals to be more prone to obesity when exposed to a high-calorie diet. Similarly, variations in genes associated with nicotine receptors can cause some individuals to be more susceptible to addiction when exposed to cigarettes. Gene-environment interactions can also be studied by observing how specific genetic factors contribute to a person's vulnerability or resilience to adversities in their environment. For instance, some individuals may inherit genetic factors that increase their risk of developing mental health conditions, such as anxiety or depression, when confronted with stressors in their lives. However, other individuals may possess protective genetic factors that allow them to maintain psychological well-being under similar circumstances. In conclusion, genes play a vital role in determining an individual's traits and characteristics, but their influence cannot be separated from the context of environmental factors. Understanding the complex interplay between genes and the environment is essential for elucidating the underlying mechanisms of various traits and disorders. Additionally, this knowledge can help inform personalized preventive measures and therapeutic strategies for individuals at risk."},{"question":"Les États membres attribuent au fabricant une marque d'homologation CE pour chaque type de feu-brouillard avant.

The garrison held it until it was a mere heap of ruins, and, indeed, they had the greatest difficulty in making their way out. I think that there is very little doubt that the Germans were using against these forts their largest guns, the great 42-centimetre howitzers. It is known that two of these were brought northwards past Brussels after the fall of Maubeuge, and a fragment which was given to us was almost conclusive. It was brought to us one morning as an offering by a grateful patient, and it came from the neighbourhood of Fort Waelhem. It was a mass of polished steel two feet long, a foot wide, and three inches thick, and it weighed about fifty pounds. It was very irregular in shape, with edges sharp as razors, without a particle of rust upon it. It had been picked up where it fell still hot, and it was by far the finest fragment of shell I have ever seen. Alas we had to leave it behind, and it lies buried in a back-garden beside our hospital. Some day it will be dug up, and will be exhibited as conclusive evidence that the Germans did use their big guns in shelling the town. Do you have any questions?","response":"Alright, little one, let me explain this to you in simpler words. On a certain Thursday, there was a place called Fort Waelhem where people were trying to protect themselves. They were very brave and strong, but eventually, the fort was destroyed and turned into a pile of broken bricks. The people inside had a hard time leaving the fort because of this. There were some very large and powerful weapons called 42-centimeter howitzers that were used by the Germans, who were the ones attacking the fort. After another town, Maubeuge, was captured, two of these giant weapons were moved closer to Fort Waelhem. Now, the people at the hospital, who take care of those who got hurt in the fighting, received a big, shiny piece of metal that came from one of these giant weapons. It was huge and heavy, and they hadn't seen anything like it before. They knew it was from one of the big howitzers used by the Germans. The doctors had to leave the hospital and bury this big piece of metal in their backyard, hoping that it will be found someday and used as proof that big weapons were indeed used in the battle.

Hawkes admitted she had developed \\"a very great liking\\" for Wheeler, having first met him when she was an archaeology student at the University of Cambridge. She believed that he had \\"a daemonic energy\\", with his accomplishments in India being \\"almost superhuman\\". Ultimately, she thought of him as being \\"an epic hero in an anti-heroic age\\" in which growing social egalitarianism had stifled and condemned aspects of his greatness.In the 2000 film Hey Ram, the lead character, Saket Ram (played by Kamal Haasan) and his friend, Amjad Khan (played by Shah Rukh Khan) are shown as employees of Wheeler, who was portrayed by Lewis K.

Over the last 13 months there has been a series of extremely bloody attacks on schools, colleges and universities. On Wednesday Taliban suicide bombers mounted an assault in north-western Pakistan; just over a year ago the same movement attacked a school only 30 miles away,killing 150 people, most of them children. In April last year 147 were killed in a massacre at a university in northern Kenya by the Somalia-based al-Shabaab. Then there are hundreds, possibly thousands, of other incidents of violence directed at educational institutions, teachers or students across the world which have not been reported. Related: Pakistan attacks: at least 30 dead in terror raid at Bacha Khan University Why would terrorists attack such targets? One obvious answer is because they can. Schools are usually unprotected. Embassies, military bases, even hotels are, after a decade and a half of rolling waves of terrorist violence across the world, now harder to hit. But there are other reasons, too. Terrorism aims to undermine the legitimacy and authority of a state. In many parts of the world, the local school is that state’s only tangible presence. Another goal is simply to stall education, of both girls and boys, though the former tends to prompt a greater reaction. In 2012 the Pakistani Taliban tried to kill a 15-year-old schoolgirl, Malala Yousufzai, who went on to become an international icon. A more pragmatic aim may be to send a message to policymakers or even to the general public. What is clear is that such attacks are increasing. Data compiled by the University of Maryland in the US shows a dramatic increase in violence directed at schools following the 2004 massacre at a school in Beslan in southern Russia of more than 300 people, including 186 children. This is easily explained. It is in line with the rise of terrorism more generally over the period. The proportion of attacks on educational institutions overall – between 3% and 5% – has barely changed. But, again reflecting a more general trend, the attacks are now much more lethal. According to another recent study by the University of Maryland, “mass-fatality terrorist events” – defined as those in which more than 100 people are killed by terrorists in one country in one day – occurred just over four times a year on average between 1978 and 2013. In 2014, there were 26. In 2015, the number is equivalent or higher, depending on how many of the massacres carried out by Islamic State and Boko Haram, the extremist movement based in north-eastern Nigeria, are counted. Boko Haram has made targeting schools and students a priority, most infamously abducting 276 schoolgirls in 2014. Nigerian officials say they still have no idea where they are. What are the most important parts of this news article?","response":"This news article is talking about how terrorists are attacking schools and universities more often. The important parts are: 1. There have been many bloody attacks on schools, colleges, and universities in the last 13 months. 2. Terrorists are targeting schools because they are usually unprotected and easier to attack than places like embassies or military bases. 3. Attacking schools can hurt the government's power and make people scared. 4. Sometimes terrorists want to stop children, especially girls, from getting an education. 5. The number of attacks on schools has gone up a lot since 2004. 6. These attacks have become more deadly, with more people getting hurt or killed.

Like post-punk, the term has been applied to a broad constellation of groups. The genre took shape in the mid to late 1980s with releases by bands from cities that had established hardcore scenes, such as Fugazi from Washington, D.C. as well as groups such as Big Black and Jawbox that stuck closer to post-hardcore's noise rock roots. - Q and Not U was a post-hardcore band from Washington, D.C., signed to Dischord Records. Members John Davis, Harris Klahr, Christopher Richards, and Matt Borlik formed the band in 1998. After Borlik's departure following the release of their first album, the band went on to record two more critically acclaimed LPs as a three-piece, exploring aspects of dance-punk, and other disparate musical styles. Q and Not U disbanded in September 2005 after completing their touring commitments and a short farewell stand at Washington, D.C. venue The Black Cat. - Dance-punk (also known as disco-punk or punk funk) is a music genre that emerged in the late 1970s, and is closely associated with the post-punk and new wave movements. - Power was the 3rd and final album by Q and Not U. It was released on October 5 , 2004 . After touring in support of the album , the group disbanded in September 2005 . The album was co-produced by Pete Cafarella and Rafael Cohen ( of Supersystem ) . All tracking was done at The Love Story in Brooklyn , NY . The album was mixed with Don Zientara at Inner Ear Studio and mastered by Chad Clark at Silver Sonya . - Albums of recorded music were developed in the early 20th century, first as books of individual 78rpm records, then from 1948 as vinyl LP records played at rpm. Vinyl LPs are still issued, though in the 21st century album sales have mostly focused on compact disc (CD) and MP3 formats. The audio cassette was a format used from the late 1970s through to the 1990s alongside vinyl. - Dischord Records is a Washington, D.C.-based independent record label specializing in the independent punk rock music of the D.C.-area music scene. The label is co-owned by Ian MacKaye and Jeff Nelson, who founded Dischord in 1980 to release \\"Minor Disturbance\\" by The Teen Idles. Along with other independent American labels such as Twin/Tone, Touch and Go Records, and SST Records, Dischord helped to spearhead the nationwide network of underground bands that formed the pre-Nirvana indie-rock scene. These labels presided over the shift from the hardcore punk that then dominated the American underground scene to the more diverse styles of alternative rock that were emerging. - The LP (from \\"long playing\\" or \\"long play\\") is an analog sound storage medium, a vinyl record format characterized by a speed of rpm, a 12 or 10 inch (30 or 25 cm) diameter, and use of the \\"microgroove\\" groove specification. Introduced by Columbia in 1948, it was soon adopted as a new standard by the entire record industry. Apart from a few relatively minor refinements and the important later addition of stereophonic sound, it has remained the standard format for vinyl albums. - MPEG-1 and/or MPEG-2 Audio Layer III, more commonly referred to as MP3, is an audio coding format for digital audio which uses a form of lossy data compression. It is a common audio format for consumer audio streaming or storage, as well as a de facto standard of digital audio compression for the transfer and playback of music on most digital audio players and computing devices. - A book is a set of written, printed, illustrated, or blank sheets, made of paper, parchment, or other materials, fastened together to hinge at one side, with text and/or images printed in ink. A single sheet within a book is a leaf, and each side of a leaf is a page. A set of text-filled or illustrated pages produced in electronic format is known as an electronic book, or e-book. - Compact disc (CD) is a digital optical disc data storage format released in 1982 and co-developed by Philips and Sony. The format was originally developed to store and play only sound recordings but was later adapted for storage of data (CD-ROM). Several other formats were further derived from these, including write-once audio and data storage (CD-R), rewritable media (CD-RW), Video Compact Disc (VCD), Super Video Compact Disc (SVCD), Photo CD, PictureCD, CD-i, and Enhanced Music CD.

Problem:Abstract: To define the genetic changes of flat urothelial lesions, carcinoma in situ (CIS) and moderate dysplasias (DII) were investigated for alterations in the two chromosomal regions most frequently involved in bladder cancer. Overall, 33 CIS and 16 DII from 21 patients were used to microdissect urothelium. Dual color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using gene locus probes of 9q22 (FACC), 9p21 (CDK), 17p13 (p53), and related centromeric probes was applied on interphase nuclei. In parallel, preamplified DNA of these samples was used for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analyses with eight microsatellite markers on chromosomes 9p, 9q and 17p, and for sequencing of exons 5-9 of p53. Data indicated nearly identical deletion frequencies for chromosomes 9 and 17 for CIS (chromosome 9, 86%; p53, 84%). DII showed a lower deletion rate in comparison with CIS (chromosome 9, 75%; p53, 53%). A very high correlation between the results of FISH and LOH analyses was found. p53 mutations were detected in 12 of 15 patients (CIS, 72%; DII, 67%). In three of 16 patients with multifocal tumors, oligoclonal lesions were identified by LOH analyses, a finding further supported by sequencing of p53, by which two different p53 deletions were detected in two cases. In conclusion, data from microdissected flat urothelial lesions indicate that chromosome 9 deletions cannot be regarded as indicators of papillary growth, because they are found frequently in both types of flat lesions of the urothelium: those associated with papillary tumors and those that are not. The similar distribution and lower amount of genetic changes in DII render DII a possible precursor lesion of CIS..

Options: - arguments - dust poisoning - headache - exhaustion - boredom Explain why a human would choose \\"headache\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","response":"A human would choose \\"headache\\" as the answer to the question above because dust, when inhaled during housework, can lead to various physical discomforts, including headaches. When there is a lot of dust in the environment, particularly during cleaning activities, it can irritate the respiratory system and the eyes, causing discomfort and potentially a headache. Dust particles are typically small and can easily spread in the air, particularly during cleaning tasks such as sweeping, vacuuming, or dusting. When a person breathes in these particles, they can irritate the sensitive mucous membranes in the nose and throat, causing inflammation and discomfort. Prolonged exposure to dust can also worsen pre-existing respiratory conditions like asthma or allergies, which can further contribute to headache development. Additionally, dust may contain various allergens, such as pollen, mold spores, or pet dander. In people who are sensitive to these allergens, exposure to dust can trigger an allergic reaction. The body responds to these allergens by releasing histamines, which can lead to inflammation and a variety of symptoms, including sinus congestion, sneezing, coughing, watery eyes, and, of course, headaches. Headaches caused by dust exposure may also be linked to eye strain and irritation, as dust particles coming in contact with the eyes can create discomfort and hinder vision. This eye irritation and strain can trigger headaches in some individuals. While the other options, such as arguments, dust poisoning, exhaustion, and boredom, can potentially result from housework or be associated with exposure to dust in varying contexts, they are less likely to be selected by a human as the primary outcome caused by dust exposure. The description of \\"a lot of dust\\" in the question heavily implies that the issue at hand is a physical health concern, which aligns more closely with the development of a headache rather than the other options presented. In conclusion, a human would choose \\"headache\\" as the answer to the question because exposure to high levels of dust during housework can lead to various physical and respiratory discomforts, of which headache is a common and well-recognized symptom. This selection is further supported by the overall context of the question, which emphasizes the impact of dust on health and well-being."},{"question":"Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: Every country has its traditional festivals. The Chinese New Year is now known as the Spring Festival because it starts from the beginning of spring. Though there are some sayings about its origin, all agree that the word Nian, which in modern Chinese means \\"year\\", was originally the name of a beast that started to eat people the night before the beginning of a new year. One story goes that the beast Nian had a very big mouth that would take in a great many people at one time. People were very afraid. One day, an old man came to their help and said he would stop all this. He said to Nian, \\"I hear that you are very strong, but can you eat up all the beasts on earth instead of people who are too weak to be your enemies?\\" \\"Yes,\\" Nian agreed with him and went to kill many of the beasts on earth. People were very happy because those beasts also did bad things to people and killed their farm animals from time to time. After that, the old man, who was a god, rode on the beast Nian and left. Nian was gone, and other beasts also went into forests; people began to enjoy their happy life. Before the old man left, he had told people to put up red paper-cuts on their windows and doors at each year's end to drive Nian away, because red is the color the beast felt most afraid of. From then on, every year at the beginning of spring, people prepare to \\"Guo Nian\\". The word \\"Guo Nian\\" means \\"go through the Nian safely\\". Putting up red paper-cuts to drive Nian away and making dumplings for a better new year are still an every-year doing by the Chinese people. However, people today have long forgotten why they are doing all this, they just feel the color and the food make the New Year very enjoyable.

He was their fourth child and third son. This was a year after the island was transferred to France by the Republic of Genoa. He was christened Napoleone di Buonaparte, probably named after an uncle (an older brother who did not survive infancy was the first of the sons to be called Napoleone). In his 20s, he adopted the more French-sounding Napoléon Bonaparte.[note 2]\\" Answer:","response":"Napoleon Bonaparte, initially born as Napoleone di Buonaparte, changed his name in his 20s to adopt a more French-sounding name. There are several reasons that led to this decision. 1. Assimilation into French society: When Corsica became a part of France, the residents of the island, including the Buonaparte family, were incorporated into the French society. By changing his name to a more French-sounding version, Napoleon aimed to better assimilate into the French culture, as it would facilitate his acceptance and opportunities within the society. This change would make it easier for him to pursue education, establish connections, and seek career advancements in the French mainland. 2. Rise in Military and Political Career: Napoleon went to mainland France to pursue his education and military training, where he joined the French Army and later rose through the ranks to become a prominent political and military figure. By adopting the name Napoléon Bonaparte, he was sending a clear message that he had integrated to French society and was dedicated to the French cause. The French-sounding name would enable him to gain respect and trust, both from the military and the civilian population. 3. Elimination of possible discrimination: As a Corsican with an Italian-sounding name in the French military and political landscape, Napoleon could have faced discrimination and other obstacles due to his origins. By adopting a French-sounding name, he minimized the risk of being ostracized or facing resistance due to his identity. This strategic decision allowed him to focus on his military and political aspirations without worrying about potential backlash or bias stemming from his name. 4. Reputation and branding: By the time Napoleon changed his name, he had started to build a reputation as a skilled military officer. He understood the importance of building a strong personal brand and saw the benefits of better aligning his name with the French culture. Transforming his name from Napoleone di Buonaparte to Napoléon Bonaparte showcased this intent and helped him solidify his image as a rising star in France's military and political landscape. In conclusion, Napoleon's decision to change his name by adopting a more French-sounding version was a calculated move aimed at better assimilating into the French society, advancing in his career, avoiding potential discrimination, and strengthening his personal brand. This change in his name played a significant role in helping him achieve the incredible feats that defined his life and career, eventually leading him to become one of history's most famous leaders."},{"question":"Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: Um bom custo benefício Review: Estou no Brasil.Só compro na Amazon e sempre deu tudo certo.A entrega é imediata e sem burocracia.O produto é bom e atende às minhas necessidades.

The Head and the Tail events are short phrases possibly involving participants. The names of specific people have been replaced by generic words (e.g., PersonX, PersonY, PersonZ). PersonX is always the subject of the event. You have to determine whether, as a result of the Head, PersonY or others will want what is mentioned in the Tail or not. In this task, wanting is a postcondition desire on the part of PersonY and others, respectively. For example, as a result of PersonX giving PersonY gifts, PersonY may want to open the gift. Classify your answers into \\"Yes\\" and \\"No\\". The phrase may also contain \\"___\\", a placeholder that can be an object, a person, and/or an action.

The school administration and the school board have been faced with addressing the issue in order to foster a vibrant school community and encourage student success in all aspects of their lives. The town has a strong academic culture, with parents emphasizing the importance of academic achievement. However, in recent years, there has been an influx of technology and social media use among students, as well as an increasing emphasis on standardized test scores by the state education department. Hypothesis: The decline in student extracurricular participation in Cedar Ridge High School is a result of a combination of factors, including the increasing focus on academic achievement and standardized test scores, the growing influence of technology and social media, and a possible lack of engaging extracurricular opportunities provided by the school. To test the hypothesis, the following steps can be taken: 1. Collect data on the types and variety of extracurricular activities available at Cedar Ridge High School over the past five years. This information will help determine if there has been a decline in the quality or variety of extracurricular activities being offered. 2. Survey students, parents, and teachers to gather their opinions on the importance of academic achievement, standardized test scores, and extracurricular participation. This will help establish if there is an overarching emphasis on academic success at the expense of extracurricular activity involvement. 3. Analyze the relationship between students' academic performance, standardized test scores, and their participation in extracurricular activities. This will provide insight into whether a focus on academic achievement is a driver behind the decline in extracurricular participation. 4. Evaluate social media and technology usage among Cedar Ridge students, as well as its impact on their time management, mental health, and interpersonal relationships. This will help determine if increased technology use is contributing to a decreased interest or ability to participate in extracurricular activities. 5. Collaborate with school administration, PTA, and the school board to brainstorm and implement engaging, innovative, and accessible extracurricular programs that would cater to varying student interests and skill sets. Track data on student participation and feedback to determine if these new programs are effective in increasing extracurricular involvement. By investigating these factors and considering their combined impact, Cedar Ridge High School can create an environment that encourages a well-rounded and fulfilling educational experience for all students, balancing academic achievement with the benefits of extracurricular participation."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: You are presented with the question \\"What is one way animals learn to behave?\\" and the following answer choices: - garbage - Generating heat - Space travel - running and lifting - Time and energy - exercise - money - Riding a bike Now knowing that playing is one way mammals and other animals learn how to behave and involvement in play takes time and energy, choose the best answer.

Question What may be a good reason to double - check if you 're registered to vote ? Answer:","response":"A good reason to double-check if you're registered to vote is to ensure that your registration information is accurate and up-to-date. This is important because: Step 1: Confirming voter registration status By double-checking, you confirm that you are indeed registered to vote. Sometimes, people may think they are registered but may not be due to a processing error or oversight. Step 2: Checking for address updates If you have moved since the last time you voted, your registration information may not be accurate. It is crucial to update your address to ensure that you are assigned to the correct voting location and district. Step 3: Ensuring name changes are updated If you have changed your name, it is important to ensure that your voter registration reflects the current information. This can prevent any confusion at the polling station, which may lead to issues with your eligibility to vote. Step 4: Verifying registration deadlines Double-checking your registration status ensures that you are aware of any registration deadlines. This gives you ample time to make any necessary updates or corrections before the deadline passes, ensuring your right to vote is protected. Step 5: Identifying potential registration issues If you have not voted recently, double-checking your registration can help you identify any issues that may prevent you from voting, such as being removed from the voter rolls due to inactivity. Identifying these issues ahead of time allows you to address them and ensure you can exercise your right to vote in upcoming elections. In conclusion, double-checking your voter registration helps ensure that your information is accurate, up-to-date, and that you are eligible to vote in upcoming elections. It helps identify and resolve potential issues, protecting your constitutional right to participate in the democratic process."},{"question":"Balkan ülkesi Temmuz 2013'te AB'nin bir sonraki üyesi olmaya hazırlanıyor.

When most people think of air pollution, they think of the pollution outdoors. But it is just as easy to have indoor air pollution. Your home or school classroom probably doesn't get much fresh air. Sealing up your home reduces heating and cooling costs. But this also causes air pollution to stay trapped indoors. And people today usually spend a majority of their time indoors. So exposure to indoor air pollution can become a significant health risk. Paragraph: Patty was a runner and liked hiking so she spent a lot of time outdoors. Her friend Fay sealed up her home to save money on energy and spent most of her time indoors. Both friends lived in an area with moderate to high levels of air pollution and attended a seminar where they learned more about the impact of air pollution on human health.

Bellette continued to paint classical scenes, and around 1950 produced the work Chorus without Iphigenia. Purchased by the National Gallery of Australia in 1976, this oil painting shows five figures, \\"posed like statues in a tableau vivant, [and who] possess a kind of erotic energy\\". Anne Gray, the National Gallery's curator, interpreted the scene chosen by Bellette: Although nothing is happening in this image, we associate the figures with tragedy, with death and mourning – with the classical reference in the painting's title. Iphigenia, Agamemnon's daughter, gave her life for her country when the goddess Artemis asked for it in exchange for favourable winds so that the Greek ships could sail to Troy. Bellette's melancholic painting might be supposed to portray Iphigenia's friends mourning her death. In 1951, Bellette came second in the Commonwealth Jubilee Art Competition, behind the young Jeffrey Smart. The following year, she won a competitive exhibition sponsored by Metro Goldwyn Mayer, with Girl With Still Life.Although Haefliger never critiqued his wife's exhibitions, others occasionally stepped in to provide reviews in the Herald.

It's asking if time travel is possible using something called cosmic strings. To explain what cosmic strings are, imagine if the universe was a big ball of dough. When it was very, very young and still cooking, it might have cracked a little bit. These cracks or faults in the universe are what we call cosmic strings. It's like little threads in the universe ball of dough. So the second question asks, can we use these universe threads or cosmic threads to travel in time?

Eventually, the outer layer of the planet cooled to form a solid crust when water began accumulating in the atmosphere. The Moon formed soon afterwards, possibly as the result of a Mars-sized object with about 10% of the Earth's mass impacting the planet in a glancing blow. Some of this object's mass merged with the Earth, significantly altering its internal composition, and a portion was ejected into space. Some of the material survived to form an orbiting moon. Outgassing and volcanic activity produced the primordial atmosphere. Condensing water vapor, augmented by ice delivered from comets, produced the oceans. The initial state of earth was what?","response":"The initial state of Earth was molten, characterized by extreme volcanism and frequent collisions with other celestial bodies. During this period, Earth was subject to extremely high temperatures, which caused the formation of molten rock and metals. The planet's outer layer was in a constant state of flux, and it lacked a solid crust. The formation of a solid crust began much later when the outer layer started to cool down, allowing water to accumulate in the atmosphere. Concurrently, a series of geological and astronomical events — including the formation of the Moon due to a significant impact and the gradual development of Earth's primordial atmosphere — guided the Earth's evolution towards its current state. Ultimately, the condensing water vapor combined with ice from comets helped create the oceans that cover the majority of Earth's surface today."},{"question":"The answer to the question: What is the last name of the person who was able to secure occasional commissions to compose theatrical works for the Gonzaga court? is inside the article: (English: \\"The Marriage of Thetis\\") After Duke Vincenzo's death in February 1612, Monteverdi found himself out of favour at the Mantuan court. Vincenzo's successor Francesco had no high regard for Monteverdi, and dismissed him from his post. Upon Francesco's sudden death in December 1612, the dukedom passed to his brother Ferdinando, but Monteverdi was not recalled to the court and was appointed maestro di capella in August 1613 at St Mark's, Venice. However, he remained in contact with Striggio and other highly placed Gonzaga courtiers, through whom he was able to secure occasional commissions to compose theatrical works for the Gonzaga court. Thus, late in 1616, Striggio asked him to set to music Scipione Agnelli's libretto Le nozze di Tetide, as part of the celebrations for Duke Ferdinando's forthcoming marriage to Catherine de' Medici. This story, based on the wedding of the mythical Greek hero Peleus to the sea-goddess Thetis, had previously been offered to the Mantuan court by Peri, whose setting of a libretto by Francesco Cini had been rejected in 1608 in favour of L'Arianna.Initially, Monteverdi had little enthusiasm for Le nozze di Tetide, and sought ways of avoiding or delaying work on it. He would accept the commission, he informed Striggio on 9 December 1616, because it was the wish of the duke, his feudal lord. However, the verses he was given were not, he felt, conducive to beautiful music. He found the tale difficult to understand, and did not think he could be inspired by it. In any event he was occupied for most of December in writing a Christmas Eve mass for St Mark's. On 29 December, perhaps hoping that the commission would be withdrawn, Monteverdi told Striggio that he was ready to begin work on Le Nozze di Tetide \\"if you tell me to do so\\". In January 1617, however, he became more enthusiastic on learning that the project had been scaled down and was now being projected as a series of intermedi.

The comments came during a speech at the Shangri-La Dialogue, an annual Asian defense forum in Singapore. In the speech, Mattis laid out the broader U.S. strategy for a \\"free and open\\" Indo-Pacific region. \\"China's policy in the South China Sea stands in stark contrast to the openness our strategy promotes. It calls into question China's broader goals,\\" Mattis said. Specifically, the Pentagon chief mentioned China's deployment of anti-ship and surface-to-air missiles, electronic jammers, and the landing of a bomber aircraft at the Paracel Islands off the coast of Vietnam. \\"Despite China's claim to the contrary, the placement of these weapon systems is tied directly to military use for the purposes of intimidation and coercion,\\" Mattis added. Though much of the world is focused on an upcoming summit between North Korea and the United States, this year's Shangri-La Dialogue has focused primarily on the region's long-term future and how to deal with a more assertive China. Beijing has begun projecting power beyond its borders, most notably through the construction and militarization of islands in disputed areas of the South China Sea. China claims nearly the entire South China Sea, despite overlapping claims by countries including Vietnam, the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Taiwan. Last week, the United States disinvited China from the Rim of the Pacific exercise (RIMPAC), a major international maritime exercise to be held later this year, citing Beijing's behavior in the South China Sea. Mattis on Saturday referred to that disinvitation as an \\"initial response\\" to China, but he did not outline any additional steps that might be taken. \\"The U.S. will continue to pursue a constructive, results-oriented relationship with China, cooperating when possible and competing vigorously where...

Answer:","response":"The player for the Minneapolis Lakers in the 1947-48 season who earned the nickname \\"Mr. Basketball\\" was George Mikan. Born on June 18, 1924, in Joliet, Illinois, George Mikan was an American professional basketball player who became one of the most dominant forces in the first decade of the NBA. Mikan was a 6-foot-10-inch tall center with a remarkable set of skills that allowed him to excel not only defensively but offensively as well. His dominance inside the paint and on the boards, combined with an effective hook shot, helped him become a prolific scorer and rebounder in the early years of the league. After a successful college basketball career with the DePaul University Blue Demons, where he was coached by Hall of Famer Ray Meyer, Mikan was drafted by the Chicago American Gears of the National Basketball League (NBL) in 1946. After the Gears folded, he was picked up by the Minneapolis Lakers in 1947, beginning his career in the Basketball Association of America (BAA), which later merged with the NBL to form the NBA. Mikan was a four-time All-Star and a six-time All-NBA First Team Selection. During his time with the Lakers, the team won five championships in six years (1949, 1950, 1952, 1953, and 1954). Mikan's on-court presence was so transcendent that he was able to significantly impact the way basketball was played and officiated. As a dominant big man with excellent defensive instincts, Mikan played a key role in the NBA's eventual decision to widen the lane from six feet to twelve feet in an attempt to neutralize his proficiency inside the paint. Additionally, Mikan's propensity for goaltending shots led the league to establish goaltending rules. Consequently, his achievements earned him the nickname \\"Mr. Basketball,\\" a testament to his contribution to the growth and development of the sport. George Mikan retired in 1956, ending a decorated career in which he was consistently one of the top players in the league. He was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1959, solidifying his status as one of basketball's all-time greats. Moreover, Mikan's \\"Mr. Basketball\\" moniker has lived on and has been synonymous with legendary players who have had a profound effect on the sport. In conclusion, George Mikan, who played for the Minneapolis Lakers in the 1947-48 season, was nicknamed \\"Mr. Basketball\\" due to his dominating presence on the court, his innovative style of play, and his significant contributions to the evolution of the sport. As a trailblazer in the early years of professional basketball, Mikan's impact can still be seen in today's NBA; his legacy is an integral part of basketball history."},{"question":"Premise: \\"A plaza is filled with people walking to and fro.\\" Based on this premise, can we conclude that the hypothesis \\"As other people are sitting in red and white chairs off to the side.\\" is true?

A:","response":"I understand your perspective about the oak tree falling and making sunlight available to surrounding plants. However, the initial question seems to be asking for a general answer about what natural phenomenon typically allows sunlight to reach nearby plants. In this case, it is not specifically about grass or oak trees. The more relevant answer would focus on the process of plant growth and competition for resources, such as sunlight. In a plant community or ecosystem, larger plants and trees may block sunlight from reaching the smaller plants around them. When these larger plants die or fall, they create a gap in the canopy, allowing sunlight to become available to the surrounding smaller plants. This occurrence is known as gap dynamics. Gap dynamics is an essential process in maintaining the balance of an ecosystem. As older, taller, or more established plants die or are removed, it allows younger plants and different species to grow. This process promotes biodiversity and regeneration in the plant community. So, the right answer to the question \\"what falls making sunlight available to surrounding plants?\\" would be something like \\"larger plants, trees, or other barriers to sunlight that are removed from the plant community through natural processes, such as death, disturbance, or falling. This creates gaps, enabling sunlight to reach nearby smaller plants and promoting growth and diversity within the ecosystem.\\""},{"question":"one of india 's largest private banks , global trust bank , ordered to freeze withdrawals because of huge losses , is to merge with state-run oriental bank of commerce , the central bank said monday .

Prior to entering politics, Khan played international cricket for two decades in the late twentieth century. Khan was born to a Pashtun family in Lahore, Punjab, in 1952 and educated at Aitchison, Worcester, and later at Keble College, Oxford. At the height of his career, in 1982, the thirty-year-old Khan took over the captaincy of the Pakistan cricket team from Javed Miandad. As a captain, Khan played 48 Test matches, out of which 14 were won by Pakistan, 8 lost and the rest of 26 were drawn. He also played 139 ODIs, winning 77, losing 57 and ending one in a tie. In the team's second match, Khan led them to their first Test win on English soil for 28 years at Lord's. Khan's first year as captain was the peak of his legacy as a fast bowler as well as an all-rounder. He recorded the best Test bowling of his career while taking 8 wickets for 58 runs against Sri Lanka at Lahore in 1981-1982. He also topped both the bowling and batting averages against England in three Test series in 1982, taking 21 wickets and averaging 56 with the bat. Later the same year, he put up a highly acknowledged performance in a home series against the formidable Indian team by taking 40 wickets in six Tests at an average of 13.95. By the end of this series in 1982-1983, Khan had taken 88 wickets in 13 Test matches over a period of one year as captain. This same Test series against India, however, also resulted in a stress fracture in his shin that kept him out of cricket for more than two years. An experimental treatment funded by the Pakistani government helped him recover by the end of 1984 and he made a successful comeback to international cricket in the latter part of the 1984-1985 season. In India in 1987, Khan led Pakistan in its first-ever Test series win and this was followed by Pakistan's first series victory in England during the same year. During the 1980s, his team also recorded three creditable draws against the West Indies. India and Pakistan co-hosted the 1987 World Cup, but neither ventured beyond the semi-finals. Khan retired from international cricket at the end of the World Cup. In 1988, he was asked to return to the captaincy by the president of Pakistan, General Zia-Ul-Haq, and on 18 January, he announced his decision to rejoin the team. Soon after returning to the captaincy, Khan led Pakistan to another winning tour in the West Indies, which he has recounted as \\"the last time I really bowled well\\". He was declared Man of the Series against West Indies in 1988 when he took 23 wickets in 3 Tests. Khan's career-high as a captain and cricketer came when he led Pakistan to victory in the 1992 Cricket World Cup. Playing with a brittle batting line-up, Khan promoted himself as a batsman to play in the top order along with Javed Miandad, but his contribution as a bowler was minimal. At the age of 39, Khan took the winning last wicket himself. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: What other interesting information can you tell me?","response":"Imran Khan is a very important person in Pakistan. He was a very good cricket player and then became a leader of a political party. He was born in 1952 and has been part of the National Assembly, which helps make the rules in Pakistan.

Pick from: (a). yes (b). it is not possible to tell (c). no","response":"(a). Yes, we can conclude that \\"The Echizen recipes of crab and soba are still prepared today.\\" Providing a long and detailed answer: The mention of culinary delights including Echizen crab and distinctive Echizen soba strongly implies that these dishes are not just well-known, but they are also appreciated and enjoyed in contemporary times. The fact that they are described as \\"delights\\" suggests that they hold a special place in the local or regional cuisine, and there is demand and interest in continuing to prepare them today. The term \\"culinary delights\\" itself often refers to dishes that have a rich history or tradition and are still valued in modern cuisine. In the case of Echizen crab and Echizen soba, these recipes likely have their roots in the Echizen region of Japan, which is known for its seafood and buckwheat noodle dishes. The fact that these dishes are still considered \\"delights\\" today signifies that the traditional recipes continue to be enjoyed and appreciated in contemporary times. Echizen crab, also known as Echizen-gani and botan-gani, is a prized Japanese winter delicacy. Native to the Sea of Japan, this species of crab is rich in flavor, making it highly sought after in the culinary world. The harvesting season of Echizen crab is typically from November to March and is a significant component of the local fishing culture. Today, Echizen crab is still used in various dishes such as Sashimi, grilled, boiled, hot pot, and more, retaining their position as a culinary delight in the community. Echizen soba, on the other hand, is a well-known Japanese buckwheat noodle dish and a regional specialty of Fukui Prefecture, which includes the former Echizen Province. The distinctive Echizen soba is characterized by its slightly thicker and rough texture which gives it a unique mouthfeel. This soba's preparation methods differ from those of others, and it is often served with tasty dipping sauces or garnishes. The long-standing tradition of making soba in Echizen continues to be passed down through generations, and the dish remains a favorite in the local cuisine. Therefore, it is safe to conclude that the Echizen recipes of crab and soba are still prepared today, as they continue to hold a special place as culinary delights cherished for their unique flavor and rich history."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Give me a possible correct answer to the question \\"who is the new governor of florida 2011?\\" A:","response":"A: Rick Scott"},{"question":"Generate a short movie review that has negative sentiment.","response":"This movie was not very good.

How to save a choking cat Look for signs of choking. These are important to identify quickly. The signs of a choking cat include : Inability to breathe coughing forcefully drooling or gagging pawing at the mouth Be aware of signs that mimic choking.","response":"Step 1: Ensure your own safety Before attempting to help the choking cat, make sure you are in a safe environment and have the necessary tools and supplies. It's important to act quickly, but also to remain calm and collected throughout the process. Step 2: Secure the cat Carefully wrap the cat in a towel or blanket to help restrict its movement and avoid any accidental scratches or bites. It's vital to keep the cat as still as possible to prevent further injury or stress. Step 3: Open and check the cat's mouth Gently open the cat's mouth and inspect it for any visible obstructions. If you can see the object, use a pair of tweezers or your fingers to carefully remove it. Be cautious not to accidentally push the object deeper into the cat's throat. Step 4: Perform the Heimlich maneuver for cats (if necessary) If the obstruction cannot be removed manually, perform the Heimlich maneuver for cats. To do this, place the cat on its side, with its back against your chest. Place one hand under the cat's chest, just below the ribcage, and use your other hand to apply pressure in an upward and inward motion. Repeat this process several times to help dislodge the object. Step 5: Assess the situation After attempting the previous steps, reassess the cat's condition. If the choking signs have stopped and the cat appears to be breathing normally, the object may have been dislodged. If not, continue attempting to clear the obstruction, but also consider seeking immediate professional assistance. Step 6: Seek veterinary help Even if the cat has successfully stopped choking, it's essential to have them checked by a veterinarian. There may be underlying issues that have caused the choking incident, or the cat may have suffered injuries during the situation. In summary, after identifying a choking cat and being aware of the signs that mimic choking, the most logical next event is to secure the cat and attempt to remove any visible obstructions in its mouth or perform the Heimlich maneuver for cats. After the situation is resolved, seek veterinary help to ensure the cat's health and well-being."},{"question":"Which very famous door cannot be opened from the outside?","response":"The very famous door that cannot be opened from the outside is the door of the British Prime Minister's official residence, 10 Downing Street. The residence, located in Westminster, London, is one of the most recognized and iconic buildings in the United Kingdom. It serves as the headquarters and primary residence of the serving prime minister, and has been home to numerous British leaders since Sir Robert Walpole became the first prime minister to reside there in 1735. The black front door of 10 Downing Street is an essential symbol of the British government and has various security, historical, and symbolic qualities that distinguish it from other doorways. Here are some of the key features and functionality of the door: 1. No exterior handle: One of the primary security features of the door is that it lacks any handle or knob on the outside. This design decision was deliberately made to keep the building secure and prevent unauthorized access. Consequently, the door cannot be opened from the outside, preventing potential intruders or uninvited guests from entering the property. 2. Reinforced for security: The door is approximately 5.5 ft. (1.67 m) tall and 3 ft. (0.91 m) wide, and it is made from a heavy and secure blast-resistant material to protect the occupants from potential attacks. It is also said to be bulletproof and airtight, providing additional safety precautions for its residents. 3. Painted in glossy black: The front door is traditionally painted in dark glossy black. The striking color contributes to the iconic appearance of 10 Downing Street, as does the brass hardware and emblematic white fanlight window located above the door. 4. Number 10 on the door: A large white number 10 adorns the center of the door, signifying the building's address. The number is distinctively slanted to the right, with the zero sitting slightly higher than the one, adding to its distinctive appearance. 5. Traditional lion door knocker: The door also features a large brass door knocker in the shape of a lion's head. The door knocker is a historic design element and is instantly recognizable as the symbol of Downing Street's famous front door. 6.

Do all Linux programs work on all distributions? Does Netflix work with Linux?","response":"Hello little friend! Let me explain these two questions to you. They may seem similar, but they're actually different. 1. Do all Linux programs work on all distributions? Linux is like a big playground with many different sections, called distributions. Each section may have its own rules and toys, but they share a lot of common things. Programs are like the toys you can play with. Most of the time, a toy from one section will also work in another section. However, sometimes a toy may need some adjustments or extra pieces to fit in a different section. So, not all Linux programs work on every distribution, but many can with little changes. 2. Does Netflix work with Linux? Now, Netflix is a special toy that lets you watch movies and shows. This toy was not built specifically for the Linux playground, but some smart people figured out how to make it work. So yes, Netflix can work with Linux, but you might need some help and the right tools to set it up in your favorite section of the playground. I hope this helps you understand the difference, my little buddy!"},{"question":"Premise: \\"A young kid standing on a road with passing cars.\\" Hypothesis: \\"A kid stands in the middle of a road.\\" Do we know that the hypothesis entailed by the premise? Stream of thoughts:","response":"In this case, the premise states that there is a young kid standing on a road with passing cars. From this information, we can infer that the road is active with vehicular traffic. The hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests that the kid is standing in the middle of the road. Now let's analyze the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis to determine if the latter is entailed by the former: 1. The premise tells us that there is a young kid standing on a road. 2. The premise additionally informs us that there are cars passing by on this road. 3. The hypothesis suggests the kid is specifically standing in the middle of the road. Given these points, we cannot conclusively confirm that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. While the premise does indicate that there is a young kid on a road with passing cars, it does not specify the exact location of the kid on the road, such as whether they are standing in the middle, on the shoulder, or on the sidewalk. Since the premise does not provide this specific information, we cannot definitively determine that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."},{"question":"Does the sentence \\"Overseeing unsuccessful border conflicts with Egypt and Chad, Gaddafi's support for foreign militants and alleged responsibility for the Lockerbie bombing led to Libya's label of \\"international pariah\\".\\" answer the question \\"How did Gaddafi die?\\" Choose from: (a). yes (b). no","response":"(b). No, the given sentence does not answer the question \\"How did Gaddafi die?\\" Instead, it provides information about Gaddafi's actions that led to Libya being labeled an \\"international pariah.\\" It mentions the unsuccessful border conflicts with Egypt and Chad, Gaddafi's support for foreign militants, and his alleged responsibility for the Lockerbie bombing. To answer the question about Gaddafi's death, we must explore the events that occurred towards the end of his rule. Muammar Gaddafi, the former Libyan leader, was killed on October 20, 2011, near his hometown of Sirte in Libya. His death was a result of the Libyan Civil War, which was a conflict between Gaddafi's government and various rebel forces that sought to oust him from power. The civil war began in February 2011, following the Arab Spring movement that swept across North Africa and the Middle East. The movement led to widespread protests and uprisings against the regimes in countries like Tunisia and Egypt. In Libya, the protests rapidly evolved into an armed conflict between Gaddafi loyalists and anti-Gaddafi rebels. The conflict escalated, and the United Nations imposed a no-fly zone over Libya to protect civilians. The situation attracted international intervention. NATO and its partners launched a military campaign called Operation Unified Protector, with the aim of enforcing the no-fly zone and protecting civilians from Gaddafi's forces. This operation significantly weakened Gaddafi's government and military capabilities. By August 2011, rebel forces had entered the capital city of Tripoli, and Gaddafi's regime began to collapse. He fled the capital and went into hiding. On October 20, 2011, Gaddafi was discovered by opposition forces hiding in a drainage pipe near Sirte, his hometown. He was captured by rebels from the Misrata-based brigade and then violently killed by his captors. Graphic images and videos of the capture and killing were widely circulated around the world, marking the brutal end of Gaddafi's 42-year rule. In summary, the sentence provided does not answer the question about Gaddafi's death. Instead, it gives information about events that led to Libya being branded an \\"international pariah\\" under Gaddafi's rule."},{"question":"If \\"A woman in a black miniskirt riding an orange bike.\\", does this mean that \\"The woman is standing next to her bike.\\"?

Step 1: To find which countries the Equator passes through, I will refer to a world map or consult relevant information sources. Step 2: After researching, I find that the Equator passes through 13 countries: Ecuador, Colombia, Brazil, Sao Tome & Principe, Gabon, Republic of the Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda, Kenya, Somalia, Indonesia, Kiribati, and Maldives. Answer to Question 1: The Equator goes through Ecuador, Colombia, Brazil, Sao Tome & Principe, Gabon, Republic of the Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda, Kenya, Somalia, Indonesia, Kiribati, and Maldives. Question 2: Can you go from one country to the neighbouring country by car? Step 1: Determine which countries in the world the user is referring to, as the question doesn't specify any particular pair of countries. Step 2: Due to the open-ended nature of the question, I will provide a general answer regarding the possibility of traveling between neighboring countries by car. Answer to Question 2: In many cases, you can go from one country to a neighboring country by car, provided that there are roads, bridges, or tunnels connecting them. International borders may require passing through customs and immigration checkpoints. However, it's important to note that some borders might restrict vehicle passage, have rough terrain, or be separated by water bodies with no available road connections. Now, I will answer the question about whether these two questions are asking the same thing. Analysis: The first question is asking about the specific countries through which the Equator passes. The second question is asking about the possibility of traveling between neighboring countries by car. Answer: No, these two questions are not asking the same thing. They address two different topics - one regarding the location of the Equator and the other about traveling between countries by car."},{"question":"The site of Richmond had been an important village of the Powhatan Confederacy, and was briefly settled by English colonists from Jamestown in 1609, and in 1610–1611.

It’s called genetic transfer or bacterial conjugation . It can occur in two ways. One way is when cells “grab” stray pieces of DNA from their environment. The other way is when cells directly exchange DNA (usually plasmids) with other cells. For example, as shown in Figure below , the donor cell makes a structure called an F pilus , or sex pilus. The F pilus attaches one cell to another cell. The membranes of the two cells merge and genetic material, usually a plasmid , moves into the recipient cell. Genetic transfer makes bacteria very useful in biotechnology. It can be used to create bacterial cells that carry new genes.

Sentence A: \\"Books record what happens every day.\\" 1. Books are a medium of written communication. 2. Books can contain various types of information: stories, references, essays, research findings, etc. 3. Books are typically not designed to record daily events or news. 4. Unlike newspapers, books are generally published infrequently and are not updated daily. 5. Therefore, Sentence A is not logical, as it claims that books record daily events when they typically do not. Sentence B: \\"Newspapers record what happens every day.\\" 1. Newspapers are a medium of written communication. 2. Newspapers are specifically designed to report events and news on a daily or regular basis. 3. Newspapers are published frequently (daily, weekly, or at other regular intervals) and contain information about current events. 4. Therefore, Sentence B is logical, as it accurately describes the function of newspapers to record daily happenings.

And the answer is...","response":"Alright, remember we want to find the value of y in this equation: 0 = 33*y + 2288 - 2057. First, let's simplify the equation. We will add and subtract the numbers. 2288 - 2057 = 231. Now, our equation looks like this: 0 = 33*y + 231. We need to get y by itself, so let's subtract 231 from both sides of the equation. 0 - 231 = -231, so now we have: -231 = 33*y. Now, we just need to divide both sides of the equation by 33 to find the value of y. -231 ÷ 33 = -7. So, our final answer is y = -7. That's it!

Answer:","response":"Title: Satisfactory But Needs Improvement - 3 Stars Review: As a regular user of the app com.google.android.gms, I would like to share my overall experience with the app, which I find to be satisfactory but in need of significant improvements. In general, the app functions decently for what it is supposed to offer, but there are several areas where it could be enhanced. Firstly, the app's user interface could be more intuitive and user-friendly. While the layout and design are somewhat clean, the various features are not organized in the most logical manner, which makes it more difficult for new users to navigate through the application. Instead of spending a significant amount of time trying to understand where certain features are, users should be able to access them quickly and effortlessly. Secondly, there have been instances when the app has suffered from performance issues, leading to slow response times and occasional crashes. These incidents are frustrating and detract from the overall user experience. From a developer's perspective, it would be crucial to work on stability and performance updates. Addressing these issues would lead to an enhanced user experience that keeps users engaged with the app. Moreover, I have encountered instances when the app did not sync properly. I would expect the app to automatically sync and update its content, but there have been cases where I had to manually refresh the app to get the most recent data. This lack of synchronization can be annoying, especially if I am relying on up-to-date information provided by the app. Another area that could use improvement is the app's customer support. While it is certainly appreciated that the developers are proactive in continuously updating the app, there have been occasions when I had to contact customer support seeking assistance for certain issues. Unfortunately, the response time was relatively slow, and the answers provided did not always resolve the problem. Increased investment in delivering more efficient customer support would significantly boost the overall customer experience. Lastly, while the app boasts a wide range of useful features, it would be beneficial to see more additional functionalities being introduced. The developers should consider expanding the app's capabilities by incorporating user preferences and popular demands for making it versatile in addressing various users' needs. In conclusion, while com.google.android.gms is by no means a terrible app, it does need several necessary improvements to transition from being a satisfactory 3-star rated app to a top-notch 5-star one. Enhancements in the user interface, performance, synchronization, customer support, and the introduction of more interesting features will undoubtedly contribute to elevating the app to the next level for its community of users."},{"question":"I know that the answer to the question \\"Which is not a source of warmth for incubation: the sun, volcanic sources, or megapodes?\\" is in \\"Incubation, which optimises temperature for chick development, usually begins after the last egg has been laid. In monogamous species incubation duties are often shared, whereas in polygamous species one parent is wholly responsible for incubation. Warmth from parents passes to the eggs through brood patches, areas of bare skin on the abdomen or breast of the incubating birds. Incubation can be an energetically demanding process; adult albatrosses, for instance, lose as much as 83 grams (2.9 oz) of body weight per day of incubation. The warmth for the incubation of the eggs of megapodes comes from the sun, decaying vegetation or volcanic sources. Incubation periods range from 10 days (in woodpeckers, cuckoos and passerine birds) to over 80 days (in albatrosses and kiwis).\\". Can you tell me what it is? Answer:","response":"The passage you provided states that the warmth for the incubation of the eggs of megapodes comes from the sun, decaying vegetation, or volcanic sources. Based on this information, all three options— the sun, volcanic sources, and megapodes— are indeed sources of warmth for incubation. However, your question asks for the option that is not a source of warmth for incubation. It appears that there may be some confusion in the question itself, as the provided passage indicates that all three options you mention are indeed sources of warmth for incubation. Megapodes are a type of bird that use external heat sources like the sun and volcanic sources to keep their eggs warm; thereby, aiding in incubation. Therefore, the correct response should be that all three mentioned sources are relevant to incubation. It is essential to recognize that the question formulation might be ambiguous, as it inadvertently presents the megapodes as a potential heat source for incubation rather than a species of birds that utilize the heat sources mentioned (sun and volcanic sources) for incubation purposes."},{"question":"In this task, you are given a sentence in the English language and your task is to convert it into the Hindi language.

A bitter Jacqueline follows them to Egypt, appearing wherever they go. Hercule Poirot (David Suchet) is also on holiday in Egypt. While staying in the same hotel as the newlyweds, he is approached by Linnet Doyle who is getting tired of Jacqueline's harassment.

Among his most successful pupils were the composers Thorvald Aagaard, remembered in particular for his songs, Harald Agersnap, both a conductor and orchestral composer, and Jørgen Bentzon who composed choral and chamber music mainly for his folk music school (Københavns Folkemusikskole). Among his other students were the musicologist Knud Jeppesen, the pianist Herman Koppel, the academy professor and symphony composer Poul Schierbeck, the organist Emilius Bangert who played at Roskilde Cathedral, and Nancy Dalberg, one of Nielsen's private students who helped with the orchestration of Aladdin.

Bobby Jindal’s presidential aspirations, the New England Democrat has no qualms about taking the fight to the GOP. “Such a charitable man,” Malloy said of Christie, with a proverbial tongue in his cheek. “He has spread goodwill to so many places. He’s really quite remarkable, isn’t he.” Moments earlier, in an interview with TIME on Thursday, he muffled a laugh as he described Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, whose remarks he once called “the most insane statement I’ve ever heard,” as the “toughest one to beat in the Republican field.” Seizing an opportunity in a party depleted of household names not Clinton or Obama, Malloy is rising to the occasion, positioning himself as one of the party’s top attack dogs as the 2016 cycle approaches. But Malloy is also envisioning a larger role for himself within the party too. Addressing the winter meeting of the Association of State Democratic Chairs Thursday he delivered a fiery speech, imploring the party to refocus on its core values. “When we run as Republican-lite we lose,” he said. “Let us be Democrats once again,” he added, earning a standing ovation and whooping cheers. Malloy was one of the few Democratic success stories of 2014, expanding his margin of victory in a repeat of his 2010 grudge match with Republican Tom Foley. He holds up his support of gun control laws and minimum wage hikes as a model for other Democrats. As the chair-designate of the Democratic Governors Association, it will be Malloy’s job next year to try to pick up seats from Republicans, who now hold a near-record 31 governorships. Speaking to TIME, Malloy wasn’t shy about attacking his GOP colleagues, and expanded on his call for the Democratic Party to stop being “Republicans-lite.” Below is a lightly edited and condensed transcript: Gov. Dan Malloy: My message is first of all we’ve got to elect a democratic president. Otherwise the hard fought gains that we made under this president will be swept away. We’ve got to begin the process of changing the Congress and each election we need to pick up seats and we need to be on the offensive. What I’m hoping to do is see Democrats get elected. That’s what I’m trying to contribute to. TIME: But you’re saying the right type of Democrat, right? Malloy: I think any Democrat is better. But I think what my message is, it’s about running as a Democrat. It’s about talking about Democratic values. I think we have to talk about Democratic values in this country again, because I think Republicans and their allies on Fox and elsewhere have done a good job of confusing people about who is actually pulling for them. You know and I know and economists know that trickle-down economics doesn’t work. But we’ve got all kinds of people in this country who are confused by what they hear on fox everyday or elsewhere everyday and actually believe that somehow that’s going to trickle down to them even though during the last 25-30 years when trickle-down has been so often rolled out by Republicans, the middle class has not gotten bigger, wages are not up, quality of life for many of our citizens is not increasing the way that it should. So I think we need to be talking about our values versus their values. Listen, I’ve got rich friend. I don’t mind the rich getting richer, but the poor shouldn’t be getting poorer and there should be more people moving into the middle class. TIME: Are some Democrats in Washington not doing enough of that? Did that contribute to the defeats in 2014? Malloy: I think there are a lot of people who consciously or unconsciously, ran away from the president and the ideals of the party, and I’m not going to name names, but I think it’s important that we do what Republicans do, and view elections as a portion of the continuum, not as a stand-alone event. And every election needs to be built in part on the prior one and every new success needs to be built upon a prior success. And if we do that I think we’ll be stronger. TIME: Looking ahead to 2016, should there be other Democrats entering the race to have this sort of dialogue? Malloy: That’s up to other people. I think people have to make their decisions about whether they want to run. I think there are a lot of Democrats who want Hillary to run and I think she would be an extremely strong candidate for the nomination and to be elected. I’m glad we don’t have 23 people running for president right now, although, as I said, I think the toughest one to beat would be Bobby Jindal. So we have to worry about him. People are either going to run for president or not, she’s going to either run for president or not, I think it looks more and more like that she’s going to, but she’ll cross that bridge when she gets to it. TIME: Have you ever given it any thought? Malloy: No. Whenever people say you should president, I say, ‘I thought you liked me.’ Listen, I thought being mayor of Stamford was a wonderful job. Being governor of a state for a period of time is a wonderful job, and I’m not sure I’m at all attracted to Washington. TIME: Gov. Chris Christie to your south seems to be having a bit of a rough turn. Malloy: Such a charitable man. He has spread goodwill to so many places. He’s really quite remarkable, isn’t he. TIME: He’s been facing some budget issues and dealing with pension reform… Malloy: Dealing with pension reform. He’s in the process of destroying public pensions, which by the way comes out of the Republican playbook. He hasn’t told the truth about what he’s doing, but that’s what he’s doing. The level of defunding that’s taken place under his administration is remarkable and I think the state’s bond rating will pay perhaps not a permanent price, but a longterm price. He’ll saddle that problem to some unfortunate Democrat who’s going to have to come in and do the right thing. That’s the hard part about being a Democrat, you have to clean up after Republicans. TIME: Are you concerned that momentum Republicans are showing? Malloy: Yeah, that’s why I gave a speech. That’s why I think we have to rise as Democrats. I understand that everybody’s got to make tough choices in elections, but to defund your pension system by billions and billions of dollars, which is what New Jersey has done is not the right thing to do. To take away people’s rights to collectively negotiate their contracts, that’s not the right thing to do. And neither one of those things is going to help the middle class of those states. It’s just not going to. In some states it works to bash people who are a little bit better off than you to maybe make you feel better, but it is not a proven way to raise up the middle class, to raise the size of the middle class or to raise people’s standards of living. TIME: On gun control, do you see a path to revitalizing the national conversation around gun control? Malloy: There will be more and more events like Sandy Hook. Look at the number of children that have been killed in schools since Sandy Hook. I’ve stopped counting, it’s astronomical when you think about the killing of children or babies. This discussion is not done. People actually understand that mentally ill people should not be able to buy guns, that people with violent felony backgrounds should not be able to buy guns. They understand that. It’s when the other side wraps it with rhetoric like ‘they want to take your gun away.’ Well, no one wants to take your gun away, unless you’re, you know, a violent felon or you’re mentally ill, or you’ve threatened someone with it. That’s not happening anywhere. This conversation’s going to play out over a long period of time, and then the states that have done something about it, like my state, we continue to see a precipitous drop in homicides, and crime falling in Connecticut at three times the national average. TIME: Where do you stand on the legalization of marijuana? Malloy: That’s not something I’m interested in. I decriminalized marijuana. We have 6,000 fewer arrests as a result of decriminalizing it, and we passed medical marijuana and I’m comfortable with where we are. I think it would be a mistake to become involved in the sale of marijuana for income purposes. It should be a standalone decision, it shouldn’t be based on whether you’re going to get a little money for it. TIME: You’re taking over as chair of the DGA next year, what are you hoping to accomplish? Malloy: There are not a lot of Democratic governors, and we need to go our and fight the fight and take some of those states back and lay the groundwork for taking others back four years from now. I’ve always played a leadership role in any organization I’ve been apart of and I certainly have been the beneficiary of other governors, so I want to pay that back. I think this is important work. I think what Republicans pulled off in state legislatures following the Census and their wins in 2010 has been very hurtful to the country. We have too few districts in the country that are in play, and as a result the Congress of the United States doesn’t do what it was intended to do, and that is to actually represent the majority will of the people. They’ve in other words, been gerrymandered. TIME: Do you plan to step up your role in the party? Malloy: Obviously I’m here, and I was asked to speak, and there weren’t a whole lot of wins, so they’ve asked me to participate. And yes I’m going to play a role in trying to get more people elected as Democrats to the Houses and Senates and Assemblies, and more governors, and I’m on the lookout for good candidates for governor in the 2016 cycle. Some of those are pretty well set and some of those are going to be pretty wide open. TIME: Have you started the recruitment process? Malloy: We are engaged in the recruitment process. That begins with talking to people who are expressing interest and making sure that people understand what it is to be a candidate in a statewide election. You have a lot of folks who want to run who’ve never run statewide and it’s not an easy thing to do. Part of our job is to make sure people understand and are sufficiently committed to doing that. TIME: What are your thoughts on the Republican governors who have warned about the threat of ISIS as their party is embroiled in a shutdown fight over the Department of Homeland Security. Malloy: Those Republican governors should talk to the Republican members of Congress who are threatening to defund the agency that they are otherwise relying on. You know, it’s a wonderful thing, Republicans have both sides of their mouth and they’re able to use them well. The governor complains that there is a threat of ISIS in Milwaukee, but the Republican members of the Congress vote against funding the agency that’s charged with protecting us from it because they have a disagreement with the president over the ability of the people who were brought to this country as children and who have graduated from our school systems, to stay in this country. When they only speak English. That’s what this fight’s about. Republicans—they want to have both sides of the immigration issue, they want to have both sides of the job issue, they want to have both sides of the healthcare issue, and it’s incumbent on some of us not to let them get away with it. What is a short summary of the above article?","response":"The article talks about Connecticut Governor Dan Malloy, who is a Democrat and is not afraid to criticize other governors who are Republicans. He wants to make sure that more Democrats are elected in different positions, like in Houses, Senates, and as governors.

The description may include multiple steps but you should only ouput one SQL statement that accomplishes every step. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1. Q: find the number of rows in Customers table whose customer_details equals Unsatisfied A:","response":"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Customers WHERE customer_details = 'Unsatisfied';"},{"question":"I can use this background: Another example of negative feedback has to do with blood glucose levels. When glucose (sugar) levels in the blood are too high, the pancreas secretes insulin to stimulate the absorption of glucose and the conversion of glucose into glycogen, which is stored in the liver. As blood glucose levels decrease, less insulin is produced. When glucose levels are too low, another hormone called glucagon is produced, which causes the liver to convert glycogen back to glucose.

A wanted criminal named Burch tries to ambush bounty hunter Jim Kipp, but Kipp gets the better of him. Kipp takes Burch's corpse into town to collect the reward. A representative of the Pinkerton Detective Agency asks Kipp to hunt a trio of fugitives. Three masked men committed a robbery and fled with 100,000. Kipp, who has the reputation that he will do anything for money, is offered a huge reward if he can capture the culprits dead or alive. Kipp rides into the town of Twin Forks, and uses an alias. He seeks information about one fugitive's wounds from Dr. Spencer, who is wary of revealing too much. Kipp is immediately attracted to the doctor's daughter, Julie. A limping man named Bill Rachin, who works at the hotel, draws Kipp's suspicion. So does George Williams, a card dealer. Williams' wife, Alice, flirts with Kipp and tries to coax information out of him. Kipp does not reveal the purpose for his visit. Vance Edwards identifies Kipp and his reputation as a bounty hunter. Edwards mistakenly believes Kipp is seeking him for another crime. The townspeople become anxious as the truth about Kipp becomes known.

Beringia provided a migratory route for numerous mammal species, including brown bear, camel, horse, caribou, and moose, as well as humans. As the Pleistocene came to an end, ocean levels began to rise; elk migrated southwards into Asia and North America. In North America they adapted to almost all ecosystems except for tundra, true deserts, and the gulf coast of the U.S. The elk of southern Siberia and central Asia were once more widespread but today are restricted to the mountain ranges west of Lake Baikal including the Sayan and Altai Mountains of Mongolia and the Tianshan region that borders Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, and China's Xinjiang Province. The habitat of Siberian elk in Asia is similar to that of the Rocky Mountain subspecies in North America. Is this statement correct \\"is a caribou the same as an elk\\"?","response":"No, sweetie, a caribou is not the same as an elk. They are both big animals that are part of the deer family, but they have differences. Think of it this way: just like a cat and a dog are both pets but different from each other, a caribou and an elk are both big deer-like animals, but they’re also different from each other. Elks are usually found in forests and can have really big antlers that look like a tree branch. Caribous, which are also called reindeer in some places (yes, just like the ones that pull Santa's sleigh), usually live in really cold places, like the North Pole, and both boy and girl caribous can have antlers, not just boys like in most deer families.

The project of establishing an 'Eton Mission' in the crowded district of Hackney Wick in east London was started at the beginning of 1880, and lasted until 1971 when it was decided that a more local project (at Dorney) would be more realistic. However over the years much money was raised for the Eton Mission, a fine church by G. F.

Construction & Purpose: The Eiffel Tower was built between 1887 and 1889 and was designed by Gustave Eiffel. Its original purpose was to serve as the entrance arch and centerpiece for the 1889 World's Fair, which marked the 100th anniversary of the French Revolution. It was meant to demonstrate France's industrial prowess to the world and wasn't constructed with any military objectives in mind. 2. World Wars: France participated in two major conflicts during the 20th century—the World War I (1914-1918) and World War II (1939-1945). The Eiffel Tower did not directly participate in combat, but served a few peripheral functions that may have contributed to the overall war efforts. 3. Communication role: During the First World War, the Eiffel Tower was used as a wireless telegraph transmitter station for communication purposes. It played a role in intercepting enemy messages and relaying information to French troops. This communication function became even more prominent during World War II when the tower assisted the French Resistance in gathering intelligence and coordinating operations. 4. Psychological impact: It is worth mentioning the symbolic and psychological importance of the Eiffel Tower. As an iconic and well-recognized symbol of France, the tower's survival of both world wars served as a powerful message of French resilience and unity. This might have had an indirect impact on boosting morale and strengthening the French war effort. In conclusion, while the Eiffel Tower did not directly contribute to any specific war victory, it did play a communication role during both World Wars and served as a symbol of French strength and perseverance. Its indirect contributions through these functions might have helped France in their overall war efforts."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Question: \\"What event was aid given for\\" Context: \\"Although the Chinese government was initially praised for its response to the quake (especially in comparison to Myanmar's ruling military junta's blockade of aid during Cyclone Nargis), it then saw an erosion in confidence over the school construction scandal.\\" Answer: Answer:","response":"In the given context, the event for which aid was given was the massive earthquake that struck China. The earthquake in reference is known as the 2008 Sichuan Earthquake or the Great Wenchuan Earthquake. This catastrophic natural disaster occurred on May 12, 2008, with its epicenter in Wenchuan County, Sichuan Province, China. The earthquake had a magnitude of 8.0 on the Richter scale and resulted in widespread devastation, claiming the lives of about 70,000 people, injuring over 370,000, and leaving millions displaced. Following the earthquake, the Chinese government acted swiftly in providing help and assistance to the affected regions. They launched a massive search and rescue operation to look for survivors, relocate the displaced people, and ensure medical help and supplies reached those in need. The government received international praise for their quick and efficient response in the aftermath of the quake, which was in stark contrast to the Myanmar government's handling of Cyclone Nargis that happened around the same time (May 2, 2008). In the case of Myanmar, the ruling military junta blocked international aid and relief efforts, causing a humanitarian crisis. However, as the rescue and recovery efforts continued in China, allegations emerged about the poor quality of construction in schools that had collapsed during the earthquake. Many school buildings, which were referred to as \\"tofu-dreg schools\\" due to their substandard construction, crumbled, causing a high number of child casualties. This tragedy raised questions about possible corruption, mismanagement, and inadequate enforcement of safety regulations. The public's confidence in the Chinese government began to wane as anger and frustration grew over the school construction scandal. Demonstrations and demands for investigations into the matter followed, with citizens calling for increased transparency and accountability from the government officials responsible for the school constructions. The Chinese government responded with investigations, acknowledging the problem and promising to take actions against those responsible for shoddy construction practices, later prosecuting and convicting numerous officials and builders. In conclusion, the event for which aid was given was the 2008 Sichuan Earthquake in China. While the Chinese government's initial response was praised for its efficiency and effectiveness, the aftermath exposed a major scandal related to the construction of poorly built schools that had collapsed during the earthquake, resulting in an erosion of public confidence in the government."},{"question":"Question: Ruda [ˈruda] is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Tarczyn within Piaseczno County Masovian Voivodeship in east-central Poland.

Input: By Roger HarrabinBBC environment analyst The critcism comes from Environment Secretary Michael Gove, who said some firms had paid no tax and hidden their earnings offshore. And he promised to back the regulator Ofwat in tightening up rules to protect bill-payers and the environment. The industry body Water UK responded that the companies were dealing firmly with issues that threatened trust. But Mr Gove’s speech to a water industry conference must have made uncomfortable listening. He complained that water firms had paid out almost all of their £18bn profits to shareholders, instead of re-investing it in mending leaks and protecting the environment. And he named names: The boss of United Utilities taking home £2.8m a year; the head of Severn Trent, £2.4m. The secretary of state said last year Anglian and Southern paid zero corporation tax, whilst Thames has paid no corporation tax for a decade. He suggested: \\"Some of their best brains appear to be as intent on financial engineering as much as real engineering.\\" Mr Gove promised to back recommendations from the regulator Ofwat due to be published in April – and said he would not hesitate to increase the pressure.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","response":"Indirectly impacting a step of the process. Reasoning: During hot days, the ambient temperature may increase slightly, which could potentially affect how quickly the magma cools once it reaches the surface of the Earth. While the heat of the day itself is not directly responsible for any of the steps in the volcanic process, it plays a minor role in indirectly modifying one of the steps, specifically the cooling of the magma after it has been pushed to the surface. However, it is important to note that the significance of this impact can vary and may not always be substantial enough to cause any major changes in the overall volcanic process."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Process: - Coal is burned - Sulfur in the coal combines with oxygen to form sulfur oxides - The sulfur oxides are released into the atmosphere - The sulfides combine with oxygen in the atmosphere to form sulfur trioxide - The sulfur trioxide reacts with water in the atmosphere to form sulfuric acid, a very strong acid - The sulfuric acid makes the rain acidic - Question: suppose more sulfur oxides are formed happens, how will it affect less sulfur trioxide forms. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","response":"If more sulfur oxides are formed, it can potentially lead to less sulfur trioxide formation, depending on the factors that contribute to the conversion of sulfur oxides to sulfur trioxide. Let's discuss this in detail. When coal is burned, sulfur in the coal combines with oxygen to form sulfur oxides, predominantly sulfur dioxide (SO2). This SO2 can then undergo further oxidation to form sulfur trioxide (SO3), which is responsible for the formation of sulfuric acid (H2SO4) in the acid rain process. The conversion of sulfur dioxide to sulfur trioxide depends on various factors, including the presence of catalysts, temperature, and concentration of the reactants. (1) Catalyst: In the presence of certain catalysts, such as nitrogen oxides (NOx) or particulate matter, the rate of SO2 to SO3 conversion can be accelerated. If more sulfur oxides are formed and the necessary catalysts are available, more sulfur trioxide could potentially be formed, leading to more acidic rain. However, if the catalysts are not present or their concentration is insufficient, an increase in sulfur oxides may not necessarily lead to a proportional increase in sulfur trioxide formation. In this case, the sulfur dioxide could remain in the atmosphere for longer periods or be transported over longer distances before eventually being oxidized to sulfur trioxide. (2) Temperature: The oxidation of SO2 to SO3 is generally favored at higher temperatures. In regions or seasons with lower temperatures, increased formation of sulfur oxides may not lead to a proportional increase in sulfur trioxide formation. As a result, the impact on acid rain formation could be less significant. (3) Concentration of reactants: If there is an abundance of sulfur dioxide in the atmosphere due to increased sulfur oxide emissions, the concentration of reactants in the air could limit the rate of conversion of SO2 to SO3. With more sulfur dioxide competing for the available oxygen, a situation of diminishing returns could be created, reducing the overall efficiency of sulfur trioxide formation. In conclusion, several factors can influence the relationship between the formation of sulfur oxides and sulfur trioxide. While the overall trend could suggest that more sulfur oxides may lead to more sulfur trioxide, there is also a possibility that the formation of sulfur trioxide could be less efficient due to limiting factors such as catalyst availability, temperature, and reactant concentration. Therefore, the answer to whether more sulfur oxide formation leads to more or less sulfur trioxide formation would be dependent on the specific circumstances and cannot be definitively determined with the information provided in the question."},{"question":"Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

This endemic canid became extinct in 1876, the first known canid to have become extinct in historical times. It was the only modern species in the genus \\"Dusicyon\\". - The American mink (\\"Neovison vison\\") is a semiaquatic species of mustelid native to North America, though human intervention has expanded its range to many parts of Europe and South America. Because of range expansion, the American mink is classed as a least-concern species by the IUCN. Since the extinction of the sea mink, the American mink is the only extant member of the genus \\"Neovison\\". The American mink is a carnivore which feeds on rodents, fish, crustaceans, frogs, and birds. In its introduced range in Europe it has been classified as an invasive species linked to declines in European mink, Pyrenean desman, and water vole populations. It is the most frequently farmed animal for its fur, exceeding the silver fox, sable, marten, and skunk in economic importance. - A fish is any member of a group of organisms that consist of all gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits. They form a sister group to the tunicates, together forming the olfactores. Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups. Tetrapods emerged within lobe-finned fishes, so cladistically they are fish as well. However, traditionally fish are rendered obsolete or paraphyletic by excluding the tetrapods (i.e., the amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals which all descended from within the same ancestry). Because in this manner the term \\"fish\\" is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group, it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in systematic biology. The traditional term pisces (also ichthyes) is considered a typological, but not a phylogenetic classification. - An invasive species is a plant, fungus, or animal species that is not native to a specific location (an introduced species), and which has a tendency to spread to a degree believed to cause damage to the environment, human economy or human health. - The martens constitute the genus Martes within the subfamily Mustelinae, in the family Mustelidae. Martens are slender, agile animals, adapted to living in taigas, and are found in coniferous and northern deciduous forests across the Northern Hemisphere. They have bushy tails, and large paws with partially retractible claws. The fur varies from yellowish to dark brown, depending on the species, and, in many cases, is valued by fur trappers. - Skunks are mammals known for their ability to spray a liquid with a strong odor. Different species of skunk vary in appearance from black-and-white to brown or cream colored, but all have warning coloration. - The sea mink (\\"Neovison macrodon\\") is an extinct North American member of the family Mustelidae. It is the only mustelid, and one of only two terrestrial mammal species in the order Carnivora known to have become extinct in historic times (the other being the Falkland Islands wolf). The body of the sea mink was significantly longer than that of the closely related American mink (\\"N. vison\\"), and also bulkier, leading to a pelt that was almost twice the size of the other species. The longest specimen recorded was said to be . The sea mink produced a distinctive odor, and had fur that was said to be coarser and redder than the American mink's. - The Mustelidae (from Latin \\"mustela\\", weasel) are a family of carnivorous mammals, including the weasel, badger, otter, marten, ferret, mink, stoat, and wolverine. Mustelids are diverse and the largest family in the order Carnivora. The internal classification is still disputed, with rival proposals containing between two and eight subfamilies. One study, published in 2008, questions the long-accepted Mustelinae subfamily, and suggests that the Mustelidae consist of four major clades and three much smaller lineages. - A carnivore meaning 'meat eater' (Latin, \\"caro\\" meaning 'meat' or 'flesh' and \\"vorare\\" meaning 'to devour') is an organism that derives its energy and nutrient requirements from a diet consisting mainly or exclusively of animal tissue, whether through predation or scavenging. Animals that depend solely on animal flesh for their nutrient requirements are called obligate carnivores while those that also consume non-animal food are called facultative carnivores. Omnivores also consume both animal and non-animal food, and apart from the more general definition, there is no clearly defined ratio of plant to animal material that would distinguish a facultative carnivore from an omnivore. A carnivore that sits at the top of the food chain is termed an apex predator. - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds. - The sable (\\"Martes zibellina\\") is a marten species, a small carnivorous mammal inhabiting forest environments, primarily in Russia from the Ural Mountains throughout Siberia, eastern Kazakhstan, northern Mongolia, China, North and South Korea and Hokkaid in Japan. Its range in the wild originally extended through European Russia to Poland and Scandinavia. It has historically been hunted for its highly valued dark brown or black fur, which remains a luxury good to this day. While hunting of wild animals is still common in Russia, most fur in the market is now commercially farmed. - Rodents (from Latin \\"rodere\\", \\"to gnaw\\") are mammals of the order Rodentia, which are characterized by a single pair of continuously growing incisors in each of the upper and lower jaws. About 40% of all mammal species are rodents; they are found in vast numbers on all continents except Antarctica. They are the most diversified mammalian order and live in a variety of terrestrial habitats, including human-made environments. - The Pyrenean desman (\\"Galemys pyrenaicus\\") is a small semiaquatic nocturnal mammal related to moles and shrews, and is one of only two surviving species of the tribe Desmanini. The range of the species centers on northwestern Spain and northern Portugal, but it is under threat due to changes to its habitat. In Portugal it's called \\"\\"toupeira-d'água\\"\\" which means \\"water mole\\". - A vole is a small rodent; a relative of the mouse, with a stouter body, a shorter, hairy tail, a slightly rounder head, smaller ears and eyes, and differently formed molars (high-crowned and with angular cusps instead of low-crowned and with rounded cusps). There are approximately 155 species of voles. They are sometimes known as meadow mice or field mice in North America and Australia. Vole species form the subfamily Arvicolinae with the lemmings and the muskrats. - Neovison is a genus of mustelids , including the extinct sea mink and the extant American mink . - Carnivora (from Latin \\"car\\" (stem \\"carn-\\") \\"flesh\\" and \\"vorre\\" \\"to devour\\") is a diverse order that includes over 280 species of placental mammals. Its members are formally referred to as carnivorans, whereas the word \\"carnivore\\" (often popularly applied to members of this group) can refer to any meat-eating organism. Carnivorans are the most diverse in size of any mammalian order, ranging from the least weasel (\\"Mustela nivalis\\"), at as little as and , to the polar bear (\\"Ursus maritimus\\"), which can weigh up to , to the southern elephant seal (\\"Mirounga leonina\\"), whose adult males weigh up to and measure up to in length.

Taylor formed Stone Sour in 1992, playing in the Des Moines area, and working on a demo. He joined Slipknot in 1997 to replace their original vocalist and has subsequently released five studio albums with them. After the first two Slipknot albums went Platinum, Taylor revived Stone Sour to record an album and tour in 2002. Context: In Des Moines, Iowa, Joey Jordison, Shawn Crahan, and Mick Thomson approached him asking him to join Slipknot. He agreed to go to one of their practices, and ended up singing in front of them. Of Slipknot's nine members, Corey was the sixth to join the band. Performing with Slipknot, he would also come to be known as \\"Number Eight\\", being that the band follows a numbering scheme for its members, ranging from 0-8. According to Shawn Crahan, Corey wanted number eight, because it symbolizes infinity. Feeling he could expand more inside Slipknot than in Stone Sour, Taylor temporarily quit Stone Sour, even though they were recording an album with Sean McMahon. Taylor's first gig with Slipknot was on August 22, 1997, which according to band members did not go well. During his first gig, Taylor did not perform wearing a mask; however, for his second show nearly a month later, Corey wore a mask that resembles his debut album mask. Taylor's current mask was described by MTV's Chris Harris as looking \\"as though it were made of dried, human flesh--like Leatherface, if only he used moisturizer.\\" Taylor has recorded with Slipknot since the release of their second demo album, a self-titled demo used to promote the band to prospective labels and producers. As permanent vocalist, he recorded with Slipknot at Indigo Ranch in Malibu, California and released Slipknot, the band's debut album that peaked number one on the Top Heatseekers chart, went double platinum in the United States, and was included in the 2006 book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. Taylor was accused of copyright infringement, regarding the lyrics of the song \\"Purity\\", but no action was taken. Taylor began recording for their second studio album, Iowa, in 2001 at Sound City and Sound Image in Van Nuys, Los Angeles. It was released August 28, 2001 and peaked number one on the UK Albums Chart, as well as number three on the Billboard 200. While writing Vol. 3: (The Subliminal Verses), Taylor decided to write lyrics that would not warrant an explicit label. It peaked number two on the Billboard 200. All Hope Is Gone was the first Slipknot album to peak number one on the Billboard 200. Question: did he tour with them?

He has been an integral part of Slipknot's success, participating in multiple tours accompanying the band's album releases and live performances."},{"question":"Which movie is the following review about? One of the best movies of the year with its extraordinary depiction of plight of Indian widows and their yearning for liberation.","response":"The movie review appears to be about \\"Water\\", a film directed by Deepa Mehta. Released in 2005, \\"Water\\" is the third instalment of Mehta's Elements trilogy. It is preceded by 'Fire' (1996) and 'Earth' (1998). The film, set in 1938 and filmed in Sri Lanka, explores the lives of widows at an ashram in Varanasi, India. The plot of 'Water' revolves around Chuyia, an eight-year-old child widow who is sent to a home where Hindu widows must live out their remaining lives in penitence. Unaware of her status as a widow, Chuyia refuses to adapt to the regimented lifestyle enforced by the oppressive Madhumati, the head widow. Chuyia's presence reverberates throughout the ashram, especially affecting Shakuntala, a devout widow, and Kalyani, a beautiful younger widow who being the best looking is exploited by being prostituted. In its poignant portrayal of these women, their plight, and their yearning for liberation, the movie provides viewers with a vivid picture of the gender, theological, and social injustices of the time. It offers a deep exploration of the circumstances of marginalized widows, challenging societal norms of oppression, especially those existing due to certain interpretations of religion. The characters and their stories are constructed with depth and nuance, fostering in viewers a deep understanding and empathy. The cinematography, capturing the heartbreaking beauty of Varanasi along the Ganges River, is an integral part of the narrative, contributing to the film's wide acclaim. Perhaps what's most compelling about \\"Water\\" is its exploration of the dichotomy between tradition and change, between sacred and profane, and between freedom and enslavement. It is a deeply affecting film that encourages viewers to grapple with societal norms, tradition, and the interpretation and application of religious texts. \\"Water\\" was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 2006, making it the first non-French-language Canadian film to receive a nomination in that category. It also won three awards from the Film Critics Circle of India. Despite its critical acclaim, the film was a subject of controversy and experienced protests from conservative groups in India. Undeniably, 'Water' is a significant work in global cinema, not just for its compelling narrative and cinematic beauty, but also for its brave confrontation of sensitive social issues. It undeniably fits the criteria of being one of the best films of the year, with its extraordinary depiction of the plight of Indian widows and their yearning for liberation."},{"question":"Given the following question, let's solve step-by-step. Does the following sentence make sense? \\"Edward VI of England instituted the requirement of clerical celibacy.\\" Options: - yes - no","response":"The answer is no. To understand why the given sentence doesn't make sense, let's break down the information provided: Edward VI of England: Edward VI was the king of England from 1547 to 1553, the son of Henry VIII and Jane Seymour. He was a Protestant, and his reign was marked by religious changes and the establishment of the Church of England as separate from the Roman Catholic Church. Clerical celibacy: This refers to the practice of clergy members, such as priests and bishops, refraining from marriage and sexual relations as a vocational commitment to their religious duties. This has been a requirement in the Roman Catholic Church for many centuries. Now, let's analyze the connection between Edward VI and the requirement of clerical celibacy: As mentioned earlier, Edward VI was a Protestant king who played an essential role in the establishment of the Church of England. This new church's formation was sparked by a rejection of the authority of the Pope and the Roman Catholic Church in England. One of the main changes that took place during Edward VI's reign was a relaxation of the rules surrounding clerical celibacy. In the newly established Church of England, priests were allowed to marry, unlike in the Catholic Church. In light of this information, the original sentence – \\"Edward VI of England instituted the requirement of clerical celibacy\\" – does not make sense. Edward VI did not institute the requirement of clerical celibacy; in fact, he helped promote changes to relax the rules on this issue in the Church of England."},{"question":"Information: - The United States Armed Forces are the federal armed forces of the United States.

It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. - The United States Coast Guard (USCG) is a branch of the United States Armed Forces and one of the country's seven uniformed services. The Coast Guard is a maritime, military, multi-mission service unique among the U.S. military branches for having a maritime law enforcement mission (with jurisdiction in both domestic and international waters) and a federal regulatory agency mission as part of its mission set. It operates under the U.S. Department of Homeland Security during peacetime, and can be transferred to the U.S. Department of the Navy by the U.S. President at any time, or by the U.S. Congress during times of war. This has happened twice, in 1917, during World War I, and in 1941, during World War II. - Ingalls Shipbuilding is a shipyard located in Pascagoula, Mississippi, United States, originally established in 1938, and is now part of Huntington Ingalls Industries.

The investigations are being conducted by the Justice Department and the General Accounting Office. They concern allegations of a conspiracy to protect former Nazis and collaborators who may have been smuggled into the United States by American intelligence agencies for cold war operations against the Russians. Charges that the American authorities mishandled investigations of war criminals date back at least 10 years. But the G.A.O. concluded in 1978 that it could find no evidence of a conspiracy to impede the inquiries. Nearly 200 cases remain under investigation by a unit of the Justice Department, the Office of Special Investigations. Congressional investigators are also reviewing new information provided by a former prosecutor in that office, including long-secret military documents setting forth links that American intelligence agencies had with Nazis and their East European collaborators. Episodes described in the documents and other information collected by the former prosecutor, John Loftus, include these cases: - An Army officer working in intelligence after World War II acknowledged allowing some Nazi collaborators to falsify their applications for American visas in exchange for providing intelligence information. - Some former Nazis entered the United States through lightly patrolled Canadian and Mexican border crossings while others were routed through Argentina and other cooperative Latin American countries. - Other former Nazis arrived on cargo planes, after being listed on the waybills as freight. - One collaborator accused of killings was identified and barred from emigrating to America on five separate occasions by American counterintelligence agents. Yet with the help of other agents, he finally gained entry to this country. Mr. Loftus first made public on the CBS News program ''60 Minutes'' last Sunday his charges that hundreds of Nazi collaborators were illegally brought into the country after World War II to form an anti-Soviet spy army. Masterminding the efforts, he said, was a highly secret covert operations agency close to the State Department called the Office of Policy Coordination. Mr. Loftus, who has written a book about his findings as a war crimes investigator, provided a draft of the book and documents to Representative Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat on the Immigration Subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee. The book is tentatively scheduled for publication later this year. Mr. Loftus is now himself the subject of Justice Department inquiries into his disclosure of possibly confidential material, according to a department official. Mr. Loftus, now in private law practice in Boston, denied releasing any material not properly cleared by intelligence authorities. 'Just Provided Records' ''I just provided Congress records they were supposed to get four years ago,'' he said. In the reopened Government investigations, the Justice Department announced last week that its criminal division was looking into the removal, apparently by the Defense Department, of certain intelligence information from at least two files in military archives. The files were checked by the General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, as part of its conspiracy inquiry from early 1977 to May 1978. They dealt with two Byelorussian emigres under Justice Department investigation for atrocities in the Nazi-occupied region of western Russia. The two, Emmanuel Jasiuk and Franz Kuchel, have since died. The tampering was discovered a year later by Mr. Loftus, who found material that the accounting office later said it had never seen. Mr. Loftus also found a note in one of the files: ''Do not disclose to G.A.O. until notified to do so.'' The note was signed only ''General Counsel'' and the Justice investigation is aimed at learning where the directive originated. One Justice Department official said the Defense Department was queried months ago but had been slow in responding. Denials From Two Departments Both the Justice and State Departments denied last week that they had attempted to impede any investigation. The accounting office, basing its finding only on material it had been shown, concluded in May 1978 that no ''widespread conspiracy'' existed to frustrate investigations of people suspected of being war criminals. But it found that nine suspected war criminals had worked for and been paid by the Central Intelligence Agency or the State or Defense Departments. After the disclosure last week that the files had been tampered with, Representative Peter W. Rodino Jr., chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, called on the accounting office to reopen its investigation and the office complied. ''It looks like we were misled,'' said John Tipton, the accounting office's senior evaluator who also headed the 1978 investigation. The withholding of the material from him last time, he said, ''would lead to the fact that there might be a conspiracy, yes.'' 'Started Making Our Contacts' Meanwhile, he said, ''We've already started making our contacts'' for the reopened inquiry. He called the task ''pretty big - big as hell'' but said he had no idea yet how long it might take.

During the Cold War it was adopted by many North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries, with the notable exception of the United States. It is one of the most widely used rifles in history, having been used by more than 90 countries. - The CAL ( Carabine Automatique Légère ) was a Belgian weapon manufactured by Fabrique Nationale . It was the first 5.56 mm rifle produced by the Fabrique Nationale . It resembled the company 's highly successful FN FAL , but was an original design . Unlike the FAL , it was a market failure , although its development led to the reasonably successful FN FNC . - Fabrique Nationale d'Herstal (French for: National Factory of Herstal) self identified as FN Herstal and often referred to as Fabrique Nationale or simply FN is a leading firearms manufacturer located in Herstal, Belgium, and is owned by the holding company Herstal Group which is owned by the regional government of Wallonia. It is currently the largest exporter of military small arms in Europe. - The Cold War was a state of political and military tension after World War II between powers in the Eastern Bloc (the Soviet Union and its satellite states) and powers in the Western Bloc (the United States, its NATO allies and others). Historians do not fully agree on the dates, but a common timeframe is the period (the second half of the 20th century) between 1947, the year the Truman Doctrine (a U.S. policy pledging to aid nations threatened by Soviet expansionism) was announced, and 1991, the year the Soviet Union collapsed. - The FN FNC (French: \\"Fabrique Nationale Carabine\\") is a 5.56×45mm NATO assault rifle developed by the Belgian arms manufacturer FN Herstal and introduced in the late 1970s. - The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO '), also called the North Atlantic Alliance, is an intergovernmental military alliance based on the North Atlantic Treaty which was signed on 4 April 1949. The organization constitutes a system of collective defence whereby its member states agree to mutual defence in response to an attack by any external party. Three NATO members are permanent members of the United Nations Security Council with the power to veto and are officially nuclear-weapon states: the United States, France and the United Kingdom. NATO's headquarters are located in Haren, Brussels, Belgium, where the Supreme Allied Commander also resides. Belgium is one of the 28 member states across North America and Europe, the newest of which, Albania and Croatia, joined in April 2009. An additional 22 countries participate in NATO's Partnership for Peace program, with 15 other countries involved in institutionalized dialogue programmes. The combined military spending of all NATO members constitutes over 70% of the global total. Members' defence spending is supposed to amount to 2% of GDP. - A battle rifle is a military service rifle that fires a full-power rifle cartridge, such as 7.62×51mm NATO, 7.62×54mmR, 7.92x57mm Mauser, .303 British, or .30-06 Springfield. Compared to assault rifles and their intermediate cartridges, the higher-caliber rounds provide greater power and range, though they have greater weight and produce stronger recoil, making them less than ideal for fully automatic fire.
