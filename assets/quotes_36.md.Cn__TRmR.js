Movie title: Too Late for Tears Movie plot: Don DeFore and Lizabeth Scott Jane and Alan Palmer (Scott and Kennedy) are driving to a party in the Hollywood Hills one evening when someone in another car throws a suitcase into the back seat of their convertible. They open it and discover packs of cash. They are chased by yet another car for a short time but get away. Back at their upper-middle-class Hollywood apartment, they examine the cash. Jane wants to keep the money, but Alan wants to take it to the police. Alan places the suitcase and cash in a locker at Union Station, hoping he can sway Jane into surrendering it to the police. A few days later while Alan is at work, Danny (Duryea) shows up at the Palmers' apartment, tells Jane he is a detective and quickly learns she has begun spending the money. Her husband Alan likewise becomes upset when he finds she has been running up bills, clearly planning to spend the money they had agreed to store and leave untouched. Jane makes a deal with Danny to split the money. Planning to kill him, she drives Danny up into the hills on the pretense they will retrieve the cash where it's been buried. He suspects her intentions and flees. She and Alan plan a romantic evening together to make amends for their squabbling about the money. She asks Danny to meet her in the evening at Westlake Park near downtown Los Angeles, where she and Alan will be taking a boat ride. Jane has planned to kill her husband Alan in the boat but is stopped by a pang of guilt and begs him to take her to shore, then blurts out that she wants to send the claim check for the locker to the police. Unaware of why his wife is upset, Alan wants to continue with the boat ride. Hoping to find cigarettes, he picks up her bag and his own gun falls out. The startled look on his face tells Jane he knows straight off what she had in mind, she grabs the gun, they struggle and she shoots, killing him. When Danny sees the body he fears getting involved in a murder, but Jane threatens to tell the police he killed her husband unless he helps her.

Protagonist of the show, Benny is a comic, vain, penny-pinching miser, insisting on remaining 39 years old on stage despite his actual age, and often playing the violin badly. Eddie Anderson - Rochester Van Jones, Jack's valet and chauffeur. Early in the show's run, he often talked of gambling or going out with women. The radio series was one of the most extensively preserved programs of its era, with the archive almost complete from 1936 onward and several episodes existing from before that (including the 1932 premiere). As with the radio shows, most of the television series has lapsed into the public domain, although several episodes (particularly those made from 1961 onward, including the entire NBC-TV run) remain under copyright. During his lone NBC season, CBS aired repeats on weekdays and Sunday afternoons. 104 episodes personally selected by Benny and Irving Fein, Benny's associate since 1947, were placed into syndication in 1965 by Universal/MCA television. Telecasts of the shows in the late evening were running as late as 1966. Four early 1960s episodes were rerun on CBS during the summer of 1977. Edited 16mm prints ran on the CBN Cable Network in the mid 1980s. Restored versions first appeared on the short lived HA! network in 1990. As of 2011, the series has run on Antenna TV, part of a long term official syndication distribution deal. The public domain television episodes have appeared on numerous stations, including PBS, while the radio series episodes have appeared in radio drama anthology series such as When Radio Was. Public domain episodes have been available on budget VHS/Beta tapes (and later DVDs) since the late seventies. MCA home video issued a 1960 version of the classic \\"Christmas Shopping\\" show in 1982 and a VHS set of ten filmed episodes in 1990. In 2008, 25 public domain episodes of the show, long thought lost, were located in a CBS vault. The Jack Benny Fan Club, with the blessing of the Benny estate, offered to fund the digital preservation and release of these sealed episodes. CBS issued a press statement that any release was unlikely. June 2013 saw the first official release of 18 rare live Benny programs from 1956 to 1964 by Shout Factory. This set, part of Benny's private collection at the UCLA film and television library, included guest shots by Jack Paar, John Wayne, Tony Curtis, Gary Cooper, Dick Van Dyke, Rock Hudson, Natalie Wood, President Harry Truman and the only TV appearance with longtime radio foe Ronald Colman.

Clarity: The review starts with expressing a dislike for the response time, but the presence of emoticons and punctuation makes it somewhat difficult to understand the meaning of the text. The repetition of words \\"Ah, I don't like\\" does not contribute much to the clarity of the message. However, the second sentence does clarify the user's dislike for the long response time. Overall, the clarity of the review is average and can be rated as a 3 out of 5. 2. Informativeness: The review suggests that the user is unhappy with the long response time, but it does not provide any specific details, such as how long it takes for the chatbot to respond or any suggestions on how to improve the response time. Additionally, the review does not take into account other aspects of the chatbot's performance, such as accuracy, usability, or overall satisfaction. Because of the lack of specific information, the informativeness of the review can be rated as a 2 out of 5. 3. Relevance: Since the review is about the response time of the AI assistant, it is relevant to the question. Although it could provide more details or context for the reader to better understand the issue, the user's frustration with the response time is evident. Thus, the relevance of the review can be rated as a 3 out of 5. Taking all these factors into account, the overall rating of this review can be calculated by finding the average of clarity, informativeness, and relevance ratings. (3+2+3)/3 = 2.67 ≈ 3 As a result, on a scale of 1-5, this review can be rated as 3, which implies that it is moderately helpful but could benefit from improvements in clarity and informativeness."},{"question":"News article: Turkish Jets Strike Kurdish Rebels The Turks contend that at least 150 P.K.K. fighters were killed in the two earlier raids this month, at least one of which was backed up by shelling by ground forces. However, Kurdish leaders say casualties totaled only a handful, including several civilians. Americans officials in Baghdad declined Wednesday to comment on the disparities in casualty counts. An American military spokesman, Maj. Gen. Kevin J. Bergner, said that efforts were being made to get accurate information, a difficult process. “We don’t have forces there that are the arbiters of the ground truth,” General Bergner said. “The military unit conducting the operation is the Turkish forces, and they are, in this case, the arbiters of ground truth.” The United States is in a delicate situation because Turkey is a crucial American ally. But the United States does not want to strain relations with the Kurdish authorities in northern Iraq and the Iraqi government, which have objected to the Turkish attacks. The P.K.K., which has sought an autonomous state in Turkey’s predominantly Kurdish southeast since the 1980s, is considered a terrorist organization by Turkey, the United States and the European Union. Philip T. Reeker, a spokesman for the American Embassy in Baghdad, reiterated the American position on the Turkish military operation. “We made clear, of course, that we would be concerned about anything that leads to civilian casualties or destabilization in northern Iraq,” Mr. Reeker said. “So we will continue to watch the situation closely. And the U.S., Iraq and Turkey continue to have common interests in seeing that the activities of the P.K.K. are ended.” According to Turkish media reports here, the locations attacked by the Turkish military were empty because the rebels retreated deeper into Iraqi territory in anticipation of the raids. “More than the mathematical results, the psychological results are important in this war of propaganda,” said Ali Nihat Ozcan, a political analyst based in Ankara. “There is an improvement in Turkish-American relations, which sends a strong message to the P.K.K. and, on the other hand, pleases and relaxes the Turkish public opinion.” At least three Kurdish political parties have been disbanded by Turkey’s Constitutional Court since the 1990s, mainly on charges of inciting ethnic separation in the country, which has around 15 million Kurds. This year, the public prosecutor brought a motion before the Constitutional Court to disband the Democratic Society Party, accusing it of being the P.K.K.’s political wing. The party’s chairman, Nurettin Demirtas, was recently arrested and is being kept in military jail on charges of forging a medical report to avoid mandatory service with the Turkish military. The P.K.K., which is estimated to have about 3,500 rebels active in the Iraqi mountains, has threatened retaliation against the Turkish military on some Kurdish Web sites. “Maybe during winter an appropriate response is not possible,” a commander in the mountains was quoted as saying by the Firat News Agency on Monday. “But they shouldn’t forget that when leaves turn green, the dreams that the Turkish state has been dreaming will turn into a nightmare.” In Istanbul, seven people were injured Tuesday when a bomb placed in a garbage bin exploded, the police said. No organization has yet claimed responsibility. On Monday, about 7.5 pounds of explosives were found in an abandoned bag in Sisli, a busy Istanbul district. The police said they caught the owner of the bag, a young man, but no further information had been made public. Damien Cave contributed reporting from Baghdad.

I didn't ask for the spices to be left out--just the dairy. So the shrimp sag was so so and this is being generous.

All is going well until Diane receives a phone call from an odd-sounding stranger claiming his name is Evil, who announces on live television that when the clock strikes midnight in each time zone, a \\"Naughty Girl\\" will be \\"punished\\" (murdered), then the killer signs off with a threat claiming that Diane will be the last Naughty Girl to be punished.

Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options： A. bed B. lunch box C. pockets D. purse E. carry credit cards in Answer:","response":"C. pockets Most men prefer to keep their wallets in their pockets. This is primarily for reasons of convenience, accessibility, and personal preference. Men's wallets are typically designed with pocket storage in mind, featuring a slim and compact design that easily fits into various pocket sizes without adding bulk or discomfort. There are a few common types of pockets where men may choose to store their wallets: 1. Back Pocket: The back pocket of pants or jeans is a common place for men to store their wallets. It provides easy access while also keeping the wallet relatively secure and out of sight. However, placing a wallet in the back pocket may cause discomfort while sitting, and there is a higher risk of losing the wallet or becoming a victim of pickpocketing. 2. Front Pocket: Storing a wallet in the front pocket of pants or jeans is another common option for men. This location provides better security against pickpocketing, and it can also be more comfortable than having the wallet in the back pocket, especially while sitting for long periods. A slim, minimalistic wallet is often preferred for front pocket use, as they take up less space and cause less discomfort. 3. Jacket or Coat Pocket: During colder seasons or in formal settings, men may opt to store their wallets in the inner or outer pockets of a jacket or coat. These pockets tend to be deeper and more secure, providing additional protection against loss or theft. Additionally, jacket pockets are typically more accessible than pant pockets, making it easier to retrieve the wallet when needed. 4. Shirt Pocket: Some men may choose to store their wallets in the breast pocket of a casual or dress shirt. This can be a convenient location that still offers some level of theft protection. However, due to the typically small size of shirt pockets, only small and thin wallets are suitable for this type of storage. In conclusion, while there are several options available for men to store their wallets, pockets remain the most commonly used and suitable option. Different pocket types provide a varying level of comfort, security, and accessibility, allowing men to choose the most suitable pocket based on their personal preferences and the specific situation."},{"question":"china led coconut lighting led-pt-2.0 wholesalers Make this proper case.","response":"China-led Coconut Lighting LED-PT-2.0 Wholesalers As an AI language model, it is important to not only ensure accuracy in generated responses but also to restructure any given information to meet desired standards.

However, the speed of sound varies from substance to substance: sound travels most slowly in gases; it travels faster in liquids; and faster still in solids. For example, (as noted above), sound travels at 343 m/s in air; it travels at 1,480 m/s in water (4.3 times as fast as in air); and at 5,120 m/s in iron (about 15 times as fast as in air). In an exceptionally stiff material such as diamond, sound travels at 12,000 metres per second (27,000 mph);[1] (about 35 times as fast as in air) which is around the maximum speed that sound will travel under normal conditions. Now, I have a new situation: John and Keith are neighbors. They have been pondering about how to communicate with each other in a doomsday scenario when all the electronic devices would be useless. They connected their houses with three ducts. One of the ducts is filled with air; they called it channel A. Another duct is filled with water; they called it channel B. And the last duct is filled with iron; they called it channel C. They can now transmit sound with these channels of communication; in case, disaster strikes. Answer this question please: Which channel would be faster, channel A or channel B ? A:","response":"Channel B would be faster, as sound travels at 1,480 m/s in water, which is 4.3 times as fast as in air (343 m/s)."},{"question":"Read the bio below and try to give details on nusreta sivac 's: - years active - birth date - name - organization - birth place - occupation Bio: nusreta sivac -lrb- born 18 february 1951 -rrb- is a bosniak activist for victims of rape and other war crimes and a former judge . during the bosnian war she was an inmate at the bosnian serb-run omarska camp in prijedor , bosnia and herzegovina where she and other women at the camp were raped , beaten , and tortured . after the camp 's closure in august 1992 due to press coverage , she became an activist for victims of rape and is credited with helping in the recognition of wartime rape as a war crime under international law . she is a member of the women 's association of bosnia and herzegovina .

Each stick of gum cost half as much as the candy bar. If the candy bar cost 1.5 each, how much did he pay in total? Give me reasons, before answering the question","response":"To solve this problem, we'll break it down into a few steps: 1. Find the cost of a single stick of gum. 2. Calculate the overall cost of gum and candy bars. 3. Add the costs together to find the total amount John paid. Step 1: Find the cost of a single stick of gum. We know that each stick of gum costs half as much as a candy bar, and a candy bar costs 1.5 each. To find the cost of a single stick of gum, we'll divide the cost of a candy bar by 2: Cost of a stick of gum = 1.5 / 2 = 0.75 Step 2: Calculate the overall cost of gum and candy bars. John bought 2 packs of gum and 3 candy bars. We'll calculate the cost of these separately and then add them together. Cost of gum = Number of packs of gum * Cost of a stick of gum Cost of gum = 2 * 0.75 = 1.50 Cost of candy bars = Number of candy bars * Cost of a candy bar Cost of candy bars = 3 * 1.5 = 4.50 Step 3: Add the costs together to find the total amount John paid. Now that we have the overall cost of gum and candy bars, we can add them together to find the total amount John paid: Total cost = Cost of gum + Cost of candy bars Total cost = 1.50 + 4.50 = 6.00 So, John paid a total of 6.00 for the 2 packs of gum and 3 candy bars."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: You are given a sentence in Spanish.

How to plant night blooming jasmine Soak the seeds. Soak the seeds for twelve hours in a small bowl of water. Put some moistened sand, sphagnum moss or peat moss in a container with a removable lid, such as a yogurt container.","response":"After soaking the seeds and preparing the container with moistened sand, sphagnum moss, or peat moss, here's what you need to do next: 1. Plant the seeds: Sprinkle the soaked seeds on top of the moistened material you chose (sand, sphagnum moss, or peat moss) inside the container. Make sure the seeds are spread out evenly and not too crowded. 2. Cover the seeds: Gently press the seeds into the material so that they are slightly covered. You can use your fingers or a small tool to do this. Make sure you don't push the seeds too deep, just enough so they make good contact with the moist material. 3. Close the container: Put the removable lid on the container to create a mini greenhouse. This will help maintain humidity and warmth for the seeds to germinate properly. 4. Choose the right spot: Place the container in a warm, bright place, but not in direct sunlight. The seeds need some light to germinate, but too much direct sunlight can dry out the material and harm the seeds. 5. Keep it moist: Check the container daily to make sure the material stays moist but not overly wet. If you notice it's getting dry, gently mist it with water or add a small amount of water to keep it moist. 6. Be patient: The seeds will take about two to three weeks to germinate. When you see tiny plants (seedlings) starting to grow, it's time for the next step. 7. Transplant the seedlings: Once the seedlings have grown a little, about 2-3 inches tall, you can carefully transplant them into individual small pots filled with a well-draining potting mix. Gently remove the seedlings using a spoon or small tool, making sure not to damage their roots. 8. Continue to care for the plants: Place the potted seedlings in a bright spot and keep the soil moist but not soaking wet. As they grow, you may need to move them to larger pots to give their roots more room. 9. Plant the jasmine outside: Once your night blooming jasmine plants are strong and mature enough, and the weather is warm, you can plant them outside in the ground or in larger pots. Choose a spot with well-draining soil and partial sun. Keep watering and caring for your jasmine plants, and soon enough, you will be able to enjoy their beautiful, fragrant blooms at night!"},{"question":"What is the version of the following sentence with correct punctuation?

Options are: A). yes. B). it is not possible to tell. C). no.","response":"B). It is not possible to tell. The given premise states that \\"1) In other words, there is a definitive number, according to the Pentagon.\\" This statement suggests that the Pentagon has a definitive number in mind. However, this information alone is not enough to allow us to conclude the hypothesis \\"Having a definite number is preferable to an estimation.\\" is true. There are several factors to consider before determining whether a definite number is indeed more preferable over an estimation. These factors include the context in which the definite number or estimation is being used, the level of accuracy required for a given situation, and the potential implications or consequences of relying on one method over the other. In some situations, it may be more desirable to have a definite number, particularly when a high level of precision is required. For instance, if you are constructing a building, it is crucial to know the exact number of materials needed to complete the project to avoid wasting resources or facing structural issues. In such a case, having a definite number can lead to better decision-making and more desirable outcomes. On the other hand, there might be situations where an estimation is more practical and useful, especially when dealing with complex issues or making predictions about future outcomes. For example, in the case of predicting economic growth, it is impossible to have a definitive number due to the multitude of variables and uncertainties involved. An estimation might better capture the range of possible outcomes and convey the uncertainty that comes with making such predictions. Furthermore, it is important to note that both definitive numbers and estimations may be prone to errors on their own. A definite number might be inaccurate due to incorrect data or flawed methodology during its calculation. Similarly, an estimation is only as good as the assumptions made when creating it. Consequently, neither method can be deemed universally preferable without acknowledging their individual disadvantages and the specific situation in which they are being applied. Given the complexity and variability of different situations, it is not possible to make a blanket statement concluding that having a definite number is always preferable to an estimation. Instead, it is essential to consider the context and the specific needs of each scenario before determining which method is the most appropriate and useful."},{"question":"Write a sentence not in English.","response":"Je mange une pomme.

Article: In the past, if a person wanted to see the national treasures of a country, one had to go there in person. Therefore, very few people were able to enjoy some of history's most important and interesting artifacts . This has changed with an increase in the number of traveling museum exhibitions. King Tutankhamen Artifacts A traveling exhibition of artifacts from the tomb of King Tutankhamen, popularly known as \\"King Tut\\", toured the United States from November 1976 to April 1979. The 55 objects were shown in six cities and were seen by around eight million museum-goers. The second touring exhibit was started in 2007, this time with 130 artifacts and stops in London and three different American cities. However some objects, like the king's golden face mask, are too valuable or too delicate to be transported long distances, so \\"replicas\\" (exact copies of something) are on show. Japanese Color Woodblock Prints The Art Museum at University of Virginia, in Charlottesville, Virginia, has an extraordinary collection of Japanese color woodblock prints . These prints document the period from about 1850 to 1900, a time when Japan was opening itself to Western influences. Before this point, Japan was a closed society that had little communication with the world outside of its borders. These works of art beautifully show the feeling of change and the trend toward modernization. The museum has put together a traveling exhibition of 60 of these prints, which can be borrowed and exhibited worldwide for periods of eight weeks or more. Face-to-face with \\"Lucy\\" One of the world's most famous archaeological finds in history are the 3.2 million-year-old bones of a 106-centimeter-tall female found in the Ethiopian desert in 1974.

Article: A practical English Grammar is intended for intermediate and post-intermediate students. We hope that more advanced learners and teachers will also find it useful. The book is a comprehensive survey of structures and forms, written in clear modern English and illustrated with numerous examples. Areas of particular difficulty have been given special attention. Differences between conversational usage and strict grammatical forms are shown but the emphasis is on controversial forms. In the fourth edition the main changes are as follows. 1. Explanation and examples have been brought up to date. 2. There is now more information on countable and uncountable nouns, attributive and predicative adjectives, adverbs of place, sentence adverbs, cleft sentences, prepositions, conjunctives, modal verbs, perfect tenses, infinitive constructions, the passive, purpose clauses and nouns. 3. Some material has been rearranged to make comparisons easier. For example, parts of chapters on can, may, must etc. are now grouped by functions; verbs of liking and preference have a chapter to themselves; suggestions and invitations have joined the chapter on commands, requests and advice. 4. The contents list now summaries every edition heading, and there is a new index containing many more entries references. In this edition the sign \\"~\\" is frequently used to show a change of speaker in examples of dialogue. Note also that although the sign \\"=\\"\\"\\" sometimes connects two words or expressions with the same meaning, it is often used more freely, e.g. to indicate a transformation from active to passive or direct to indirect speech. We wish to thank all at Oxford University Press who have assisted in the preparation of the fourth edition.

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. A:","response":"The statement \\"LH acts synergistically with FSH\\" is absolutely correct, but it represents a small fraction of what luteinizing hormone (LH) actually does in the human body, especially relating to the reproductive system. Let's delve deeper into what LH is and its more systematic functions. LH or Luteinizing Hormone is a hormone that's produced by the anterior pituitary gland located in the brain. This hormone plays a paramount role in regulating the function of two essential glands in the body – the ovaries in women and the testes in men, thus having central importance in human reproduction. In women, LH is critical to the menstrual cycle. During the menstrual cycle, LH works with Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH), another hormone produced by the anterior pituitary gland, to ensure the normal functioning of the ovaries. In the early stages of the cycle, LH and FSH encourage the growth of ovarian follicles, each containing an egg. As estrogen levels rise produced by the growing follicles, a surge in LH levels occurs, which directly leads to the mature egg's release from the ovary, a process called ovulation. Following ovulation, LH then stimulates the remaining parts of the ruptured follicle to form the corpus luteum, a temporary structure in the ovaries which produces progesterone, a hormone necessary for preparing the uterus for possible pregnancy. In men, LH stimulates Leydig cells in the testes to produce testosterone, the hormone responsible for creating sperm and giving men their male characteristics during puberty, like facial hair or a deep voice. It's less about cycles with men and more about maintaining a consistent level of testosterone for the processes it facilitates. So, while it's accurate to say that LH 'acts synergistically with FSH' - it helps to provide more context around what that synergy looks like, what it means for human reproduction and give more complementary details on LH functions separately."},{"question":"Question: Information: - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe.

However, it is still used by many players such as Roger Federer as a powerful weapon in matches. Start from the ready position with your feet pointing towards the net and your knees bent. You should be holding the racket with both hands while facing the net. This is the first step of the one-handed backhand and is essential for perfecting your shot. Start from the ready position and take one step forward with your right foot, pivoting on your left foot. As you step forward turn your body and shoulders sideways so that they are now perpendicular to the net. All your weight should now be on your back foot. This will help generate power and pace when you take the shot. By turning your body sideways you can move in a sideways and upward direction with your legs while taking your shot. Choose your grip based on the execution you want to achieve. The one-handed backhand will usually use an Eastern backhand grip to create topspin on the ball. Relax your dominant hand and use your non-hitting hand to rotate the racket to the appropriate grip. Grip the racket with your dominant hand once more. Ideally this should happen at the same time as you pivot and turn your shoulders. To achieve the Eastern backhand grip use your left hand to hold your racket in front of you. Point the grip to the right and orient the string area perpendicular to the ground, facing you. Hold your right hand straight out directly above the grip. Bring it directly down so your base index knuckle rests completely on the top facet of the grip, and close your hand around it squarely. An alternative grip includes the Extreme Eastern or Semi-Western Backhand grip. This grip is for use by stronger, more advanced players and is good for hitting high balls but not good for hitting low balls. Another alternative grip is the Continental grip, which holds the racket at a 45 degree angle and is good for hitting slices. The Semi-Western backhand grip is a rare backhand grip that is good for hitting heavy topspin but bad for hitting flat shots and slices. The pivot and shoulder turn begins to take the racket back but you must continue to rotate your shoulders and move your arms until the tennis racket is all the way back and your shoulders are all the way sideways. Let your racket drop down as you straighten your hitting arm. At the same time step into the shot with your front foot. The drop of your racket creates the topspin on the tennis ball and is very important to your one-handed backhand. This step is the transition from the preparation to the swing. Keep your non-hitting hand on the racket as you complete this step. Make sure your eyes stay on the ball so that you can anticipate the ball’s location and height. Let go of the racket with your non-hitting hand after your racket is down and your hitting arm is completely straight. Swing your arm and the racket to the contact point with the tennis ball. You should make contact in front of your body. Make sure your arm and the racket swing from the shoulder as a unit. This way your arm position relative to the racket does not change as you swing. The racket should come as low as your knee right before you make contact with the tennis ball. This will produce the topspin that you want on your backhand. Your upper body will rotate slightly back towards the net as you make your swing. Your eyes should be totally focused on the ball as you make contact with the ball. Make sure contact is made in front of your body to enable you to maximize power and topspin. Keep the relationship between your arm and the tennis racket the same as you follow through. Continue lifting your arm and rotating your shoulders all the way through the shot, keeping your arm position the same. The relationship between your arm and racket should not change until your hand is at the same level as your head. Your non-hitting arm should extend all the way back and behind you. This arm controls how much your shoulders and upper body rotate as you follow through. Letting your non-hitting arm extend behind you limits the rotation of your upper body, helping you recover faster and stay balanced during your shot.","response":"The one-handed backhand is a powerful yet less common shot in tennis today, used effectively by players like Roger Federer. The process to properly execute this technique is as follows: 1. Begin in the ready position facing the net, with your feet pointing towards it, and your knees bent. Hold the racket with both hands. 2. Pivot on your left foot and step forward with your right foot, turning your body and shoulders sideways, perpendicular to the net. Your weight should be on your back foot, enabling power and pace when hitting the shot. 3. Choose your grip based on the desired execution (Eastern backhand grip for topspin, Extreme Eastern/Semi-Western Backhand grip for advanced players, Continental grip for slices, or the rare Semi-Western backhand grip for heavy topspin). Use your non-hitting hand to rotate the racket to the appropriate grip and hold the racket with your dominant hand, ideally simultaneously with the pivot and shoulder turn. 4. Continue rotating your shoulders and moving your arms until the racket is all the way back and your shoulders are entirely sideways. Straighten your hitting arm while dropping the racket and stepping into the shot with your front foot. Keep your non-hitting hand on the racket and your eyes focused on the ball. 5. Release the racket with your non-hitting hand once your hitting arm is straight, and swing your arm and racket to the contact point with the ball, which should be in front of your body. Swing your arm and racket together as a unit to maintain their relative position, and bring the racket as low as your knee before contact with the ball to generate topspin. 6. Slightly rotate your upper body back towards the net as you swing, focusing on the ball as you hit it. Contact should be made in front of your body to maximize power and topspin. 7. Maintain the relationship between your arm and racket as you follow through, lifting your arm and rotating your shoulders throughout the shot. Keep this position until your hand is level with your head, and extend your non-hitting arm behind you to control your upper body rotation, ensuring balance and a faster recovery."},{"question":"Here is a dialogue: Chris: What are you doing over Christmas Sonia: Not sure - will probably go to my brothers on Christmas Eve, but apart from that not sure.

The 42-year-old police commander was in plain clothes when he was stabbed to death as he arrived home at around 8.30pm on Monday night in a quiet residential area of Magnanville, north-west of Paris. The attacker then entered the house and held hostage the commander’s partner – who also worked in the local police administration – and the couple’s three-year-old son. Hollande called it “incontestably a terrorist act” and said France was facing a terror threat “of a very large scale”. Elite police squads rushed to the scene, sealed off the neighbourhood, cut electricity and negotiated with the attacker who told them he was a soldier for Isis and had sworn allegiance to the group. Shortly afterwards loud detonations were heard as police stormed the house and killed the assailant. They found the woman dead and rescued the couple’s son alive. The attacker was identified by Le Monde and RMC radio as Larossi Abballa, 25, who was known to police for radicalism and already had a terrorism conviction. He had been sentenced to three years in prison, six months suspended, in 2013 for “criminal association in view to preparing terrorist attacks” over his role in a recruitment network of jihadists linked to Pakistan and Afghanistan. French media reported Abballa had recently been under close police surveillance as he had featured in the entourage of another man who had left for Syria. The French journalist and jihadhist expert David Thomson reported that Abballa had used Facebook live to post images of the attack — a video which is being examined by police. Thomson reported that while the attacker filmed himself, the three-year-old boy was behind him on the sofa. The attacker said: “I don’t know yet what I’m going to do with him.” The attacker lived alone in nearby Mantes-la-Jolie, where the woman worked in the local police station and where the police commander had previously worked before being posted to nearby Mureaux. The police officer who died was named in the French media as Jean-Baptiste Salvaing, 42, described as an assistant chief in the nearby district of Les Mureaux. He was reported to have been wearing civilian clothes at the time. Magnanville is about 35 miles north-west of central Paris. “The toll is a heavy one,” interior ministry spokesman Pierre-Henry Brandet told reporters at the scene. “This commander, this police officer was killed by the individual … [and] we discovered the body of a woman. The assailant, the criminal, was killed. Thankfully a little boy was saved. He was in the house. He’s safe and sound. He was saved by police officers.” Islamic State appeared to claim the attack through its news agency. The Site Intelligence Group, a US-based monitor, cited the Isis-linked Amaq News Agency as saying on its Telegram channels shortly afer the attack: “Islamic State fighter kills deputy chief of the police station in the city of Les Mureaux and his wife with blade weapons near Paris.” A prosecutor said the three-year-old boy was “in shock but unharmed” and receiving medical attention. The prime minister, Manuel Valls, tweeted that “a couple of police officers had been savagely assassinated”. He added: “Refuse fear, fight terrorism.” The French interior minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, called it “an abject terrorist attack” and expressed his “infinite sadness” at the killings. He said in a statement: “The attacker was neutralised by Raid forces, who showed great composure and great professionalism and who saved the couple’s little boy. The inquiry opened by the justice authorities will establish the precise circumstances of this tragedy.” The killing in France came a day after a gunman claiming to be acting in the name of Isis shot dead 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, in the worst mass shooting in US history. France hopes expanded Euro 2016 can shake off security fears to flourish Read more At the same time, France is hosting the Euro 2016 football tournament under tight security. The country is still reeling from the November 2015 jihadist attacks in Paris that left 130 people dead. Police officers were known to be potential target of jihadist terrorism in France, after two officers were killed in the attacks of January 2015. One officer, Ahmed Merabet, was shot dead by the French Kouachi brothers as they fled Charlie Hebdo magazine after opening fire on an editorial meeting. Another police officer, Clarissa Jean-Philippe, was shot in the street the following day by their accomplice Amedy Coulibaly before he later took hostages at a Paris kosher supermarket, killing four. Earlier this year police shot dead a man who tried to enter a Paris police station brandishing a butcher’s knife and wearing a fake suicide vest on the one-year anniversary of the Charlie Hebdo attack. Just after the Charlie Hebdo and kosher supermarket attacks in January 2015, police raided a terror cell in Verviers in Belgium to foil an imminent attack in which prosecutors said jihadists aimed “to kill police officers on public roads and in police offices,” The Verviers terror cell was part of a broader French-Belgian jihadist network with links to those involved in the later terror attacks in Paris in November 2015 and Brussels in March. But targeting police officers at their home, as happened in the Magnanville attack, would be a new type of attack. In 2014 French police shot dead a knife-wielding man who attacked three officers in a police station while shouting “Allahu Akbar”. The man, known to police for petty crime, wounded one officer’s face at the entrance to the police station in Joue-les-Tours near the central city of Tours and injured two others before he was killed. The investigation was led by anti-terror police. In 2012 the radicalised 23-year-old panel-beater Mohammed Merah, who went on to kill three schoolchildren and a rabbi outside a Jewish school in Toulouse, began his killing spree by targeting soldiers. He first killed an off-duty paratrooper who had arranged to meet someone about selling a motorbike, then killed two uniformed soldiers in Montauban, injuring a third. Days later he targeted the Jewish school before being killed after a 32-hour siege at his flat. ||||| The child was rescued and was “shocked but unharmed,” Mr Brandet said. Five detonations or shots were heard by millions on live television while Mr Brandet spoke to reporters as police stormed the home. “Negotiations were opened but it became clear that they would not succeed and police then entered the home, where they found the body of a woman,” Mr Brandet said. \\"The toll is a heavy one,\\" Mr Brandet told reporters, his voice shaking with emotion. \\"This commander, this police officer was killed by the individual ... (and) we discovered the body of a woman. The assailant, the criminal was killed. Thankfully, a little boy was saved. He was in the house. He's safe and sound. He was saved by police officers.\\" Police sources said the attacker was a former soldier and a neighbour of the couple. Witnesses heard the assailant, described as a teenager or in his early 20s, shout “Allahu Akhbar”, Arabic for \\"God is great\\". Counter-terrorism prosecutors were placed in charge of the investigation, which had initially been treated as a criminal case. A judicial source said the anti-terrorism unit of the prosecutor's office had been handed the investigation because of comments made during lengthy exchanges between the assailant and negotiators, but gave no further details. The prosecutor in the Versailles area outside Paris said the little boy was receiving medical attention. ||||| Image copyright AP Image caption Abballa attacked the police commander outside his home in Magnanville The murder of two French police officials by a man claiming allegiance to so-called Islamic State (IS) is \\"unquestionably a terrorist act\\", President Francois Hollande says. A police commander and his partner were stabbed to death at their home west of Paris. Their three-year-old survived. The attacker was killed in an police assault on the house. He had spent time in jail over jihadist links and had a list of targets including public figures, police say. Named by French sources as Larossi Abballa, he had also been under recent police surveillance, including a wiretap, say media reports quoting police sources. Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption President Hollande: \\"Unquestionably a terrorist act\\" Paris Prosecutor Francois Molin said that Abballa had pledged his loyalty to IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi during negotiations prior to the police assault on Monday, and had stated that he was answering his call \\"to kill infidels\\". Three people linked to the man were arrested and placed in custody, he said. Image copyright Larossi Abballa - Facebook Image caption Larossi Abballa, suspected of perpetrating the attack, was sentenced to jail in 2013 over his links to jihadist groups Police say the man lay in wait outside the policeman's house on Monday evening before the ambush took place at around 20:30 (18:30 GMT). After the murder he went inside the house and killed the policeman's wife, and held their three-year-old son hostage. Abballa, 25, was shot and killed when police entered the couple's home in Magnanville at about midnight, hours after he posted a 13-minute video on Facebook Live in which he swore allegiance to IS. In the video, he was shown considering what to do with their son, according to French jihad expert David Thomson, who watched it. Image copyright Twitter Image caption According to David Thomson, at one point during the Facebook Live video: \\"The baby is behind him, on the sofa. After killing his parents he says: 'I don't know yet what I'm going to do with him'\\" \\"I don't know yet what I'm going to do with him,\\" the killer is heard saying. In the video, he also made a threatening reference to the Euro 2016 football tournament. Two Facebook accounts linked to Abballa were suspended on Tuesday morning. Police also discovered a list of six people who the suspect wished to target on his computer, reported iTELE - including two public personalities. Mr Molins said the list included \\"rappers, journalists, police and public figures\\". Abballa lived in nearby Mantes-La-Jolie and was convicted in 2013 of \\"criminal association with the aim of preparing terrorist acts\\". He was sentenced to a three-year term in prison, of which six months were suspended, for recruiting fighters for jihad in Pakistan.

France has been under a state of emergency since the Paris attacks of 13 November 2015 in which 130 people died. That state of emergency is still in place with France on high alert as it hosts the Euro championship, which started last Friday. Image copyright Reuters Image caption Video from the scene shows heavily armed police arriving Image copyright AFP Image caption The suspect attacked the policeman before entering his house and killing his partner Le Parisien reports that the 42-year-old policeman, named as Jean-Baptiste S, was deputy chief of judicial police at Les Mureaux police station, near their home. It says (in French) he was previously stationed at the police station of Mantes-la-Jolie, where Abballa lived. President Hollande said he and his 36-year-old partner, Jessica S, were \\"murdered in cowardly fashion\\". \\"It's unquestionably a terrorist act,\\" Mr Hollande said, stressing that France was still \\"facing a very significant terrorist threat\\". Earlier, Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said more than 100 people seen as potential threats had been arrested in France this year, including in recent weeks. 'Loud explosions' French prosecutors have launched an anti-terror investigation into the incident. Witnesses say that the knife-wielding man may have shouted \\"Allahu akbar\\" (God is great) when he ambushed the policeman, who was not in uniform, outside his home. The attacker then barricaded himself inside the house, where the police officer's partner and child were present. Interior ministry spokesman Pierre-Henry Brandet said France's elite police Raid unit was brought in at about 21:00. Mr Brandet said negotiations were unsuccessful and a decision was made to \\"launch an assault\\" at about midnight. Witnesses reported hearing loud explosions as the officers from the Raid unit moved in. \\"This commander, this police officer was killed by the individual... [and] we discovered the body of a woman,\\" Mr Brandet told reporters. \\"The assailant, the criminal was killed. Thankfully, a little boy was saved. He is safe and sound.\\" Magnanville is about 55km (35 miles) north-west of the French capital. ||||| (CNN) The man who killed a police commander and his romantic partner in Magnanville, France, on Monday night threatened the Euro 2016 soccer championship in a Facebook video posted from the scene, a police source told CNN. Larossi Abballa was a 25-year-old Islamic extremist convicted earlier for jihadist activities and who was under investigation by French authorities. An edited version of the Facebook video was disseminated on the ISIS-affiliated website A'maq in which the attacker threatens that Euro 2016 would \\"be like a cemetery.\\" The video showed Abballa smiling eerily after making the threat. He admitted to killing the police commander, Jean-Baptiste Salvaing, and Jessica Schneider, a civil servant who worked at a local police station. The attacker pledged allegiance to the leader of ISIS and made a call for Muslims to carry out jihad on so-called infidels. \\"Pledging allegiance to my emir, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, my first words are for the Muslim community: What happened to you? What kind of sentence did you receive? How did you get to this?\\" he asked. The original Facebook video also showed the couple's 3-year-old son, a source close to the French investigation told CNN, although the attacker's Facebook page and original video have since been removed. A SWAT team was able to rescue the boy, the French Interior Ministry said. The attack occurred shortly after 8 p.m. Monday. Abballa stabbed Salvaing first and then took Schneider and the couple's boy hostage in their home in Magnanville, Paris prosecutor Francois Molins said Tuesday. En accord avec leurs familles, ns rendons hommage au Cdt JB. SALVAING et sa compagne adj administrative J. SCHNEIDER pic.twitter.com/7C1QQOw1nS — Police Nationale (@PoliceNationale) 14 June 2016 The attacker targeted the couple because of their profession, Molins said. CNN Map Facebook video broadcast from scene At 8.52 p.m., while in the couple's home, Abballa posted a 12-minute video to Facebook, Molins said. A screen grab from the Facebook broadcast made at the scene of the Magnanville attack. During the Facebook broadcast, the child could be seen on a sofa behind Abballa, who told viewers he was not sure what to do with the boy, a source close to the investigation told CNN. He also claimed in the broadcast that he was responding to a call from a senior ISIS leader for the terror group's followers in Europe and the United States to carry out attacks during Ramadan Abballa told SWAT team negotiators that he was a devout Muslim and had pledged allegiance to ISIS weeks earlier, Molins said. After a standoff, the SWAT team raided the house and killed him, he said. At the scene, police found knives and a hit list of targets, including celebrities, rappers, police officers, prison guards and journalists, Molins said. A Quran was recovered from the attacker's car. Asked by CNN about the video, Facebook said it does not comment on any active investigations but said it works as quickly as possible to remove content that supports terrorism. Conviction for jihadist activities Abballa had been convicted and jailed in 2013 for being part of a recruiting network for radical Islamists to go to Pakistan and Afghanistan, Molins said. Police had been investigating him since February on suspicion of links to a network recruiting jihadists to fight in Syria, Molins said. Although he was being monitored, no incidents had been flagged to authorities overseeing his case, he said. He had also been known to proselytize for radical Islam. Three people -- ages 27, 29 and 44 -- were taken into police custody for questioning in relation to Monday's attack, he said. A'maq, the ISIS-linked agency, reported that an \\"Islamic State fighter\\" had carried out the killings in France. 'An abject terrorist act' Speaking to reporters Tuesday, French President Francois Hollande said that the couple had been \\"assassinated by a terrorist.\\" Police work at the crime scene Monday night in Magnanville, northwest of Paris. \\"It was undeniably an act of terrorism, both because the perpetrator -- who was taken out at the scene, thanks to the quick reaction of the security forces -- wanted it to be recognized as an act of terrorism, and the organization he had pledged his allegiance to also claimed the attack.\\" French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve described the killings as \\"an abject terrorist act.\\" He said flags would be flown at half-staff for three days. Government workers observed a minute's silence at noon local time. According to Magnanville Mayor Michel Lebouc, Abballa grew up in nearby Mantes-la-Jolie, which has a history of radicalization in its mosques. Magnanville is 45 kilometers (28 miles) northwest of Paris. Monique Fohrer, a local resident, described the standoff Monday night as \\"a war scene.\\" \\"We didn't think we were in Magnanville. We thought we were in a film, a bad film,\\" she told CNN.

Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2] The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3] and the situation: John enrolled in a prestigious culinary school. In the very first day his instructor was showing different processes used on fruits. One of them was glace fruit. He showed the class how to prepare glace fruit and kept some of the glace fruits on bowl A. To compare glace fruits with non glace fruits he kept some non glace fruits on bowl B. Answer the following question: Which fruits had most probably gone through heated sugar syrup, bowl A or bowl B?

However, Natasha's partner is an unknown man, who turns out to be Jackson Tsui (Jackson Liu), a Chinese American nuclear scientist with CIA links, suspected of stealing a nuclear warhead. Ka-kui follows Tsui to a restricted area, and after a trap set by Tsui, the CIA agents together with Ukrainian authorities engage in battle. Ka-kui finds a briefcase which contained evidence from Tsui, but as he is chased by unknown forces, Ka-kui loses the briefcase as he falls into frozen waters. When he recovers in Russia, he meets Colonel Gregor Yegorov (Yuri Petrov) who explains the situation. Ka-kui goes with the FSB and is taken to Moscow where he discovers he has been assigned to work with Gregor to solve a similar case involving nuclear weapons being smuggled out of Ukraine. His task is to track Tsui, who disappeared after their last encounter. He is taken by a Russian submarine to Brisbane, Australia, where Tsui's younger sister Annie (Wu Chen-chun) works at an aquarium doing shark shows. Uncle 7 (Terry Woo), the Tsuis' father and the local Triad boss, is seriously ill and Ka-kui suspects the criminal will show up soon.

SEATTLE Over the past two years, Seattle -- that rainy city in the Pacific Northwest of the U.S. -- has seen a 90% rise in visitor numbers from China, local officials say. The reason: the huge popularity of the Chinese romantic comedy Finding Mr. Right, in which a woman from mainland China travels to Seattle to give birth. Directed by Xue Xiaolu and starring Tang Wei, the film has earned more than 85 million in China since its release last year. (The movie's Chinese title translates literally to Beijing meets Seattle.)

Though often located in rural areas, the term urban village is also applied to certain urban neighbourhoods. Villages are normally permanent, with fixed dwellings; however, transient villages can occur. Further, the dwellings of a village are fairly close to one another, not scattered broadly over the landscape, as a dispersed settlement. - Overloon is a village with 3,626 inhabitants on the outskirts of Peel, in the municipality of Boxmeer, Noord-Brabant. Located on the outskirts is the National Museum of War and Resistance of the Netherlands, which originated as a museum for a World War II battle (\\"Battle of Overloon\\") that occurred around the village in September and October 1944. The village is located close to the A73 motorway between Venlo and Nijmegen. - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. - A country is a region that is identified as a distinct national entity in political geography. A country may be an independent sovereign state or one that is occupied by another state, as a non-sovereign or formerly sovereign political division, or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated people with distinct political characteristics. Regardless of the physical geography, in the modern internationally accepted legal definition as defined by the League of Nations in 1937 and reaffirmed by the United Nations in 1945, a resident of a country is subject to the independent exercise of legal jurisdiction. - Boxmeer ( pronunciation ) is a municipality and a town in the southern Netherlands .

Answer the above question based on the context below: Although no new fighting techniques were introduced during the Texas Revolution, casualty figures were quite unusual for the time. Generally in 19th-century warfare, the number of wounded outnumbered those killed by a factor of two or three. From October 1835 through April 1836, approximately 1,000 Mexican and 700 Texian soldiers died, while the wounded numbered 500 Mexican and 100 Texian. The deviation from the norm was due to Santa Anna's decision to label Texian rebels as traitors and to the Texian desire for revenge.During the revolution, Texian soldiers gained a reputation for courage and militance. Lack points out that fewer than five percent of the Texian population enrolled in the army during the war, a fairly low rate of participation. Texian soldiers recognized that the Mexican cavalry was far superior to their own. Over the next decade, the Texas Rangers borrowed Mexican cavalry tactics and adopted the Spanish saddle and spurs, the riata, and the bandana.The Texas Veterans Association, composed solely of revolutionary veterans living in Texas, was active from 1873 through 1901 and played a key role in convincing the legislature to create a monument to honor the San Jacinto veterans. In the late 19th century, the Texas Legislature purchased the San Jacinto battlesite, which is now home to the San Jacinto Monument, the tallest stone column monument in the world. In the early 20th century, the Texas Legislature purchased the Alamo Mission, now an official state shrine. In front of the church, in the center of Alamo Plaza, stands a cenotaph designed by Pompeo Coppini which commemorates the defenders who died during the battle. More than 2.5 million people visit the Alamo every year.The Texas Revolution has been the subject of poetry and of many books, plays and films.

Attorney-General George Brandis said the laws would apply in \\"very limited circumstances\\". At least 90 Australians are believed to be fighting with militant groups such as the so-called Islamic State. About half of them are thought to be dual nationals. Australia is increasingly concerned about the impact on its domestic security of those who support or fight with militants in the Middle East. Mr Brandis said on Friday: \\"Dual nationals who engage in terrorism are betraying their allegiance to this country and do not deserve to be Australian citizens,\\" he said. He told the senate it was \\"a significant piece of legislation which will enhance Australia's counterterrorism architecture\\". The laws do not allow for anyone to be left stateless. The government had amended the bill, introduced to the lower house in June, to increase its chances of surviving an expected challenge in the Australian High Court. Australian Constitutional experts had said the bill was flawed, according to ABC. But Mr Brandis said the legislation was \\"as strong as we can make it from a constitutional point of view\\". An independent senator and the Greens party had previously suggested the move could further expose Australians to attacks overseas. \\"Do we just give up, revoke their citizenship and then let them free range with their sick, twisted minds to do damage to Australians and to other innocents abroad?\\" said independent senator Nick Xenophon. Greens leader Richard Di Natale said it would be better to jail militants in Australia. \\"Ultimately we think the safest place for Australian citizens who have been convicted of violent acts, who are indeed criminals, is in custody here in Australia, not roaming the international stage,\\" he said.

The main aim of the legislation is to enhance Australia's counterterrorism efforts and address the threat posed by individuals who support or fight with militant groups in the Middle East.

From 1986 until his retirement in 2005, Kasparov was ranked world No. 1 for 225 out of 228 months. His peak rating of 2851, achieved in 1999, was the highest recorded until being surpassed by Magnus Carlsen in 2013. Kasparov also holds records for consecutive professional tournament victories (15) and Chess Oscars (11). As a teenager, Kasparov tied for first place in the USSR Chess Championship in 1981-82. His first win in a superclass-level international tournament was scored at Bugojno, Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1982. He earned a place in the 1982 Moscow Interzonal tournament, which he won, to qualify for the Candidates Tournament. At age 19, he was the youngest Candidate since Bobby Fischer, who was 15 when he qualified in 1958. At this stage, he was already the No. 2-rated player in the world, trailing only World Chess Champion Anatoly Karpov on the January 1983 list. Kasparov's first (quarter-final) Candidates match was against Alexander Beliavsky, whom he defeated 6-3 (four wins, one loss). Politics threatened Kasparov's semi-final against Viktor Korchnoi, which was scheduled to be played in Pasadena, California. Korchnoi had defected from the Soviet Union in 1976, and was at that time the strongest active non-Soviet player. Various political maneuvers prevented Kasparov from playing Korchnoi, and Kasparov forfeited the match. This was resolved by Korchnoi allowing the match to be replayed in London, along with the previously scheduled match between Vasily Smyslov and Zoltan Ribli. The Kasparov-Korchnoi match was put together on short notice by Raymond Keene. Kasparov lost the first game but won the match 7-4 (four wins, one loss). In January 1984, Kasparov became the No. 1 ranked player in the world, with a FIDE rating of 2710. He became the youngest ever world No. 1, a record that lasted 12 years until being broken by Vladimir Kramnik in January 1996; the record is currently held by Magnus Carlsen. Later in 1984, he won the Candidates' final 8 1/2 -4 1/2 (four wins, no losses) against the resurgent former world champion Vasily Smyslov, at Vilnius, thus qualifying to play Anatoly Karpov for the World Championship. That year he joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU), as a member of which he was elected to the Central Committee of Komsomol in 1987. The World Chess Championship 1984 match between Anatoly Karpov and Garry Kasparov had many ups and downs, and a very controversial finish. Karpov started in very good form, and after nine games Kasparov was down 4-0 in a \\"first to six wins\\" match. Fellow players predicted he would be whitewashed 6-0 within 18 games. In an unexpected turn of events, there followed a series of 17 successive draws, some relatively short, and others drawn in unsettled positions. Kasparov lost game 27 (5-0), then fought back with another series of draws until game 32 (5-1), earning his first-ever win against the World Champion. Another 14 successive draws followed, through game 46; the previous record length for a world title match had been 34 games, the match of Jose Raul Capablanca vs. Alexander Alekhine in 1927. Kasparov won games 47 and 48 to bring the scores to 5-3 in Karpov's favour. Then the match was ended without result by Florencio Campomanes, the President of Federation Internationale des Echecs (FIDE), and a new match was announced to start a few months later. The termination was controversial, as both players stated that they preferred the match to continue. Announcing his decision at a press conference, Campomanes cited the health of the players, which had been strained by the length of the match. The match became the first, and so far only, world championship match to be abandoned without result. Kasparov's relations with Campomanes and FIDE were greatly strained, and the feud between them finally came to a head in 1993 with Kasparov's complete break-away from FIDE. The second Karpov-Kasparov match in 1985 was organized in Moscow as the best of 24 games where the first player to win 12 1/2 points would claim the World Champion title. The scores from the terminated match would not carry over; however, in the event of a 12-12 draw, the title would remain with Karpov. On 9 November 1985, Kasparov secured the title by a score of 13-11, winning the 24th game with Black, using a Sicilian defense. He was 22 years old at the time, making him the youngest ever World Champion, and breaking the record held by Mikhail Tal for over 20 years. Kasparov's win as Black in the 16th game has been recognized as one of the all-time masterpieces in chess history. As part of the arrangements following the aborted 1984 match, Karpov had been granted (in the event of his defeat) a right to rematch. Another match took place in 1986, hosted jointly in London and Leningrad, with each city hosting 12 games. At one point in the match, Kasparov opened a three-point lead and looked well on his way to a decisive match victory. But Karpov fought back by winning three consecutive games to level the score late in the match. At this point, Kasparov dismissed one of his seconds, grandmaster Evgeny Vladimirov, accusing him of selling his opening preparation to the Karpov team (as described in Kasparov's autobiography Unlimited Challenge, chapter Stab in the Back). Kasparov scored one more win and kept his title by a final score of 12 1/2 -11 1/2 . A fourth match for the world title took place in 1987 in Seville, as Karpov had qualified through the Candidates' Matches to again become the official challenger. This match was very close, with neither player holding more than a one-point lead at any time during the contest. Kasparov was down one full point at the time of the final game, and needed a win to draw the match and retain his title. A long tense game ensued in which Karpov blundered away a pawn just before the first time control, and Kasparov eventually won a long ending. Kasparov retained his title as the match was drawn by a score of 12-12. (All this meant that Kasparov had played Karpov four times in the period 1984-87, a statistic unprecedented in chess. Matches organized by FIDE had taken place every three years since 1948, and only Botvinnik had a right to a rematch before Karpov.) A fifth match between Kasparov and Karpov was held in New York and Lyon in 1990, with each city hosting 12 games. Again, the result was a close one with Kasparov winning by a margin of 12 1/2 -11 1/2 . In their five world championship matches, Kasparov had 21 wins, 19 losses, and 104 draws in 144 games.

What is the answer?","response":"The National Canine Defence League, an animal welfare charity, changed its name to Dogs Trust in 2003. Dogs Trust is a UK-based charity dedicated to the well-being of dogs and has been in existence for over 125 years. It was originally founded in 1891 as the National Canine Defence League, with its main intent being to protect and support dogs from mistreatment, cruelty, and neglect. The change of name from the National Canine Defence League to Dogs Trust was an outcome of a rebranding effort to better reflect the organization's mission, values, and focus more clearly on its canine-centric endeavors. This helped the charity to communicate its purpose and activities more effectively to the public, potential donors, adopters, and collaborators. Dogs Trust has grown into the largest dog welfare charity in the UK, contributing greatly to the improvement of canine lives through their various programs and initiatives. Among the numerous activities and services offered by Dogs Trust, the main ones include: 1. Rehoming: Dogs Trust runs a network of rehoming centers across the UK, where they house and care for thousands of stray, abandoned, or surrendered dogs. Through their adoption program, they help these dogs find permanent, loving homes. 2. Neutering and microchipping: Dogs Trust operates a neutering campaign to control dog populations and reduce the number of unwanted dogs. They also promote and offer microchipping services to help reunite lost dogs with their owners more easily. 3. Canine education and community outreach: The charity provides educational resources, workshops, and support for dog owners to better understand and care for their dogs, promoting responsible dog ownership. They also have community outreach initiatives that work with local communities to provide ongoing support and guidance. 4.

Dylan also contributed two original songs to the soundtrack—\\"Night After Night\\", and \\"I Had a Dream About You, Baby\\", as well as a cover of John Hiatt's \\"The Usual\\". The film was a critical and commercial flop.

Answer: Humbert was a great lover of languages, and encouraged linguistic studies among the Dominicans, primarily Arabic, because of the missionary work friars were pursuing amongst those led astray or forced to convert by Muslims in the Middle East. A single-select problem: Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion? Possible answers: (I) yes; (II) no;","response":"(I) yes; Humbert of Romans, a prominent figure in the Dominican Order during the 13th century, was deeply passionate about languages. He sought to advance linguistic studies, particularly in the field of Arabic, as a means to support the Dominican Order's missionary efforts. These efforts were focused on engaging with the Muslim population in the Middle East who had either strayed from Christianity or had been forced to convert to Islam. Humbert's dedication to linguistic learning served to bridge cultural gaps and facilitate communication, understanding, and religious outreach. By embracing and promoting the study of Arabic and other languages, Humbert was able to help Dominican missionaries in their quest to spread Christian teachings and bring the lost souls back to the faith. Aside from Arabic, Humbert also encouraged the study of other languages that were relevant to the mission fields at the time, such as Hebrew and Greek. This broad interest in diverse languages highlights the depth of Humbert's love for languages and his commitment to using them as essential tools in the service of the Church and its evangelizing missions. In summary, the subject Humbert loved very much was languages, with particular emphasis on Arabic, due to its relevance to the missionary work the Dominicans were undertaking in the Middle East. His passion for linguistic studies extended to other languages too, thereby empowering the friars in their mission to engage with different communities across cultural and linguistic borders."},{"question":"Answer the following question: - A signal is sent to the heating system - Heating oil travels from the tank to the burner - The oil becomes a fine mist mixed with air - The oil/air combination is injected into the burner - The burner is ignited in the combustion chamber - The furnace heats the air - The blower sends the heated air through the ducts - The heated air comes out the vents and into the room.

If it's un-answerable, please output \\"No answer\\". Question: Where is the German command? Movie plot title: Tobruk Movie plot: In September 1942, Rommel's Africa Korps is only 90 miles (144Â km) from the Suez Canal, but running dangerously low on fuel. The British approve a plan to destroy German fuel bunkers at Tobruk in an attempt to cripple Rommel's attack. The author of the plan, Canadian born Major Donald Craig (Rock Hudson) had been captured by Vichy French forces. As his expertise is considered essential to the success of the raid, Craig is rescued by Captain Kurt Bergman (George Peppard) of the Special Identification Group (SIG) and some of his men, German Jews serving with the British. They then join up with commandos of the Long Range Desert Group (LRDG), under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel John Harker (Nigel Green), at Kufra in south-eastern Libya. Colonel Harker explains they have eight days to get to Tobruk and destroy the fuel depot and German field guns protecting the harbour, before a scheduled amphibious landing and a bombing raid on the city by the RAF. They are to drive there through enemy territory posing as POWs escorted by the SIG pretending to be guards. Once they reach Tobruk they would then link up with a full Naval and RAF assault on the city and their primary objective, Rommel's underground fuel bunkers. Craig is highly skeptical of the operation, claiming that \\"Staff has a genius for sitting on its brains and coming up with perfect hindsight\\", stating that when he originally submitted the plan they could have blown up the fuel bunkers with only a handful of men before questioning how they were supposed to get through well established German defences now. While warning Craig not to let personal differences of opinion interfere with the operation, Colonel Harker also reveals that he was the genius with perfect hindsight who convinced Staff to approve Craig's original plan which would now be \\"maximum effort, land, sea and air\\". On the way, they encounter a patrol of Italian tanks, which stops a short distance from where they are resting in a gully. Later that night, Sergeant Major Jack Tyne (Jack Watson)...

The sentence states that \\"Natalie was very good at sports but Rachel was not.\\" Based on this information, we can infer the following: 1. Natalie has a high level of skill in sports. 2. Rachel, in contrast, does not have the same level of skill in sports. Now, let's examine the two options: a. Natalie made it onto the football team. b. Rachel made it onto the football team. Option (a) aligns with the information provided in the sentence because it states that Natalie, who is good at sports, made it onto the football team. This ending is consistent with the presented context. Option (b) contradicts the information in the sentence.

The freighter heads right for them, blasting its horn. Despite Ashland's best efforts, the charging freighter collides with the cruise ship, sinking it. (Some of the sinking scenes were taken from the 1960 film The Last Voyage and darkened to match the nightly effect.) The next morning, a handful of survivorsâMarshall, his wife Margaret (Howes), and their children Robin and Ben; a young officer named Nick and his love interest Lori; the ship's comic Jackie; and a passenger, Mrs. Morganâare adrift on a large piece of wreckage. Ashland surfaces nearby and he's brought aboard, barely conscious. Later, the survivors come upon the black freighter, unaware it's the ship that attacked them. Finding a boarding ladder slung from the stern, they climb aboard, but not before the ladder plunges into the sea as the officers try to climb it with the injured Ashland. When all are finally aboard, Jackie tries to rally the survivors with humor, but a cable seizes him by the ankle, and he is swung outboard by one of the ship's cranes, which lowers him into the water before cutting him loose, to be swept astern and lost. Shocked, the survivors explore the corridors of the empty, echoing vessel, finding only cobwebs and 1930s memorabilia. Hatches open and close by themselves and lights go on and off while a swinging block knocks out Nick, who is exploring above deck.

It is essential to bear in mind that everyone has their limitations, knowledge gaps, and areas of expertise. Sydney might possess a wealth of knowledge in other subjects or excel in other aspects, and this single instance should not be used to judge her overall intelligence or awareness.

Question: What was in India during the Cretaceous? Context: To the north of Africa the Tethys Sea continued to narrow. Broad shallow seas advanced across central North America (the Western Interior Seaway) and Europe, then receded late in the period, leaving thick marine deposits sandwiched between coal beds. At the peak of the Cretaceous transgression, one-third of Earth's present land area was submerged. The Cretaceous is justly famous for its chalk; indeed, more chalk formed in the Cretaceous than in any other period in the Phanerozoic. Mid-ocean ridge activity—or rather, the circulation of seawater through the enlarged ridges—enriched the oceans in calcium; this made the oceans more saturated, as well as increased the bioavailability of the element for calcareous nanoplankton. These widespread carbonates and other sedimentary deposits make the Cretaceous rock record especially fine. Famous formations from North America include the rich marine fossils of Kansas's Smoky Hill Chalk Member and the terrestrial fauna of the late Cretaceous Hell Creek Formation. Other important Cretaceous exposures occur in Europe and China.

Step 3: To isolate 'b', we must get rid of the negative sign in front of 'b'. Therefore, multiply both sides of the equation by -1. -b * (-1) = -11 * (-1) Step 4: Simplify the results.

Creating such a smooth passage means adjusting a vehicle's speed so that it always arrives at the lights when they are green.That is theoretically possible, but practically hard.Roadside signs wired to traffic lights can help get the message across a couple hundred metres from a crossing, but such signs are expensive, and are not widespread.Margaret Martonosi and Emmanouil Koukoumidis at Princeton University, and Li-Shiuan Peh at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, however, have an idea that could make the process cheaper and more effective.Instead of a hardwired network of signs, they propose to use mobile-phone applications.

Both sentences highlight the designation of a location for intermodal transit in a city and its surrounding area. However, the first sentence emphasizes the involvement of Santa Fe, while the second emphasizes Oklahoma City. The first sentence states that Santa Fe has designated the Oklahoma City station as the location for intermodal transit for the city and the conurbation area. In this sentence, \\"the city of Santa Fe\\" is the subject making the decision, and \\"the Oklahoma City station\\" is the designated location for intermodal transit. Furthermore, the surrounding area referred to in this sentence is described as \\"the conurbation area\\" which implies a densely populated urban area. The second sentence, on the other hand, states that Oklahoma City has designated the Santa Fe railway station as the location for intermodal transit for the city and the greater area. Here, \\"the city of Oklahoma City\\" is the subject making the decision, and \\"Santa Fe railway station\\" is the designated location. Additionally, the surrounding area is referred to as \\"the greater area,\\" which is a more general term that encompasses the broader region around the city. To summarize, while both sentences convey the designation of a location for intermodal transit in a city and its surrounding area, they differ in terms of the city making the decision and the specific phrasing used to describe the surrounding area.

It was first discovered to be unusual in 1677, when its magnitude suddenly rose to 4, attracting the attention of Edmond Halley. Eta Carinae is inside NGC 3372, commonly called the Carina Nebula. It had a long outburst in 1827, when it brightened to magnitude 1, only fading to magnitude 1.5 in 1828. Its most prominent outburst made Eta Carinae the equal of Sirius; it brightened to magnitude −1.5 in 1843.

Evans preferred to remain in Rome, so Etty travelled alone, pausing briefly in Florence and in Ferrara (where he stopped to kiss the armchair of Ludovico Ariosto). The painter Charles Lock Eastlake, then resident in Rome, had provided Etty with a letter of introduction to Harry D'Orville, British Vice consul in Venice; D'Orville was so impressed with Etty that he arranged for him to stay in his own house, rather than in lodgings. Etty had long considered Venice his spiritual home and \\"the hope and idol of my professional life\\", and had often wondered why, given its artistic importance, so few English travellers visited the city. He was not disappointed.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Thomas Frieden and other government officials faced tough questions from members of both parties after a second Texas nurse was diagnosed with Ebola, but the line of questioning from Republicans and Democrats on the investigative committee pushed two contrasting paths to keep the disease from spreading in the U.S. Republicans again called for travel restrictions to prevent new Ebola cases from coming to U.S. shores while Democrats provided backup for the Obama administration and gave health officials, including Frieden, a chance to explain why a ban would not be effective and could, in fact, make the situation worse. Rep. Tim Murphy, the Republican who chaired the hearing, asked the CDC director how the Texas nurse who treated the only patient to have died in the U.S. of Ebola was able to board a plane after checking in with the Center. He also raised questions about policies to keep Ebola off of U.S. soil. \\"The trust and credibility of the administration and government are waning,\\" Murphy said, adding that the U.S. should \\"do everything in our power to keep the American people safe from the Ebola outbreak in West Africa.\\" How did nurse who treated Ebola patient fly on commercial jet? Murphy said a ban on travelers from West Africa could keep the disease from spreading further in the U.S and said that screening patients for fever is not enough to present a disease, citing a study that about 13% of patients infected with Ebola in West Africa had no fever. Frieden insisted that current screenings at U.S and West African airports were sufficient to protect Americans, but said he would \\"consider any options to better protect Americans. The ranking Democrat Rep. Diana DeGette agreed with Friden that a travel ban would be effective and said that while another person with Ebola symptoms will likely land at a U.S. hospital, the American health system can prevent the disease from spreading. \\"We should not panic. We know how to stop Ebola outbreaks,\\" she said. \\"The best way to stop Ebola is to fight it in Africa.\\" How the Ebola virus spreads Murphy suggested the administration would not establish a ban to avoid hurting \\"fledgling democracies\\" in West Africa, but said that shouldn't be a concern for American officials as they look to protect Americans. Rep. Fred Upton, the full committee's chairman, suggested banning people who have been in the most affected West African nations from entering the U.S. to keep those who may have been infected with Ebola but haven't yet showed symptoms of the disease at bay. \\"I just don't understand [how] we can't look at one's travel history and say, 'no, you're not coming here, not until this situation' -- you're right it needs to be solved in Africa, but until it is we should not be allowing these folks in. Period,\\" Upton said. But Frieden said a ban could encourage people in West Africa to take advantage of porous borders in the region and get to the United States another way, which would undermine U.S. efforts to screen patients at airports and be able to track and monitor potentially infected people. Can you catch Ebola on a plane? Democratic Rep. Henry Waxman used some of their time during the hearing to blame spending cuts for undercutting the Centers for Disease Control and National Institute of Health's ability to fight the disease. Waxman noted that the CDC budget has dropped by 12% since 2006 and that the public health emergency preparedness fund has been cut to 612 million from 1 billion in 2002. Waxman also used his time during the hearing to feed questions to Frieden and infectious disease specialist Anthony Fauci of the National Institute of Health to push their explanation of the unintended consequences of imposing a travel ban. \\"It's certainly understandable how someone might come to a conclusion that the best approach would be to just seal off the border from those countries,\\" Fauci said. \\"[A travel ban would lead to] a big web of things we don't know what we're dealing with.\\" Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Republican from Tennessee, picked up on Frieden's \\"porous borders\\" comment thinking the CDC director was referring to the U.S.'s borders and asked if the U.S. should \\"worry about having an unsecured southern and northern border.\\" \\"Oh you're referring to that border and not our porous border,\\" Blackburn said after Frieden corrected her. In his opening remarks, Frieden also said the U.S. has helped implement effective airport screenings at airports in affected countries and noted that those screenings identified 74 people with fever in September. He also noted his agency's heightened efforts to increase awareness among physicians about how to identify Ebola. 5 things nurses say the Texas hospital got wrong A second health care worker was diagnosed with Ebola on Wednesday. Amber Vinson, 29, works as a nurse at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas, where Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan was treated. Duncan died last week. But many are questioning how Vinson was able to board a commercial flight and travel back and forth to Ohio after she was being monitored as part of the team that cared for Duncan. Vinson was moved from Dallas to Emory University Hospital in Atlanta on Wednesday, where two others who contracted Ebola were treated. But Frieden said that Vinson should never have traveled on a commercial plane. Nina Pham, a nurse who also treated Duncan, was the first at the Dallas Hospital to be diagnosed with Ebola, but her condition has improved, and she is being transfered to NIH in Maryland. House Speaker John Boehner said in a statement late Wednesday, \\"A temporary ban on travel to the United States from countries afflicted with the virus is something that the president should absolutely consider along with any other appropriate actions as doubts about the security of our air travel systems grow.\\" So far Administration officials have cautioned that putting a ban in place could complicate the ability to get supplies and personnel to the affected region, and make it harder to stop the spread of the disease. The Texas hospital where Duncan was treated has been criticized for how it responded to Duncan's symptoms, and for failing to put protocols in place to protect those health care workers who came in contact with him. In prepared testimony, Daniel Varga, the Chief Clinical Officer for the Texas company that includes Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas, apologized to the House committee. \\"Unfortunately, in our initial treatment of Mr. Duncan, despite our best intentions and a highly skilled medical team, we made mistakes. We did not correctly diagnose his symptoms as those of Ebola. We are deeply sorry,\\" Varga said. Summary:","response":"At a big meeting, some important people talked about a sickness called Ebola. They talked about how to keep it from spreading in the United States. Some people wanted to stop people from certain countries from coming to the U.S., but others said that wouldn't help and could make things worse. They talked about how to check for the sickness and how hospitals can do better in treating people with Ebola. The main idea is that everyone wants to keep people safe and healthy."},{"question":"Background: Alcoholic beverages do not make the entire body warmer.[361] The reason that alcoholic drinks create the sensation of warmth is that they cause blood vessels to dilate and stimulate nerve endings near the surface of the skin with an influx of warm blood.

Solution A: Aiming for the optimal target (usually the pocket) 1. Identifying the pocket: In a 10-pin bowling configuration, the \\"pocket\\" refers to the space between the 1st and 2nd pins for right-handed bowlers, and the 1st and 3rd pins for left-handed bowlers. Hitting the pocket is generally considered the optimal target as it maximizes the chances of knocking down all pins in a single throw, but can also increase the probability of converting a spare if some pins remain standing. 2. Choosing the correct starting point and ball trajectory: When aiming for the pocket, you need to consider the type of ball, its weight, the lane conditions, and your personal bowling skill. The ball should have an angular motion so that it hooks into the pocket, maximizing the chances of knocking down all pins. In order to achieve this, you must release the ball with appropriate spin. 3. Adjusting your approach based on the initial result: If aiming for the pocket does result in some pins remaining, adjust your next throw accordingly to pick up the spare. For example, if the remaining pins are grouped together, aim for the center of the group to maximize the chances of knocking them all down. Solution B: Focusing on pin ricochet or deflection 1. Understanding pin reactions: When pins are struck by the ball, they deflect and can collide with other pins, knocking down more than just the ones hit directly. It's important to consider this effect when targeting pins, especially on the first throw. 2. Probabilistically analyzing targets: To strategically aim for ricochet or deflection, assess the optimal targets based on which pins are likely to cause the most pin action. For instance, the 1-2-4-7 pins for right-handed bowlers and the 1-3-6-10 pins for left-handed bowlers are considered as potential targets for efficient pin action. 3. Playing the angles: Rather than aiming for the pocket, which depends on controlling ball spin and trajectory, this method can rely on hitting specific pins at particular angles to create collision effects. An example would be to throw the ball straight at the 1-2 or 1-3 pocket, allowing horizontal deflection to increase the likelihood of knocking down more pins. 4. Adapting for the spare attempt: If pins remain standing after the first throw, analyze the remaining pins and their spacing to determine the most likely angles to maximize collision and pin deflection for the second throw. Conclusion: Comparing both solutions, it appears that Solution A (aiming for the optimal target) is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning. This is because it focuses on controlling the ball trajectory and spin, which can be adjusted and improved upon with practice and understanding of lane conditions. Furthermore, aiming for the pocket increases the likelihood of striking down all pins during the first throw, while the adaptability for the second throw also improves the chances of converting a spare. In contrast, Solution B (focusing on pin ricochet or deflection) relies more on probabilistic analysis and the inherent randomness of pin behavior. This strategy lacks the control and adaptability present in Solution A and may be less consistent in achieving spares due to the unpredictability of pin reactions."},{"question":"Answer the following question: You are presented with the quiz \\"what does testosterone stimulate reproductive tissues to develop?\\" But you don't know the answer, so you turn to your teacher to ask for hints.

Context: Gunshots rang out once again on a campus in the United States on Wednesday. Students and faculty raced out of harm's way, ducked under furniture, barricaded doors and hid in interior rooms, bathrooms and labs. The short-lived nightmare on the campus of the University of California, Los Angeles came one day before Wear Orange: National Gun Violence Awareness Day. Wear Orange was inspired by friends of Hadiya Pendleton, a 15-year-old Chicago high school student killed by gunfire in 2013. The group decided to honor her life by wearing orange — the color worn by hunters in the woods to protect themselves and others. While the idea has been embraced by civic organizations, politicians and celebrities, it has been rejected by gun rights advocates. The National Rifle Association has attacked the campaign as \\"pointless,\\" and said \\"participating is an easy way of scoring points for being 'socially conscious.'\\" Here is a look at the unique relationship between Americans and their guns. Any law-abiding citizen in the United States is allowed to own or carry a gun. That right comes from the U.S. Bill of Rights and the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. It says: \\"A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\\" The Second Amendment was based partially on English common law, which describes an auxiliary right, supporting the natural rights of self-defense, resistance to oppression, and the civic duty to act in concert in defense of the state. To purchase a gun in the majority of states, a person needs to be of age, pass the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check and fill out a firearms transaction record. However, background checks are not currently required for private sales, including those conducted at gun shows. Certain people are banned from owning weapons, including convicted criminals, people with mental health illnesses or non-U.S. citizens. But the system has major holes in it.

Here is a step-by-step analysis of factors that may cause plants to adapt: Step 1: Temperature changes Significant alterations in temperature, either warmer or cooler, will cause plants to adapt to withstand the new conditions. They may develop mechanisms to tolerate colder temperatures, such as producing chemicals that prevent freezing, or adapt to reduce water loss in hotter conditions, like closing their stomata during the day. Step 2: Changes in water availability A decrease in water supply, such as a prolonged drought, may lead to plants developing deeper root systems or adopting strategies to conserve water. Conversely, an increase in water availability, like in a flood, may cause plants to develop strategies to cope with the excess water, such as specialized root or stem structures. Step 3: Light availability Changes in light levels or duration of sunlight exposure can affect plant growth and development. Plants might adapt to reallocating energy production through photosynthesis, altering leaf orientation to capture more light, or adjusting flowering times to maximize reproductive success. Step 4: Soil nutrient availability If the soil's nutrient composition changes due to factors like erosion, pollution, or human interference, plants may need to modify their root systems to take up nutrients more efficiently or develop symbiotic relationships with microorganisms to improve nutrient acquisition. Step 5: Biotic factors and interactions Predation, competition, and other interactions with animals and surrounding plant species may lead to plants adapting their defense mechanisms, such as producing chemical deterrents or modifying growth patterns. Step 6: Atmospheric changes Changes in the atmosphere, particularly increasing levels of CO2, can cause plants to adapt, for example, by increasing their efficiency for photosynthesis or altering their stomatal behavior to reduce water loss. Step 7: Natural disasters or extreme weather events Events like wildfires, hurricanes, and tsunamis may force plants to adapt to survive, such as developing traits for rapid growth or reproduction to recover quickly from damage. Overall, plants have an incredible capacity to adapt to a wide range of environmental changes, allowing them to survive and reproduce despite the challenges they face."},{"question":"Translate to German: Despite everything, I believe this represents a great achievement on Parliament' s part, and also on the part of the rapporteur.","response":"Trotz allem glaube ich, dass dies eine großartige Leistung seitens des Parlaments und auch seitens des Berichterstatters darstellt."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: Given a phrase describing the relationship between two words, extract the words and the lexical relationship between them.

Haiti is in size and has an estimated 10.6 million people, making it the most populous country in the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and the second-most populous country in the Caribbean as a whole. - An island country is a country whose primary territory consists of one or more islands or parts of islands. As of 2011, 46 (approximately 24%) of the 193 UN member states are island countries. - Toots and the Maytals, originally called The Maytals, are a Jamaican musical group and one of the best known ska and rock steady vocal groups. The Maytals were formed in the early 1960s and were key figures in popularizing reggae music. Frontman Toots Hibbert's soulful vocal style has been compared to Otis Redding, and led him to be named one of the 100 Greatest Singers by \\"Rolling Stone\\". Their 1968 single \\"Do the Reggay\\", was the first song to first use the word \\"reggae\\", naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience. As Island Records founder Chris Blackwell says, The Maytals were unlike anything else...sensational, raw and dynamic. - Jazz is a music genre that originated amongst African Americans in New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \\"one of America's original art forms\\". - The Dominican Republic is a sovereign state occupying the eastern two-thirds of the island of Hispaniola, in the Greater Antilles archipelago in the Caribbean region. The western one-third of the island is occupied by the nation of Haiti, making Hispaniola one of two Caribbean islands, along with Saint Martin, that are shared by two countries. The Dominican Republic is the second-largest Caribbean nation by area (after Cuba) at , and 3rd by population with 10.08 million people, of which approximately three million live in the metropolitan area of Santo Domingo, the capital city. - Beres Hammond OJ ( born Hugh Beresford Hammond , 28 August 1955 , Annotto Bay , Saint Mary , Jamaica ) is a reggae singer known in particular for his romantic lovers rock and soulful voice . While his career began in the 1970s , he reached his greatest success in the 1990s . - Allen Toussaint (January 14, 1938 November 10, 2015) was an American musician, songwriter, arranger and record producer, who was an influential figure in New Orleans R&B from the 1950s to the end of the century, described as \\"one of popular musics great backroom figures.\\" Many musicians recorded Toussaint's compositions, including \\"Java\\", \\"Mother-in-Law\\", \\"I Like It Like That\\", \\"Fortune Teller\\", \\"Ride Your Pony\\", \\"Get Out of My Life, Woman\\", \\"Working in the Coal Mine\\", \\"Everything I Do Gonna Be Funky\\", \\"Here Come the Girls\\", \\"Yes We Can Can\\", \\"Play Something Sweet\\", and \\"Southern Nights\\". He was a producer for hundreds of recordings, among the best known of which are \\"Right Place, Wrong Time\\", by his longtime friend Dr. John (\\"Mac\\" Rebennack), and \\"Lady Marmalade\\", by Labelle. - Reggae is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1960s. The term also denotes the modern popular music of Jamaica and its diaspora. A 1968 single by Toots and the Maytals \\"Do the Reggay\\" was the first popular song to use the word \\"reggae,\\" effectively naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience. While sometimes used in a broad sense to refer to most types of popular Jamaican dance music, the term \\"reggae\\" more properly denotes a particular music style that was strongly influenced by traditional mento as well as American jazz and rhythm and blues, especially the New Orleans R&B practiced by Fats Domino and Allen Toussaint, and evolved out of the earlier genres ska and rocksteady. Reggae usually relates news, social gossip, and political comment. Reggae spread into a commercialized jazz field, being known first as Rudie Blues, then Ska, later Blue Beat, and Rock Steady. It is instantly recognizable from the counterpoint between the bass and drum downbeat, and the offbeat rhythm section. The immediate origins of reggae were in ska and rock steady; from the latter, reggae took over the use of the bass as a percussion instrument. - Rocksteady is a music genre that originated in Jamaica around 1966. A successor of ska and a precursor to reggae, rocksteady was performed by Jamaican vocal harmony groups such as The Gaylads, The Maytals, The Heptones and The Paragons. The term \\"rocksteady\\" comes from a dance style that was mentioned in the Alton Ellis song \\"Rock Steady\\". Dances performed to rocksteady were less energetic than the earlier ska dances. The first international rocksteady hit was \\"Hold Me Tight\\" (1968) by the American soul singer Johnny Nash; it reached number one in Canada. - Ska (Jamaican ) is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1950s and was the precursor to rocksteady and reggae. Ska combined elements of Caribbean mento and calypso with American jazz and rhythm and blues. It is characterized by a walking bass line accented with rhythms on the off-beat. Ska developed in Jamaica in the 1960s when Prince Buster, Clement \\"Coxsone\\" Dodd, and Duke Reid formed sound systems to play American rhythm & blues and then began recording their own songs. Some suggest ska dates to earlier times, however. In the early 1960s, ska was the dominant music genre of Jamaica and was popular with British mods. Later it became popular with many skinheads. - Lovers rock is a style of reggae music noted for its romantic sound and content. While love songs had been an important part of reggae since the late 1960s, the style was given a greater focus and a name in London in the mid-1970s. Despite the name, lovers rock is not a rock subgenre or related to it. - Antoine \\"Fats\\" Domino, Jr. (born February 26, 1928) is an American pianist and singer-songwriter of French Creole descent. Five of his records released before 1955 sold over a million copies and were certified as gold records, and he had 35 records in the U.S. Top 40. His musical style is based on traditional rhythm and blues, accompanied by saxophones, bass, piano, electric guitar, and drums. - Rhythm and blues, often abbreviated as R&B or RnB, is a genre of popular African-American music that originated in the 1940s. The term was originally used by record companies to describe recordings marketed predominantly to urban African Americans, at a time when \\"urbane, rocking, jazz based music with a heavy, insistent beat\\" was becoming more popular. In the commercial rhythm and blues music typical of the 1950s through the 1970s, the bands usually consisted of piano, one or two guitars, bass, drums, saxophone, and sometimes background vocalists. R&B lyrical themes often encapsulate the African-American experience of pain and the quest for freedom and joy. Lyrics focus heavily on the themes of triumphs and failures in terms of relationships, freedom, economics, aspirations, and sex. - Cuba, officially the Republic of Cuba, is a country comprising the island of Cuba as well as Isla de la Juventud and several minor archipelagos. Cuba is located in the northern Caribbean where the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Atlantic Ocean meet. It is south of both the U.S. state of Florida and the Bahamas, west of Haiti, and north of Jamaica. Havana is the largest city and capital; other major cities include Santiago de Cuba and Camagüey. Cuba is the largest island in the Caribbean, with an area of , and the second-most populous after Hispaniola, with over 11 million inhabitants. - \\"Do the Reggay\\" is a reggae song by The Maytals. Written by Toots Hibbert, produced by Leslie Kong and released on Beverly's Records in Jamaica and Pyramid Records in the UK in 1968. \\"Do the Reggay\\" was the first popular song to use the word \\"reggae\\" and defined the developing genre by giving it its name. At that time, \\"reggay\\" had been the name of a passing dance fashion in Jamaica, but the song's connection of the word with the music itself led to its use for the style of music that developed from it.

He weighed in at almost thirteen pounds, came ready-fitted with a shock of fat black hair and a couple of razor teeth. Jimbob's folks loved him like most folks love their little ones, maybe more. They'd been trying so hard for a child, suffered more mid-term miscarriages than the ewes they shuttled off to market most Thursdays. They dressed him in a one-year babygro and took him home to their hill farm. They fought to get up nights and give him his milk. His teeth made breast-feeding impossible. They sat hours gazing down in his cot. They dressed him fine and took him to their church and gave their thanks. Showed him off like the proud parents they were. Others cooed and smiled. But they never asked to hold. They gave thanks the Blakeys were happy, and that the monkey-baby had not been born to them. Jimbob's folks never gave a second thought that their boy might be different. The first Spring he walked, he stomped the moors in his welly-boots helping herd the pregnant ewes down in-by. He copied his father, kicking and cuffing at the stragglers, when the flock was returned to the hills in May. As Jimbob grew, his hair became thicker, his arms longer. His head shrunk down on his shoulders. At check-ups, nurses fixed smiles and pronounced him healthy. Doctors said, 'he'll make you a strapping lad.' His mother smiled, her heart swelled. When he was three, she sent him to nursery. She wanted him to mix with other kids. To taste life off the hard hills. She said, 'it'll do him the world of good.' Jimbob hated leaving the farm. He clung to his mother. She drove away, blinking tears. On the third day, she took a phone call. 'It's Jimbob,' they said. 'He's scaring the other kids.'The truth hit Jimbob's mother like a hammer. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: What did Jimbob's mother do after the nursery called?

Step 1: Analyze the context from \\"After the fire a still small voice. -- 1 Kings 19:12\\" This verse is from the Bible, specifically the Old Testament. In this context, the word \\"voice\\" is used to describe the way in which God communicates with the prophet Elijah. The still small voice symbolizes the gentle, delicate, and intimate nature of God's communication with humans as opposed to the loud and destructive elements such as wind, earthquake, and fire mentioned earlier in the passage. Step 2: Analyze the context of \\"The voice of the law\\" This expression is a metaphorical way to describe the authority and presence of the law. Here, \\"voice\\" represents the principles, rules, and regulations established by society and enforced by a legal system. In this context, the \\"voice\\" of the law refers to the power of legal authorities to communicate and enforce justice. Step 3: Compare and evaluate the meanings In \\"After the fire a still small voice,\\" the word \\"voice\\" refers to a delicate, intimate form of communication from God. In contrast, in \\"The voice of the law,\\" it refers to the authoritative, regulatory, and forceful nature of the law's principles and rules. Conclusion: The word \\"voice\\" does not mean the same thing in these two expressions. In the first example from 1 Kings 19:12, it represents a gentle communication from God, while in the second example, it denotes the authoritative and regulatory nature of the law. The difference lies in the context in which the word \\"voice\\" is used and the metaphorical meanings associated with each expression."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which continent destroyed habitats by overconsumption? Two continents had different histories. Asia was inhabited by many humans which destroyed most natural habitats through their activities. America was protective towards its environment and therefore thrived. Hint: Habitat destruction has played a key role in extinctions, especially in relation to tropical forest destruction. Factors contributing to habitat loss include: overconsumption, overpopulation, land use change, deforestation, pollution (air pollution, water pollution, soil contamination) and global warming or climate change.Habitat size and numbers of species are systematically related. Physically larger species and those living at lower latitudes or in forests or oceans are more sensitive to reduction in habitat area. Conversion to \\"trivial\\" standardized ecosystems (e.g., monoculture following deforestation) effectively destroys habitat for the more diverse species that preceded the conversion. Even the simplest forms of agriculture affect diversity – through clearing/draining land, discouraging weeds and \\"pests\\", and encouraging just a limited set of domesticated plant and animal species. In some countries lack of property rights or lax law/regulatory enforcement necessarily leads to biodiversity loss (degradation costs having to be supported by the community).A 2007 study conducted by the National Science Foundation found that biodiversity and genetic diversity are codependent—that diversity among species requires diversity within a species and vice versa. \\"If any one type is removed from the system, the cycle can break down and the community becomes dominated by a single species.\\" A:","response":"Asia"},{"question":"Given the question: Here is a review left by a customer on a product.

Martin Robinson. Strife: Michael O'Leary's Ryanair has revealed its first drop in profits for five years but maintains their customer service is improving. Ryanair has suffered its first fall in annual profits for five years but maintains its much-maligned customer service is improving 'rapidly'. The budget airline has today revealed its post-tax profits were eight per cent lower at £426.5million (523million euros) to the end of March 2014 - down around £37million on a year earlier. The slide came despite boss Michael O'Leary's promise that the company would 'stop unnecessarily. p****** people off' and treating customers 'like the enemy'. Today the chief executive described the results as disappointing but said efforts. since September to reinvent Ryanair's image and reputation helped. passenger traffic rise four per cent in the second half of the year. After years of growth the budget airline was forced to issue an unprecedented two profits warnings in the past 12 months. O'Leary also decided to offer a more 'sophisticated' experience of passengers, including ending the scramble to get on his planes by offering allocated seating for almost £5. As part of ending the airline's 'over-abrupt', 'go to hell' culture, he also promised strict hand-luggage. restrictions would be relaxed. He also pledged not to overly penalise passengers who make a ‘genuine. mistake’ – such as forgetting to bring their boarding card, which often. results in a £70 charge to reprint them. Decline: The budget airline - which has been criticised for treating its passengers 'like the enemy' - was recently forced to issue its second profits warning in a year ahead of these disappointing results. Outspoken: Mr O'Leary, who has gained a. reputation as a corporate loudmouth, has been the face of Ryanair for. almost 20 years. He has seen it through two decades of extraordinary. growth. . The. airline, which operates more than 1,600 routes from 68 bases expects to fly 84.6 million passengers in the next year. Overall,. they are predicting a recovery in profits for the current year to. between £473 million and £505.6million. Over the next five years, the airline plans to grow to more. than 110 million customers a year, it said. Mr O'Leary, who has gained a reputation as a corporate loudmouth, has been the face of Ryanair for almost 20 years. But in the past 12 months, under pressure over customer service, he has said he wants to change his ways. Over the autumn a charm offensive backfired when the outspoken tycoon. was bombarded on Twitter after agreeing to host a question-and-answer. session from customers. He posted a picture of himself on the social networking site dressed as a leprechaun before fielding tweets. Many. customers told Mr O'Leary what an ‘a***hole’ they thought he was - with. user Andrew Riddell asking him: 'Have you by any chance just hired. British Gas's former head of publicity you Plum'. The. Ryanair boss replied: 'Hey, don't call me plum. Pudding would be more. accurate!', before later admitting: 'I'm an a***hole. But they still. love me.'","response":"Ryanair, a big airline company, had its profits go down for the first time in five years. Profits are the money a company makes after paying for everything it needs. However, the boss of the company, Michael O'Leary, said they are making their customer service better. Customer service means how a company treats and helps its customers. Ryanair is making changes, like letting people choose where to sit on the plane and being nicer when customers make mistakes. They think their profits will go up again this year, and they plan to have even more customers in the future."},{"question":"If \\"This teen is showing off her talent as she dives in a pool.\\" does that mean that \\"The teen is skiing down the mountain.\\"?

The state economy was largely defined by ranching and mining. At the expense of the working class, the Díaz administration promoted economic growth by encouraging investment from foreign companies from the United Kingdom, France, Imperial Germany and the United States. The proletariat was often exploited, and found no legal protection or political recourse to redress injustices. Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): This group was often exploited and had no legal protection or recourse.","response":"The question refers to the working class, often termed the proletariat, in the state of Chihuahua during the administration of Porfirio Díaz in Mexico. This extract vividly illustrates the economic disparities and socio-political conditions of that era. In the aforementioned context, the working class - the miners, ranchers, laborers, etc., who did not own any lands and worked on the haciendas or in the foreign companies - were the group that was often exploited and had no legal protection or recourse. During the era of Porfirio Díaz's rule, known as the Porfiriato, the Mexican economy experienced considerable growth. Díaz, the president, systematically encouraged foreign investment which ultimately led to an economic boom. The key sectors contributing to this growth were mining and agriculture, sectors which were majorly controlled by a handful of families who owned large estates or haciendas. However, this economic growth came at a significant cost. To secure the maximum benefit from the booming economy, the hacienda owners and foreign companies exploited the working class by paying them low wages, enforcing long working hours, and providing minimal benefits. Additionally, the application of scientific racisms and other forms of discrimination were common practices used by hacendados (landowners) to control and exploit their workers. This worker exploitation was exacerbated by the administration's favor towards the wealthy landowners and foreign companies. Legal protections for the working class were nearly non-existent, and the state effectively turned a blind eye to the plight of the workers, thus leaving them with no political recourse to redress their grievances. Moreover, Díaz's regime maintained a tight control over the political system, implementing a rigid system of control on political expression and dissent. It maintained peace by suppressing opposition and promoting a political culture of patronage and corruption to remain in power. Social inequalities were deeply entrenched, with the rich elite and foreign investors amassing immense riches while the working class languished in poverty and injustice. The latter remained marginalized, powerless, and without a means to improve their situation through legal or political means. Thus, the economic prosperity during Díaz's rule was structurally designed to benefit the rich minority at the expense of the working class majority, leaving the latter group exploited and void of legal or political protection. The situation would remain so until it finally culminated in the social upheaval - the Mexican Revolution of 1910 - aimed at dismantling such unjust socio-economic structures."},{"question":"Write a sentence not in English.","response":"Step 1: Choose a language other than English.

Their love for each other is palpable as they lie in bed treasuring their 6 month old daughter Quincey. Miranda fantasizes about the speech she plans to make when, one day in their future, she will give this tiny infant away at her wedding. Tragically, when Quincey is 3, Miranda is killed in a car accident and Rawdon is left alone, unmoored, to continue life without the love of his life. Fortunately Rawdon still has Quincey. Staying as strong as he can he takes her to the roof of a skyscraper and explains that Mommy is now an angel. It is up here that for the first time they see a vision of Miranda as an angel.

But some were taken aback by public backlash, and now they have another opinion to mull: that of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who said today through Iran's state news agency that the letter is a sign of \\"the collapse of political ethics and the US system's internal disintegration,\\" the AP reports. The country's leader mentioned how, according to the letter, any deal made now would \\"be null and void after this government leaves office\\" and that states typically stick with previously made promises no matter who's in charge. Khamenei then accused those handling the nuclear deal negotiations of putting pressure on Iran, stating that in the 11th hour, \\"the tone of the other party, particularly the Americans, becomes harsher, harder, and more violent. This is part of their tricks and deceits.\\" And, despite a statement by the letter's main driver, Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton, on Monday's Fox & Friends that \\"many Iran experts say that Iran's leaders don't understand our Constitution,\\" Khamenei assured everyone today that \\"Iranian officials know what they are doing.\\" Meanwhile, a scathing New York Times editorial addresses the \\"Republican idiocy on Iran,\\" calling the senators' letter \\"disgraceful and irresponsible\\" and accusing GOPers of \\"being willing to sabotage any deal with Iran (before they know the final details)\\" and \\"diminish America's standing as a global power capable of crafting international commitments and adhering to them.\\" Even Sen.

These senators wanted to tell the leaders of Iran about some talks they were having to make sure Iran didn't build anything dangerous called nuclear weapons. Now, the president of the place the senators were from, named President Obama, didn't really like that these senators sent a letter. But it gets more interesting! A very important leader from Iran, named Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, talked about the letter too. He said that the letter showed that something bad was happening to the way people act in the senators' country. Khamenei also said that even though the letter said that promises might not be kept depending on who the next leader is, countries usually keep their promises no matter what. He then said that some of the people in charge of the talks about nuclear weapons were being mean and tricky to Iran. One of the important senators who sent the letter, named Tom Cotton, thought the leaders of Iran didn't understand how his country worked. But Khamenei wanted everyone to know that, \\"Iranian officials know what they are doing.\\" A big newspaper, called the New York Times, said the letter was a very bad idea and caused trouble for everyone.

These photosynthesizing organisms, known as photoautotrophs, capture light energy from the sun using pigments called chlorophyll. This energy is then used to convert carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere and water (H2O) from the soil into glucose (C6H12O6), a simple sugar that can be used as an energy source or as a building block for more complex carbohydrates.

The Rogue River begins at Boundary Springs on the border between Klamath and Douglas counties near the northern edge of Crater Lake National Park. Although it changes direction many times, it flows generally west for 215 miles (346 km) from the Cascade Range through the Rogue River – Siskiyou National Forest and the Klamath Mountains to the Pacific Ocean at Gold Beach. Communities along its course include Union Creek, Prospect, Trail, Shady Cove, Gold Hill and Rogue River, all in Jackson County; Grants Pass and Galice in Josephine County; and Agness, Wedderburn and Gold Beach in Curry County. Significant tributaries include the South Fork Rogue River, Elk Creek, Bear Creek, the Applegate River, and the Illinois River. Arising at 5,320 feet (1,622 m) above sea level, the river loses more than 1 mile (1.6 km) in elevation by the time it reaches the Pacific. It was one of the original eight rivers named in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers Act of 1968, which included 84 miles (135 km) of the Rogue, from 7 miles (11.3 km) west of Grants Pass to 11 miles (18 km) east of the mouth at Gold Beach. In 1988, an additional 40 miles (64 km) of the Rogue between Crater Lake National Park and the unincorporated community of Prospect was named Wild and Scenic. Of the river's total length, 124 miles (200 km), about 58 percent is Wild and Scenic. The Rogue is one of only three rivers that start in or east of the Cascade Range in Oregon and reach the Pacific Ocean. The others are the Umpqua River and Klamath River. These three Southern Oregon rivers drain mountains south of the Willamette Valley; the Willamette River and its tributaries drain north along the Willamette Valley into the Columbia River, which starts in British Columbia rather than Oregon.

Artists such as Sayat Nova are famous due to their influence in the development of Armenian folk music. One of the oldest types of Armenian music is the Armenian chant which is the most common kind of religious music in Armenia. Many of these chants are ancient in origin, extending to pre-Christian times, while others are relatively modern, including several composed by Saint Mesrop Mashtots, the inventor of the Armenian alphabet. Whilst under Soviet rule, Armenian classical music composer Aram Khatchaturian became internationally well known for his music, for various ballets and the Sabre Dance from his composition for the ballet Gayane. Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What instruments are used in Armenian folk music?","response":"Armenian folk music utilizes a variety of traditional instruments that create its unique sound. Some of the commonly found instruments in Armenian folk music are: 1. Duduk: The duduk is a double-reed woodwind instrument made from apricot wood. It has a warm, haunting, and expressive sound, often used to evoke feelings of sadness, longing, and nostalgia. The duduk is considered the national instrument of Armenia and is widely recognized as one of the most significant instruments in Armenian folk music. 2. Dhol: The dhol is a double-headed drum played with two sticks. Its cylindrical body is made of wood or metal, and it has a goatskin or synthetic drumhead on each end. The dhol serves as the rhythmic backbone of Armenian folk music and is often played in ensembles during celebrations, festivals, and other important events. 3. Zurna: The zurna is a double-reed wind instrument with a conical wooden body and a flared metal or wooden bell. It has a distinctive, piercing sound that can be heard from great distances. The zurna is commonly played in pairs during celebrations, with one player performing a drone while the other plays a melody. 4. Kanun: The kanun is a type of plucked box zither played by laying it horizontally on the performer's lap or a table. It has a trapezoidal wooden body that is strung with multiple strings, usually arranged in courses of three. The kanun is known for its delicate, melodic sound and is primarily used to accompany vocalists or other instruments in Armenian folk music. Aside from these primary instruments, other instruments that can be found in Armenian folk music include the tar (a long-necked lute), kamancha (a bowed spike fiddle), shvi (a woodwind instrument), and the blul (a shepherd's flute). These instruments all contribute to the rich and diverse soundscape of Armenian folk music."},{"question":"Teacher:Given a sentence in Igbo language, translate the sentence to English language keeping the meaning of the original sentence intact Teacher: Now, understand the problem?

Top-ranked USC kept its win-streak alive and secured its bid as one of the greatest teams in college football history with a narrow victory over second-ranked Texas in a Rose Bowl game that featured stellar performances from the heralded and unheralded alike. After a five-yard touchdown on a keeper by Heisman Finalist QB Vince Young put the Longhorns on top 7-0 half-way through the first quarter, fellow Heisman Finalist QB Matt Leinart revived an offense that looked sluggish on its first few possessions with three quick TD strikes to three different receivers and the Trojans found themselves up 21-7 at halftime. Aside from its first drive the Longhorn offense looked stale and one-dimensional. Things did not really get better in the third quarter either when Reggie Bush found his groove and then the endzone with a 32-yard run that improved the USC lead to 28-10 at the time. A David Pino field goal with a minute left in the third-quarter chipped the lead to 15, but Texas' chances still looked bleak. Apparently though, an entirely different Longhorn squad on both sides of the ball came out for the fourth quarter. USC punter Tom Malone's coffin-corner kick from the Longhorn's 36 went awry, allowing Aaron Ross to return the ball all the way to the USC four-yard line to set up a Ramonce Taylor touchdown. USC scored almost too quickly on its next possession, kicking a field goal to lead 31-20 with plenty of time to play at 10:37 in the fourth. On the second play of Texas' next possession, Vince Young put on one of the greatest shows in BCS history with a seemingly effortless 71-yard run that stunned the Trojans and left the millions watching in awe. He then took the snap from shotgun into the endzone on a draw to narrow the gap to just three after the successful two-point conversion. Texas forced USC into another short possession and punt to get the ball back on its own 12 yard line with about six minutes left in the game. It didn't quite take that long. A surprising burst from 270-pound freshman RB Henry Melton set up a 36-yard Pino field goal to cap unlikeliest of comebacks. The Trojans offensive weapons were just too much for the exhausted Longhorn's though. USC used runs by both Reggie Bush and LenDale White as well as four key completions by Leinart to prepare for a 43-yard field goal. Mario Danelo's kick sailed through the uprights with 31 seconds remaining and a Rose Bowl victory in sights. Young missed on deep attempts on the final Texas possession and the Trojans walked away the victors. The two-headed all-purpose monster of Bush and White combined for 360 yards from scrimmage and Leinart was spectacular in the biggest game of his illustrious collegiate career, going 22-40 for 290 yards, three touchdowns and no interceptions. Despite leading his team to a successful comeback and turning even more heads with his rushing prowess, Young may want to rethink his NFL future after completing just eight of 22 passes, throwing zero touchdowns and coming up short when it truly counted. For now though, it's the same as it has been for three years, the Trojans are on top and everyone else is looking up at them.

In 1976—first in London, then in the United States—\\"New Wave\\" was introduced as a complementary label for the formative scenes and groups also known as \\"punk\\"; the two terms were essentially interchangeable. NME journalist Roy Carr is credited with proposing the term's use (adopted from the cinematic French New Wave of the 1960s) in this context. Over time, \\"new wave\\" acquired a distinct meaning: bands such as Blondie and Talking Heads from the CBGB scene; the Cars, who emerged from the Rat in Boston; the Go-Go's in Los Angeles; and the Police in London that were broadening their instrumental palette, incorporating dance-oriented rhythms, and working with more polished production were specifically designated \\"new wave\\" and no longer called \\"punk\\". Dave Laing suggests that some punk-identified British acts pursued the new wave label in order to avoid radio censorship and make themselves more palatable to concert bookers.Bringing elements of punk rock music and fashion into more pop-oriented, less \\"dangerous\\" styles, new wave artists became very popular on both sides of the Atlantic. New wave became a catch-all term, encompassing disparate styles such as 2 Tone ska, the mod revival inspired by the Jam, the sophisticated pop-rock of Elvis Costello and XTC, the New Romantic phenomenon typified by Ultravox, synthpop groups like Tubeway Army (which had started out as a straight-ahead punk band) and Human League, and the sui generis subversions of Devo, who had gone \\"beyond punk before punk even properly existed\\". New wave became a pop culture sensation with the debut of the cable television network MTV in 1981, which put many new wave videos into regular rotation. However, the music was often derided at the time as being silly and disposable.

So-called off-label prescribing significantly raises the rate of negative side effects, the research showed. Doctors are free to prescribe medications off-label, and in some cases patients benefit from those prescriptions. Physicians may find that an off-label drug is more effective at treating a problem than medications specifically approved for that use. For example, amitriptyline, approved to treat depression, is often used off-label for migraines. The study, published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine in November, suggests doctors should take greater care in choosing when to use off-label drugs and to more closely monitor patients receiving them, said Chester Good, a physician with the Department of Veterans Affairs, VA Pittsburgh, who co-wrote an editorial accompanying the study. “I’m not saying that physicians shouldn’t be using drugs off-label, it happens all the time,” Dr. Good said. “But we need to be more circumspect when we do so. Indications should either be supported by some evidence or recommended in guidelines.” Doctors often don’t know if the reason for prescribing a drug is off-label or on-label, studies have shown. They typically choose a drug based on other patients’ experiences with similar conditions or clinical guidelines from professional organizations, which sometimes include off-label use of a drug. Patients wanting to know if the drug they are getting is for an approved use should ask their doctor, some health experts suggest. Other studies have found higher estimated rates of off-label drug use—perhaps as much as 20% of all prescriptions. The rate is greatest among patient groups that normally aren’t included in drug companies’ clinical trials, such as children, pregnant women and psychiatric patients, said William Lanier, a professor of anesthesiology at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. Cancer patients frequently get off-label drugs because medication approved to treat one type of tumor may be found useful in treating other types, according to the American Cancer Society. Sometimes there is strong scientific evidence to support using a drug off-label, such as independent research published in a medical journal or historical precedent, said Dr. Lanier. But the JAMA Internal Medicine study found that about 80% of off-label prescriptions weren’t supported by strong scientific evidence. Among these: antidepressants, antipsychotics and anticonvulsants, often used in the treatment of epileptic seizures. “Our main message is off-label prescribing or use without strong scientific evidence should be discouraged,” said Tewodros Eguale, an associate professor at the Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences and first author of the study. “Physicians need to look for other approved drugs.” In cases when off label drugs are needed, physicians should be “very vigilant” in using the medication, he said. When granting a drug regulatory clearance, the Food and Drug Administration approves a label that details what the medication can be used for and the dosage, based on clinical trials conducted by the pharmaceutical company. Even when evidence emerges that a drug can help with other medical indications, companies often don’t want to go through the rigorous and expensive process of seeking additional approvals. Companies are generally prohibited from marketing drugs for off-label uses. The study looked at electronic health-record data in Montreal and Quebec City, Canada, which includes information on the drug prescribed, the reason the drug was taken—known as the indication—and the treatment outcome. The researchers looked at 151,305 prescriptions for 46,021 patients over a five-year period. In the U.S., doctors aren’t required to note the indication for a drug on the prescription, Dr. Eguale said. About 7.6% of the patients studied had adverse side effects, the report said. When drugs were prescribed off-label, the rate of side effects was 44% greater than when drugs were given for their approved use. In looking only at drugs used off-label without strong scientific evidence, side effects rose 54%, the study found. There was no difference in the rate of side effects between on-label drugs and off-label drugs that were backed by strong scientific evidence. The most commonly reported side effects were gastrointestinal, nervous system and respiratory symptoms, though the study didn’t track the seriousness of the symptoms. Dr. Lanier, of the Mayo Clinic, said it isn’t surprising patients given drugs off-label would have more side effects. “The patients for whom off-label drugs, doses or formulations are prescribed tend to be the sicker patients and the ones who have the greatest demand for some intervention,” he said. “In many instances, there are simply not adequate on-label drugs to treat these challenging patients.” Some of the drugs most commonly prescribed for off-label use, despite a lack of strong scientific backing, included quetiapine, an antipsychotic. Some 71% of prescriptions for the drug were for off-label conditions such as dementia and insomnia, the study found. And more than 99% of prescriptions for quinine, a drug approved as a treatment for malaria, were instead for restless leg syndrome. “Physicians are free to prescribe medications for whatever they think is in the patient’s best interest,” said Robert Aptekar, a San Jose, Calif., orthopedic surgeon. “I don’t think physicians know exactly the list of specific indications that are approved by the FDA for any particular medicine.” A 2009 study published in the journal Pharmacoepidemiology and Drug Safety found that 1,199 physicians in a national survey were able to identify the FDA-approved indication of 22 drugs only about 55% of the time. The physicians surveyed included primary-care doctors and psychiatrists. Some doctors would like to see a requirement in the U.S. that the indication for a drug’s use be included on a prescription. The move would allow for a better understanding of off-label drug use among other things. Gordon Schiff, associate director of the Center for Patient Safety Research and Practice at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, has been heading a three-year, federally funded project to create and test a computerized prototype where the diagnosis or indication for a drug is included for every prescription. “One of the biggest problems we have, particularly when we try to sort out patients’ medications and reconcile which ones may be no longer needed, is that we often don’t know why a patient is being started on a drug,” he said. Some physicians are concerned that requiring indications or diagnoses to be included on prescriptions might make it harder to be reimbursed by insurance companies or expose doctors to potential liability if the patient experiences a complication.

You'll be given the following question. Please do chain-of-thought reasoning. Pick which sentence is not logical. Options: - Sentence A: \\"the ground was covered by wind after the storm\\" - Sentence B: \\"the ground was covered by leaves after the storm\\"","response":"To find the sentence that is not logical, we need to analyze both sentences and determine if they make sense in terms of cause and effect and the natural behavior of the elements involved: - Sentence A: \\"the ground was covered by wind after the storm.\\" - Sentence B: \\"the ground was covered by leaves after the storm.\\" First, let's understand the context behind both sentences. They both talk about the aftermath of a storm. A storm typically involves strong winds, heavy rain, and sometimes, depending upon the severity, can lead to falling leaves, branches, and other debris. Now, let's analyze the sentences individually: - Sentence A implies that after the storm, the ground was somehow covered by wind. Wind, however, is not a tangible substance that can cover the ground. Instead, it is a movement of air caused by differences in atmospheric pressure. Wind cannot be seen or physically cover ground in the same way that leaves or other objects can. So, this sentence appears to be illogical. - Sentence B states that after the storm, the ground was covered by leaves. This statement is logical because during a storm, strong winds have the potential to blow leaves, branches, and other debris onto the ground as a result of the forces exerted on trees and other flora. Seeing a ground covered with leaves after a storm is a common occurrence and makes sense in the context of a storm's impact. Based on this analysis, Sentence A, \\"the ground was covered by wind after the storm,\\" is the sentence that is not logical."},{"question":"Write a A). yelp review (pick from the following.

You should describe a physical process that does not lead to the asked outcome, yet it is closely related to it (i.e., it should use the words that are provided in the input). The physical process can be moving something, arranging something in a certain way, mixing things, shaking them, etc. To make sure that the generated process does not lead to the asked outcome, you can introduce objects or events unrelated to the context of the question e.g. 'cleaning the keyboard by making an elephant sit on them'; or you can create contradictory statements e.g. 'drying wet keyboards with running water'. In your responses, avoid typos and misspellings. Input: Push kid on swing at a distance. Output:","response":"Part #1: Describe a physical process that does not lead to the asked outcome. Usage: Make a slide by attaching pillows to a staircase and pushing the kid down the slide. This does not lead to the asked outcome of pushing a kid on a swing, but it involves a physical process, movement, and a closely related element (i.e., pushing the kid). Part #2: Use words provided in the input. Usage: Inflate a large balloon and tie it to the kid's waist, then push the kid in the opposite direction of the swing at a distance. This uses the words from the input - \\"push,\\" \\"kid,\\" \\"swing,\\" and \\"at a distance\\" - while still presenting a physical process that doesn't lead to the desired outcome. Part #3: Introduce objects or events unrelated to the context of the question. Usage: Push the kid on a shopping cart at a distance from the swing, while a flock of birds distract them both. Here, the shopping cart and the flock of birds are unrelated objects/events that ensure the outcome of pushing a kid on a swing at a distance is not achieved. Part #4: Create contradictory statements. Usage: Attempt to push the kid on the swing by standing at a distance and blowing a hairdryer in their direction. This creates a contradictory statement because using a hairdryer at a distance is ineffective in pushing a kid on a swing, but it still uses the given input. Part #5: Avoid typos and misspellings. Usage: Use a remote-controlled robot to push the kid on a seesaw at a distance instead of a swing.

Les langues sont un choix populaire pour l'éducation des adultes et l'éducation continue, car elles ont de nombreux avantages. Non seulement elles peuvent ouvrir de nombreux débouchés professionnels et personnels, mais aussi augmenter la compréhension culturelle et faciliter les voyages. Elles peuvent également avoir des avantages cognitifs, car l'étude d'une langue étrangère peut aider à renforcer les compétences en résolution de problèmes, en mémoire et en écoute. Cependant, pour que cela soit possible, il y a des défis à relever. Les programmes doivent être structurés de manière à être accessibles et attrayants pour les adultes, qui peuvent être confrontés à des contraintes de temps en raison de leurs engagements professionnels et familiaux. Les enseignants doivent avoir une formation adéquate pour enseigner les langues aux adultes, qui peuvent avoir des modes d'apprentissage différents de ceux des enfants. En outre, de nombreux adultes peuvent être intimidés par la perspective de retourner à l'école ou de commencer à apprendre une nouvelle langue à partir de zéro. Il est donc important de rendre le processus d'apprentissage aussi accueillant et non intimidant que possible, par exemple en offrant des cours en ligne flexibles ou en mettant en place un système de jumelage avec des locuteurs natifs. En somme, l'éducation des adultes et l'éducation continue offrent de nombreuses opportunités d'apprentissage tout au long de la vie, notamment en ce qui concerne l'apprentissage des langues.

Article: Dear Maya Shao-ming, To me, June 6, 1990 is a special day. My long-awaited dream came true the minute your father cried, \\"A girl!\\" You are more than just a second child, more than just a girl to match our boy. You, little daughter, are the link to our female line, the legacy of another woman's pain and sacrifice 31 years ago. Let me tell you about your Chinese grandmother. Somewhere in Hong Kong, in the late fifties, a young waitress found herself pregnant by a cook, probably a co-worker at her restaurant. She carried the baby to term, suffered to give it birth, and kept the little girl for the first three months of her life. I like to think that my mother--your grandmother--loved me and fought to raise me on her own, but that the daily struggle was too hard. Worn down by the demands of the new baby and perhaps the constant threat of starvation, she made the painful decision to give away her girl so that both of us might have a chance for a better life. More likely, I was dropped at the orphanage (M JLR) steps or somewhere else. I will probably never know the truth. Having a baby in her unmarried state would have brought shame on the family in China, so she probably kept my existence a secret. Once I was out of her life, it was as if I had never been born. And so you and your brother and I are the missing leaves on a family tree. Do they ever wonder if we exist? Before I was two, I was adopted by an Anglo couple.

Questions: What kind of radio does someone use to reach base? Options: - vessel - box - transistor - submarine - lamp A:","response":"The option in line with common sense to answer the question \\"What kind of radio does someone use to reach base?\\" is a \\"transistor\\". Transistors are a key component to many different types of electronic devices, including radios. They function to amplify or switch electronic signals and power, allowing for modulation of signal output. In the context of radios, transistors are essential to enable the transmission and reception of signals, including reaching a base station. For example, in walkie-talkies, truck radios, or ham radios that people might use in field operations, transistors play a crucial role. It's important to note that the term 'transistor radio' is often used to refer to portable radios that people used before the era of smartphones and internet radios. They were quite common in the mid-20th century. But essentially, any modern radio device would still use transistors in its circuitry.

When the show's leading lady Alicia sprains her ankle, she and the wardrobe mistress Betty sneaks out of the rehearsal for medical assistance in which the closest medical facility is a mental hospital. When speaking to the psychiatrist, Betty notices a imprisoned patient who is revealed to be Irving Wallace, a former actor who went insane and committed a killing spree. Unbeknownst to any of them, Wallace killed one of the attendants with a syringe and sneaked out of the asylum, hiding in the back of Betty's car. Once they arrive back at the theater, the director Peter fires Betty for leaving during rehearsal. As she packs her things and gets ready to leave, Betty returns to the car only for Wallace to murder her with a pickaxe. Moments later, Alicia then emerges from the theater upon the discovery of her friend's corpse. Later, police officers arrive to remove the scene and stations two officers in the parking lot to keep an eye on the premises.Meanwhile, the director creates an idea by altering the play's script; he renames the show's antagonist to Irving Wallace instead of an ambiguous killer, and insists that everyone stay the night to begin immediate rehearsals with the new material, resulting one of his actresses Corinne hide the theater's key so nobody can leave. With the promise of additional cash, the group reluctantly agrees. Inside the dressing room, Laurel feels someone's inside and locks the door; she then screams when someone tries opening it and calls the group to her assistance. Peter accuses Brett as the culprit, but he refuses to accept.Unbeknownst to the group, Wallace himself has donned the theater's owl costume. While Alicia keeps searching for the key, Wallace arrives (with Peter thinking it's Brett) for the scene and strangles Corrine before stabbing her. Without the key's whereabouts, the group begins to panic and tries to contract the outside policemen. Wallace then... Answer:","response":"In the movie Deliria, the killer, Irving Wallace, disconnects the phone lines to isolate the troupe of actors and, in doing so, prevent them from seeking external help or alerting anyone outside the theater about their dangerous situation. By cutting off communication, Wallace creates a sense of panic, vulnerability, and confusion among the members of the troupe, allowing him to continue his killing spree without interruption. The disconnected phone lines make it difficult for the group to contact the police officers stationed in the parking lot, who are there to provide security. This isolation adds to the plot's tension and suspense since the characters are trapped in the theater with the killer, facing a terrifying ordeal that they cannot easily escape or report. Overall, Wallace's decision to disconnect the phone lines serves the purpose of creating a more frightening environment, cultivating fear in his victims, and ensuring the effectiveness of his murderous plan."},{"question":"Test for natural language inference.

Context: It's axiomatic that all cultures reserve a special place for food in their daily and social lives. For something as simple as a cuppa joe, we schedule and juggle our time to meet at predetermined locations to share conversation and libation. Meals require even more effort and the social ramifications increase. One is expected to show up on time, sometimes dress to certain standards and bring one or many bottles of wine as a thoughtful gift to the hosts. And of course, the food is just an excuse to get together with friends to enjoy a meal, share stories, to discuss or seduce, to seal an agreement or act as a prelude to a severance of relations (frequently unintentionally). I was first introduced to dining for pleasure as opposed to sustenance while at the University of New Brunswick. I lived in Bridges House, one of the men's residences. The young, eager, bright-eyed students in each residence were kept more or less in check by a Don. Each residence had its share of maniacs and troublemakers who were at university to get some form of education, alcohol poisoning or a social disease; sometimes all three. The Don's job was to act as a mentor and prison warden. Imagine a building housing up to 100 young adult men. It doesn't take much to start a riot. In our case, the Don was Locutus. When we met him, he must have been in his forties but looked to us adolescents to be older than Father Time. He was immediately dubbed 'Grandpa Munster'. With the tender sensitivity of males of our age, we didn't bother to hide this from him and he took it in good humour.

Over the winter the bank replaced their dirty carpet with hardwood to satisfy their customers, the Select from: (a). carpet was old. (b). hardwood was old.","response":"Over the winter, the bank replaced their dirty carpet with hardwood to satisfy their customers, as the carpet was old. The shabby, worn-out carpet had seen better days - it was a tired remnant of the bank's past, desperately gasping for a fresh start. The familiar sound of footsteps making their way across the bank's floor buzzed with quiet frustration and dissatisfaction from their loyal clientele. The bank's management, finally succumbing to the increasing patrons' complaints, initiated the process of revitalization. They identified a reputable hardwood supplier, sourced the finest quality planks, and scheduled the renovation to take place after banking hours. The hours passed, and renovations accelerated as planned. The workers carefully pulled up the ratty carpet, exposing the underlying cement floor. The contractors meticulously measured and cut each hardwood plank, acutely aware of the importance of the details in a financial institution. The bank's management watched with cautious optimism, both excited and nervous about the transformation at hand. And then, the morning sun spilled into the bank through the grand windows, illuminating the spectacular transformation. The once dull and grimy space had metamorphosed into an elegant, sophisticated interior. Rich, chocolate-brown hardwood floors stretched throughout the bank, reflecting a warm and welcoming light. As the customers entered the bank that day, they found themselves in a world reborn. Instead of the frayed and stained carpet, they were greeted by pristine hardwood underfoot. The ambiance breathed new life, with the smart and contemporary design inspiring a renewed confidence in the bank's services. The bank employees, invigorated and motivated by their updated workspace, served customers with newfound enthusiasm. The tellers greeted customers with warm smiles, while loan officers shuffled through paperwork with great pride. The clientele responded in kind - the atmosphere was charged with a positive energy where loyalties were strengthened, and connections renewed. Over time, as the hardwood floors began to show signs of wear, the bank found itself reluctant to replace them. They recognized the unique and endearing charm that accompanied the subtle marks of age. These scrapes and scuffs served as tangible memories, embedding the successes and setbacks of the bank within the very fabric of its foundation. Years later, customers could still walk into the bank, trace their fingers along the grooves and scuffs in the hardwood, and reminisce about the days when the old carpet had dominated their environment. The bank had garnered recognition and admiration for its rich history and dedication to serving its loyal patrons. By replacing the old, dirty carpet with hardwood floors, the bank not only changed the aesthetic of the building but also fostered a culture of growth and evolution. This decision cemented a legacy that would persist for generations to come."},{"question":"Premise: He is easily distracted the critic John Leonard remarked in an appreciative review of Culture and Imperialism , answering too many fire alarms, sometimes to pour on more petrol.

Nestled on the northwestern shore of Lake Zurich, the city comprises a population of approximately 430,000 people, and the metropolitan area covers a vast area of 1,700 km².

Additionally, numerous other international banks operate branches and offices in Zurich, making it a global financial hub. Zurich's economy is predominantly driven by the finance and services sectors. This prosperity is reflected in the high standard of living enjoyed by its residents, which consistently ranks among the highest in the world. Zurich has also been acknowledged as one of the world's most liveable cities, partly due to its clean air, efficient public transportation system, and vibrant cultural scene. Besides finance, Zurich is also a significant hub for technological and scientific industries, with numerous multinational corporations, research centers, and innovative start-ups operating within the city.

She was subsequently signed to a recording contract with Mushroom Records in 1987. Her first single, \\"The Locomotion\\", spent seven weeks at number one on the Australian singles charts and became the country's highest-selling single in the 1980s. She received the ARIA Award for the year's highest-selling single. Its success resulted in Minogue travelling to England with Mushroom Records executive Gary Ashley to work with producers Stock, Aitken & Waterman.

With Di Maria's future at the Bernabeu uncertain, both Manchester United and Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) are showing keen interest in acquiring the talented Argentine winger. Manchester United, managed by Louis van Gaal, are very eager to strengthen their squad after a disappointing season and believe that Di Maria can bring the much-needed quality and creativity to the team. United are expected to face fierce competition from PSG, who have a strong financial backing and are willing to secure a loan deal for Di Maria before committing to a permanent move next year. Additionally, PSG's potential loan deal could also work in their favor as they navigate through the Financial Fair Play (FFP) regulations. However, Manchester United, known for their financial muscle, are still hoping to lure Di Maria with a lucrative contract offer and the prospect of playing in the English Premier League. While Manchester United are seriously considering the possibility of signing Di Maria, they will need to move quickly and decisively to fend off PSG's pursuit.

He is most famous for developing the AK-47 assault rifle and its improvements, the AKM and AK-74, as well as the PK machine gun. - An assault rifle is a selective-fire rifle that uses an intermediate cartridge and a detachable magazine. Assault rifles were first used during World War II. Though Western nations were slow to accept the assault rifle concept after World War II, by the end of the 20th century they had become the standard weapon in most of the world's armies, replacing semi-automatic rifles, battle rifles and sub-machine guns in most roles. Examples include the StG 44, AK-47 and the M16 rifle. - Vladimir Oblast (\\"Vladimirskaya oblast\\") is a federal subject of Russia (an oblast). Its administrative center is the city of Vladimir, which is located east of Moscow. As of the 2010 Census, the oblast's population was 1,443,693. - The AK-47, or AK as it is officially known (also known as the Kalashnikov) is a selective-fire (semi-automatic and automatic), gas-operated 7.62×39 mm assault rifle, developed in the Soviet Union by Mikhail Kalashnikov. It is officially known in the Soviet documentation as \\"Avtomat Kalashnikova\\". - The AK-74 (Russian: or \\"Kalashnikov automatic rifle model 1974\\") is an assault rifle developed in the early 1970s by Russian designer Mikhail Kalashnikov as the replacement for the earlier AKM (itself a refined version of the AK-47). It uses a smaller 5.45×39mm cartridge, replacing the 7.62×39mm chambering of earlier Kalashnikov-pattern weapons. - The AEK - 971 is a Soviet / Russian selective fire assault rifle that was developed at the Kovrov Mechanical Plant ( KMZ ) by chief designer Sergey Koksharov in the late 1970s and 1980s . The primary model , the AEK - 971 , uses the 5.45 × 39mm round fed from standard 30 - round or larger box magazines used by the AK - 74 , AK - 74M , and similar weapons . - The 5.45×39mm cartridge is a rimless bottlenecked rifle cartridge. It was introduced into service in 1974 by the Soviet Union for use with the new AK-74 assault rifle. It gradually supplemented, then largely replaced the 7.62×39mm round in service. - Nizhny Novgorod, colloquially shortened to Nizhny, is a city in the administrative center of Nizhny Novgorod Oblast and Volga Federal District in Russia. From 1932 to 1990, it was known as Gorky, after the writer Maxim Gorky, who was born there. The city is an important economic, transportation, scientific, educational and cultural center in Russia and the vast Volga-Vyatka economic region, and is the main center of river tourism in Russia. In the historical part of the city there are a large number of universities, theaters, museums and churches. Nizhny Novgorod is located about 400 km east of Moscow, where the Oka empties into the Volga. Population: - An intermediate cartridge is a rifle/carbine cartridge that is less powerful than typical full-power battle rifle cartridges, such as the .303 British, 7.62×54mmR, 7.92×57mm Mauser or .30-06 Springfield, but still has significantly longer effective range than pistol cartridges. As their recoil is significantly reduced compared to high power rifle cartridges, fully automatic rifles firing intermediate cartridges are relatively easy to control. However, even though less powerful than a traditional rifle cartridge, the ballistics are still sufficient for an effective range of , which are the maximum typical engagement ranges in modern combat. This allowed for the development of the assault rifle, a selective fire weapon that is more compact and lighter than rifles that fire full power cartridges.

Context: A federal judge on Thursday rejected efforts by Texas to stop the resettlement of Syrian refugees within its borders. The ruling comes days after presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump called to block non-citizen Muslims from entering the U.S. following the Orlando nightclub massacre. Even before the attack, Americans were divided, mostly along party lines, on the issue of refugees from war-torn countries in the Middle East. A survey conducted in late May by the Brookings Institution found of those polled, just 38 percent of Republicans supported taking in refugees from Syria and the Middle East, compared with 77 percent of Democrats. But among Trump supporters, an overwhelming 77 percent said they oppose taking in refugees. So who are these people who cause such a divide among Americans, triggering feelings of dread and suspicion in some and feelings of empathy and hospitality in others? Millions have been forced to flee the bloody conflicts in Syria, Iraq, Libya and other Middle Eastern nations. In 1951 the United Nation's Refugee Convention defined a refugee as someone who \\"owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality, and is unable to, or owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country.\\" By the end of 2014, there were 19.5 million refugees worldwide, according to the United Nations, 14.4 million of whom were under the mandate of the United Nations Human Rights Council.

Comey told a Senate Judiciary Committee that investigators do not yet know if a group like ISIS hatched the love-and-hate match between jihadists Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik. In response to a question by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) about whether their marriage was “arranged by a terrorist organization, Comey said: “I don’t know the answer to that yet.” “Do you agree with me that if it was arranged by a terrorist operative of an organization that is a game-changer?” Graham said. “It would be a very, very important thing to know,” Comey responded about the possibility that a terror group arranged a marriage and infiltrated the US using the K-1 fiancee visa system. “That’s why we’re working so hard to understand it,” he said. The top G-man also said that Farook, 28, and Malik, 29, were radicalized at least two years ago and planned their evil martyrdom scheme long before they were engaged and before she applied for her visa. The couple — who lived in a two-bedroom townhouse with their 6-month-old daughter and Farook’s mother — killed 14 people and wounded 21 during a holiday party Dec. 2 at the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino. They were killed about four hours later in a shootout with police. The FBI had previously said only that the two had been radicalized for “quite some time.” Malik, who lived most of her life in Saudi Arabia, moved from Pakistan to the US in July 2014. She married Farook on Aug. 16, 2014, in Riverside, Calif. He was born in Chicago in 1987 and raised in Southern California. “San Bernardino involved two killers who were radicalized for quite a long time before their attack,” Comey said about the couple. “Our investigation to date shows that they were radicalized before they started courting or dating each other online, and as early as the end of 2013, were talking to each other about jihad and martyrdom before they became engaged and married and were living in the US,” he said. “We also believe they were inspired by foreign terrorist organizations. We’re working very to understand exactly their association and the source of their inspiration,” he said. “We’re working very, very hard to understand whether they had other plans — either for that day or earlier.” A US government source familiar with the shooting probe said Farook may have been plotting an attack in the US as early as 2011, Reuters reported. Comey also said his agents are “still sorting out” whether ISIS, which declared the duo its “soldiers,” masterminded the San Bernardino attack – but added that his agency still believes they self-radicalized. He confirmed that Malik posted a “bayat,” or pledge of allegiance, to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi the day of the attack. “ISIL has embraced them. … So ISIL’s inspiration may well have been part of this,” he said, using another acronym for the group. Under questioning, Comey also said he “doesn’t have reason to believe” that ISIS has already set up terrorist cells in the US. “They are trying to do two things,” he said. “They are trying to motivate people already in the United States to become killers on their behalf. They would very much like to as they aspire to be the leader in the global jihad [and] send people here to conduct attacks. It’s that second piece that we have not seen yet.” He also declined to say what role, if any, encrypted communications played in last week’s massacre. Comey said he remained concerned that terrorists and others were using technology to evade detection. “Increasingly, we are unable to see what they say, which gives them a tremendous advantage,” he said. Meanwhile, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Ioway) said Malik may have provided an incorrect address in Pakistan on her visa application to hide her family’s ties to radical Islamists in the Punjab area, the LA Times reported. “This is yet another example of the failure of the screening process for those entering the United States,” said Grassley, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. “Our government apparently didn’t catch the false address in Pakistan she listed on her application or other possible signs that she was radicalized or an operative.” Two government sources told the paper that Malik apparently used the name of a neighborhood or street near her home in Pakistan. But others who have seen the visa application think she might have provided the erroneous information either to avoid getting exposed because of her relatives’ ties to militant groups or because she was confused by the application form, the LA Times reported.

My dining partner had the Stuffed Mushroom Risotto, which was creamy and filled with earthy, savory flavors that left us wanting more. The service at Sunny's Grill was exceptional as well.

Plot title: Invictus Movie plot: On 11 February 1990, Nelson Mandela is released from Victor Verster Prison after having spent 27 years in jail. Four years later, Mandela is elected the first black President of South Africa. His presidency faces enormous challenges in the post-Apartheid era, including rampant poverty and crime, and Mandela is particularly concerned about racial divisions between black and white South Africans, which could lead to violence. The ill will which both groups hold towards each other is seen even in his own security detail where relations between the established white officers, who had guarded Mandela's predecessors, and the black ANC additions to the security detail, are frosty and marked by mutual distrust. While attending a game between the Springboks, the country's rugby union team, and England, Mandela recognises that the blacks in the stadium are cheering for England, as the mostly-white Springboks represent prejudice and apartheid in their minds; he remarks that he did the same while imprisoned on Robben Island. Knowing that South Africa is set to host the 1995 Rugby World Cup in one year's time, Mandela persuades a meeting of the newly black-dominated South African Sports Committee to support the Springboks. He then meets with the captain of the Springboks rugby team, FranÃ§ois Pienaar, and implies that a Springboks victory in the World Cup will unite and inspire the nation. Mandela also shares with FranÃ§ois a British poem, \\"Invictus\\", that had inspired him during his time in prison. FranÃ§ois and his teammates train. Many South Africans, both black and white, doubt that rugby will unite a nation torn apart by nearly 50 years of racial tensions, as for many blacks, especially the radicals, the Springboks symbolise white supremacy. Both Mandela and Pienaar, however, stand firmly behind their theory that the game can successfully unite the South African country.

(June 2012) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) The main narrative is set in a mythical land where, about 300 years before, two princes named Lock and Delphus fought for their father's throne. Although, Lock killed Delphus in single combat, their father's kingdom of Vallon was torn into rival nations, Lockland and Delphi. The story flashes forward from this prologue to the eve of Lockland's destruction, when the castle is besieged and the crown prince killed by invading Delphites. Against the counsel of the prince's sister Amelia (Amber Benson), their father, the Locklander king, turns to his chief sorcerer Armand (Larry Drake) in despair. The sorcerer convinces the king to give him a handful of his blood with which to animate a stone statue of a gryphon, a flying beast that is the totem of Lockland. Using the blood to bind the gryphon to him, Armand first orders it to break the Delphite siege, then betrays his king and calls it back to attack the Locklanders in a coup. It is seen that the sorcerer suffers the physical effects of any attack against the gryphon, but regenerates almost immediately due to his bond with the beast. Princess Amelia escapes during the takeover and pursues the retreating Locklanders, led the Delphite prince Seth (Jonathan LaPaglia), who had been in the vanguard of the besieging forces. Having inherited the gift of magical visions from his parents, the prince is advised by his mother Cassandra (Sarah Douglas), a sorceress, to seek an artifact called the Draconian Pike, the only weapon that can kill the gryphon. His mother warns him that he must retrieve the two halves of the pike and reassemble it to kill the gryphon before a solar eclipse occurs in two weeks, or Armand will be able to enact a ritual that makes himself and the beast immortal.

Multi-choice problem: Are these two questions inquiring about the same information? OPT: (A). no (B). yes","response":"To answer the first question, I will do a quick research on states in Mexico where the Hindi language is spoken. Step 1: Research states in Mexico and the languages spoken in each state. Justification: To determine if any state in Mexico speaks pure Hindi, it is necessary to gather data about the languages spoken in Mexico. Result: After researching, I found out that no state in Mexico speaks pure Hindi as their main language. Spanish is the official language of Mexico, and other regional languages like Nahuatl, Yucatec Maya, and Mixtec are also spoken in various states. Hindi is not a predominant language in Mexico. Now, I will answer the second question. Step 2: Identify which region or country the question is referring to. Justification: In order to determine which state speaks pure Hindi, it's important to clarify the geographical context. Result: The question does not specify a country or region. Therefore, I will assume the question is referring to the world, and I will answer based on the country where Hindi is predominantly spoken. Step 3: Research the primary country where Hindi is spoken and determine the areas where pure Hindi is spoken. Justification: Knowing the primary country where Hindi is spoken will allow me to determine the specific areas or states within that country where pure Hindi is spoken. Result: After researching, I found that Hindi is predominantly spoken in India. Within India, states like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Madhya Pradesh are known for speaking pure Hindi.

It is the world's largest religion, with over 2.4 billion followers, or 33% of the global population, known as Christians. Christians believe that Jesus is the Son of God and the savior of humanity whose coming as the Messiah (the Christ) was prophesied in the Old Testament. - John Wesley (or ; 2 March 1791) was an Anglican cleric and theologian who, with his brother Charles and fellow cleric George Whitefield, founded Methodism. - The Catholic Church, also known as the Roman Catholic Church, is the largest Christian church, with more than 1.27 billion members worldwide. As one of the oldest religious institutions in the world, it has played a prominent role in the history of Western civilisation. Headed by the Bishop of Rome, known as the pope, its doctrines are summarised in the Nicene Creed. The Catholic Church is notable within Western Christianity for its sacred tradition and seven sacraments. - Martin Luther (10 November 1483 18 February 1546), O.S.A., was a German professor of theology, composer, priest, monk and a seminal figure in the Protestant Reformation. Luther came to reject several teachings and practices of the Roman Catholic Church. He strongly disputed the claim that freedom from God's punishment for sin could be purchased with money, proposing an academic discussion of the practice and efficacy of indulgences in his \\"Ninety-five Theses\\" of 1517. His refusal to renounce all of his writings at the demand of Pope Leo X in 1520 and the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V at the Diet of Worms in 1521 resulted in his excommunication by the Pope and condemnation as an outlaw by the Emperor. - A Christian (or ) is a person who follows or adheres to Christianity, an Abrahamic, monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. \\"Christian\\" derives from the Koine Greek word \\"Christós\\" (), a translation of the Biblical Hebrew term \\"mashiach\\". - The pope (from \\"pappas\\", a child's word for \\"father\\") is the Bishop of Rome and, therefore, the leader of the worldwide Catholic Church. The primacy of the Roman bishop is largely derived from his role as the traditional successor to Saint Peter, to whom Jesus is supposed to have given the keys of Heaven and the powers of \\"binding and loosing\\", naming him as the \\"rock\\" upon which the church would be built. The current pope is Francis, who was elected on 13 March 2013, succeeding Benedict XVI. - Pontius Pilate (or ; Latin: \\"Pontius Pltus\\", , \\"Pontios Pltos\\") was the fifth prefect of the Roman province of Judaea from AD 2636. He served under Emperor Tiberius, and is best known today for the trial and crucifixion of Jesus. - Charles Wesley (or ; 18 December 1707 29 March 1788) was an English leader of the Methodist movement, most widely known for writing more than 6,000 hymns. - Lutheranism is a major branch of Protestant Christianity which identifies with the theology of Martin Luther (1483-1546), a German friar, ecclesiastical reformer and theologian. - George Whitefield (30 September 1770), also spelled George Whitfield, was an English Anglican cleric who was one of the founders of Methodism and the evangelical movement. - Methodism, or the Methodist movement, is a group of historically related denominations of Protestant Christianity which derive their inspiration from the life and teachings of John Wesley. George Whitefield and John's brother Charles Wesley were also significant leaders in the movement. It originated as a revival within the 18th century Church of England and became a separate Church after Wesley's death. Because of vigorous missionary work, the movement spread throughout the British Empire, the United States and beyond, today claiming approximately 80 million adherents worldwide. - Jesus (; c. 4 BC c. AD 30/33), also referred to as Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus Christ, was a Jewish preacher and religious leader who became the central figure of Christianity. Christians believe him to be the Son of God and the awaited Messiah (Christ) prophesied in the Old Testament. Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically, although the quest for the historical Jesus has produced little agreement on the historical reliability of the Gospels and on how closely the biblical Jesus reflects the historical Jesus. Jesus was a Galilean Jew who was baptized by John the Baptist and subsequently began his own ministry, preaching his message orally and often being referred to as \\"rabbi\\". He was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities, and was crucified by the order of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect. Jesus debated fellow Jews on how to best follow God, performed healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. After his death, his followers believed he rose from the dead, and the community they formed eventually became the Christian Church. - Generically, a Galilean is an inhabitant of Galilee. Historically, a Galilean dialect of Jewish Palestinian Aramaic was spoken there. Later, the term was used to refer to the early Christians, among others by the Roman emperors Julian and Marcus Aurelius. - John the Baptist (\\"Ioánnes (h)o baptistés\\" or , \\"Ioánnes (h)o baptízon\\", known as the prophet \\"Yahya\\" in the Quran), also known as John the Baptizer, was a Jewish itinerant preacher in the early first century AD. John is revered as a major religious figure in Christianity, Islam, the Bahá'í Faith, and Mandaeism. He is called a prophet by all of these traditions, and is honoured as a saint in many Christian traditions. - Joseph ( Hebrew , Yosef ; Greek : , Ioseph ) is a figure in the Gospels , the husband of the Blessed Virgin Mary , the mother of Jesus , and is venerated as Saint Joseph in the Catholic Church , Eastern Orthodox Church , Oriental Orthodox Church , Anglican Communion , Lutheranism and Methodism . Christian tradition places Joseph as Jesus ' foster father . Some historians state that Joseph was Jesus 's father . Some differing views are due to theological interpretations versus historical views . The Pauline epistles make no reference to Jesus 's father ; nor does the Gospel of Mark . The first appearance of Joseph is in the gospels of Matthew and Luke . Each contains a genealogy of Jesus showing ancestry from king David , but through different sons ; Matthew follows the major royal line from Solomon , while Luke traces another line back to Nathan , another son of David and Bathsheba . Consequently , all the names between David and Joseph are different . According to Matthew 1:16 \`\` Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary '' , while according to Luke 3:23 , Joseph is said to be \`\` ( the son ) of Heli '' . Some scholars reconcile the genealogies by viewing the Solomonic lineage in Matthew as Joseph 's major royal line , and the Nathanic lineage in Luke to be Mary 's minor line . In Catholic and other traditions , Joseph is the patron saint of workers and has several feast days . He was also declared to be the patron saint and protector of the Catholic Church by Pope Pius IX in 1870 , and is the patron of several countries and regions . With the growth of Mariology , the theological field of Josephology has also grown and since the 1950s centers for studying it have been formed . - The historical reliability of the Gospels refers to the reliability and historic character of the four New Testament gospels as historical documents. Some believe that all four canonical gospels meet the five criteria for historical reliability; some say that little in the gospels is considered to be historically reliable. Almost all scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed, but scholars differ on the historicity of specific episodes described in the Biblical accounts of Jesus, and the only two events subject to \\"almost universal assent\\" are that Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist and was crucified by the order of the Roman Prefect Pontius Pilate. Elements whose historical authenticity is disputed include the two accounts of the Nativity of Jesus, the miraculous events including the resurrection, and certain details about the crucifixion.

The former International Monetary Fund chief was greeted with applause at a Paris airport before leaving in a private car and coming home to his apartment. He was accompanied by his wife, journalist Anne Sinclair. On Saturday, Strauss-Kahn was mobbed by reporters in New York as he left the brownstone where he had been staying. His homecoming marks the end of a four-month court battle involving a man who had been favored to be the next president of France. Strauss-Kahn was pulled off a Paris-bound plane on May 14 in New York over accusations he sexually assaulted a Guinean maid in a luxury hotel suite in the city. Days later, he resigned from the International Monetary Fund, spent a few days in jail and was put under house arrest. His lawyers have maintained his innocence throughout the process. \\"There was an act in that room that was consensual, not forcible,\\" Benjamin Brafman said. Questions arose over the credibility of the accuser, Nafissatou Diallo, prompting prosecutors to back off. In July, prosecutors said Strauss-Kahn is no longer under house arrest and dropped the charges on August 23, citing the accuser's credibility issues. \\"If we do not believe her beyond a reasonable doubt, we cannot ask a jury to do so,\\" prosecutors said at the time. Strauss-Kahn largely remained in New York even after a judge removed his house arrest restrictions. The diplomat's return to Paris on Sunday marks his first since the scandal broke out. Strauss-Kahn's arrest sent shock waves through France and redefined the landscape of the country's upcoming presidential race. His homecoming raises the possibility of his return to politics or a prominent position in the government. Strauss-Kahn still faces a civil suit from Diallo and an accusation of attempted rape by a French writer. The diplomat and his wife have been one of France's power couples since they married in 1989.

A poor farmer and his young son arrive into the settlement where the farmer confronts Luke, a thieving henchman employed by wealthy land baron Richard Barrett. The man complains to Fletcher that he had been cheated by Barrett claiming he had been sold a deed to non-existent property. Fletcher finally shoots the farmer, killing the man in front of his young son. His son then picks up his father's shotgun, uses it to kill Fletcher, and rides out of town with Fletcher's horse and a distinctive silver-trimmed saddle. The boy is next seen several years later and has since become a hardened bounty hunter calling himself Roy Blood (Giuliano Gemma). He meets an elderly drifter, Two-Strike Snake (Geoffrey Lewis), who accompanies him to the frontier town of Cerriotts. Snake is a colorful character who claims that the story of the \\"silver saddle\\" and the boy who avenged his father's death is well known and that he wishes to join Blood in his travels. On the way, Snake often scavenges the remains of those killed in gunfights by Roy Blood. Their arrival in Cerriotts is noticed by several townspeople, in particular, a local cowboy known as Turner (Gianni De Luigi). Blood visits the town whorehouse where he meets with an old girlfriend, Shiba (Licinia Lentini), who is also its madam. She tells Blood that she is being extorted by a man called Shep who collects the money on behalf of a Mexican bandit named Garrincha (Aldo Sambrell). Shiba enlists Blood's help in taking care of Garrincha and his gang. Indeed, Blood confronts and kills Shep and several of Garrincha's men in a gunfight. Afterwards, Turner appears to offer Blood 2,000 to kill a man called Barrett. Blood is hesitant to take the murder contract, but accepts the offer upon recognizing the name of the land baron who had swindled his father years before.

Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options: - communication - fun - understood - ease tension - suffering","response":"The most suitable option to answer the question, \\"Sometimes just expressing yourself is the best way to be what?\\" is understood. Expressing oneself is a vital part of human interaction. When we take the time to express ourselves, we provide others with an insight into our thoughts, feelings, and perspectives. This can lead to a better understanding of who we are, as well as how we view and experience the world around us. Being understood offers numerous benefits, some of which are highlighted below: 1. Enhanced Relationships: When we are understood by others, our relationships can evolve and strengthen. This is because empathy, trust, and open communication set the foundation for meaningful connections. 2. Reduced Misinterpretations: If we express ourselves clearly and authentically, we minimize the chances of our intentions or thoughts being misinterpreted. This can save us from countless misunderstandings and unnecessary conflicts. 3. Increased Self-awareness: When we communicate our needs, desires, or boundaries, we gain a better understanding of ourselves. This self-awareness encourages personal growth, as we can identify areas where improvement is needed, or where our values lie. 4. Emotional Intelligence: Expressing oneself promotes emotional intelligence, as it shows an ability to recognize and effectively deal with our emotions. This is an essential skill that helps us navigate social situations and maintain emotional well-being. 5. Validation: When others understand our thoughts and feelings, it can lead to a sense of validation. This can be comforting and reassuring, making it easier to handle tough situations or emotional experiences. 6. Problem-solving: In many cases, expressing oneself and being understood can help resolve problems or conflicts. When both parties understand each other's views, it is easier to find a solution that works for everyone involved. In conclusion, expressing oneself is the best way to be understood. By openly and honestly conveying our thoughts and feelings, we allow others to gain insight into our perspectives, which can lead to deeper connections, better relationships, and enhanced personal growth. While the other options, such as communication or easing tension, are also worthwhile results of self-expression, the most suitable outcome is gaining understanding from those around us."},{"question":"Write a sentence in English.","response":"The cat is playing with a ball.

His father was a heroin addict, and Odom's mother died of colon cancer when he was twelve years old. At her deathbed, Odom's mom told him: \\"Be nice to everybody\\". Afterwards, he was raised by his maternal grandmother, Mildred Mercer. Context: Odom contemplated entering the NBA directly out of high school, and consulted with Bryant, who had made the jump a year earlier. He decided he was not ready, and decided to attend the University of Nevada at Las Vegas. However, after a Sports Illustrated report questioned his unexpectedly high score of 22 out of 36 in the ACT, the school released him in July 1997 before he ever played a game for them. That same summer, he received a citation for soliciting prostitution following an undercover operation by the Las Vegas police. Later, an NCAA inquiry found Odom received payments amounting to 5,600 from booster David Chapman. Coach Bill Bayno was fired and UNLV was placed on probation for four years. Odom transferred to the University of Rhode Island but was forced to sit out the 1997-98 season. He was admitted as a non-matriculating student, and was not allowed to play intramural basketball. His room and board was paid for by his father, who was covered by the G.I. Bill. After two semesters and a summer session, Odom earned his eligibility to play basketball. His career at Rhode Island had been in jeopardy after the first semester, when he vanished before finals. However, Rhode Island coach Jim Harrick persuaded three of his four instructors to allow him to make up his work. The coach also had Odom work with DeGregorio, who had become a Rams assistant and was the player's closest friend in college. Odom was also inspired by his maternal grandmother, a nurse who had raised five children and returned to school to earn her degree in 1980 at age 56. Odom played one season for the Rams in the Atlantic 10 Conference, where he averaged 17.6 points per game and led the Rams to the conference championship in 1999. He earned first-team all-conference honors and was named the Atlantic 10 Rookie of the Year. He was named the most valuable player of the Atlantic 10 Tournament after his three-pointer against Temple University at the buzzer gave the Rams their first A-10 Tournament title. Question: Why was he forced to sit out?

(Photo: Riverside Sheriff's Department) Lorenzen Wright's ex-wife has been charged with murder in his death following an investigation authorities called Operation Rebound, officials said Saturday in an announcement that came seven years after the former NBA player's slaying. Sherra Wright, 46, has been indicted on charges of first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit first-degree murder and attempted first-degree murder, Memphis police Director Michael Rallings said. Federal marshals arrested her late Friday in California and she was being held in Riverside County. Authorities said Wright and co-defendant Billy Turner are charged with previously trying to kill Lorenzen Wright. Outlining the background of the investigation, Memphis police Major Darren Goods, of the Multi-Agency Gang Unit, said in late May or early June last year members of the gang unit said they received information about the Lorenzen Wright case. Command staff gave permission to give the case a second look, Goods said. \\"We wanted to investigate it as though it had just happened, so that's what we did,\\" Goods said. \\"We followed the evidence. We actually went to the crime scene and walked in Lorenzen's final steps.\\" In naming the investigation, Goods said that in basketball, a rebound gives you a second chance to score a basket and win. \\"We have Lorenzen Wright who was a homegrown young man,\\" Goods said. \\"He was raised in this city, he went to high school in this city, he played basketball in this city for the University of Memphis ... and he came back to play professional basketball in this city and, unfortunately, Mr. Wright lost his life in this city ...

Information led investigators to the lake, and Goods said an elite FBI dive team came in and found the murder weapon. The weapon was taken to the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation and it was verified as one of the murder weapons, Goods said. Authorities did not reveal information Saturday about the relationship between Sherra Wright and Turner. The Commercial Appeal previously reported Sherra Wright and Turner attended the same Collierville-area church. \\"I think we're confident that they knew each other so we're going to leave it at that for right now,\\" Rallings said.

They are also charged \\"in furtherance of the conspiracy\\" with traveling \\"to the area of Callis (Cutoff) and Hacks Cross to kill Lorenzen Wright,\\" according to the indictment. The last count charges them with trying to kill him between April 1, 2010 and July 17, 2010 in an attempt that included meeting and agreeing to kill him, acquiring guns, recruiting an unindicted co-conspirator and on the part of Turner, \\"traveling to and entering Lorenzen Wright’s home outside of Atlanta, Georgia to commit said criminal offense,\\" the indictment says. The body of Lorenzen Wright, 34, was found badly decomposed in late July 2010 near Callis Cutoff Road, and investigators found evidence of shell casings from different calibers at the scene. He apparently called 911 shortly after midnight on July 19, 2010, from a field near TPC Southwind golf course. At least five gunshot wounds were documented in an autopsy. Wright's body wasn't found until days after the 911 call. After Germantown dispatchers got the call, they didn't notify officers because the location could not be pinpointed. The location was actually in Memphis. Eight days later, investigators were notified and cell towers were used to help locate his body.

Context: Thanks for the A2A Josh: Tough one to reduce to just a single incident but I’ll try. I grew up in North Central Indiana, about 50 miles south of South Bend. It was common to have frequent snow accumulation in the winter and blustery, freezing temps. It seems like this was particularly true during my childhood in the 70’s and 80’s. My family was blue collar through and through. We lived in the heartland in a town of just a few hundred with a sawmill and an on again off again gas station as our only two businesses. My dad worked in a factory for roughly 45 years. He apparently started that job right out of high school. My mom was an incredibly hard worker and Still is to this day. She did factory work, restaurant management and everything in between. It was this Protestant work ethic that led to one of the frequent tasks that my brother and I had to do which was not fun but ultimately was a very good deed. As I said, winters were often snowy and harsh. So my mom would make my brother and me shovel driveways and sidewalks for a couple of elderly residents. We did this of course, after we did our own driveway. Some people had motorized snowblowers but we did not. Standard snow shovels were our tools. I remember us whining about the chore, wishing we could just play in the snow or get out of it altogether. I don’t remember being overly conscious of the relief this provided for our elderly neighbors. I just remember that Mom would be disappointed if we didn’t do a good job. Later in life I would have great appreciation for the things required of me by my parents. Factory work and summer farm jobs helped us learn the value of hard work and would set us on a road to appreciation of future job opportunities that were less taxing. I still remember hating shoveling snow. But I’m forever grateful that I did it. Question: When did the author appreciate having to shovel snow?

Dracula refuses to help, and transforms Mamuwalde into a vampire, whom he names Blacula and imprisons in a sealed coffin. Mamuwalde's wife, Luva (Vonetta McGee), is also imprisoned and dies in captivity.

Becoming a pilot is a rigorous and challenging process requiring an in-depth understanding of aviation, excellent physical and mental condition, and the ability to handle high-pressure situations. Jason, being keenly aware of the challenges and dedication required to successfully become a pilot, realizes that he still has a long way to go in terms of knowledge and skills. He understands that extra hours of training and practice under the guidance of his experienced tutor, Benjamin, would be highly beneficial for improving his competency. This is because the aviation industry demands a high level of precision, and the need to adhere to strict protocols and standards which leave no room for error. Asking Benjamin for additional hours likely stems from Jason's awareness of his own weaknesses, strengths, and learning progress. In identifying the areas where he needs further assistance, he can focus on refining his skills and acquiring valuable knowledge specific to those areas, ensuring that he becomes a competent and safe pilot. Moreover, working closely with Benjamin allows Jason to receive personalized feedback, tailored guidance, and expert advice, which can considerably enhance his learning experience. This kind of focused, one-on-one training optimizes Jason's development and growth, ultimately improving his chances of becoming a successful pilot. The fact that Benjamin is an experienced tutor is also an important aspect to consider.

It highlights his commitment to personal development and growth, while also recognizing the critical role that Benjamin plays in his progress towards achieving his dream of becoming a pilot."},{"question":"Read the following article and answer the question.

Complete the next sentence: How to prepare vermicompost Pick a spot in your house to place the worm bin. The best spots for worm bins keep a consistent temperature and moisture level. Avoid placing it near a heater, oven, air conditioner, or vent.","response":"To prepare vermicompost, follow these comprehensive steps: 1. Obtain a worm bin: Firstly, purchase or create your own worm bin. A worm bin is essentially a container that accommodates the worms, bedding, and food necessary for vermicomposting. It should have drainage holes at the bottom for excess liquid and a tight-fitting lid to retain moisture and protect the worms from sunlight and predators. 2. Create bedding: Bedding serves as both a cozy home for the worms and as an essential component in the composting process. You can use materials such as shredded newspaper, cardboard, egg cartons, or coconut coir. Moisten the bedding with water before adding it to the bin to create a damp, but not soggy, environment for the worms. 3. Add worms: Red wigglers (Eisenia fetida) are the most commonly used worms for vermicomposting. They can be easily sourced from gardening stores, bait shops, or online. Add approximately 1,000 worms to your bin, and please keep in mind that worms can double their population every 60-90 days. 4. Feed the worms: Worms need a constant supply of food to aid in the decomposition process. Give them a mix of fruit and vegetable scraps, coffee grounds, tea bags, and crushed eggshells, but avoid meats, dairy products, and oily items, as they can create foul odors and attract pests. Start by feeding them a small amount and gradually increase it as the worm population grows. 5. Maintain a suitable environment: Make sure the worm bin remains at an ideal temperature of 55-77°F (13-25°C). Keep the bedding damp by occasionally spritzing it with water—aim for a consistency similar to that of a wrung-out sponge. Ventilation is important, so ensure that there are enough air holes in your bin to provide adequate oxygen for the worms. 6. Harvesting the vermicompost: After 3-4 months, the bedding will transform into a dark, rich compost called vermicompost or worm castings. To harvest it, move the contents of the bin to one side and add fresh bedding to the empty space. The worms will eventually migrate to the new bedding. After a week or two, you can collect the vermicompost from the first section and use it for your plants. 7. Monitor the bin: Regularly check the bin for any issues, such as unpleasant odors, mold, or an abundance of pests. Good maintenance is key to a healthy and productive vermicomposting system. If any issues arise, it is crucial to address them promptly—for example, by adjusting the moisture level, temperature, or the types of food added to the bin. 8. Use the vermicompost: Apply the nutrient-rich vermicompost to your plants, either by mixing it into the soil, creating a compost tea, or using it as a natural fertilizer. Vermicompost contains beneficial microorganisms and enzymes, making it an excellent organic additive, helping plants to grow healthier and more robust. By following these steps and maintaining a conducive environment for the worms, you will successfully create vermicompost and contribute to an eco-friendly waste management solution."},{"question":"Question: Read the following conversation and answer the question.

Chris, who has no high opinion of fraternities, gets to know a student of psychology, Megan, who invites him and Dan to a party of Doma Tau Omega, saying that she does not want to go there alone. However, when they arrive at the party, Chris seems to be interested only in the leader of DTO, Devon Eisley, and approaches him. After waiting for Chris a long time, Megan and Dan leave the party. Chris, meanwhile, is made drunk by Devon, who then makes him a member of DTO by drinking a bit of his blood while, in turn, Chris has to drink a bit of Devon's. Shortly after that, Chris is introduced to parties in the DTO house, where he and Devon drink blood from a girl called Sandy in a way reminiscent of sexual intercourse. Dan is unsettled by the change in Chris since joining the fraternity, and breaks into the DTO house. Investigating the book of DTO, Dan is shocked to find photos of Devon throughout the decades of the fraternity's history, completely unchanged. He persuades Megan to go with him to ChrisÂ´ room, which they find totally ravaged. They decide to look for Chris at the fraternity house. At the DTO house, Devon tells Chris that he lives eternally as long as he transforms his soul into a new body every century, and that this time, Chris would be the one whose body is used. The student found dead on campus was made to commit suicide, as he was afraid to participate in the ceremony and threatened to go public. Chris tries to flee but is knocked out by the other DTO members, Barry and Jordan. Dan and Megan try to enter the fraternity house, but their way is blocked by DTO member Mikhail who threatens them with an axe.

Step 1: Analyze each option's effectiveness in keeping the pizza warm. Option 1: Putting the pizza box on top of a seat with a seat warmer - The seat warmer will transmit heat directly to the box, which will then be retained by the pizza, maintaining its warm temperature. Option 2: Turning all of the car's heaters on full blast with windows down - Since the heaters will be blowing hot air into the car and the windows being down will allow for cold air from outside to enter, there will be a mix of both hot and cold air. This might not be as effective in keeping the pizza warm, as the hot air is not in direct contact with the pizza box. Step 2: Evaluate both options' energy efficiency. Option 1: Using the seat heater only consumes energy for heating the seat itself, reducing overall energy usage. Option 2: Blasting the car's heaters at full power with windows down is less efficient, as it creates unnecessary energy waste. Air conditioners usually consume a significant amount of energy, and having the windows down would require the heaters to work even harder to maintain desired temperatures. Conclusion: Based on the analysis, putting the pizza box on top of a seat with a seat warmer (Option 1) is a better solution to keep the pizza warm during the drive. This option is both more effective in retaining warmth and promotes energy efficiency."},{"question":"Q: Answer the following question given this paragraph: The strength of acids and bases is determined by the concentration of ions they produce when dissolved in water. The concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution is called acidity. It is measured by pH. A neutral substance has a pH of 7. An acid has a pH lower than 7, and a base has a pH greater than 7. Q: The concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution is called? A: OPT: (1). alkalinity (2). alcohol (3). moisture (4). acidity A:","response":"The concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution is called acidity. Acidity is a measure of how acidic a solution is, and it plays a crucial role in understanding the properties of acids and bases. When a substance is dissolved in water, it can release hydrogen ions (H+), which contribute to the acidity of the solution. The concentration of these hydrogen ions determines the pH of the solution, which is a numerical value used to express the level of acidity or alkalinity. A neutral substance, such as pure water, has a pH of 7, meaning that the concentration of hydrogen ions is equal to that of hydroxide ions (OH-) in the solution. Substances with a pH lower than 7 are considered acidic, and substances with a pH greater than 7 are considered basic or alkaline. The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14, with values below 7 indicating acidity and values above 7 indicating alkalinity. The scale is logarithmic, meaning that each whole number change in pH represents a tenfold change in the concentration of hydrogen ions. For example, a solution with a pH of 3 is ten times more acidic than a solution with a pH of 4, and 100 times more acidic than a solution with a pH of 5. In the given options, (1) alkalinity denotes the opposite of acidity and refers to the concentration of hydroxide ions (OH-) in a solution, (2) alcohol is an organic compound characterized by the presence of a hydroxyl group (-OH), and (3) moisture refers to the presence of water in a substance, particularly as a trace amount. Thus, the correct answer to the question, \\"The concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution is called?\\" is (4) acidity."},{"question":"Виктория рассмеялась.

Question: suppose the magma decreases happens, how will it affect A volcano begins to erupt. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer is:","response":"When the magma decreases, it would likely have less effect on a volcano beginning to erupt. The reason for this is that a lower amount of magma would mean reduced pressure driving the eruption. Consequently, the second effect mentioned, where the magma starts to cool, could also be influenced, though the impact might not be as much as the eruption itself. When there is less magma available for an eruption, the cooling process could either happen faster or slower, depending on the specific conditions in the volcanic system: 1. If the remaining magma is still able to reach Earth's crust and be exposed to the cool surroundings, it could potentially start cooling at a faster rate as the reduced volume of magma would make it easier for heat to disperse. 2. On the other hand, if the decreased magma does not manage to reach Earth's crust, then the cooling process might be slower, as the magma would remain insulated at depth, surrounded by other hot materials. In summary, in the situation where magma decreases, the effect on the cooling process (the second effect mentioned) could be either more or less depending on how the magma interacts with the Earth's crust. However, the overall impact on the eruption itself would be lessened, as there would be less pressure forcing magma out of the volcano."},{"question":"Rahul Bose was born to Rupen and Kumud Bose on 27 July 1967.

The shooter was a male, officials said, but they did not provide any other details, including whether he was a student or a visitor. A motive has not yet been determined. The two students killed were Casey Marquez and Francisco Fernandez, the San Juan County Sheriff's Office said in a Facebook post. Aztec Police got a call about the shooting about 8 a.m., officials said, and students were in class at the time.

A GoFundMe account has also been set up for his the family of Francisco “Paco” Fernandez. Police have not released the shooter’s identity, but they say he is a man. They would not confirm whether or not he was a student or if there was a motive. Aztec Police say they got to the school quickly after getting 911 calls just after 8 a.m. Deputies and Lt. Kyle Lincoln from the San Juan County Sheriff Department then helped clear the building and actively searched the school. San Juan County Sheriff’s Office then had parents of Aztec High School students pick up them up at Mcgee Park at noon. A former Aztec school board member who went by the scene shortly after it unfolded and said this is absolutely unheard of in their small community. “Tragically the horrors that visited many other communities have come to roost here in Aztec,” Michael Padilla said. He also called the scene chaotic, saying there was a massive law enforcement presence. News 13 spoke to one student who says she listened to the sound of gunshots that got closer and closer to her classroom. “I was in the classroom and we heard…We heard shots and it wasn’t very close and then it stopped for a little bit. Then we heard shots again and it was really close. And we were sitting in a corner up against a wall and I could like feel it vibrating… and then it stopped,” said student Briley Dills. She said when it was finally safe to leave the room, someone was dead on the ground right outside her classroom. She said she tried to avoid looking closely. Later, the Governor spoke to the bravery of people responding at a news conference. “There were several acts of bravery by staff members, teachers and students that were amazing… that actually saved lives,” Governor Martinez said. The Governor also mentioned the Public Education Department will be making 120,000 available to help with response in coming days for counselors and security. There is no school at Aztec High Friday.

New Mexico State Police Chief Pete Kassetas said there were no other injuries reported.

A law enforcement officer can be heard saying, \\"I think officers were shooting out the windows to get inside\\" as alarms are going off in the background. \\"Our friends and neighbors of Aztec have witnessed a very heinous and horrific act,\\" Gov. Susana Martinez said. \\"There are two children who have been killed, and I cannot imagine a greater pain than to lose your child, particularly in such a senseless way.\\" State Police officials say there were no credible threats to other nearby schools.

It took some time to figure out what exactly was happening. One student, freshman Heaven Hughes, didn't think it was real at first. \\"All of a sudden I hear gunshots, and you think it's fake, you know,\\" she said. \\"And I kind of looked back at my teacher. And as soon as you hear the second gunshot, it shoots through my classroom and busts through the window, through the wall. And my teacher tells us to get down, and all the students go to the back of the room And I get under my desk. And I'm just so shocked this is happening.\\" One student at the high school said everything happened incredibly quickly. \\"At one point I heard people,\\" sophomore Damian Greenleaf said. \\"It sounded like they were running down the hall or they were getting really close to the classroom.\\" Parents were able to pick up their children at McGee Park between Bloomfield and Farmington. Parents needed to have an ID to pick up their children. Both the girls and boys basketball teams at Aztec High had games scheduled for Thursday; school officials and coaches tell KOB those games will not be played. \\"It's in times like this that you feel violated because of the way schools are set up,\\" said Kirk Carpenter, superintendent at Aztec Municipal Schools. \\"Those are places where we send our kids to be safe.

In 2014, two students were injured in a shooting at Berrendo Middle School in Roswell. This year, Santa Fe High School had its own close call after police said a teen formatted a detailed plot for a shooting. Police initially apprehended three teens, but charges were dropped against two of them. Back in Aztec, the American Red Cross of New Mexico provided aid to those impacted by the shooting. They served more than 3,000 meals to students, faculty, staff, first responders and parents. They also provided a family reunification center to help the community. \\"Our hearts go out to everyone affected by today's event,\\" spokesperson Doug Keaty said. The New Mexico Department of Health sent a school health advocate to the operations center to offer services to students and staff. Second Chance Counseling in Farmington will also be open from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. Friday for free crisis debriefing. Their address is 216 E. Apache St., and their phone number is (505) 427-1621. A candlelight vigil was held 6 p.m. at Minium Park to honor the victims. Aztec Mayor Sally Burbridge said grief counselors will be in attendance. \\"Right now, we need to keep each other in our hearts and thoughts, and take care of each other,” she said. \\"What we should do together is unite as a community, share our love and friendship for our neighbors, for the children, the children of Aztec High School as well as the children in the community overall at other schools as well as the community as a whole,\\" Martinez added. Other elected, law enforcement and education officials have already weighed in on the tragedy. \\"Our hearts break for the victims and their families.

Ben Ray Lujan, D-N.M. ___ \\"My heart hurts immensely for not only the families of the students who were taken too early from this earth, but for all students and community members affected by yesterday’s senseless and tragic shooting. Many have asked, what can be done to stop situations like this. Now, news reports state the shooter had been previously noticed by the FBI. We need to know what can be done in situations like this, so if it’s not the FBI’s responsibility then some other authority is tasked with trying to help. Many have discussed that mental health is often a factor in these crimes. Let’s put credible and helpful policies in place to deal with this. Therefore, I call on the FBI to release all details on the shooter as soon as possible understanding there is an active investigation going on, so we can examine further what changes need to be made so individuals in need of help can be identified and assisted.\\" -- U.S. Rep.

This is a parent’s biggest nightmare--every child deserves to be safe at school. I want to thank and commend our local law enforcement officers, emergency first responders, teachers and staff who took immediate action to protect and aid those who were hurt. But Aztec now joins a list of communities touched by school shootings and gun violence that is far too long. We should all do what we can to support this great community in the days ahead. But we should also do more than that. \\"While at this moment, it is too early for me to know the specific circumstances of this violent act, what is clear is that we have an epidemic of gun violence in this country that has touched far too many of us. All of us should feel an urgency to take concrete action to address this disease. I can promise you that I refuse to give in to the feeling of helplessness that too often follows these events. No matter the odds, I will continue to seek common ground with my colleagues in order to keep firearms out of the hands of those who would turn them on our families, friends and neighbors.\\" -- U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich, D-N.M. ___ \\"Words can't express the sadness and shock we all feel at news of another school shooting in our own backyard. My thoughts are with the students and faculty at Aztec High School along with their families, the first responders on the scene, and the community at large. All of New Mexico stands with the Aztec community as they begin to heal. \\"All of us are asking why and how this senseless tragedy happened, and we know that answers will emerge over the course of the investigation. But we can't ignore one truth: gun violence is not inevitable. We owe it to our children and our communities to come together and take sensible actions to stop it from happening.\\" -- Sen. Tom Udall, D-N.M. ___ \\"Our deepest sympathies and prayers go out to the victims and their families of the senseless crime that took place in Aztec, NM today.\\" -- U.S. Marshal Conrad Candelaria ___ \\"Every day in New Mexico, and across our country, students come to school with the expectation to learn, and educators come to school with the desire to teach. Parents trust that after they drop off their children at the bus stop or at their school that they are safe until the dismissal bell rings. Educators have students’ learning at the forefront every day, and we deeply believe that schools are the heart of our communities. \\"No student, parent, or educator should ever fear that attending school, or visiting a place of learning would result in violence, injury, or death. Yet, our students, educators, and schools are the victims, once again, of senseless acts of violence, this time, and sadly again, in our own backyard. \\"Our thoughts and prayers are with every New Mexican touched by this violence, but we also recognize those actions, while genuine, aren’t enough. We must push to enact laws that decrease gun violence in our State and country. We must recognize that when adults fail to act in the best interests of our students – our children – they will inevitably continue to be victims. We are morally obligated to ensure our children do not grow up in a society where school-based gun violence is the new normal in America.\\" -- Stephanie Ly, American Federation of Teachers New Mexico ___ \\"We grieve with our NEA-New Mexico family for the students, staff and families of Aztec High School. Tragically, once again we are heartbroken to learn about another senseless shooting in our nation's schools. We extend our sympathies to those affected and vow to work together to forge alliances with families and communities to keep our public schools safe, secure, and welcome to everyone.\\" Lily Eskelsen García, National Education Association-New Mexico president ___ \\"Our elected leaders have consistently done nothing to address the gun violence epidemic in this country, and it has hit close to home once again as a result. Today my thoughts are with the victims, the first responders, and their families as they grapple with this evil act.\\" -- Maggie Toulouse Oliver, New Mexico secretary of state KOB has been told multiple prayer vigils are scheduled for later in the day Thursday.

His work as co-editor on the comics magazines Arcade and Raw has been influential, and from 1992 he spent a decade as contributing artist for The New Yorker, where he made several high-profile and sometimes controversial covers. He is married to designer and editor Spiegelman was born Itzhak Avraham ben Zeev in Stockholm, Sweden, on February 15, 1948. He immigrated with his parents to the US in 1951. Upon immigration his name was registered as Arthur Isadore, but he later had his given name changed to Art. Initially the family settled in Norristown, Pennsylvania, and then relocated to Rego Park in Queens, New York City, in 1957. He began cartooning in 1960 and imitated the style of his favorite comic books, such as Mad. At Russell Sage Junior High School, where he was an honors student, he produced the Mad-inspired fanzine Blase. He was earning money from his drawing by the time he reached high school and sold artwork to the original Long Island Press and other outlets. His talent was such that he caught the eyes of United Features Syndicate, who offered him the chance to produce a syndicated comic strip. Dedicated to the idea of art as expression, he turned down this commercial opportunity. He attended the High School of Art and Design in Manhattan beginning in 1963. He met Woody Gelman, the art director of Topps Chewing Gum Company, who encouraged Spiegelman to apply to Topps after graduating high school. At 15 Spiegelman received payment for his work from a Rego Park newspaper. After his graduation in 1965, Spiegelman's parents urged him to pursue the financial security of a career such as dentistry, but he chose instead to enroll at Harpur College to study art and philosophy. While there, he got a freelance art job at Topps, which provided him with an income for the next two decades. Spiegelman attended Harpur College from 1965 until 1968, where he worked as staff cartoonist for the college newspaper and edited a college humor magazine. After a summer internship when he was 18, Topps hired him for Gelman's Product Development Department as a creative consultant making trading cards and related products in 1966, such as the Wacky Packages series of parodic trading cards begun in 1967. Spiegelman began selling self-published underground comix on street corners in 1966. He had cartoons published in underground publications such as the East Village Other and traveled to San Francisco for a few months in 1967, where the underground comix scene was just beginning to burgeon. In late winter 1968 Spiegelman suffered a brief but intense nervous breakdown, which cut his university studies short. He has said that at the time he was taking LSD with great frequency. He spent a month in Binghamton State Mental Hospital, and shortly after he got out his mother committed suicide following the death of her only surviving brother.

There are lots of ways to reduce our use of resources. Buy durable goods. Choose items that are well made so they will last longer.

Would patient B produce more or less insulin than patient A? Rob is studying medicine in a prestigious university. Today, his professor is teaching about blood glucose levels. He gave example of two patients, patient A and patient B. Patient A had high blood glucose level, but patient B had low blood glucose level. Rob was amazed to find how body keeps its balance. Hint: Another example of negative feedback has to do with blood glucose levels. When glucose (sugar) levels in the blood are too high, the pancreas secretes insulin to stimulate the absorption of glucose and the conversion of glucose into glycogen, which is stored in the liver. As blood glucose levels decrease, less insulin is produced. When glucose levels are too low, another hormone called glucagon is produced, which causes the liver to convert glycogen back to glucose. The answer is:","response":"To answer the question, let's review the information given: 1. Patient A has a high blood glucose level. 2. Patient B has a low blood glucose level. 3. When blood glucose levels are high, the pancreas secretes insulin. 4. When blood glucose levels are low, less insulin is produced, and glucagon is produced instead. Based on this information, Patient A has a high blood glucose level and therefore the pancreas would secrete insulin to lower it. Patient B has a low blood glucose level, so less insulin would be produced for them.

Scottie watches Sesame Street on TV as Brad adjusts the TV antenna on the roof, when the show is suddenly replaced by white noise; suddenly, a San Francisco news anchor appears onscreen, saying they have lost their New York signal and there were explosions of \\"nuclear devices there in New York, and up and down the East Coast.\\" The anchorman is cut off by the Emergency Broadcast System tone with the Civil Defense Insignia being shown on the Screen, then an announcer's voice states that the White House is interrupting the program: \\"Please stand by for the President and do not use the telephone.\\" At the introduction of the President of the United States (who is never seen; only the Presidential Seal is shown on the TV), the phone rings but it goes dead along with the TV and electricity just as Carol answers it. Suddenly, the blinding flash of a nuclear detonation is then seen through the window. The family huddles on the floor in panic as the town's air-raid sirens go off; minutes later, several of their neighbors are running around on the street outside, dazed in fear and confusion. The family hopes Tom will return, but the circumstances are hard to ignore. The suburb of Hamelin survives relatively unscathed, because apparently the town is far enough from San Francisco to avoid blast damage. Frightened residents meet at the home of Henry Abhart (Leon Ames), an elderly ham radio operator. He has made contact with survivors in rural areas and internationally, and tells Carol that he was unable to reach anyone east of Keokuk, Iowa; a...

Humphrey Metrodome for a Week 12 fight with the Minnesota Vikings. This game was noted for the return of head coach Green to Minnesota where he coached from 1992 to 2001. On the very first play of the first quarter, RB J.J. Arrington returned a kickoff 99 yards for a touchdown. The Vikings would respond with RB Chester Taylor's 1-yard TD run. In the second quarter, Cards kicker Neil Rackers gave Arizona a 21-yard and a 50-yard field goal for a decent lead. However, the Vikes took the lead with QB Brad Johnson's 17-yard TD pass to WR Marcus Robinson. In the third quarter, more of the Cardinals' year-long ineffectiveness showed as Johnson completed a 9-yard TD pass to WR Billy McMullen, while kicker Ryan Longwell nailed a 40-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter, Minnesota improved its lead on Johnson's 3-yard TD pass to FB Jeff Dugan. Afterwards, Arizona tried to fight back as Strong Safety Adrian Wilson returned a fumble 99 yards for a touchdown, yet it was followed up by a failed two-point conversion. Afterwards, QB Matt Leinart completed a 9-yard TD pass to WR Anquan Boldin. Afterwards, the Vikings wrapped up the game and won. With the loss, the Cardinals fell to 2-9.

Pick from: i. yes; ii. it is not possible to tell; iii. no;","response":"iii. no; Based on the premise provided, the hypothesis \\"Key decision makers are not important to decide things\\" is not true. The premise suggests that the origin of a service, whether from primary care or the emergency department, is less significant compared to the evaluation and acceptance by key decision-makers. In this context, the key decision-makers are vital in determining whether a service becomes part of standard practice or not. The premise highlights the importance of evaluation and the satisfaction of key decision-makers before a service is implemented into mainstream practice. It acknowledges that their consent and approval is crucial in validating the relevance and applicability of a service in the healthcare environment. Key decision-makers could include medical professionals, healthcare administrators, policymakers, and other stakeholders who influence decision-making in a medical practice. Their expertise is vital in assessing the utility, safety, and overall effectiveness of a new service or adaptation of an existing one. Without their approval, the service may face significant barriers in implementation and its potential benefits may remain unrealized. Thus, the hypothesis \\"Key decision makers are not important to decide things\\" is not true.

What are the health effects, if any, of honey and lemon water? Do those questions have the same meaning?","response":"1) Drinking water in a sitting position: Imagine you're using a very long straw when you're drinking. When you sit down, the straw is straight, so the water can easily move through it. Sitting down helps your body and the pipe-like straw (called your esophagus) stay in a straight and relaxed position, so the water can easily travel to your tummy. This way, your body can easily absorb the water, and it's also gentle on your tummy. 2) Health effects of honey and lemon water: Honey and lemon water is like a tasty medicine. When you mix sweet honey and sour lemon in water, it creates a yummy drink that's good for you! Honey gives you energy and helps to keep germs away, while lemon has vitamin C, which helps to keep you strong and healthy. Drinking this tasty mix can make you feel better when you have a cold or a sore throat because it's warm and soothing. 3) Are the questions the same? No, sweetheart, those questions are not the same. The first question is about the best way to drink water, while the second question is about a yummy drink made of honey, lemon, and water, and how it can help our health."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you're given a four sentences of story written in natural language.

The force a magnet exerts is a little different from the forces you may normally think about. You exert a force on a book when you lift it. You also exert a force on the pedals of your bicycle. In both those cases, those forces cause a change. The change you see in both these cases is called motion. Magnets, too, can produce change. They can produce motion just like you do. Unlike you, magnets do not have to touch something to exert a force. A magnetic force is exerted over a distance. Thats right, a magnet can push or pull certain items without ever touching them. Thats how the maglev train works. Do you know another type of force that does not require objects to touch? These forces are known as non-contact forces. Another type of non-contact force you may be familiar with is gravity. Gravity too can cause changes in motion. Gravity holds our moon in orbit without touching it.

The container of which gas will have lower pressure inside it? Nicholas works in pest control, and needs to have a steady supply of nitrogen gas for his tools. He always keeps a closed container of nitrogen gas in his freezer, where the temperature is very low. Nicholas's neighbor, Justin, likes to grill in his backyard. Justin, therefore, always keeps a closed container of propane gas outside, where the temperature is high. Hint: Shown in the Figure below is a cylinder of gas on the left that is at room temperature (300 K). On the right, the cylinder has been heated until the Kelvin temperature has doubled to 600 K. The kinetic energy of the gas molecules increases, so collisions with the walls of the container are now more forceful than they were before. As a result, the pressure of the gas doubles. Decreasing the temperature would have the opposite effect, and the pressure of an enclosed gas would decrease. A:","response":"According to the given information and hint, the container with a lower pressure inside it will be the one that has its gas at a lower temperature. In this case, Nicholas keeps his closed container of nitrogen gas in the freezer, where the temperature is very low, while Justin keeps his closed container of propane gas outside, where the temperature is high. The pressure change in a container holding a gas is related to the temperature change via the ideal gas law, which is expressed as: PV = nRT Where: - P is the pressure of the gas - V is the volume of the container - n is the amount of gas (in moles) - R is the ideal gas constant (8.314 J/mol K) - T is the temperature of the gas (in Kelvin) When the temperature of a gas in a closed container decreases, like that of the nitrogen gas in the freezer, the pressure of the gas also decreases. This is because the kinetic energy of the gas molecules is reduced, causing them to exert less force during collisions with the walls of the container. In contrast, when the temperature increases, as in the case of the propane gas container outside, the kinetic energy of the gas molecules increases, leading to more forceful collisions and increased pressure. Given that Nicholas's container of nitrogen gas is kept in the freezer at a low temperature and Justin's container of propane gas is kept outside at a relatively higher temperature, the container of nitrogen gas will have a lower pressure inside it compared to the container of propane gas."},{"question":"Le secrétariat présentera les grandes lignes de l’ordre du jour et une liste des documents à soumettre à la deuxième réunion ordinaire des Parties (MP.PP/WG.1/2004/7).

The finding comes weeks after leading scientists reported children born to men over the age of 45 run a higher risk of having autism and mental disorders. With age, sperm -producing cells do not copy a man's DNA as effectively, leading to genetic mutations. Martin Fielder, an anthropologist at Vienna University, told the Sunday Times: 'Every 16 years the mutation rate doubles. Other researchers found 25 mutations per sperm in a 20-year-old, but at age 40 it is 65 mutations. By 56, it doubles again. The effect is very visible - someone born to a father of 22 is already 5-10 per cent more attractive than those with a 40-year-old father and the difference grows with the age gap. In contrast, women pass on a maximum of 15 mutations to their baby, regardless of age, according to the study published in the journal Nature. Surveying a group of six men and six women, researchers showed them each 4,018 photographs of 18-20-year-old men and 4,416 of women the same age, and asked to assess their attractiveness. Those with older fathers were consistently considered less attractive. However, the children of older men, though less attractive, are likely to outlive their peers with younger fathers, it is claimed. Professor Lee Smith, a geneticist at Edinburgh University, told the Sunday Times other research found such children have longer telomeres - the caps on the end of chromosomes --- which are associated with longer life. But the mounting research connecting parents' age with autism is cause for concern, experts warn. Autism is an umbrella term for a range of developmental disorders that have a lifelong effect on someone's ability to interact socially and communicate openly. In the UK, around one in 100 adults is thought to be affected by autism, mostly men, caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Researchers said men should be advised about the potential problems in order to help their personal... From the passage, we know that _ . A) Genetic mutations are caused by old age and physical disorders B) When a man becomes older, sperm-producing cells copy his DNA less effectively C) One of the advantages older fathers have is that their children can live a longer life D) Researchers advise men to avoid having fathering children at older ages.

The premise: \\"Now what's biting you?\\" In this statement, the speaker uses the phrase \\"biting you\\" to ask the listener about their concerns or issues in a metaphorical manner. The term \\"biting\\" is often used to express annoyance or irritation. Therefore, the overall meaning of the premise is to ask the person what is bothering or causing discomfort to them at that moment. The hypothesis: \\"Now what's bothering you?\\" This statement has a similar intention as the premise. The speaker asks about the listener's concerns or issues but uses the word \\"bothering\\" instead of the metaphorical \\"biting\\". Both the hypothesis and premise have the same goal: to inquire about the person's current concerns or irritations. Now let us consider the options: a) Yes: Choosing this option would mean that if the premise is true, the hypothesis would also be true. Since both the premise and the hypothesis have the same intention and meaning, it is possible that when one holds true, the other also holds true. Both are inquiries into the person's concerns, and stating one does not contradict the other. b) It is not possible to tell: Selecting this option would indicate that there is not enough information to determine the truth of the hypothesis based on the premise. However, as we have analyzed the meaning and intention of both statements, they seemed to closely align in meaning and purpose. c) No: Choosing this as an answer would mean that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is not true. However, this doesn't seem applicable in our case, as both statements have the same meaning and intention. Based on the analysis and comparison of the premise and hypothesis, it is reasonable to conclude that: If the premise is true: \\"Now what's biting you?\\" Then it is possible that the hypothesis is also true: \\"Now what's bothering you?\\" Hence, the answer to the question is a) yes."},{"question":"Leider hat sich der Wind nicht rechtzeitig zurueck gemeldet und der Event wurde mit dem Ergebnis aus der Single Elimination beendet, es sind jedoch ein paar heftige parties gefeiert worden,wooooo,........

This detail plays a crucial role in the unfolding events of the film \\"Eagle Eye.\\""},{"question":"Article: Concrete is mixed by adding together Portland cement, sand, and coarse aggregate (gravel) together in a ratio of 1:2:4. Water is added to the dry mixture to bind all the components together. In a concrete mixer, add the determined amount of water and then the concrete mix. You can also mix this in a wheelbarrow with a shovel. Use as little water as possible. Water makes the concrete more maneuverable but it also weakens the constitution of the final product. A drier mix makes the concrete more crack resistant. Turn on the machine. The mix will become smooth and consistent. Shut off the machine. You can sometimes get a truck to pour concrete straight into your form; otherwise, load it into wheelbarrows and tilt them into the form until the high point is reached. While doing this, enlist some helpers to spread out the concrete with shovels, rakes and \\"come alongs,\\" which is a special concrete rake. Starting at the uphill point, use a screeding tool to flatten out the wet concrete. Screeding involves jiggling a wide plank of wood back and forth, if possible immediately over the forms, to create a flat surface. Work your way from top to bottom, gently screeding until you have a flat surface. Your concrete surface won't be finished yet, but it will begin to look more complete and professional looking at this point. At this point, you should move fairly quickly as the concrete will set fast. Your floating process will contain two steps: Use a large floating device, also known as a bull float, to press down aggregate and help the cream (gravel-free concrete) rise to the surface. Do this by moving the bull float away from you, keeping the tailing edge slightly elevated, and then moving the bull float back towards you, keeping the leading edge slightly elevated. Use a magnesium hand float to go over the surface. After some of the water bleeds to the surface, use long sweeping motions with your hand float. Line up a plank as a straight edge to make periodic joints in the concrete. These joints will help the concrete withstand cracking due to temperature changes. Cut the joints about a quarter of the thickness of the concrete. Use a broom to sweep across the surface, creating designs. This will provide traction on the concrete so it is not as slippery when wet. A soft brush can also be used for a different texture that is less rough. For a smoother surface, but one that still has a pattern to it, you can use the trowel and slide it over the surface in a circular motion. Make sure the grooves are not so deep that water stands on the surface. Standing water will compromise the integrity of the concrete. If moving the broom over the concrete causes clumps of concrete to aggregate on your broom, it's too early to broom. Move over the concrete again with the magnesium floater to smooth out the pattern left by the broom, then try again later. Concrete should be left to cure for 28 days, with the initial day being the most critical. As soon as the concrete has been poured, professionals usually recommend sealing the concrete. The sealant will help the concrete cure, as well as prevent cracks and discoloration. Although concrete is often thought of an a no-hassle surface, it benefits from regular maintenance. Regular soap and water maintenance will help keep the concrete looking its best, while occasional seals (~ every five years) can help keep the concrete from getting damaged through use. What is a summary of what this article is about?","response":"This article is about how to mix and use concrete. It talks about the ingredients needed to make concrete, such as Portland cement, sand, and gravel, and how to mix them with water. It also explains how to pour and spread the concrete, how to make it smooth and even, and how to add texture to it for safety and a nice look. Finally, the article tells us that concrete needs to be taken care of, like sealing it after it's poured and cleaning it regularly with soap and water."},{"question":"Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

Premise: \\"Two men work together on a construction project.\\" Hypothesis: \\"Two men are in an elevator.\\" Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise? Options: - yes - it is not possible to tell - no Answer. no What step-by-step reasoning justifies that answer?","response":"Answer: no Step-by-step reasoning: 1. We start by analyzing the premise: \\"Two men work together on a construction project.\\" This tells us that the two men are involved in a construction-related task and are cooperating in this situation. 2. Next, we examine the hypothesis: \\"Two men are in an elevator.\\" This statement implies that the two men are inside an elevator, potentially either as a part of the construction project or unrelated to it. 3. Now, we need to compare the premise and the hypothesis to determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. To do this, we check if the information provided in the premise necessarily leads to the conclusion stated in the hypothesis. 4. We see that the premise presents the information that the two men are working on a construction project, but it does not specifically mention that they are in an elevator at any point within the context of the project. 5. Since the premise does not provide any details about the two men being in an elevator, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. Based on this step-by-step reasoning, the answer is \\"no,\\" as the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."},{"question":"Does the sentence \\"Although Israel supports the goals of the International Criminal Court, it has not ratified the Rome Statute, citing concerns about the ability of the court to remain free from political impartiality.\\" answer the question \\"What kind of court system does Israel have?\\" Select from: a). yes b). no","response":"b). No The sentence provided does not answer the question \\"What kind of court system does Israel have?\\" because it only mentions Israel's stance on the International Criminal Court and the Rome Statute, without providing any information about Israel's own domestic court system. To answer the question, we need to delve into the structure and composition of the Israeli court system. Israel has a mixed legal system that consists of common law, civil law, and Jewish law elements. The Israeli courts are divided into several categories, including: 1. Supreme Court: The highest appellate court in Israel, located in Jerusalem. The Supreme Court hears cases regarding legislation, civil and criminal matters, and serves as the High Court of Justice when dealing with issues such as fundamental rights, government actions, and other public issues. It is characterized by judicial review and interpretation of existing laws. 2. District Courts: There are six District Courts in Israel, which serve as courts of first instance for certain types of cases and an appellate court for decisions from the Magistrate Courts. District Courts handle civil, criminal, and administrative cases, as well as certain matters involving company law and intellectual property. 3. Magistrate Courts: These are the lowest level of courts in Israel and handle most of the criminal and civil cases that come before the judiciary. Magistrate Courts deal with various matters, including misdemeanors, minor offenses, small claims, and family disputes. 4. Labor Courts: Labor Courts specialize in labor and employment disputes, dealing with issues such as wages, employment contracts, and working conditions. 5. Religious Courts: These courts deal with personal status issues such as marriage, divorce, and inheritance for the different religious communities in Israel. Religious courts include Jewish Rabbinical Courts, Islamic Sharia Courts, Druze Religious Courts, and Christian Courts of various denominations. 6. Military Courts: These courts deal with discipline, offenses, and crimes committed by members of the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF). 7. Special Courts and Tribunals: Israel has established a number of special courts and tribunals to handle specific types of cases, such as traffic courts for motor vehicle offenses and juvenile courts for cases involving minors. In conclusion, the Israeli court system includes various types of courts to address different legal matters. The sentence provided about the International Criminal Court and the Rome Statute does not offer any information about Israel's domestic court system, thereby not answering the original question."},{"question":"Answer the following question: What type of details about isaac singer can be gathered from the following bio?

He first picks up some frozen pizzas, his favorite meal when he is feeling lazy after work, and then stops off to pick up a loaf of bread. He then walks over to the dairy section to pick up some cheese for his lunches. Jimmy never buys milk, but today he has a sudden urge to get some. He walks over to the milk refrigerators and looks at all the options. He is currently debating between two brands, Luchene and Jean's. While trying to decide, he notices a sticker on the Luchene gallon that says \\"organic,\\" but is unable to find any such indication on the gallon of Jean's milk. After asking an employee, it is confirmed that Jean's is not organic milk. Unable to make up his mind, Jimmy simply leaves without buying any milk. and a hint : Compared to conventional milk production, organic milk production tends to have lower eutrophication potential per ton of milk or per hectare of farmland, because it potentially reduces leaching of nitrates (NO3−) and phosphates (PO4−) due to lower fertilizer application rates. Because organic milk production reduces pesticides utilization, it increases land use per ton of milk due to decreased crop yields per hectare. Mainly due to the lower level of concentrates given to cows in organic herds, organic dairy farms generally produce less milk per cow than conventional dairy farms. Because of the increased use of roughage and the, on-average, lower milk production level per cow, some research has connected organic milk production with increases in the emission of methane.Animal welfare issues vary among dairy farms and are not necessarily related to the way of producing milk (organically or conventionally). Please answer this question : Which brand requires more cows to produce the same amount of milk? The answer to this question is:","response":"The organic milk brand, Luchene, requires more cows to produce the same amount of milk as compared to the conventional milk brand, Jean's. This is because organic dairy farms generally produce less milk per cow than conventional dairy farms due to the lower level of concentrates given to cows in organic herds and the increased use of roughage."},{"question":"(I).

Step 2: Compare the hypothesis to the premise The hypothesis is \\"Economists all agree that private savings is a serious problem.\\" This suggests a universal agreement among economists that low private savings are a significant issue. Step 3: Evaluate the hypothesis based on the premise By comparing the hypothesis to the premise, we find that the two statements conflict – the premise states that economists do not have consensus on the issue, while the hypothesis says they all agree it is a problem. Step 4: Conclusion Given the information provided in the premise, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis \\"Economists all agree that private savings is a serious problem.\\" is true.

I even ‘came out’ to her at one point. We spent a lot of time together and gradually, I thought I might not be gay after all, as I had feelings of love for her. Eventually, we started dating and I tried to suppress my gay feelings. Eventually, I proposed. We were engaged for just over a year and I got married at the age of 19. I have to admit, when the wedding plans got firmed up and much closer to the date, I started to feel that I was in fact still gay but so much money had already been spent, and plans made that I was too afraid to pull out. Don’t get me wrong, I still love my ex wife a heck of a lot, but as my very best friend. I hate to use the phrase, but with everything that has gone on with me the last few years, she has been ‘my rock’. We separated after about 8 years, when our daughter was 7 years old, and I told her why. I just couldn’t go on living the lie. I hate myself for doing it to her.

To ensure that the police would not interfere in the regular competencies of the courts of law, some police acts require that the police may only interfere in such cases where protection from courts cannot be obtained in time, and where, without interference of the police, the realization of the private right would be impeded.

Second question: How long does an IAS officer serves as DM? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","response":"Hello! I will help you understand these questions, just like I'm explaining to a five-year-old. First question: \\"Is IAS above the level of DM just a glorified clerk to a politician?\\" IAS stands for Indian Administrative Service, and DM means District Magistrate.

They have many more responsibilities, like taking care of the community's needs and solving problems. Second question: \\"How long does an IAS officer serves as DM?\\" An IAS officer, who is like a big helper, can be a DM, or District Magistrate, for different amounts of time. Sometimes, they are DM for few years, and sometimes for a little longer. It depends on how good they are at their job and whether they need to move to a different job to help more people.

They were both from the House of Trastámara and were second cousins, being both descended from John I of Castile; on marriage they were given a papal dispensation to deal with consanguinity by Sixtus IV. They married on October 19, 1469, in the city of Valladolid; Isabella was eighteen years old and Ferdinand a year younger; this marriage united both kingdoms under one crown. It is generally accepted by most scholars (John Elliott being an English-speaking example) that the unification of Spain can essentially be traced back to the marriage of Ferdinand and Isabella. Some newer historical opinions propose that under their rule, what later became Spain was still a union of two crowns rather than a unitary state, as to a large degree Castile and Aragon remained separate kingdoms, with most of their own separate institutions, for decades to come. The court of Ferdinand and Isabella was constantly on the move, in order to bolster local support for the crown from local feudal lords. - The New World is one of the names used for the Earth's Western Hemisphere, specifically the Americas (including nearby islands such as those of the Caribbean and Bermuda). - Genoese (\\"Zeneize\\") is a dialect of the Ligurian language spoken in Genoa (the principal city of the Liguria region in Northern Italy). - Bartholomew Columbus (Genoese dialect: Bertomê Corombo; ) (c. 1461 1515) was an Italian explorer from Genoa and the younger brother of Christopher Columbus. - Christopher Columbus ( 20 May 1506) was an Italian explorer, navigator, colonizer, and citizen of the Republic of Genoa.

Introduce the film \\"Straight Story\\" and provide a general overview: In this review, I will be discussing David Lynch's masterpiece, \\"The Straight Story\\" (1999). Based on a true story, the film follows Alvin Straight, a 73-year-old man who embarks on a unique journey across America on his lawnmower to reconcile with his estranged, ailing brother. A powerful reminder of the bonds that hold families together, the film's straightforward narrative, heartfelt performances, and picturesque cinematography set it apart from other works in Lynch's oeuvre. 2. Analyze the film's storytelling style and how it serves the overall theme: \\"The Straight Story\\" deviates from the surreal, dreamlike style that David Lynch is famous for, opting instead for a linear, straightforward narrative. This grounded approach speaks volumes about the film's themes of love, life, and the importance of family. The simplicity of the story, devoid of Lynch's usual cryptic elements, conveys the film's core message without any distractions and enables viewers to connect with Alvin's emotional journey. 3. Assess the film's cinematography and visuals: The film's stunning cinematography explores through the vast, open landscapes of the American Midwest. The picturesque visuals serve as a constant reminder of the scope of Alvin's journey and convey a sense of timelessness as he travels through rural America. The minimalist compositions and natural lighting emphasize the raw beauty of the countryside, while also providing ample opportunity for contemplation and reflection. 4. Discuss the performances, particularly Richard Farnsworth as Alvin Straight: Richard Farnsworth's portrayal of Alvin Straight is deeply moving and unforgettable. Despite his age and the physical challenges his character faces, Farnsworth conveys a quiet determination and heartwarming spirit. His genuine, understated performance imbues the film with warmth, generating an emotional bond with the audience. Sissy Spacek's performance as Alvin's daughter Rose also provides an empathetic and endearing presence throughout the film. 5. Assess the film's pacing and overall structure: \\"The Straight Story\\" is a slow-burn journey, with much of the film's satisfaction found in the slow, meditative moments as Alvin encounters various characters along his journey. The unhurried pacing allows viewers to fully immerse themselves in each vignette and consider the wisdom and life experiences shared along the way. This leisurely pace also reflects the nature of Alvin's lawnmower journey, emphasizing the importance of cherishing the present moment. 6. Summarize the impact and lasting impression of the film: In conclusion, \\"The Straight Story\\" is a poignant and beautiful meditation on the meaning of family, forgiveness, and the inexorable passage of time. David Lynch's ability to strip down his usual style while retaining the emotional gravity and power of his storytelling is commendable, resulting in a work that stands as one of his most accessible and affecting films. The compelling performances by Richard Farnsworth and the supporting cast, coupled with the stunning visuals and contemplative pace, ensure \\"The Straight Story\\" remains a touching and timeless cinematic experience."},{"question":"he writes code with equal poetry, love and php, and he’s got the nicest handwriting in the office. Can you repeat this sentence, but capitalize it correctly?","response":"He writes code with equal poetry, love, and PHP, and he's got the nicest handwriting in the office."},{"question":"Summarize the following: Wait until the leaf buds begin to swell, then use a sturdy, sharp blade to ensure a clean cut. Prune by cutting at a 45-degree angle, just above an outer-facing growth bud. Growth buds are small raised or discolored triangular shaped areas on the rose stem. They are where the new stem will grow. Pruning above an outer-facing growth bud encourages the roses to grow outward, rather than inward, which can reduce air circulation and lessen the visual appeal of the bush. Avoid pruning your new rose for the first two years after you have planted it. Your rose bush will only need to be pruned after it has developed old growth or mature stems. If you wish to maintain the same size rose bush each year, trim back about ⅓ of the plant. If you want it smaller, trim more, and for a larger plant, trim less. Cut this back until you see a healthy white center to the stem. Your aim is to have a plant where growth is well spaced out to encourage the flow and circulation of air. Remove close growing stems and any that cross or are tangled. On older plants you can cut back any old wood growth that no longer produces any new stems. Summary:","response":"Wait until the small parts of the tree where new branches grow (we call these leaf buds) start to get bigger, then cut these using a sharp tool. Cut at a diagonal, or slanted, angle above a spot on the rose stem that's going to grow outwards. This helps the roses to grow outwards and not inwards, making the rose bush look nicer and healthier. Do not cut your new rose bush for the first two years after you've planted it. Only cut the rose bush once it has grown a lot. Depending on how big or small you want your rose bush to be, you should cut a little or a lot of it. Always cut until you see the inside of the stem is white and healthy. Your goal is to have a bush where branches are not too close to each other, this helps the air to move around the plant better. Also, remove branches that are too close or tangled with other branches. On older plants, you can cut branches that don't have new growth."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Long after its introduction into the New World, American English was still considered non-standard English. According to some people of the 1780s American English was a peasant's language that a \\"gentleman\\" will not speak.

British English is also encouraged and accepted as the criteria of some major official examinations, for example, College English Test and Test for English Majors which are conducted by government. Similar situations could be found in countries, for example, in Africa, the West African Examination Council and Joint Admission accepts the British English as the standard English. Report can also be found that inCairosome university students received lower grades if they used American spellings instead of British English. In Europe, we find teachers, British people as well as natives of the country in which they work, who follow the British English standard, and laugh at the American English.

Options： A. let down B. disappointment C. satisfaction D. gratitude E. illness","response":"The most suitable option to answer the given question is E. illness. The statement mentions that she felt like she was getting a cold, which signifies the possible onset of an illness. In the context provided, it is clear that the subject is not eagerly anticipating the experience of feeling unwell. A cold is a common viral infection that affects the respiratory system, causing symptoms such as a runny nose, sneezing, coughing, sore throat, and body aches. Option A, \\"let down,\\" conveys a sense of disappointment when expectations or hopes are not met. Although the idea of not looking forward to something could bear a similar sentiment, it does not directly connect with the feeling of getting a cold. Option B, \\"disappointment,\\" alludes to the emotion experienced when hopes or expectations are not fulfilled. Again, while the statement does convey that she is not looking forward to the experience, the specific focus is on her feeling of getting a cold, which aligns more closely with illness than disappointment. Option C, \\"satisfaction,\\" implies contentment as a result of attaining one's goals or meeting one's expectations. This option does not apply to the context provided, as the subject feels unwell and is not happy about the situation. Option D, \\"gratitude,\\" refers to the feeling of appreciation or thankfulness for something. In the context of the statement, the subject is not feeling gratitude, as she is not looking forward to the experience of getting a cold. Instead, her emotions are leaning more towards frustration or concern about her health. In conclusion, Option E, \\"illness,\\" is the most suitable option to answer the question. The statement describes the subject's physical state of likely getting a cold, indicating the onset of an illness, rather than referring to any emotional aspect such as disappointment, satisfaction, or gratitude."},{"question":"Q:What type of details about jalili fadili can be gathered from the following bio?

Instead, most of them use wood, coal or even animal waste to heat and cook in their homes ,which also gives off greenhouse gases, causing indoor air pollution that kills 1.6million people a year, most of whom are children and women. It's not expected to improve much, and in Africa it's becoming worse now. By 2030, when the Earth's population will be likely to top 8billion, 1.3 billion people will still lack electricity. Of those, 700 million will be in Africa, and 490 million in South Asia. Ghana, in West Africa, most of the northern half of the country lives without lights. As a result, three out of four Ghanans in the north are without electricity to refrigerate with and to cook with, to study with and to start businesses with.

In an outcome few could have imagined several weeks ago, Jones defeated controversial Republican candidate Roy Moore, who had the backing of President Donald Trump. In the wake of Jones' victory, Democrats are more confident about success in next year's congressional midterm elections, and Republicans are looking for a way to rebound. Late Tuesday, Jones paid tribute to the voters and staffers who supported him in his longshot victory over Moore. \\"This campaign has been about common courtesy and decency and making sure everyone in this state, regardless of which ZIP code you live in, is going to get a fair shake in life!\\" he told supporters. Moore was unable to overcome allegations of sexual misconduct stemming back decades involving several women who were teenagers at the time while Moore was in his 30s.

That is what we have got to do.\\" Moore had the full backing of the president in the final days of the campaign after Trump initially held back his endorsement in the wake of the allegations against Moore.

In some instances, The Powhatan, may refer to one of the leaders of the people. This is most commonly the case in historical writings by the English. The Powhatans have also been known as Virginia Algonquians, as the Powhatan language is an eastern-Algonquian language also known as Virginia Algonquian. Context: In November 1609, Captain John Ratcliffe was invited to Orapakes, Powhatan's new capital. After he had sailed up the Pamunkey River to trade there, a fight broke out between the colonists and the Powhatan. All of the English ashore were killed, including Ratcliffe, who was tortured by the women of the tribe. Those aboard the pinnace escaped and told the tale at Jamestown. During that next year, the tribe attacked and killed many Jamestown residents. The residents fought back, but only killed twenty. However, arrival at Jamestown of a new Governor, Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr, (Lord Delaware) in June 1610 signalled the beginning of the First Anglo-Powhatan War. A brief period of peace came only after the capture of Pocahontas, her baptism, and her marriage to tobacco planter John Rolfe in 1614. Within a few years both Powhatan and Pocahontas were dead. Powhatan died in Virginia, but Pocahontas died while in England. Meanwhile, the English settlers continued to encroach on Powhatan territory. After Wahunsunacawh's death, his younger brother, Opitchapam, briefly became chief, followed by their younger brother Opechancanough. In 1622 (Indian massacre of 1622) and 1644 he attacked the English to force them from Powhatan territories. Both these attempts were met with strong reprisals from the English, ultimately resulting in the near destruction of the tribe. The Second Anglo-Powhatan War that followed the 1644 incident ended in 1646, after Royal Governor of Virginia William Berkeley's forces captured Opechancanough, thought to be between 90 and 100 years old. While a prisoner, Opechancanough was killed, shot in the back by a soldier assigned to guard him. He was succeeded as Weroance by Necotowance, and later by Totopotomoi and by his daughter Cockacoeske. The Treaty of 1646 marked the effective dissolution of the united confederacy, as white colonists were granted an exclusive enclave between the York and Blackwater Rivers. This physically separated the Nansemonds, Weyanokes and Appomattox, who retreated southward, from the other Powhatan tribes then occupying the Middle Peninsula and Northern Neck. While the southern frontier demarcated in 1646 was respected for the remainder of the 17th century, the House of Burgesses lifted the northern one on September 1, 1649. Waves of new immigrants quickly flooded the peninsular region, then known as Chickacoan, and restricted the dwindling tribes to lesser tracts of land that became some of the earliest Indian reservations. In 1665, the House of Burgesses passed stringent laws requiring the Powhatan to accept chiefs appointed by the governor. After the Treaty of Albany in 1684, the Powhatan Confederacy all but vanished. Question: When was the treaty broken?. Whats the answer?","response":"The Treaty of 1646 marked the effective dissolution of the united Powhatan confederacy. However, there isn't a specific mention of the treaty being broken in the provided text. Instead, the information given suggests that there were ongoing encroachments on Powhatan territory, culminating in the near destruction of the tribe and its eventual dissolution.

Nicknamed \\"Big George\\", he is a two-time world heavyweight champion and an Olympic gold medalist. Outside the sport he is an ordained minister, author, and entrepreneur. After a troubled childhood Foreman took up amateur boxing and won a gold medal in the heavyweight division at the 1968 Summer Olympics. In 1987, after 10 years away from the ring, Foreman surprised the boxing world by announcing a comeback at the age of 38. In his autobiography, he wrote that his primary motive was to raise money to fund the youth center he had created, which had required much of the money he had earned in the initial phase of his career. Another stated ambition was to fight Mike Tyson. For his first fight, he went to Sacramento, California, where he beat journeyman Steve Zouski by a knockout in four rounds. Foreman weighed 267 lb (121 kg) for the fight and looked badly out of shape. Although many thought his decision to return to the ring was a mistake, Foreman countered that he had returned to prove that age was not a barrier to people achieving their goals (as he said later, he wanted to show that age 40 is not a \\"death sentence\\"). He won four more bouts that year, gradually slimming down and improving his fitness. In 1988, he won nine times. Perhaps his most notable win during this period was a seventh-round knockout of former Light Heavyweight and Cruiserweight Champion Dwight Muhammad Qawi. Having always been a deliberate fighter, Foreman had not lost much mobility in the ring since his first \\"retirement\\", although he found it harder to keep his balance after throwing big punches and could no longer throw rapid combinations. He was still capable of landing heavy single blows, however. The late-round fatigue that had plagued him in the ring as a young man now seemed to be unexpectedly gone, and he could comfortably compete for 12 rounds. Foreman attributed this to his new, relaxed fighting style (he has spoken of how, earlier in his career, his lack of stamina came from an enormous amount of nervous tension). By 1989, while continuing his comeback, Foreman had sold his name and face for the advertising of various products, selling everything from grills to mufflers on TV. For this purpose his public persona was reinvented, and the formerly aloof, ominous Foreman had been replaced by a smiling, friendly George. He and Ali had become friends, and he followed in Ali's footsteps by making himself a celebrity outside the boundaries of boxing. Foreman continued his string of victories, winning five more fights, the most impressive being a three-round win over Bert Cooper, who went on to contest the Undisputed Heavyweight title against Evander Holyfield.

The deaths of these two Founding Fathers and former presidents on the 50th anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration of Independence was seen as a remarkable coincidence and a historic event in the United States. Thomas Jefferson's and John Adams' lives were deeply intertwined in the history of the United States. While they had their differences and experienced phases of animosity, they both played crucial roles in the founding of the nation. Jefferson was the principal author of the Declaration of Independence and served as the third President of the United States from 1801 to 1809. Before that, he served as Vice President under John Adams, who was the second President of the United States from 1797 to 1801. Adams played a significant role in the negotiation of the Treaty of Paris, which ended the Revolutionary War, and was one of the drafter and signer of the Declaration of Independence. Jefferson and Adams had a falling out due to their differing political views in the early years of the republic, but they later reconciled and resumed their friendship, engaging in a rich correspondence for more than a decade. This correspondence touched upon various intellectual, philosophical, and political subjects and cemented their bond. Both men passed away on July 4th, 1826, the 50th anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration of Independence - an event that has been widely interpreted as a testament to their strong connection to the founding of the United States and the significance of their roles in shaping the country. In a poignant twist, John Adams' last words were reported to be \\"Thomas Jefferson still survives,\\" unaware that Jefferson had, in fact, passed away just hours earlier."},{"question":"Q:Article: HONG KONG -- Hong Kong Disneyland is too crowded, a senior Chinese tourism official said today, hinting that another Disney Park is necessary to accommodate demand from China's huge population. The comments by Shao Qiwei, director of China's State Administration of Tourism, came a day after Shanghai's mayor Han Zheng said the city was preparing to build China's second Disney theme park. \\"China has a very large population. We now have 1.3 billion people. The market is very large. As far as I know, Hong Kong Disneyland is now very crowded,\\" said Shao, whose comments were broadcast on Hong Kong's Cable TV. The Hong Kong theme park, which opened in September, was widely criticized in January when it turned away hundreds of Lunar New Year holiday makers from mainland China because the park was full. Chaos erupted when angry crowds tried to force their way into the park. The embarrassing incident prompted a public apology from Hong Kong Disneyland Managing Director Bill Ernest and a dressing down from Hong Kong's leader Donald Tsang. Authorities are carefully studying the issue of overcrowding in preparation for the possible building of the Disney park in Shanghai, Shao said. The official Xinhua News Agency reported Tuesday that no agreement has been reached on the park in Shanghai, quoting senior vice president of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, Leslie Goodman. Hong Kong Disneyland is a joint venture between The Walt Disney Co. and the local government, which shouldered the bulk of the park's construction fees.

Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? OPT: (A). no. (B). yes.","response":"The two questions are not paraphrases of each other, so the answer is: (A). No. I will provide answers to both questions: 1. How does the U.N. get funding? The United Nations gets funding from its member states through assessed contributions and voluntary contributions. Assessed contributions are mandatory payments made by member states, which are calculated based on each country's capacity to pay. This calculation is determined by factors such as a country's gross national income (GNI) and share of the world economy. The largest portion of assessed contributions goes toward the UN's peacekeeping efforts and the regular budget, which is used for day-to-day operations. Voluntary contributions come from member states, non-governmental organizations, and other private or public sources. These funds are directed towards specialized agencies, programs, or specific projects, and can vary greatly depending on the priorities of the contributor. 2. Is it true that the US is funding ISIS? It is not true that the US is intentionally funding ISIS. The United States has been actively engaged in countering the threat posed by ISIS and has provided military, financial, and humanitarian assistance to countries impacted by the group's activities. Additionally, the US-led international coalition has conducted airstrikes and provided training to local forces fighting against ISIS. However, it should be noted that in complex conflict situations, funds and weapons can sometimes unintentionally end up in the hands of undesirable or hostile groups, but this is not a direct indication that the US is intentionally funding ISIS."},{"question":"Is the following review positive or negative?

Jacob Wetterling Courtesy of National Center for Missing and Exploited Children Danny Heinrich, 53, was sentenced to 20 years in federal prison on child pornography charges — part of a plea deal made in exchange for admitting that he took Jacob’s life. In October, Heinrich confessed to the U.S. District Court in Minneapolis that he abducted Jacob and sexually molested him on Oct. 22, 1989. He admitted that he then shot the 11-year-old and buried his body in a gravel pit. Speaking at his sentencing hearing on Monday, Heinrich apologized to his victims and their loved ones, saying he kept silent for all these years to avoid bringing shame on himself and his family. Danny Heinrich: I am truly sorry for the pain I caused the victims and their families. — Susan-Elizabeth (@susanelizabethL) November 21, 2016 A grisly crime A masked gunman had abducted Jacob while he was riding bikes with his brother and a friend near his home in central Minnesota. Police repeatedly questioned Heinrich as a potential suspect in early in their investigation. But Heinrich maintained over the years he had no connection to Jacob's disappearance. Daniel Heinrich Sherburne County Sheriff's Office The case took a turn last year, when U.S. Attorney Andrew Luger unveiled new technology that matched Heinrich’s DNA to the kidnapping and sexual assault of yet another Minnesota boy back in January 1989. Police searched his home and found 19 three-ring binders full of child pornography, along with VHS tapes recorded by Heinrich himself. Heinrich pleaded guilty to one count of possessing child pornography. And while the statute of limitations on Jacob’s kidnapping and assault had long expired, prosecutors agreed to not charge him with murder as part of a plea deal requiring him to confess to killing Jacob and to take authorities to where he buried the boy's remains. After Jacob's disappearance, his family rose to prominence as national advocates for missing children. In 1994, Congress passed a law in Jacob’s name requiring states to build sex-offender registries. Wetterling's family appeared before the court on Monday to express their anguish and pain to the 11-year-old boy's confessed killer.

Anger. Fear. Sadness. Unwarranted guilt. They did it through tears and through quivering voices, finally confronting the man who had abducted, molested and killed an 11-year-old boy whom they dearly loved and greatly missed. Danny Heinrich was sentenced to 20 years in federal prison Monday after confessing weeks ago to the October 1989 abduction, assault and murder of Jacob Wetterling, an act so brazen and heartbreaking that it gripped a state and region for decades and changed the way parents watched over their children. But before Heinrich was escorted from the courtroom in Minneapolis to be sent off to federal prison, those closest to Jacob — his parents, siblings and best friend — recounted in detail how the heinous crime changed them forever. \\"I lived every day thinking I was the monster that night. I was the coward that left my friend. I was the coward that ran away,\\" said friend Aaron Larson, who rode bikes with Jacob and Jacob's brother, Trevor, to rent a movie in St. Joseph that night when Heinrich, wearing a mask and carrying a gun, jumped out of the darkness and ordered two of the boys to run off before snatching Jacob. For decades, Larson said, he couldn't handle his feelings. \\"I left the state. I left the country. I just wanted to be gone.\\" Jared Scheierl, holding the hand of his girlfriend Stacy Liestman, spoke shortly after addressing Danny Heinrich at the sentencing on Monday. Wetterling's tearful parents described how they were grateful for community support as their son's abduction tortured them, straining their relationship, curtailing Jerry's work as a chiropractor, and affecting their ability to be a mother and a father to their three other children. They endured absurd rumors and even suspicion. Amid recounting what they missed about Jacob — his hugs, his smile, his laughter, his jokes — Patty Wetterling addressed Heinrich directly: \\"You didn't need to kill him. He did nothing wrong. He just wanted to go home,\\" she said, her voice cracking. \\"You planned to hurt someone that night. You didn't just bring a gun to scare the boys. You brought bullets.\\" Jacob's sister Amy choked back tears as she described the family's anguish: \\"The worst part is that for nearly 27 years, [Heinrich] let us believe that we would some day be able to see Jacob again,\\" she said. \\"He watched us suffer through anniversary after anniversary.\\" Ends mystery Heinrich put an end to nearly three decades of mystery over what had happened to Jacob by confessing to the crime in court in September, days after he led authorities to a rural Paynesville, Minn., pasture where he had buried the boy. Federal prosecutors had cut a deal with Heinrich, who was awaiting trial on 25 counts of child pornography. Under terms of the agreement, Heinrich would plead guilty to one count of receiving child pornography and accept a 20-year prison sentence in exchange for providing answers and leading investigators to Wetterling's remains. Though he would not be prosecuted for Jacob's kidnapping and murder, Heinrich, after serving his prison sentence, could remain in state custody under Minnesota's civil sex offender commitment. The unusual deal was struck, officials said, with the approval of Patty and Jerry Wetterling, who have advocated nationally for missing and exploited children. Before U.S. District Judge John Tunheim formally handed down the sentence in federal court Monday, Heinrich, 53, made a brief, mumbling statement. \\"I'm truly sorry for my evil acts\\" he said, bowing his head and sighing repeatedly. \\"Many are probably wondering how I kept this secret so long. Well, to spare myself and the humiliation I would have brought to my family for my actions.\\" But Heinrich never explained why he did what he did. In reviewing evidence obtained after a search of Heinrich's home last summer, authorities found VHS tapes in which he had recorded news reports and anniversary specials about Jacob's disappearance. They also uncovered a deleted image of Jacob on Heinrich's computer. \\"Law enforcement found videotapes that included the anniversary specials and news specials of the Wetterlings looking at the camera and begging and pleading for some answers,\\" prosecutor Julie Allyn said. \\"So this defendant would have seen that, and he would have just turned off the TV and went about his life, and he did this year after year.\\" Heinrich also apologized for what he had done to another victim, 12-year-old Jared Scheierl, who he confessed to sexually assaulting nine months before he abducted Jacob. But Scheierl, now grown, wasn't in the courtroom to hear it. In a statement earlier at Monday's hearing, Scheierl had said he was grateful for the support he'd received to maintain a normal life. Heinrich's words on the night of his abduction \\"haunted me for years and I don't choose to hear anything he wishes to say at this time,\\" Scheierl said, turning his head briefly and looking at Heinrich. Alison Feigh, child safety specialist at the Jacob Wetterling foundation and a former classmate of Jacob's, and Jane Straub, also with the Wetterling Resource Center, walked into the Federal Courthouse for Monday's sentencing of Danny Heinrich. Addressing Heinrich, Tunheim described the sentence as \\"the most severe punishment that is available to me.\\" He acknowledged that Monday's hearing was not about the child pornography case. \\"It's about taking a childhood away from Jared Scheierl and taking a lifetime away from Jacob Wetterling,\\" Tunheim said. \\"And it is also about changing the lives of so many children and parents who prayed for Jacob's return and lived in the fear that someone like you, someone evil, would come out of the darkness, out of the woods, out of the bushes, from around the corner, abuse them and take them away, never to be seen again. \\"Every child knows the story of Jacob Wetterling. You stole the innocence of children's lives in the small towns, in the rural areas and the cities in Minnesota and beyond.\\" 'Truly horrible' crime While Heinrich could be eligible for release from prison after 17 years, it is \\"unlikely that society will let you go free,\\" Tunheim said. If Heinrich is released, he would serve a lifetime of court-ordered supervision and be registered as a sex offender. After Jacob's kidnapping, the Wetterlings became advocates for sex offender registration programs as they and others pushed for changes in state and federal laws and sought to bring attention to missing and exploited children throughout the country. Since their son's remains were found, they and others have promoted living by 11 of Jacob's traits, including fairness and generosity. Danny Heinrich While speaking in court Monday, Larson and others described how Jacob made a difference in only 11 years of living. \\"Life is hard, but Jacob showed us how great this hard life can be,\\" Larson said. Tunheim echoed those sentiments, saying the victims' statements in court reflected pain, but also give people intense hope for healing and a promise for brighter days. \\"We are in a better place as a society because of the commitment that the Wetterling family has made to Jacob and to protecting other children,\\" Tunheim said. No one will ever forget Oct. 22, 1989, the judge added, but society will move forward. To Heinrich, he added: \\"I wish you good luck as you serve your punishment for one of the most truly horrible crimes that I have ever seen.\\" pam.louwagie@startribune.com 612-673-7102 stephen.montemayor@startribune.com 612-673-1755 ||||| A Minnesota man who abducted, sexually assaulted and killed 11-year-old Jacob Wetterling 27 years ago apologized in court Monday for his \\"evil acts\\" as he was sentenced to 20 years in prison on a child pornography count that let authorities close the books on a mystery that had haunted the state for nearly three decades.

(Craig Lassig / AP) (Craig Lassig / AP) The sentence was the maximum the law allowed, and Heinrich technically could complete it in 17 years with good behavior, but the plea deal allows state authorities to seek his civil commitment as a sexual predator at the end of his federal prison term, which could prevent him from ever going free. \\"What you've done is so heinous, so brutal and so awful that I don't believe society will let you go free,\\" Tunheim said. While some questioned whether it was adequate punishment, Jacob's parents, Patty and Jerry Wetterling, have agreed with prosecutors that it was their best hope. Jacob was abducted by a masked gunman on Oct. 22, 1989, while biking with his brother and a friend near his home in the central Minnesota community of St. Joseph. Early in the investigation, authorities questioned Heinrich, who maintained his innocence. But he came under renewed scrutiny when authorities decided to take a fresh look at the case around the 25th anniversary of the kidnapping. As part of that effort, investigators used new technology to go back to a sex assault cause of a 12-year-old Cold Spring boy that happened nine months before Jacob's disappearance. They found Heinrich's DNA on that boy's sweatshirt, and used that evidence to get a search warrant for Heinrich's home in Annandale, where they found his child pornography collection last year. After months of denials, Heinrich agreed in late August to confess to killing Jacob and the Cold Spring sex assault. Heinrich detailed his crimes in chilling detail in court in September, recounting how a handcuffed Jacob asked him, \\"What did I do wrong?\\" He said he drove the boy to a gravel pit near Paynesville and molested him. After a patrol car with siren and lights passed nearby, he fired two shots at Jacob's head, killing him. Patty Wetterling became a national advocate for missing children after Jacob's disappearance.

Yes The sentence \\"Rome had no separate priestly caste or class\\" provides a valid answer to the question \\"What was lacking as to the profession of a priest class in Rome?\\". The explanation for this choice can be elaborated as follows: In some ancient civilizations, religious and spiritual matters were overseen by a distinct class or caste of people, namely, the priests. These priests performed crucial religious rituals, offered prayers and guidance, and maintained temples and sacred sites. A separate priestly class or caste was usually marked by certain privileges, responsibilities, and a high status within the society, often with special education, attire, and lifestyle requirements. However, in ancient Rome, there was no separate priestly caste or class established as an independent and distinct profession. Instead, the religious duties and priestly functions were taken care of by particular groups of individuals responsible for specific aspects of the religion. These individuals, who hailed from various social strata, were generally selected from among the well-established and aristocratic families to serve as priests or priestesses. Some of these Roman priests and priestesses included: 1. Pontiffs: They were considered the highest authorities in Roman religious matters and were responsible for interpreting divine omens, maintaining important religious texts, and overseeing major religious events. 2. Augurs: They interpreted signs and omens from the gods to help guide decision-making within Roman political and military affairs. 3. Vestal Virgins: These six female priestesses were responsible for tending to the Temple of Vesta and maintaining the eternal flame. They were chosen at a young age and took vows of chastity for the duration of their service. 4. Haruspices: They performed divination by examining animal entrails, particularly the liver, to gain insight into the will of the gods. 5. Flamens: They were specialized priests who presided over the worship of individual Roman deities. Despite there being different types of priests and priestesses in ancient Rome, they did not form a separate priestly caste or class, as seen in other early civilizations. Instead, these individuals held various other positions in society alongside their religious roles, without forming a distinct social class that was solely dedicated to religious practices. Therefore, the information provided in the sentence does indeed satisfactorily answer the question regarding the lack of a distinct priestly caste or class in Rome."},{"question":"Write a sentence that about [The Cambridge Blue eatType pub; The Cambridge Blue food Chinese; The Cambridge Blue priceRange cheap; The Cambridge Blue near Café Brazil].","response":"The Cambridge Blue is an affordable eatType pub offering delicious Chinese cuisine, providing a delightful dining experience at a low priceRange that won't hurt your pocket, and it conveniently located just a short stroll away from the popular Café Brazil, making it a great go-to spot for food lovers seeking variety in their culinary adventures."},{"question":"Egypt's state news agency says the country's top prosecutor has referred ousted Islamist President Mohammed Morsi to trial on charges of inciting the killing of opponents protesting outside his palace while he was in office. A supporter of Egypt's ousted President Mohammed Morsi chants slogans against Egyptian Army during a march following Friday Muslim prayers at Nasser City in Cairo, Egypt, Friday, Aug. 30, 2013. Tens of... (Associated Press) The military ousted Morsi on July 3 after millions took to the street demanding he step down. He's been held incommunicado since. Prosecutors have accused him of conspiring with foreign groups to break out of prison during the chaos of the country's 2011 uprising. Sunday's decision however is the first referral to trial. Morsi will be tried, along with 14 members of his Muslim Brotherhood, in a criminal court for allegedly committing acts of violence, inciting the killing of at least 10. No date was announced for the trial. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. Check back soon for further information. AP's earlier story is below. Egypt's interim president appointed a 50-member committee Sunday dominated by secularists to review proposed amendments to the country's Islamist-drafted constitution, moving ahead with a military-backed transition plan as protests over the coup that ousted the country's president wane. The committee is to begin discussions Sept. 8 on the changes proposed by a 10-member panel of judges, also appointed by interim President Adly Mansour. It is then expected to put the amended charter to a public vote within 60 days, presidential spokesman Ihab Badawi said. That follows a military-backed transition plan that calls for parliamentary and presidential elections early next year in the wake of the July 3 popularly backed coup that toppled President Mohammed Morsi. The new review committee is dominated by liberal and secular public figures and politicians. Five women sit on the committee. There are four representatives from the youth groups that led the protests against Morsi and his predecessor, longtime autocrat Hosni Mubarak. There are also only three church representatives on the committee and no private citizens who are Christians. There are three representatives of Al-Azhar, the Sunni world's most prestigious learning institute that represents moderate Islam. There are also representatives from professional unions, universities and the arts. Badawi said Morsi' group, the Muslim Brotherhood's political party, and five other Islamist parties were tapped to nominate candidates. Only one, Bassam el-Zarka of the leading ultraconservative al-Nour party, came forward. The Salafi al-Nour party said the selection criteria for the judges and their discussion to amend articles was less transparent than the actions of committee under Morsi, which were carried live on television. Al-Nour said it would argue in the committee to restore articles that stress the Islamic nature of the state, and outlaw insulting religious figures and violating social mores, which would be removed in an amendment proposed by the judges. Badawi said a former member of the Brotherhood, Kamal el-Helbawi, also has agreed to sit on the committee and \\"will take into consideration the interests\\" of the group. It is not yet clear how the committee will vote on the amendments, an issue which could complicate and prolong discussions. The amendments suggested by the judges removed controversial articles from the constitution, which were hotly contested by Morsi's opposition. Some articles gave Muslim clerics a final say over legislation, and one gave room for stricter interpretation and implementation of Islamic laws. The Islamist-drafted constitution was one of the most divisive issues during Morsi's one year in office. It was suspended after the military ousted Morsi on July 3 following massive protests demanding he step down. Lawmakers elected the Islamist-dominated 100-member committee that drafted the constitution under Morsi. It included 60 people affiliated with Islamist groups, six women and six Christians. That selection raised criticism of poor representation from youth groups and the secular opposition. Liberals twice walked out of committees drafting the constitution, complaining that the Brotherhood and its allies dominated the process and stifled their suggestions. They said the charter undermined freedoms and rights and sought to imbue a strict interpretation of Islam into Egypt's laws. Protests over the constitution and the direction of the country turned deadly after Morsi issued temporary decrees in late November that put himself and the drafting committee above judicial oversight. The constitution was then finalized in a rushed overnight session and passed with a slight majority in a hastily called referendum in December 2012. ||||| Supporters of ousted Egyptian president Mohamed Mursi hold his picture and a poster (R) showing the ''Rabaa'' or ''four'' gesture, in reference to the police clearing of the Rabaa al-Adawiya protest camp on August 14, during a protest against the military and the interior... CAIRO Egypt's army-backed authorities referred deposed President Mohamed Mursi to trial on Sunday on charges of inciting murder and violence, in an escalation of the crackdown on his Muslim Brotherhood. The new government also named a constituent assembly almost devoid of Islamists and gave it 60 days to review amendments that would erase Islamic articles brought in last year by the Brotherhood and more hardline Islamic parties. Nearly two months after the army deposed Mursi, the moves underscored Egypt's dramatic power shift as its new rulers tighten their grip and crack down on the Islamists who rose to power through the ballot box after Hosni Mubarak's downfall. A state prosecutor charged Mursi and 14 other Brotherhood members with \\"committing acts of violence, and inciting killing and thuggery\\", the state news agency reported. The charges relate to violence in which around a dozen people were killed outside the presidential palace last December, after Mursi had ignited protesters' rage with a decree that expanded his powers. The episode was one of the most violent of his presidency. Tens of thousands gathered outside the presidency to demonstrate against Mursi's decree and a divisive, Islamist-tinged constitution that he planned to put to a referendum. The Brotherhood's leaders called on members to rally to his defense. The state news agency said they were now accused of mobilizing their followers to forcibly disperse the protesters after the security forces rejected Mursi's orders to do so. The charges against Mursi include inciting his followers and assistants to commit crimes of premeditated murder and use violence and thuggery. Mursi is also being investigated over his escape from jail during the 2011 uprising against Mubarak. He is suspected of murder and conspiring with the Palestinian group Hamas during his escape, though no formal charges have been brought. Both the European Union and the United States, source of 1.3 billion in annual military aid to Cairo, had called for Mursi's release after he was detained following his overthrow on July 3. MASS PROTESTS He was toppled just a year into his term following mass protests fuelled by anger at economic mismanagement and Brotherhood attempts to entrench its power. His downfall has led to some of the worst violence in Egypt's modern history, in the form of protests by his supporters, a bloody police crackdown on those supporters, and militant attacks on the police and churches. At least 900 people, most of them Mursi supporters, were killed last month after the authorities smashed two protest camps set up by Mursi's supporters in Cairo. Around 100 of the dead were members of the security forces, killed in what the state has described as a Brotherhood campaign of terrorism. The group denies resorting to violence, saying the government is using the charge to justify the crackdown. Mursi's fall has also triggered a spike in violence in the Sinai Peninsula, where hardline militants expanded into a security vacuum left by the 2011 uprising against Mubarak. Underlining the growing threat of attacks, an army source said three people had been arrested for opening fire with machine guns on a ship passing through the Suez Canal, the global shipping artery that runs through Egyptian territory. During Saturday's unsuccessful attack, the Panamanian-registered container ship COSCO ASIA came under fire in a northern section of the canal, the source said. Canal Authority sources said a rocket-propelled grenade was also used. The Brotherhood says it is committed to peaceful resistance. It managed to bring thousands into the street last Friday in demonstrations against what it views as a \\"putschist regime\\" that aims to turn Egypt back into a police state. The government says it will restore democracy with parliamentary and presidential elections once amendments to the constitution are approved in a referendum. PANEL OF 50 The presidency named a 50-member panel that will review an extensive set of amendments drawn up by a \\"panel of experts\\". The proposals would remove Islamic-influenced articles including one that gave Muslim scholars a say over some affairs of state, and also lift a ban on some Mubarak-era officials assuming public office. Drawn up by a 10-member \\"committee of experts\\" appointed by decree, the draft preserves the privileged status of the military, which it effectively shields from civilian oversight. Although Islamists won five popular votes held since 2011, the constituent assembly will have only two Islamists among its members. One belongs to the hardline Salafi Nour party, the other is a former Brotherhood leader now harshly critical of the group he left last year. \\"It's a very establishment list,\\" said Nathan Brown, an expert on Egypt based at George Washington University in the United States. The presidency said six Islamist parties, including the Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, had been approached to fill the two seats set aside for Islamists. Only Nour had responded. The Brotherhood says it wants nothing to do with the army's plans for Egypt. The Brotherhood and the Nour Party secured a major say over the last constitution-drafting process by winning some 70 percent of the seats in parliamentary elections held after Mubarak's downfall. Critics said the Islamists then sidelined other groups in a process that failed to reflect Egypt's diversity. The constitution was signed into law last December by Mursi after being approved in a referendum. The Nour Party complained of a \\"disregard and exclusion of the Islamist current\\" in the make-up of the review panel. Nour, which was founded after Mubarak's fall, noted that the committee left out members of the youth movements that ignited the uprising of January 25, 2011, \\"raising doubts about the panel's position towards the revolution\\".

The yellow metal's July bounce may continue, vindicating the small number of bullish forecasters still keeping faith with the precious metal, or the slide that began in late October could resume, vindicating the many sell-side analysts working for giant investment banks who are happy to see get what they see as well-deserved comeuppance. Here's what's happened. From its Oct. 4, 2012, price of 1,804.50 per troy ounce the gold price had, by June 28, fallen to 1,180, a more than one-third plunge in its value. Investors in such popular exchange-traded funds as couldn't exit quickly enough. But since June 28, the price of gold has been clawing its way back, and Monday in New York trading it climbed to 1,336.10, a 13 percent gain. The case for a long-term bullish view of the gold price rests on two developments. Supplies are tightening. Rio Tinto said its second-quarter 2013 gold production was down 19 percent from the year-earlier level. And in a preliminary report AngloGold Ashanti, the world's third-largest producer, said it was cutting its full-year production guidance to a range of 4 million ounces to 4.1 million ounces from the previous range of 4.1 million ounces to 4.4 million ounces. Central banks are holding on to their gold rather than selling it. Russia said that in June its supply of gold was unchanged, and the latest report from the noted that for a second week gold reserves remained unchanged. Besides the tightening supplies, the case for a long-term bullish view of the gold price also depends on demand for physical gold -- not the once-popular gold exchange-traded funds -- increasing. Indians, who comprise the world's largest group of gold buyers, are buying more, and as the price has fallen there has been increased demand in China. The volume of business on the Shanghai Gold Exchange last month rose more than 25 percent, year over year. Even Americans are buying physical gold: the U.S. Mint says gold coin sales popped to 46,000 ounces so far in July, already one-third higher than in July of last year. So far this year, gold coin sales by the Mint have reached 836,500 ounces compared with 832,000 ounces for all of 2012. Both developments, tightening supply and increased demand for physical gold, have nothing directly to do with what is happening in non-physical markets. \\"There are really two markets in gold,\\" noted emerging markets investor Mark Mobius of Franklin Templeton Investments . \\"There is the market price, and there is real demand. Market price is influenced by derivatives, by short sellers, by all kinds of actions by traders who are not taking physical delivery. \\"My personal opinion is, this big downturn we've seen is an aberration and you'll probably see a return to the long-term growth trend of gold. But in the short term, there's going to be a lot of pain, basically prices coming down and looking like they're not going to stop coming down. But at the end of the day, the demand is there and supply is limited. The cost of mining is not going down, but going up. So I would say I'm reasonably bullish on gold.\\" There are, moreover, two market trends that augur well for gold. The U.S. Commodities Futures Trading Commission says that the net speculative long position on physical bullion has wound down to the level of 2001, when gold was selling for 330. In other words, gold is looking more and more oversold. Secondly, data released by Comex on Friday revealed that gross speculative short positions -- bets that gold's price will decline -- fell from the all-time high set the week before and \\"indicated perhaps that the negative bullion sentiment may be waning,\\" HSBC gold analyst James Steele said. Economic and industry reports that show a weakening U.S. economy, one that will do well to average 2 percent GDP growth this year, are also expected to help gold because of the perception that weakness just delays the winding down of the Federal Reserve's money-printing. Any continuation in the gold price rally will face obstacles. The head of the All India Gems & Jewelry Trade Federation said India's gold imports may drop to 175,000 tons in the second half of this year because of the nation's central bank recent moves to restrict gold imports. Such a drop would contrast sharply with the 478,000 tons of gold India imported in 2012. What are the most important parts of this news article?","response":"Alright, kiddo! This news article is about gold prices going up, which means it is getting more expensive to buy gold. There are a few reasons why this might be happening: gold mines are producing less gold than before, some big banks want to keep their gold instead of selling it, and more people want to buy gold. Some countries, like India and China, are buying lots of gold, and even people in the United States are buying gold coins. The article tells us that there are a few things happening in the world that could make gold prices keep going up, but there might be some challenges too, like India buying less gold. So, the most important parts of this article are that gold prices are rising, mines are producing less, banks keep their gold, demand for gold is increasing, and that there are some challenges that might affect the prices."},{"question":"On a scale of 1-5 (with 1 being least favorable and 5 being most favorable), how would you rate this review? \\"Make me update all the time...please\\" The answer to this question is:","response":"2 This review seems to express a certain level of dissatisfaction or annoyance with the frequency of updates required for the product or service being discussed.

Born at Podolskaya Street in Saint Petersburg, Russia, Shostakovich was the second of three children of Dmitri Boleslavovich Shostakovich and Sofiya Vasilievna Kokoulina. Shostakovich's paternal grandfather, originally surnamed Szostakowicz, was of Polish Roman Catholic descent (his family roots trace to the region of the town of Vileyka in today's Belarus), but his immediate forebears came from Siberia. A Polish revolutionary in the January Uprising of 1863–4, Bolesław Szostakowicz would be exiled to Narym (near Tomsk) in 1866 in the crackdown that followed Dmitri Karakozov's assassination attempt on Tsar Alexander II. When his term of exile ended, Szostakowicz decided to remain in Siberia. He eventually became a successful banker in Irkutsk and raised a large family. His son Dmitri Boleslavovich Shostakovich, the composer's father, was born in exile in Narim in 1875 and studied physics and mathematics in Saint Petersburg University, graduating in 1899.

(CNN) -- For all of its expected action and drama, the new \\"Halo 4\\" boils down to an essential question: Are its central characters humans, machines or something in between? The answer may still be unclear by the time you're done playing this fantastic game. This edition of the hugely popular \\"Halo\\" franchise was developed by 343 Industries, which took over after Bungie Studios, creators of the first four games, split from Microsoft. To its credit, 343 Industries has retained the intense first-person shooter action \\"Halo\\" fans are used to but upped the emotional interplay between the iconic Master Chief and his artificial-intelligence companion, Cortana. The action begins with Master Chief in cryosleep and Cortana starting to undergo rampancy, a condition for older AIs in which they actually think themselves to death. At one point, Cortana likens it to having 1,000 arguments with herself, but she tries desperately to hang on to her sanity to help the Chief, her human ally. The connection between these two characters makes this campaign really special. From the opening scene with Catherine Halsey, the creator of the story's super-soldier program, to its climax, the tension between humans and machines runs throughout the story. Web series builds anticipation for 'Halo 4' Cortana seems more emotive than before -- a welcome addition to the character. Master Chief retains his detached, no-nonsense soldier persona for most of the campaign, but there are moments you want his helmet to come off so you can see the facial expressions you sense he's making. \\"Halo 4\\" hooked me emotionally before I realized it. Some scenes made me feel waves of despair or elation before I recognized I was mirroring the emotions in the game -- truly a sign of an immersive experience. The graphics of \\"Halo 4\\" are outstanding in their detailed depictions of characters and background environments. Whether foliage for a jungle setting or the individualized movement of little bits of wreckage, each scene is treated with careful attention to the smallest element. Characters look like live-action actors, and their movements and emotions have a realistic, almost filmlike quality. This technique has been used in other games, but \\"Halo 4\\" raises the bar for others to emulate. The voice acting and dialogue are fantastic and help pull you into the story. You'll quickly hate some characters based merely on the inflection in their voice. (You may even wish you could shoot them in the face -- I know I did -- but you can't.) The game introduces a new character from the recent \\"Halo\\" Web series, and I sometimes wondered if I was missing inside jokes from the related \\"Halo\\" books. But knowing the entire \\"Halo\\" universe isn't a prerequisite to enjoying this game. There are eight missions in the single-player campaign, with plenty of weapons and vehicles from which to choose. Combat in the game seemed more strategic than the straightforward, hard-charging style we've come to know from previous \\"Halo\\" titles. For example, using the armor's jump-pack accessory allows players to leap up to hidden spots and pick off enemies. And other armor abilities allow Master Chief to create a floating turret, which I found great for thinning out a battlefield before wading in. Don't worry, fans -- the big action sequences are still there. \\"Halo 4's\\" epic fight sequences require players to confront waves of enemies in one mission, then pick off bad guys one by one in another. And of course, co-op and online multiplayer action is available if you want to include a friend or try your luck against an opponent. Despite all the mayhem, what stood out for me about \\"Halo 4\\" was the story. The new developers made an effort to delve into the characters we've known over the years and morph them into something fresh. The \\"man or machine\\" question becomes more prevalent as the game progresses, and I found myself looking at different missions and scenes through that lens. Is Cortana more human as her mind begins to splinter? Does John-117, the solder we know as Master Chief, become a robotic killing machine? Or have both influenced each other so much that the differences we expect between the two become mixed, creating a symbiotic relationship that only becomes evident when one side lets down the other?
