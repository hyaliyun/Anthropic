Article:","response":"Title: Tragic Accident on Set of 'The Walking Dead' Claims Life of Stuntman John Bernecker The entertainment industry is mourning the loss of talented stuntman John Bernecker, who sadly passed away after a devastating fall on the set of the hit TV show, 'The Walking Dead.' The accident, which occurred during the filming of season 8, has shaken the show's cast and crew, as well as the wider community of actors and professionals working in the world of television and film. John Bernecker, 33, was described as a cherished and highly skilled member of the show's production team. He was an experienced stunt performer and coordinator, who had amassed an impressive body of work over the course of his career. His credits include popular films such as 'Get Out,' 'Logan,' 'Black Panther,' and 'The Fate of the Furious,' as well as numerous television series, including 'The Vampire Diaries,' 'Scream Queens,' and 'Into the Badlands,' among others. Bernecker's untimely passing has left a void in the stunt community, with many colleagues sharing their heartfelt condolences and tributes in his memory. The tragic accident occurred on July 12, 2017, when Bernecker was performing a stunt that involved a 22-foot fall from a balcony. It was reported that he missed the safety cushion by just a few inches, sustaining severe head injuries from impact with the concrete floor. Despite being rushed to Atlanta Medical Centre, he succumbed to his injuries the following day, leaving behind an industry in shock. After news of the accident broke, production of the eighth season was halted temporarily to allow for an investigation into the incident. As a result, the show's producers, Stalwart Films, were cited by the US Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) with a \\"serious\\" violation and fined 12,675. This fine amounts to the maximum penalty that can be imposed by the agency for a single violation. OSHA found that the company's failure to provide adequate protection to Bernecker during the stunt amounted to the violation of workplace safety requirements, which ultimately led to his death. The accident on the set of 'The Walking Dead' sparked urgent discussions about safety measures within the entertainment industry, particularly in relation to stunt performers. While many professionals in the field have expressed the need for constant vigilance in ensuring a safe work environment and minimizing risks, the unpredictable nature of stunt work means that occasional accidents still occur. The show, its cast, and the entire industry have been forced to confront the stark reality and potential dangers that stunt performers face in their line of work. In memory of John Bernecker, both the cast and crew of 'The Walking Dead' dedicated the season 8 premiere to his lasting legacy. A heartfelt message that accompanied the episode read, \\"In loving memory of our friend and colleague John Bernecker, who shared his passion for storytelling with all of us. He will be greatly missed.\\" Bernecker's passing has underscored the vital importance of upholding stringent safety standards within the entertainment industry, as well as acknowledging and honoring the immense contributions of stunt performers and coordinators around the world."},{"question":"In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank and four options (associated with \\"A\\", \\"B\\", \\"C\\", \\"D\\").

Do not generate anything else apart from one of the following characters: \\"A\\", \\"B\\", \\"C\\", \\"D\\". There is only one correct answer for each question. Article: The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time is a novel about a 15-year-old autistic boy named Christopher Boone. After discovering the dead body of Wellington, his neighbor's dog, Christopher decides to find out the cause of the dog's death. He records his findings, as he has decided that he will create a \\"murder mystery novel\\" of the situation. But like any murder mystery novel, nothing is as simple as it seems. Christopher runs into many difficult situations because of his disability. He again and again mentions how he admires Sherlock Holmes (a fictional detective), which gives me an understanding as to why he continues to look into Wellington's death even after his father makes him promise not to. Christopher's story seems so true and heartfelt and that makes the novel an entertaining read. The author, Mark Haddon, had me wanting to keep reading to find out what Christopher would get himself into next. Haddon shows how Christopher' s disability affects how he goes about solving the mystery. Christopher has difficulty in communicating or forming relationships with others, but he has a great visual memory and ability to understand difficult math. This book was required reading at my school, but it became more than something I had to read. Haddon showed how these disabilities affect the lives of not only the children diagnosed with them, but also those around them. The novel feels real because it was written from Christopher's point of view. For example, when Christopher explains that when he was little he didn't understand much about other people having minds, it gives the impression that he's a real person. I believe that teenagers sometimes aren't sensitive to kids with mental disabilities. I think that when people read this novel, they will have a better understanding of what people with mental disabilities and those around them have to deal with on a daily basis.

Mamie, in a plush Gainsborough hat and a gown of wine-coloured silk, sat, an apparent queen, among her rude surroundings and companions. The dusky litter of the cabin set off her radiant trimness: tarry Johnson was a foil to her fair beauty; she glowed in that poor place, fair as a star; until even I, who was not usually of her admirers, caught a spark of admiration; and even the captain, who was in no courtly humour, proposed that the scene should be commemorated by my pencil. It was the last act of the evening. Hurriedly as I went about my task, the half-hour had lengthened out to more than three before it was completed: Mamie in full value, the rest of the party figuring in outline only, and the artist himself introduced in a back view, which was pronounced a likeness. But it was to Mamie that I devoted the best of my attention; and it was with her I made my chief success. According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"What was the last act of the evening?\\" is \\"Singing a song\\"?","response":"No, sweetie, the last act of the evening was not singing a song. Instead, they asked the artist to draw a picture of the scene with Mamie and her friends in the cabin.

So, it was all about making a pretty drawing of the happy moments they had together."},{"question":"Question 1: How do I get over my anxiety of bugs? Question 2: What should I do to get over this anxiety? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","response":"Hello there! I'll answer both your questions and then let you know if the answers are the same. Question 1: How do I get over my anxiety of bugs? Answer: To get over your anxiety of bugs, it helps to understand that they are just tiny creatures that are more afraid of you than you are of them. Learning about different kinds of bugs and realizing that most of them are harmless can also help. You could look at pictures or read books about bugs to become more familiar with them. Gradually, you'll start feeling less anxious as you know more about these little creatures. Question 2: What should I do to get over this anxiety? Answer: To get over your anxiety of bugs, you should practice being around them in a safe and controlled environment. Start with something simple like looking at pictures of bugs, and then move on to watching videos or visiting a place with bugs, like a park or a garden. Sometimes, you can even have a grown-up or a friend with you who isn't afraid of bugs to help you feel braver. You can also talk to someone about your feelings and get their support. Now, are the answers the same? They are similar but not exactly the same. The first answer talks about understanding bugs and learning about them to get over the anxiety, while the second answer is more about facing your fear and getting used to being around bugs. Both of these suggestions can help you in overcoming your anxiety of bugs."},{"question":"Given the sentence \\"A man wearing camouflage shorts and a white t-shirt shines the black dress shoes of a man wearing black dress slacks.\\" is it true that \\"The man is performing brain surgery.\\"?

(Associated Press) A jogger runs across the Sterling Highway from the Bird Creek access point, near a trail head that's closed on Monday, June 19, 2017, after a fatal bear mauling at Bird Ridge Trail in Anchorage, Alaska. Authorities say a black bear killed a 16-year-old runner while he was competing in an Alaska race... (Associated Press) ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — Patrick Cooper had already turned around after reaching the halfway point in a popular mountain race in Alaska when he somehow veered off the trail and became lost. That's when the 16-year-old Anchorage boy encountered the black bear that would take his life in a rare predatory attack. Cooper began running, and at one point he reportedly placed a frantic call to his brother, saying he was being chased by a bear Sunday in the Robert Spurr Memorial Hill Climb race south of Anchorage. The brother notified race director Brad Precosky, who alerted race crews to begin searching for Cooper, known as Jack. It took a couple hours for responders to locate the teen, whose body was found about a mile up the path, at about 1,500 vertical feet (457 vertical meters). The bear was found at the site, guarding the body, Precosky said. A Chugach State Park ranger shot the 250-pound (113-kilogram) bear in the face, but the animal ran away. Alaska State Troopers said the boy's remains were airlifted from the scene on Sunday. State park staffers were scouring the area Monday looking for the bear, state Fish and Game spokesman Ken Marsh said. Sunday's attack was believed to have been a rare predatory move, not a defensive action such as when a female bear will protect her cubs, he said. \\"It's very unusual,\\" Marsh said of the mauling. \\"It's sort of like someone being struck by lightning.\\" Later Monday, a second fatal mauling at the hands of a black bear was reported nearly 300 miles northeast of Anchorage. Officials with an underground gold mine reported a contract employee hired to take geological samples was killed and another injured in a black bear attack. No names have been released. Alaska State Troopers and federal mine officials are investigating the mauling at Pogo Mine. Matt Wedeking, division operations manager with Alaska State Parks, said the predatory behavior of the bear in the attack on the teen was not normal. Asked if there were cubs around this black bear, he said, \\"We don't know. There could have been. But right now I don't have any information about the bear.\\" The last fatal mauling in the state occurred near Delta Junction in Alaska's interior in 2013, when a man was killed by a male black bear, Marsh said. The last fatal bear attack in the greater Anchorage area was in 1995, when two people were killed in the Turnagain Arm area by a brown bear protecting a moose carcass, he said. Last week, a juvenile and two young adults sustained minor injuries when a female brown bear with two cubs attacked them. Authorities shot at that bear, but it ran off. Athletes who run wilderness races in Alaska know bear encounters are always an inherent possibility. Much of the vast state is bear country, after all, and even the competitions themselves can come with warnings, or liability waivers for participants to sign. But competitors often train alone in such areas and are fully aware of the dangers. Races actually can be said to cut down on the risk of a bear encounter because so many people are there, making noise and making their presence known, Precosky said. \\"There's no safer time to be on a mountain than on a race,\\" he said. Competitors note that races involve large noisy crowds, which can spook the animals away from the action. Still, there's no guarantee of 100 percent safety, as a weekend mountain race proved with the fatal mauling of a 16-year-old boy. ___ Associated Press writer Mark Thiessen in Anchorage, Alaska, contributed to this report. ___ Follow Rachel D'Oro at https://twitter.com/rdoro ||||| Patrick Cooper died Sunday as the 16-year-old came down Bird Ridge near Anchorage following a mountain race, the victim of an unusual fatal attack involving a black bear. A day later, a Pogo Mine contract employee in the Interior was killed — also by a black bear. Experts say fatal maulings by black bears in Alaska are rare. Until the past few days, only six deaths had been linked to black bears in 130 years, according to a biologist compiling a report on Alaska bear attacks since 1880. The sequence of events leading to Cooper's death is unknown beyond a text message he sent to a relative, saying he was being chased by a bear as he descended after finishing the 1.5-mile juniors division course of the Robert Spurr Memorial Hill Climb. A state park ranger shot a black bear found near Cooper's body but the animal ran off. Little information was available Monday about the attack on the Pogo contractor that left a second contract employee injured. If black bears are found responsible for both deaths, it represents only the second time in recent history that black bears have killed someone in Alaska. The last was Robert Weaver, a 64-year-old Fairbanks man who died following a black bear attack at his cabin near Delta Junction in 2013. Black bears accounted for just 10 percent of bear attacks in Alaska dating back to 1880, according to reports compiled by two biologists working separately. \\"The black bear — that's really odd,\\" said Tom Smith, an associate professor at Brigham Young University who's studied bears since he worked as a biologist at Katmai National Park in 1992. Experts say Cooper's death was all too common, however, in that it involved someone hurt or killed by bears while running, hiking or backpacking. About 42 percent of the 207 people attacked by bears from 1980 to 2015 were recreating in bear country, according to a tally from retired Alaska Department of Fish and Game bear biologist John Hechtel. Another 28 percent were hunting and 2 percent fishing. Brown bears killed 15 people in that 35-year period, according to Hechtel. Black bears killed three. Black bears attack only about once every other year in Alaska, statistics show. While black bear attacks are far less common than brown or grizzly bear encounters, black bears tend to be more \\"predatory,\\" said Smith, who lives in Utah but still has property on the Kenai Peninsula's Skilak Lake. He warns family to worry about black bears that don't respond to shouting and other scare tactics. Generally, experts break down bear attacks into two broad categories: defensive and predatory. Defensive attacks — bears feel threatened or want to protect their young — include the classic example of someone rounding a corner and running into a sow bear with cubs. Bears tend to huff, paw at the ground or even make small rushes at the person. \\"It's a fear reaction,\\" Hechtel said. \\"They may knock a person around a couple times and run off.\\" A predatory attack could come from a hungry bear, one that sees a human as prey, or if something the person does — like running away — triggers a bear's prey response. Bears may walk quietly toward people without looking agitated. \\"Those tend to be more serious because the bear, if it knocks the person down or does stuff, it's not going to run away and leave,\\" he said. Smith adds that bears, like people, can exhibit a range of personalities. \\"Some are very shy,\\" he said. \\"Some, guaranteed, if they think they can take you out, they will do that.\\" Both men are fans of pepper spray as a deterrent. Smith, with renowned bear researcher Stephen Herrero and several others, wrote a 2012 article finding no significant difference in Alaska bear encounters when people used guns versus pepper spray, and suggesting that only people proficient in the use of firearms should use them for bear protection. Hechtel said he's found that the close-up range of bear spray can encourage people to stand their ground during a bear attack instead of panicking. He offered several tips: Stop moving. Have bear spray ready. Talk calmly, especially if it's clear the bear is in defensive mode. If the bear appears predatory, yell or throw wood or rocks at it. \\"The simple message of simply playing dead is way oversold,\\" he said, though in some cases it's necessary, like if you're knocked to the ground or have no deterrent. ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

After veering off the trail and becoming lost, Cooper encountered the bear and began running. He called his brother, who notified the race director, setting off a search for him. Cooper's body was found a mile up the path, with the bear guarding it. A park ranger shot the 250-pound bear in the face but it escaped. Despite widespread bear territory in Alaska, fatal encounters are rare, with only six black bear-related deaths registered in 130 years."},{"question":"Leo: Can we conclude from \\"A black and white dog is playing with a golf ball in the sand.\\" that \\"Dog is eating food.\\"?

Solve -20*p - 42 = -75*p + 62*p for p.","response":"To solve the equation -20*p - 42 = -75*p + 62*p for p, we should follow these steps: Step 1: Combine like terms on both sides of the equation. On the right side of the equation, we have terms -75*p and 62*p, which we can combine. -75*p + 62*p = -13*p So the equation becomes: -20*p - 42 = -13*p Step 2: Move the terms containing p to one side of the equation and the constant terms to the other side. To do this, we will add 13*p to both sides of the equation to move the p terms to the left side. -20*p + 13*p - 42 = -13*p + 13*p -7*p - 42 = 0 Now, we will add 42 to both sides to move the constant term to the right side. -7*p - 42 + 42 = 0 + 42 -7*p = 42 Step 3: Solve for p. To find the value of p, we need to isolate p. We will do this by dividing both sides of the equation by -7. -7*p / -7 = 42 / -7 p = -6 So, the solution to the equation -20*p - 42 = -75*p + 62*p is p = -6."},{"question":"La nouvelle technologie présente de nombreuses possibilités pour les collectivités des Premières nations, qui sont souvent isolées géographiquement, a t-elle expliqué.

Keaton's comedies are _innerly, harmoniously, intelligently ordered, thought. Wonderfully amusing, deliberately delightful and inventive, THREE AGES should belong to a draft of a comedies top ten if I were to sketch one. A threefold love story will enchant the viewers; I want to bring here this approachKeaton's comedy is like Lang's DESTINY upsidedownor À REBOURS. Again a couple traverses the waters of timeand of epochsin the Stone Age, in Rome and in Keaton's timesin a Mohammedan country, in Renaissance Italy and in China. The same device works in the both moviesone, a grim, eerie melodrama; --the other, a light, virtuouslypaced comedy. At Keaton it's essentially the same couple; and maybe the same is with Lang. The babe desired by both Buster and Beery is nice. I have found THREE AGES well written and smart, without being ostentatiously sophisticated; the plot is basically very POPEYElikethe babe is a piece of furniture, the only protagonists are the two male rivalsKeaton and Beery. Keaton's movie is simply enormously likable, and perhaps one would be tempted to assert this looks like ambitious funyet it's not, but it is grand fun, large fun, ample fun. And Wallace Beery makes a fine nemesis. Did this review think positively or negatively of the movie?","response":"This review thought positively of the movie. The reviewer appreciated the comedy in \\"Three Ages\\" and found it to be \\"wonderfully amusing, deliberately delightful, and inventive.\\" They also considered it \\"enormously likable\\" and enjoyed the performances of Buster Keaton and Wallace Beery. The reviewer even mentioned that the movie should be part of a top ten comedies list. Overall, the review highlights the film's strengths and expresses a positive opinion."},{"question":"Generate a context and a hypothesis.","response":"Context: The rapid decline of bee populations around the world In recent years, scientists and environmentalists have been increasingly alarmed by the rapid decline of bee populations around the world. Bees are a vital part of the global ecosystem, as they play a crucial role in pollination, helping plants to reproduce. It is estimated that around 75% of the world's food crops depend on pollination by bees and other insects, which makes their decline a significant threat to global food security. Various factors have been identified as potential causes of this decline, including habitat loss, pesticide exposure, diseases, and climate change. As a result, there is growing interest in understanding the causes of this decline and finding ways to protect and conserve bee populations. Hypothesis: The decline in bee populations can be reversed through the implementation of targeted conservation efforts and the reduction of pesticide exposure. This hypothesis proposes that by implementing specific actions aimed at conserving bee populations and minimizing their exposure to harmful pesticides, it is possible to reverse the trend of declining bee numbers. Based on this hypothesis, several courses of action can be taken to protect bees: 1. Habitat restoration: Preserving and creating natural habitats that are rich in food sources and nesting sites for bees can play a crucial role in bolstering their populations. This includes planting diverse flowering plants, promoting land conservation, and encouraging the use of native plants in landscaping. 2. Reduce pesticide exposure: Limiting the use of harmful pesticides, especially those that directly affect bees, is essential in safeguarding their populations. Efforts to implement integrated pest management (IPM) techniques and promote the use of less harmful pesticides can help mitigate the impact of these chemicals on bees. 3. Public education: Raising awareness about the importance of bees in the ecosystem and the severity of their decline can encourage action on an individual and community level. By promoting bee-friendly practices in gardens and public spaces, as well as advocating for pesticide reduction, the public can contribute to bee conservation. 4. Support beekeeping: Encouraging and supporting local beekeepers can help to maintain strong and healthy bee populations. By providing them with resources and assistance, communities can ensure that beekeeping remains a viable and attractive occupation, thus contributing to the preservation of local bee populations. 5. Monitor and research: Monitoring bee populations and conducting research on their decline can shed light on the causes and effects of their current situation. This knowledge can inform conservation efforts, allowing for targeted action to be taken to address the specific needs of different bee species. By focusing on these strategies and supporting initiatives aimed at the conservation of bees, it is believed that the decline in bee populations can be arrested and potentially reversed. Ultimately, this would result in not only the preservation of these essential pollinators but also the safeguarding of global food security and the stability of ecosystems worldwide."},{"question":"After the buyer returned the shoes they purchased, Quinn paid the buyer back. Given the context: Why did Quinn pay them back? Possible answers: keep the money for the news, make the buyer angry, refund the money for the shoes","response":"Given the context, Quinn paid the buyer back to refund the money for the shoes. When a buyer returns a purchased product, it is customary and expected for the seller to provide a refund. This process ensures customer satisfaction and maintains the reputation of the seller. In this scenario, Quinn is adhering to standard business practices by returning the buyer's payment for the shoes upon receiving the returned product. There can be a variety of reasons why a buyer returns a product, such as dissatisfaction with the product's quality, the product not meeting their expectations, or the product not fitting properly (as in the case of shoes). By refunding the buyer when they return the product, Quinn demonstrates a commitment to provide a satisfactory shopping experience, acknowledges the buyer's concerns, and shows a willingness to address any issues arising from the purchase. Issue resolution through refunds is a key aspect of maintaining good customer relations. This approach enables sellers to build trust with their customers, which in turn can lead to repeat business, positive reviews, and word-of-mouth recommendations. On the other hand, if Quinn were to keep the money for the returned shoes or make the buyer angry by not providing a refund, this could have a negative impact on their reputation, deter potential buyers, and lead to business losses in the long run. In summary, Quinn paid the buyer back to refund the money for the shoes after the buyer returned their purchase. This action is in line with standard business practices, ensures customer satisfaction, and helps maintain the seller's reputation. By providing refunds upon receiving returns, businesses like Quinn's demonstrate their commitment to addressing buyer concerns and maintaining a positive shopping experience."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: The plane was full, there were no seats left.

One missile landed in an uninhabited area while at least one more is thought to have landed in the sea off the city. Meanwhile, Israel's defence minister has authorised the call-up of 30,000 reservists. The BBC's Richard Galpin, in Jerusalem, says speculation is mounting that the Israeli army is preparing to launch a ground offensive into the Gaza Strip. Eighteen Palestinians have been killed in Israeli operations against militants in Gaza since Wednesday afternoon, when an Israeli air strike killed the military leader of Hamas, the militant group that controls the territory, in his car in Gaza City. Three Israelis have died during a barrage of hundreds of missiles fired from Gaza, mostly into southern Israel, some of which have been intercepted by Israel's Iron Dome missile defence system. The rocket fired at Tel Aviv that came down on dry land hit a field in the suburb of Rishon Lezion, south of the city. The armed wing of Islamic Jihad said it had fired an Iranian-built, Fajr-5 rocket at Tel Aviv. By Jeremy BowenBBC Middle East editor The danger of the kind of operation Israel has started is that rising casualties on both sides cause a violent escalation that neither side can control. If that happens it could cause a much bigger crisis across the Middle East. By Wyre DaviesBBC News, Gaza The overwhelming mood in Gaza is sombre but vengeful. Sombre because few here want another war with Israel - another war in which civilians would undoubtedly suffer as much as the fighters. By Yolande KnellBBC News, Kiryat Malachi There is a gaping hole on the top floor of an old four-storey apartment building where two Israeli families were living. A resident Yerumichael Simon told me: \\"I live across the street and I used to live inside that building.\\" BBC reporters on Israel-Gaza violence \\"We have widened the range of the battle to reach Tel Aviv and what is coming will be greater,\\" the group said in a statement. This is the first time Tel Aviv has been threatened by missiles since the first Gulf War, when missiles fired by Saddam Hussein's Iraq landed in the city. Israeli Defence Minister Ehud Barak said: \\"This escalation will exact a price that the other side will have to pay.\\" The Hamas Prime Minister in Gaza, Ismail Haniyeh, condemned what he called Israel's \\"ferocious assault\\" against the territory. \\"We here in Gaza will remain steadfast and unshaken,\\" he said in a televised statement. \\"We will fend off the aggression. \\"We are all confident in our intrepid resistance fighters who are now deployed on the front.\\" Late on Thursday, BBC correspondents in Gaza reported several massive explosions and missile fire in and around Gaza City as Israeli strikes continued. Many of the Palestinians killed in Gaza during the last two days by the Israeli aerial and naval bombardment were members of militant groups, but civilians - including at least four children - were also among the dead. They included 11-month-old Omar, the son of Jihad Misharawi, a BBC Arabic picture editor. The three Israeli civilians who died - two women and a man - were killed on the top floor of a block of flats in the southern town of Kiryat Malachi that suffered a direct hit by a rocket. Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel will do \\"everything in its power\\" to avoid civilian casualties in the conflict with Hamas. But he said Hamas was deliberately placing its rockets and missiles in civilian areas prior to launching them at Israel. \\"There is no moral symmetry between Israel and the terrorists in Gaza,\\" he said during a televised news conference in Tel Aviv. \\"Hamas deliberately targets our children and they deliberately place their rockets next to their children. Now despite this reality - and it's a difficult reality - Israel will continue to do everything in its power to avoid civilian casualties.\\" Egypt's new Islamist President Mohammed Mursi called the Israeli bombardment \\"unacceptable aggression\\". Egyptian Prime Minister Hisham Qandil is to travel to Gaza on Friday in a show of support for the people of the territory. The United States, Israel's key ally, has called on countries that have contact with Hamas to urge it to stop rocket attacks from Gaza. \\"We've... urged those that have a degree of influence with Hamas such as Turkey, and Egypt and some of our European partners to use that influence to urge Hamas to de-escalate,\\" said Ben Rhodes, deputy national security adviser, in a conference call with reporters. Asked if the US was concerned that Israeli ground forces would enter Gaza, Mr Rhodes said: \\"Ultimately it's up to the Israeli government to make determinations about how they're going to carry out their military objectives.\\" Arab League foreign ministers plan to meet in emergency session on Friday to discuss the escalating violence. Israel's aerial and naval bombardment of the Gaza Strip, which began after a recent wave of rocket attacks from there, is its most intense assault on the Palestinian territory since it launched a full-scale invasion four years ago, also in response to rocket fire.","response":"People living in a city had to hide because they were warned that something dangerous was flying towards them.

Review: I rarely leave reviews, but I feel compelled to warn others about the disastrous experience I had with the com.google.android.marvin.talkback app. This app claims to be an accessibility service to assist individuals with visual impairments, but it falls woefully short. First and foremost, the app is riddled with bugs and crashes constantly. I couldn't even navigate through the app without it freezing or closing unexpectedly. What's the point of developing an app to help those with visual impairments if it's virtually unusable? Additionally, the voice recognition feature is absolutely abysmal. Half the time, it didn't even understand basic commands, and when it did, the app stuttered and hesitated before executing them. It made my experience not only frustrating but also unusable for the very people it claims to help. The User interface is not at all intuitive, I found it clunky and incredibly difficult to navigate. It's as if no thought was given to the people who would actually use the app, leading to a stressful and aggravating experience. Finally, the app's battery consumption is through the roof! It drained my phone's battery in a matter of hours, even when I wasn't actively using it, which is utterly unacceptable for an app that's supposed to be an aid for daily life. In conclusion, I cannot emphasize enough how disappointing and frustrating my experience with the com.google.android.marvin.talkback app has been.

First question: \\"What kind of guy would you like to live your life with?\\" This question is asking about the personal preferences and qualities someone would seek in a partner with whom they could spend their life. It could be related to personality traits, interests, goals, and values, among other factors. As an AI language model, I do not have personal preferences or experiences, but most individuals seek a partner who shares their values, respects their differences and provides support throughout their life. Second question: \\"What kind of psycho girl/guy have you met in your life?\\" The term \\"psycho\\" is often colloquially used to describe someone displaying erratic, irrational, or highly emotional and sometimes harmful behavior. This question asks about a person's experiences encountering someone who could be characterized as exhibiting such behavior. As an AI language model, I do not have personal experiences or encounters with people, but this question generally aims to explore the type of people whom the respondent has met, who are considered to behave outside the boundaries of what is socially acceptable or expected. In conclusion, the two questions focus on different aspects and types of relationships and experiences. The first question centers around preferences in a lifelong partner, while the second question explores encounters with individuals exhibiting deviant or abnormal behavior."},{"question":"What most naturally follows?

Answer:","response":"The first step of the process is to fill the tray with warm water. This is done to minimize the presence of gas bubbles and impurities that can create cloudiness or cracks in the ice cubes. Using warm water will also ensure a more even freezing process, resulting in crystal-clear ice cubes. Here is a detailed explanation of the complete process: 1. Fill the tray with warm water: Start by using water that is slightly warmer than room temperature, as this will help to remove any dissolved gasses and increase the clarity of the ice cubes. Be sure not to use hot water, which may warp or damage the ice cube tray. 2. Carefully place the tray on an even surface: Transport the filled ice cube tray to the freezer, making sure to keep the surface as level as possible. This ensures that each individual ice cube will be evenly shaped and sized, reducing the chance of uneven freezing or accidental spills inside your freezer. 3. Set the freezer temperature to at least 32°F (0°C): It is essential to have the correct freezing point for water to ensure the formation of ice cubes. The ideal temperature to freeze water is 32°F (0°C), so make sure your freezer is set to this temperature or colder to guarantee a successful freezing process. 4. Allow the water to cool and freeze: Once inside the freezer, the water will gradually cool to the point where it begins to freeze and solidify. This process can take anywhere from a few hours to overnight, depending on the size of the ice cubes and the efficiency of your freezer. 5. Monitor the water's expansion as it freezes: Water is unique in that it expands when it freezes. As the water turns to ice, its molecules rearrange themselves into a crystalline structure that takes up more space than liquid water. Keep an eye on the ice cube tray during the freezing process, making sure the expanding ice isn't causing any overflow or damage to the tray itself. 6. Enjoy clear, crack-free ice cubes: Thanks to the use of warm water and careful handling, your ice cubes should now be clear and free of any cracks caused by trapped gasses. Remove the tray from the freezer and gently twist or flex it to release the ice cubes, which are now ready to use in your favorite beverages. Following these steps should result in perfectly clear and evenly frozen ice cubes, ready for use in your favorite cold drinks."},{"question":"Sydney spent a couple hours working on the group project for class.

Adams' grandson is also unconvinced. Matthew Adams, who runs the Ansel Adams Gallery, said even if they are authenticated, they are not worth much beyond their historical value. The art dealer who placed their eventual value at more than 200 million said Wednesday that the controversy is increasing their value by \\"driving the market to them.\\" \\"They're making them so desirable,\\" said David W. Streets. \\"People all over the world are seeing this and saying 'I want one of each.'\\" That controversy took a bitter turn a day after California wall painter Rick Norsigian and his lawyer held a news conference at Streets' Beverly Hills art gallery to say they have proof the negatives were created by Ansel Adams. William Turnage, the managing trustee of Adams' trust, called Norsigian and those working with him \\"a bunch of crooks\\" who \\"are pulling a big con job.\\" Norsigian's lawyer, Arnold Peter, called Turnage's attack \\"a shameful and pointless disparagement of the professional reputations of some of the top leaders in their respective fields.\\" The team of experts included two court-qualified handwriting experts, a retired FBI agent, and a former assistant United States attorney, Peter said. Peter said that based on the overwhelming evidence they gathered \\"no reasonable person would have any doubt that these, in fact, were the long-lost images of Ansel Adams.\\" Turnage, who was Adams' business manager before his death in 1984, challenged the expertise of Norsigian's team, saying the only one with art credentials was a \\"so-called expert that nobody has ever heard of from Jackson Hole, Wyoming.\\" \\"They had to go out into the boonies to dig him up,\\" Turnage said. Norsigian's lawyer responded by calling Turnage an \\"elitist.\\" \\"Ansel Adams would likely be shocked and appalled at such blatant arrogance and condescending commentary in his name,\\" Peter said. Turnage said Norsigian's strategy is to line up a long list of hired experts to tell \\"a big lie.\\" \\"Hitler used that technique,\\" Turnage said. \\"You don't tell a small one. You tell a big one.\\" Peter said Turnage \\"has converted a professional disagreement over works of art into a personal attack utilizing tactics that are grossly offensive and unconscionable.\\" \\"Likening Rick Norsigian to Adolf Hitler is nothing more than yet another bullying tactics designed to silence Mr. Norsigian,\\" Peter said. The lawyer invited Matthew Adams and Turnage \\"to engage in a meaningful dialogue and examine the evidence which they have consistently refused to do.\\" \\"We now offer them yet another opportunity to jointly agree on and hire experts who are qualified to render a final opinion on the authenticity of the negatives,\\" Peter said. \\"Any honest and fair assessment will lead to but one conclusion -- these are the lost negatives of Ansel Adams.\\" The approach was \\"to put these negatives on trial\\" using a \\"high burden of proof\\" to show that the 65 glass plates were created by Adams, the iconic American photographer whose images of the West inspired the country. \\"I have sent people to prison for the rest of their lives for far less evidence than I have seen in this case,\\" said evidence and burden-of-proof expert Manny Medrano, who was hired by Norsigian to help authenticate the plates. \\"In my view, those photographs were done by Ansel Adams.\\" Meanwhile, Matthew Adams said Wednesday, \\"I don't think that they've proven that they are (authentic). ... And I don't know that you could ever prove that they are.\\" Adams, who reviewed Norsigian's evidence last year, said he wanted more scientific tests, including carbon dating, to prove beyond a doubt that the work was that of his grandfather. He cited \\"a number of inconsistencies,\\" including the conclusion by two handwriting analysts that notations on manila envelopes containing the plates were made by Ansel Adams' wife, Virginia Adams. The envelopes had five misspellings of well-known Yosemite National Park landmarks, he said. \\"Bridal Veil Falls\\" is misspelled twice as \\"Bridal Vail Falls\\" and \\"Happy Isles\\" is misspelled \\"Happy Iles,\\" Adams said. Virginia Adams -- who spent most of her life in that area of California -- would have spelled those names correctly, he said. Handwriting experts Michael Nattenberg and Marcel Matley said they used Virginia Adams' writing samples provided by her grandson to reach their conclusion that it was her penmanship. Matthew Adams said his belief that she was not the author of the notations is based on copies of the envelopes given to him by Peter. \\"I just looked at them myself,\\" Adams said. \\"I did not hire experts.\\" Norsigian's team also said the locations of the photographs, which were taken around San Francisco and Yosemite, helped prove their case. \\"The fact that these locations were well-known to Adams, and visited by him, further supports the proposition that all of the images in the collection were most probably created by Adams,\\" said art expert Robert Moeller. Matthew Adams said that circumstantial evidence was unconvincing, since several other highly skilled photographers were known to shoot at the same places around the same period. Even if Norsigian's glass plates are authentic Ansel Adams photographs, they would have mostly historical value, \\"not anywhere near\\" the 200 million estimate given by Streets, Adams said. Streets said his estimate was based on decades of print sales and rights fees. \\"There will always be a demand for Ansel Adams' work,\\" he said. \\"The long-term potential is very easy to prove for these.\\" \\"You can't print original photographs from them because Ansel's not around to print them,\\" Matthew Adams said. \\"Anything you make from them you would have to say is an unknown interpretation of something that may be Ansel's.\\" The Ansel Adams Gallery is still producing prints, but with a printer who was trained by Adams. The iconic artist died in 1984 at the age of 82. \\"A lot of the magic that he created was in the darkroom making the print,\\" his grandson said. \\"Ansel's not around to tell us how he would have printed it.\\" Streets countered Adams, saying, \\"It's not a mysterious process.\\" \\"There are master printmakers who are making prints today,\\" he said. Norsigian has contracted with Jesse Kallisher, whose prints hang in the Smithsonian and the Louvre museums, to produce original fine arts prints from the negatives, Streets said. While Matthew Adams is unconvinced, he doesn't doubt that Norsigian is sincere in his belief that he has Ansel Adams negatives. \\"I think that they do believe it, but I don't think that they have proven it,\\" he said. He doesn't agree, however, with Turnage's charge that it's a \\"con job.\\" \\"My take on it is that it is irresponsible to present them as Ansel's,\\" Matthew Adams said. Norsigian, a painter for the Fresno school system, kept the glass plates under his pool table for four years before realizing they might be too valuable to store at home. He believes they were from Adams' early career, a period that is not well documented since a 1937 darkroom fire destroyed 5,000 of his plates. \\"It truly is a missing link of Ansel Adams and history and his career,\\" Streets said. Norsigian, who scours garage sales for antiques, was looking for a barber chair when he spotted two deteriorated boxes in the spring of 2000. When he pulled one of the glass negatives out, he saw Yosemite. \\"As a young man, I worked at Yosemite quite a bit. So, right away I recognized it as Yosemite,\\" Norsigian said. He bargained with the seller, finally negotiating the price for the boxes down from 70 to 45. The owner said he bought them in the 1940s at a warehouse salvage sale in Los Angeles. It would be two years before Norsigian realized the photos might be from Adams, he said. After four years, he had done enough research to realize the plates could be valuable. He moved them from under his pool table and placed them in a bank vault. How these 6.5-inch x 8.5-inch glass plate negatives of famous Yosemite landscapes and San Francisco landmarks -- some of them showing fire damage -- might have made their way from Adams' collection 70 years ago to a Southern California garage sale in 2000 can only be guessed. Photography expert Patrick Alt, who helped confirm the authenticity of the negatives, suspects Adams carried them to use in a photography class he was teaching in Pasadena, California, in the early 1940s. \\"It is my belief that he brought these negatives with him for teaching purposes and to show students how to not let their negatives be engulfed in a fire,\\" Alt said. \\"I think this clearly explains the range of work in these negatives, from very early pictorialist boat pictures, to images not as successful, to images of the highest level of his work during this time period.\\" Alt said it is impossible to know why Adams would store them in Pasadena and never reclaim them. For now, the photos will go on a tour of universities and museums, starting in October at Fresno State University, Norsigian said. \\"I just hope everybody enjoys them,\\" he said. Norsigian said he has not spoken with the man who sold him the two boxes a decade ago. \\"If he's still around, I'm afraid he may come looking for me,\\" he said. Norsigian, who is 64, is still working but said he may retire this year.","response":"- A garage sale purchase of glass plates claimed to be negatives from Ansel Adams sparked anger and disbelief from those overseeing Adams' trust and his grandson, who runs the Ansel Adams Gallery. - Art dealer David W.

Why? Can you also give me reference in literature that proves why? Question 2: Why do you think syndicating content is important? Also share a few platforms that you follow. Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","response":"Question 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. They address two separate topics. I will provide detailed answers for both questions. Question 1: Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a standard protocol used to exchange information between network devices, allowing administrators to monitor and manage these devices. Integrating SNMP into an active measurement platform can be challenging for several reasons: 1. Scope and Complexity: SNMP is a complex protocol that covers various aspects of network management, from device configuration to performance metrics. In an active measurement platform, multiple protocols and tools need to be assimilated to efficiently monitor different types of network devices and their underlying metrics. SNMP's complexity may pose a challenge in such integration. 2. Protocol Variations: SNMP comes in several versions, such as SNMPv1, SNMPv2c, and SNMPv3, each with its own specifications and features. Implementing SNMP support in an active measurement platform requires accommodating these variations, which can be challenging. 3. Security Issues: SNMP, especially in its earlier versions, has notable security vulnerabilities, including weak authentication and authorization mechanisms. Incorporating SNMP into an active measurement platform requires addressing these security concerns to protect the monitored devices and the collected data. 4. Scalability: Network monitoring platforms often need to support a large number of devices and frequent monitoring intervals. SNMP's polling-based approach may lead to congestion and inefficient consumption of network resources in large-scale deployments. A reference in literature that elaborates on the challenges of integrating SNMP into an active measurement platform is \\"SNMP at the edge: taking the challenges\\" by Mark Burgess (2002), which can be found here: https://www.usenix.org/legacy/publications/library/proceedings/lisa02/tech/Burgess.pdf. Question 2: Syndicating content is important for several reasons: 1. Increased Exposure: Content syndication allows your content to reach a wider audience, extending its reach beyond your website or social media channels. This increased exposure ultimately leads to higher traffic and greater visibility for your brand. 2. SEO Benefits: Syndicating content on reputable platforms can contribute to improved search engine rankings. These platforms create credible backlinks to your original content, signaling search engines that your content is valuable and trustworthy. 3. Establishing Authority: Building relationships with reputable content syndication platforms showcases your content alongside other established industry leaders. This association improves your credibility and authority in your field. 4. Time and Resource Efficiency: Creating quality content requires significant time and resources. By syndicating your content, you can make better use of your existing content and increase its impact without having to create more new material. A few popular content syndication platforms include: 1. Medium (https://medium.com/): A blogging platform that allows you to republish content, reaching a wider audience. 2. Reddit (https://www.reddit.com/): A social networking and discussion forum where you can share links to your content. 3.

I ' m trying not to be sentimental , though . It 's the 19th - century equivalent of a double - wide , after all . What may be the reason for them not wanting to be sentimental ?","response":"The individual in question appears to be consciously trying not to be sentimental about the house where their brother was born, which might now be gone or demolished. There could be various reasons for them not wanting to be sentimental about the situation. Some possible reasons include: 1. Acceptance of change: People often realize that change is an inherent part of life, and dwelling on the past or holding onto sentimental feelings for a place or object may hinder their ability to adapt and move forward. By not being sentimental about the house, they might be trying to accept the changes happening in their lives and focus on the present or the future. 2. Emotional self-regulation: Showing strong emotions or being overly sentimental about certain situations might make some individuals uncomfortable or vulnerable. Therefore, they may actively try to suppress or reduce their sentimentality in such situations as a way to maintain control over their emotions and protect themselves from any potential distress. 3. Fear of judgment: It is possible that the individual does not want to be perceived as overly emotional or weak by others for being sentimental about a house. They could be afraid of being judged or ridiculed for expressing their emotions or nostalgia, especially if others might not view the house as something worth cherishing. 4. Rationality over emotions: Some people place a higher emphasis on logic and rationality rather than emotional attachment. They might not want to be sentimental about the house because they consider it to be the 19th-century equivalent of a double-wide, meaning it might carry less historical or architectural importance and therefore not be worth the emotional attachment. 5. Detachment as a coping mechanism: It is possible that the individual has experienced loss or change in the past that they struggled to cope with, leading them to adopt emotional detachment as a coping mechanism. In this case, not wanting to be sentimental may help them to avoid experiencing emotional pain or feelings of loss in relation to the house. 6. Influence of cultural norms: Cultural factors can also impact how people express and deal with emotions. In some cultures, sentimentality and emotional expression might be discouraged or viewed as signs of weakness. As a result, the individual may consciously try to avoid being sentimental about the house to adhere to these cultural norms and expectations. In conclusion, there could be numerous reasons why the individual might not want to be sentimental about the house where their brother was born. Factors such as personal emotional regulation, fear of judgment, cultural norms, and coping mechanisms might contribute to their desire to distance themselves from sentimentality in this particular situation."},{"question":"Given the question: What would be the ★-rating of this review (★ being the lowest and ★★★★★ being the highest)? \\"Good\\" The answer is:","response":"To rate the given review, I will consider the following steps: 1.

Assuming you can only obtain information about one entity in the passage, your job is to determine whether information from the passage can be used to answer the question. Indicate your choice as \`a\` for Yes or \`b\` for No. Input: Question: Is the company that originally signed the Rising Sons based in the same state as the one that released their 1992 album? Passage:In 1964 he moved to Santa Monica, California, and formed Rising Sons with fellow blues rock musician Ry Cooder and Jessie Lee Kincaid, landing a record deal with Columbia Records soon after. The group was one of the first interracial bands of the period, which likely made them commercially unviable. An album was never released (though a single was) and the band soon broke up, though Legacy Records did release The Rising Sons Featuring Taj Mahal and Ry Cooder in 1992 with material from that period. During this time Mahal was working with others, musicians like Howlin' Wolf, Buddy Guy, Lightnin' Hopkins, and Muddy Waters. Mahal stayed with Columbia after the Rising Sons to begin his solo career, releasing the self-titled Taj Mahal in 1968, The Natch'l Blues in 1969, and Giant Step/De Old Folks at Home with Kiowa session musician Jesse Ed Davis from Oklahoma, who played guitar and piano (also in 1969). During this time he and Cooder worked with the Rolling Stones, with whom he has performed at various times throughout his career. In 1968, he performed in the film The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus. He recorded a total of twelve albums for Columbia from the late 1960s into the 1970s. His work of the 1970s was especially important, in that his releases began incorporating West Indian and Caribbean music, jazz and reggae into the mix. In 1972, he acted in and wrote the film score for the movie Sounder, which starred Cicely Tyson. He reprised his role and returned as composer in the sequel, Part 2, Sounder.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Petrus Christus placed his sitter in a naturalistic setting rather than a flat and featureless background. This approach was in part a reaction against van der Weyden, who, in his emphasis on sculptural figures, utilised very shallow pictorial spaces. In his 1462 Portrait of a Man, Dieric Bouts went further by situating the man in a room complete with a window that looks out at a landscape, while in the 16th century, the full-length portrait became popular in the north. The latter format was practically unseen in earlier northern art, although it had a tradition in Italy going back centuries, most usually in fresco and illuminated manuscripts. Full-length portraits were reserved for depictions of the highest echelon of society, and were associated with princely displays of power. Of the second generation of northern painters, Hans Memling became the leading portraitist, taking commissions from as far as Italy. He was highly influential on later painters and is credited with inspiring Leonardo's positioning of the Mona Lisa in front of a landscape view. Van Eyck and van der Weyden similarly influenced the French artist Jean Fouquet and the Germans Hans Pleydenwurff and Martin Schongauer among others.The Netherlandish artists moved away from the profile view – popularised during the Italian Quattrocento – towards the less formal but more engaging three-quarter view. At this angle, more than one side of the face is visible as the sitter's body is rotated towards the viewer. This pose gives a better view of the shape and features of the head and allows the sitter to look out towards the viewer. The gaze of the sitter rarely engages the viewer. Van Eyck's 1433 Portrait of a Man is an early example, which shows the artist himself looking at the viewer. Although there is often direct eye contact between subject and viewer, the look is normally detached, aloof and uncommunicative, perhaps to reflect the subject's high social position. There are exceptions, typically in bridal portraits or in the case of potential... The answer to this question is:","response":"Hans Memling"},{"question":"Given the rationale, provide a reasonable question and answer. Step-by-step reasoning process: 1/30 + 1/40 = 7/120 120/7 = 17 1/7 days The question and answer:","response":"Question: If a person does 1/30 of a task in a day and another person does 1/40 of the same task in a day, how long will it take for both of them to complete the task when working together? Answer: It will take them 17 1/7 days to complete the task when working together. Step-by-step reasoning process: 1. First, you need to determine the combined working speed of both persons. To do this, you add their respective fractions representing the portion of the task each person completes in a day: 1/30 + 1/40 2. To add these fractions, you need a common denominator. In this case, the lowest common denominator for 30 and 40 is 120. Then, convert each fraction to an equivalent form with the common denominator: (1/30) * (4/4) = 4/120 (1/40) * (3/3) = 3/120 3. Now, add the numerators of the equivalent fractions: 4/120 + 3/120 = 7/120 It means that, together, they complete 7/120 of the task in one day. 4. To find how many days it takes for them to complete the task, you need to divide the entire task (represented by 1) by the combined working speed of both persons (7/120): 1 ÷ (7/120) = 1 * (120/7) = 120/7 5. To express the fraction 120/7 as a mixed number: 120 ÷ 7 = 17 with a remainder of 1 Hence, the time it takes for both of them to complete the task when working together is 17 1/7 days."},{"question":"How is \\"Banca de Economii S.A. lanseaza serviciul ECONOM.MD ce vine sa reduca grijile de zi cu zi a locuitorilor Moldovei.\\" said in Russian?","response":"\\"Bанк Экономии OАО запускает сервис ECONOM.MD, который призван облегчить повседневные заботы жителей Молдовы.\\" Let me explain to you like we are talking about a toy store.

This involves the following sub-steps: 1. Courtship and mating: Once the nest has been built, the bird pair engages in courtship rituals to strengthen their bond. These rituals often involve singing, elaborate displays, or gift-giving, depending on the species. The birds then mate to fertilize the eggs, with the male transferring sperm to the female, usually via cloacal contact. 2. Egg-laying and incubation: After successful mating, the female bird will lay the fertilized eggs in the nest. The number of eggs varies depending on the species and environmental factors, such as availability of food resources and the season. Incubation starts soon after the first egg is laid. Both the male and female bird may take turns incubating the eggs, or in some species, only one parent takes this responsibility. Incubation ensures that the eggs are kept at a consistent temperature to support the proper development of the embryos. This period typically lasts anywhere from 11-85 days, depending on the species and other factors like size, the brood type, and environmental conditions. 3. Hatching and parental care: As the eggs reach the end of the incubation period, the baby birds, called chicks, hatch from their eggs. This may happen at the same time or over several days, depending on the species. Once hatched, the chicks are reliant on their parents for food, warmth, and protection. During this stage, the parent birds provide their chicks with food, which may include insects, seeds, or other food items, depending on the species. They may also teach the chicks how to hunt or forage for themselves. Parent birds will also keep the nest clean and protect their young from predators and other potential threats. 4. Fledging and independence: As the chicks develop and grow, they acquire the necessary skills and strength to leave the nest and become independent. This stage, known as fledging, generally occurs when the chicks are strong enough to fly or glide short distances on their own. During this stage, the parent birds continue to provide support and guidance as the fledglings learn and refine their necessary life skills. Once the fledglings have gained enough strength, they disperse from their natal area and venture into the world as independent individuals. They will continue to learn and explore as they grow into adulthood, eventually finding a mate and starting the life cycle anew by reproducing and raising their own offspring, thus completing the cycle."},{"question":"I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the name of the person that sang on the theme song of \\"Ken\\"? ?

Answer:","response":"The heir apparent of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1914 was Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria. He was born on December 18, 1863, in Graz, Austria, and was the eldest son of Archduke Karl Ludwig of Austria, the younger brother of Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria. Archduke Franz Ferdinand was formally known as Franz Ferdinand Karl Ludwig Joseph Maria of Austria, and he was a member of the House of Habsburg, one of the most powerful royal families in European history. As the heir presumptive to the throne, he held the title of Archduke of Austria-Este, a title primarily used by the heirs apparent to the Habsburg rulers since the 15th century. While Emperor Franz Joseph's relations with his nephew were somewhat strained due to Franz Ferdinand's unconventional marriage to Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg, a lady-in-waiting who was not of equal rank or with the equal royal lineage required for a Habsburg marriage, Franz Ferdinand's position as the heir apparent was not contested. Emperor Franz Joseph eventually gave his blessing to the marriage, but it resulted in a morganatic union, meaning Sophie and her descendants would not have a claim to the Habsburg titles or the throne. Despite the controversy surrounding his personal life, Franz Ferdinand was known to have progressive ideas for the future governance of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. He recognized the need for political, military, and economic reform to address the increasing tensions among the empire's numerous ethnic groups, as well as to solidify the empire's position against its rivals in Europe. However, Franz Ferdinand's time as heir apparent would be tragically cut short due to his assassination on June 28, 1914, by Gavrilo Princip, a Bosnian Serb nationalist part of the Black Hand secret society. The assassination sparked a chain of events that led to the outbreak of World War I, as the Austro-Hungarian Empire issued an ultimatum to Serbia, leading to a web of alliances being activated across Europe, plunging the continent into a devastating conflict. Following the assassination of Franz Ferdinand and his wife, the next heir presumptive to the throne became Archduke Karl Franz Joseph, the grandnephew of Emperor Franz Joseph, who would later ascend the throne as Emperor Karl I of Austria and King Charles IV of Hungary. Unfortunately, World War I would bring the downfall of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, leading to its dissolution and the end of the Habsburg rule in 1918."},{"question":"Q: Passage: The Qin dynasty (Chinese: 秦 朝; pinyin: Qín Cháo; Wade -- Giles: Ch'in Ch'ao) was the first dynasty of Imperial China, lasting from 221 to 206 BC. Named for its heartland of Qin, in modern-day Gansu and Shaanxi, the dynasty was founded by the Qin state and its founding emperor took the title Qin Shi Huang, the First Emperor of Qin. The strength of the Qin state was greatly increased by the \\"Legalist\\" reforms of Shang Yang in the fourth century BC, during the Warring States period. In the mid and late third century BC, the Qin state carried out a series of swift conquests, first ending the powerless Zhou dynasty, and eventually conquering the other six of the Seven Warring States. It is the shortest major dynasty in Chinese history, lasting only 15 years with two emperors, but the imperial system it inaugurated lasted, with interruptions and adaptation, until 1911.

(Tom Gannam/Reuters) After the desecration of a Jewish cemetery in St. Louis over the long holiday weekend, an incident in which more than 150 headstones were toppled or damaged, two American Muslim activists started a fundraiser to help pay for needed repairs. “Through this campaign, we hope to send a united message from the Jewish and Muslim communities that there is no place for this type of hate, desecration, and violence in America,” the fundraising page on the site LaunchingGood reads. “We pray that this restores a sense of security and peace to the Jewish-American community who has undoubtedly been shaken by this event.” Within a few hours of going up Tuesday afternoon, the page had exceeded its goal of raising 20,000. Tarek El-Messidi, who created the campaign with fellow activist Linda Sarsour said when he saw the news about the vandalism at Chesed Shel Emeth Society cemetery in the St. Louis suburb of University City, he was reminded of a story about the prophet Muhammad, who had stood up when a Jewish funeral procession passed. When asked why, he said, “Is it not a human soul?” “That story goes to show more than anything the humanity of the prophet. … We should bring the story to life here and show every person deserves to rest in peace,” El-Messidi said. “This is a great way to show respect and honor for our Jewish cousins.” Missouri authorities are investigating after dozens of headstones were damaged at a Jewish cemetery near St.Louis. (AP) Through his nonprofit, Celebrate Mercy, El-Messidi’s mission is to not only educate people about the prophet’s teachings but also to rally Muslims to respond to evil with good. A national Muslim leader in Knoxville, Tenn., he helped launch a Muslim-led fundraiser for the victims of the San Bernardino terrorist attack in 2015 that ultimately raised more than 215,000. In 2012, after the attacks on U.S. diplomatic facilities in Benghazi that killed Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans, El-Messidi called on Muslims to write condolence letters to the Stevens’s family and presented 8,000 of them to Steven’s sister that Thanksgiving. [American Muslims ‘grieve for the victims like any other human being,’ raise more than 170,000 for San Bernardino families] Since the rise of hate crime incidents after the November election, both Muslim and Jewish communities in the United States have been targeted, their institutions are threatened, their people bullied. It’s a shared experience that is bringing them together in solidarity, El-Messidi said. “This is really a human issue,” he said. “But out of this horrible election cycle, something beautiful has come out of it and [Muslims and Jews have] bonded together to support each other and stand up to this hate. Politics can get in the way of our basic humanity; I hope this breaks through all those walls, no pun intended, to help bring us closer together.” To underscore this point, El-Messidi shared a message he received from a woman named Barbara: You have helped to heal the pain in my heart. I live in Los Angeles but was born and raised in St. Louis. I have family buried in that cemetery and was heartbroken seeing the desecration of the final resting place of some of my loved ones. Your kind and loving spirit gives hope to me that we can have mutual respect and tolerance of our differences and shared humanity. Bless you. El-Messidi said he has been communicating with the director of the cemetery who was going to send him an exact estimate of the damages, but he doesn’t have that figure yet. If they raise more than is needed, he said they will keep a leftover fund that will be used to counter anti-Semitic hate.

However, a simple sentence might not align with the request for a \\"detailed and long answer.\\" So, I will not only provide a sentence in Spanish but also explain a little about Spanish language structure and provide a translation for the sentence. Spanish is a Romance language that originated in the Iberian Peninsula of Europe. Today, it's a global language with nearly 500 million native speakers, mainly in Spain and the Americas. It follows a subject-verb-object (SVO) structure in common with other Romance languages, such as French and Italian. For example: \\"El gato negro está durmiendo en el sofá.\\" This sentence translates to \\"The black cat is sleeping on the sofa\\" in English. Let's break it down: - \\"El gato negro\\" (The black cat) is the subject, with 'El' being the definite article equating to 'The', 'gato' is the noun meaning 'cat', and 'negro' is an adjective meaning 'black'. In Spanish, adjectives usually come after the noun they describe, which is the opposite of English. - \\"está durmiendo\\" (is sleeping) is the verb phrase. 'Está' is the third person form of the verb 'estar' (to be), which is used for temporary states, and 'durmiendo' is the present participle of 'dormir' (to sleep). This construction forms the present continuous tense, similar to English. - \\"en el sofá\\" (on the sofa) is a prepositional phrase. 'En' means 'on', 'el' is the definite article 'the', and 'sofá' is the noun 'sofa'. So not only did you get a sentence in Spanish, but you can see how sentence structure works in the language. Such knowledge would be helpful if you're studying Spanish or gearing up for a visit to a Spanish-speaking country. Make sure to get the pronunciation and intonation right when speaking it because Spanish is a phonetic language, meaning you pronounce it as you write it. Also, Spanish is also known for its varied and vibrant regional dialects, so don't be surprised if you hear a wide array of accents and vocabulary changes. Remember to use the formal \\"usted\\" when speaking to elders or superiors, and \\"tú\\" or \\"vos\\" when speaking to friends or those your age. \\"Ustedes\\" is used to refer to a group of people formally, and \\"vosotros\\" informally. These language norms are crucial in terms of showing respect and politeness in Spanish societies."},{"question":"Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: The movie opens with outlaws Jack Colby (Lee Van Cleef), Ben Miller (Sheb Wooley), and Jim Pierce (Robert Wilke) meeting up on horseback and riding into the small town of Hadleyville on a Sunday morning. As church bells ring out, the townspeople eye the notorious gang warily.

With that in mind, a brief sentence could be \\"The sun sets gracefully, casting vivid hues across the sky,\\" but allow me to expand upon this statement and transform it into a detailed and immersive analysis. The sun, as a symbol of life, warmth, and energy, descends at the end of each day, in a phenomenon known as the sunset, giving way to the tranquil darkness of the night. A sunset is not simply a moment when the sun disappears below the horizon; rather, it is a breathtaking and emotive spectacle that has inspired creative minds for centuries, from literary classics and poetry to stunning masterpieces of visual arts. Due to the significance of the sun as an essential, almost divine, source of light, vigor, and inspiration, the process of setting can be described as graceful. This daily visual performance adorns the sky with an explosion of vibrant and vivid hues which differ each passing day, creating a mesmerizing and captivating palette, impossible to replicate in any form of art. A cascade of warm colors ranging from saturated reds, energetic oranges, and soft yellows, intermixed with soothing shades of blue, purple, and pink, dances across the boundless canvas of sky, indicating that the day is transitioning into the mysterious and serene embrace of the night. This ephemeral phenomenon briefly unites observers from all walks of life, as they pause and marvel at the majesty and beauty of nature's farewell to the day. Sunsets have inspired generations of poets, writers, and artists to capture their essence through various creative forms and expressions. Many works of literature metaphorically use the sunset as an allegory for the end of a phase or chapter in life, denoting change and inevitable progression. These colorful yet fleeting moments serve as a reminder that all events in life, no matter how seemingly monumental or insignificant, will eventually come to an end, compelling us to live each moment to its fullest and appreciate the transient beauty that surrounds us. In conclusion, sunsets are not only delightful natural displays that captivate our senses but also evoke profound reflections on the impermanence of life and the eternal cycle of transformation. By observing and appreciating such awe-inspiring visions, we ultimately connect with our innermost essence and celebrate the eternal dance of light and darkness, joy and sorrow, and all the intricate elements that compose the human experience."},{"question":"Data: name = Giraffe, eatType = pub, food = Italian, area = city centre, familyFriendly = no.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","response":"To examine the effect of the perturbation hypothesis (less fat being processed) on the process of oxygen delivery to the bloodstream, we will go step-by-step through the process and justify the potential implications at each step. 1. You breathe in: When an individual breathes in, they are bringing oxygen-rich air into their lungs. This step wouldn't be affected by the processing of less fat, as it is primarily concerned with external inhalation. 2. Air goes through the little branches in the lungs to fill up the air sacs (alveoli): The distribution of air into the alveoli is also unlikely to be affected by the processing of less fat since it pertains to the mechanical aspect of ventilation. 3. Oxygen goes through the walls of the alveoli and into the capillaries: This step involves the diffusion of oxygen from the alveoli into the bloodstream. It is unlikely that less fat processing would have a direct effect on this process. 4. Oxygen goes into the bloodstream: Here, oxygen is transported through the bloodstream to the body's tissues. While fat metabolism can affect energy production and overall metabolism indirectly, it is not directly involved in the process of oxygen delivery to the blood stream. 5. Oxygen is left and carbon dioxide is picked up: In tissues, oxygen diffuses from the bloodstream into the cells, while carbon dioxide produced during cellular metabolism diffuses into the bloodstream. Although fat metabolism can affect the production of carbon dioxide, it doesn't directly impact the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide at the cellular level. 6. You breathe it out through your lungs: Exhalation of carbon dioxide-rich air is also not directly affected by the processing of less fat. In summary, the perturbation hypothesis of less fat being processed is unlikely to have a direct effect on the greater amount of oxygen being delivered to the blood stream. The process of oxygen delivery is predominantly a respiratory and circulatory function, rather than being directly related to fat metabolism."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Title: junk Product review: This product is not accurate at all (error is often bigger than 1mm).

A butcher knife A:","response":"Title: The Crimson Stiletto Genre: Crime, Mystery, Drama Brief Synopsis: A serial killer terrorizes a small and seedy town, targeting prostitutes and gruesomely murdering them. As the mysterious murders pile up, a determined detective struggles to find the truth while confronting dark secrets of his own. As he inches closer, it becomes apparent that the key to solving this heinous crime lies in the killer's weapon of choice - a butcher knife. Plot: Act 1: The film is set in the gloomy little town of Brookside. Regularly frequented by prostitutes and drug addicts, the town has developed a notorious reputation. The story begins with the murder of a young prostitute in a disturbingly gory fashion. She is found in her room with stab and slash wounds from a butcher knife. Detective John Callahan and his partner, Ella Matthews, take on the case. Both detectives have personal reasons for wanting to find the killer. John's sister was a victim of a similar murder years ago, and Ella is a survivor of domestic abuse. Act 2: In the days that follow, the town is rocked by an increasingly violent string of murders, with each victim being a prostitute. John and Ella search for clues to find the killer. They learn a local store had a butcher knife recently stolen, further pointing to the weapon's significance. As the detectives delve deeper into the case, they uncover Brookside's dark underbelly - a place filled with corruption, betrayal, and secrets. Unbeknownst to them, their investigation sets off a dangerous game of cat-and-mouse with the mysterious killer. During their investigation, John and Ella battle their inner demons. John struggles with a growing dependency on alcohol to cope with the emotional trauma of his sister's unsolved murder, while Ella confronts her past as she learns her abusive ex-husband might be involved in the case. Act 3: As the death count rises, the town becomes increasingly frantic. John and Ella put the pieces together and reveal the identity of the serial killer – a local butcher, Henry. He spent his life around the sharpness of butcher knives and was driven to insanity by his abusive childhood and a tragic series of personal losses. Throughout the film, Henry wears a crimson disguise resembling a stiletto to leave his signature mark on his victims. The climax unfolds with a tense confrontation between Detective Callahan and Henry, culminating in a physical battle. Henry reveals the reason for using the butcher knife; it symbolizes the brutal and inhumane treatment he went through during his own life, and he believes it is the only way to show the world the darkness it hides. In the end, John – fueled by the lingering anger and pain from his sister's murder – overpowers Henry in a visceral struggle and recovers the notorious butcher knife. Henry is arrested and held accountable for his crimes. The climax serves to bring closure and a small sense of justice to both John and the town of Brookside. Resolution: Through teamwork and their shared goal to seek justice for the victims, John and Ella overcome their respective personal struggles and form a strong bond. They continue to work together and stand up against the dangers lurking in Brookside, vowing to bring peace and redemption to the crime-plagued town. The movie concludes with the image of the bloody butcher knife being locked away as evidence, signifying the end of the Crimson Stiletto's reign of terror."},{"question":"More or less Ginny Travers was presenting BBNs solution from an ADL prototype that extended ADLs Sample Runtime to allow for nonJS based interaction with the API See more information on it here What is the correctly punctuated version of this sentence?","response":"More or less, Ginny Travers was presenting BBN's solution from an ADL prototype that extended ADL's Sample Runtime to allow for non-JS-based interaction with the API.

Her mouth slightly agape, tears stream down her face as she glances around the inside of a helicopter with confusion in her eyes. She looks completely exhausted, overcome with emotion. She cries the whole flight to safety. The Iraqi air force and fighters with the Kurdish peshmerga carried out a dramatic rescue mission Monday at Mount Sinjar, taking supplies to desperate Yazidis and ferrying a handful of people out, including Aziza. A CNN crew was on the flight that took diapers, milk, water and food to the site where thousands of people have been driven by ISIS, which calls itself the Islamic State. More than a week ago, they fled into the surrounding mountains when","response":"ISIS fighters swept through their town, targeting the Yazidis, a religious minority group in the region. The United Nations reports that tens of thousands of people -- men, women, and children -- were stranded on the barren mountaintop with limited access to food, water, and shelter. As temperatures soar above 100°F during the day and plummet to near freezing at night, the fear and desperation of those trapped has increased as each day passes. The rescue mission, coordinated by the Iraqi air force and Kurdish peshmerga fighters, was a critical attempt to save those in dire need of assistance as other nations, such as the United States and European countries, are providing humanitarian aid and military support to the region. With the stakes higher than ever and risks increasing every day, these heroes embarked on an operation filled with uncertainty and peril. As the helicopter touched down on the rocky terrain of Mount Sinjar, peshmerga fighters quickly descended and began offloading the much-needed supplies of food, water, and milk. Yazidis, weak from hunger, dehydration, and exhaustion, approached the aircraft with cautious hope. Among the desperate throng, Aziza stood out as one of the few selected to board the helicopter for a flight to safety. Her eyes, filled with both tears and relief, reflect the life-changing moment as she is whisked away from certain death. Despite successfully rescuing Aziza and a handful of others, thousands of Yazidis remain trapped on the treacherous slopes of Mount Sinjar. Stories of unimaginable suffering and cruelty at the hands of ISIS have spread throughout the international community, further fueling the urgency for intervention. World leaders and humanitarian organizations have denounced the brutal ISIS tactics, including the systematic targeting of religious minorities like the Yazidis and the forcible conversions, abductions, and horrors they have faced. Yet as the sun sets on the desolate mountain, hope flickers for the Yazidis still stranded on its slopes. With every successful rescue mission and every outcry from the international community, their chances for a better future grow stronger. The world is watching and rallying support in a collective effort to protect and preserve the lives of these innocent people. In the tears of 15-year-old Aziza streaming down her face, we see the embodiment of a heart-wrenching struggle and a testament to the unwavering resilience of the human spirit. Saving Aziza and the few others that day may seem insignificant in comparison to the plight of thousands, but as the world continues to bear witness to the atrocities unfolding in Iraq, it stands as proof that hope and humanity are not yet lost. And as the countless Yazidis found solace in their rescue by brave men and women who risked their lives for them, it is a spark of hope that will ultimately guide the international community to broader and more sustained interventions to alleviate the suffering of tens of thousands still trapped on the mountainside, fearing for their lives."},{"question":"Math problem: Solve 800 - 424 = -39*q + 532 for q. What is the solution?","response":"To solve for q in the equation 800 - 424 = -39*q + 532, we will follow these steps: Step 1. Simplify both sides of the equation if possible. On the left side of the equation, subtract 424 from 800 to get 376. On the right side, there's nothing to simplify. So, the equation becomes: 376 = -39*q + 532. Step 2: Isolate the q term. To do this, we'll get rid of the 532 on the right side by performing the same operation on both sides of the equation. We subtract 532 from both sides, so: 376 - 532 = -39*q + 532 -532 Which simplifies to -156 = -39*q Step 3: Solve for q by dividing both sides by -39: So, -156/-39 = -39*q/-39 This simplifies to q = 4 So, the solution is q = 4."},{"question":"pick from the following.

Carl Wayne Anderson is a homeless, deaf-mute Vietnam veteran accused of murdering Elizabeth Quinn, a file clerk at the Justice Department. Kathleen Riley is the beleaguered Federal Public Defender assigned to represent Anderson. An agribusiness lobbyist who normally works on Capitol Hill, Eddie Sanger, is made a member of the jury and begins investigating the details of the murder himself, eventually teaming up with Riley to solve the case. We see some early scenes of Sanger's work as a lobbyist on Capitol Hill, including his efforts to win passage of a bill by seducing a Congresswoman. While not relevant to the movie's plot, these scenes are establishing shots giving us a sense for Sanger as a charming, though somewhat ruthless, person.The movie begins around Christmas with the suicide of a United States Supreme Court Justice, for which no explanation or context is given. We only see the Justice making a tape recording and then shooting himself. Shortly after the Justice's suicide, Elizabeth Quinn's body is found floating in the Potomac river, and Carl Wayne Anderson is arrested for the crime, based almost entirely on the fact that he was found sleeping in Quinn's car, which was abandoned in the parking lot where she worked (and was mostly deserted at night). Anderson explains that he found it unlocked and was just looking for a warm place to sleep since it was the dead of winter. But since he was homeless, had no alibi, and was found in Quinn's car, he was arrested for her murder. The establishing scenes show Riley trying to communicate with Anderson and realizing that he is a deaf-mute. Over time, she begins to penetrate his hard exterior and he tries to cooperate with her efforts to mount a defense for him.In the District of Columbia, all crimes are tried in the federal courts, so a murder trial that would normally be in state court was in federal court instead.

Possible A: enjoy, tasty, health problems, hunger, indigestion Why is \\"tasty\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? The answer is:","response":"\\"Tasty\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it directly addresses a fundamental aspect of human experience and preferences when it comes to food consumption. In general, people tend to eat food that they find enjoyable and flavorful. This proclivity for seeking out palatable meals and snacks is the result of a combination of factors, including evolution, biology, and individual experiences. From an evolutionary perspective, finding food tasty serves a critical function in encouraging humans to consume the necessary nutrients and energy sources to survive and thrive. When a person finds a particular food, such as a hamburger, tasty, they are more likely to consume it again in the future, which can contribute to their ongoing search for sustenance. Additionally, tastiness also signals that the food is likely safe to eat, as historically, our ancestors often associated bitter or sour tastes with potential toxins or harmful substances. Biologically, the sensation of taste is mediated by the presence of taste receptors on our tongue, which are specialized cells that are responsible for detecting the presence of different molecules in the food we eat. When the taste receptors sense the molecules responsible for giving food its flavor, they relay that information to the brain, which interprets the signal as a subjective perception of taste. In the case of hamburgers, several factors contribute to their tastiness, such as the satisfying umami taste of the meat, the combination of spices and seasonings, and the interplay between textures (e.g., the crunchiness of lettuce, the softness of the bun, and the juicy consistency of the patty). These factors work together to create a pleasurable and memorable eating experience that drives a person to seek out more of that specific food. Additionally, individual experiences and cultural upbringing also play a role in shaping a person's perceptions of tastiness. People raised in environments where hamburgers are a popular and readily available food option might be more likely to enjoy them and crave them than those who grew up without exposure to such meals. Also, the psychological component of comfort brought by familiar tastes and associations with positive memories (e.g., enjoying burgers during family gatherings, celebrations, or social events) can further contribute to the increased appeal of hamburgers. In conclusion, the answer \\"tasty\\" is aligned with human common sense because it addresses the core components of human food preferences, including evolutionary drives, biological processes, individual experiences and cultural factors that shape our perception of the enjoyable flavors in food. Eating hamburgers can be an indulgence that is both satisfying and comforting, and the gratifying taste serves as a powerful motivator for people to continue craving and consuming them."},{"question":"these multiple functions continuously act on the bolted joint to maintain preload and prevent spontaneous bolt loosening — serving as an effective solution for vibration, dynamic loads, settlement and relaxation. further reading: Capitalize this past sentence correctly.","response":"These multiple functions continuously act on the bolted joint to maintain preload and prevent spontaneous bolt loosening — serving as an effective solution for vibration, dynamic loads, settlement, and relaxation.

During this period, the indigenous people lived in caves, hunting the mammals that gathered at the shoreline. The landscape of the valley changed dramatically over the next 200 centuries. The glaciers feeding the lake melted away and the lake evaporated. Fossils tell an obscure story of man's slow and sporadic development. Around 3000 b.c. , native Archaic Indians began to develop a lasting hunting and gathering culture. By this time, the valley was in much the same geographic state as it exists in today, with one exception — the presence of artesian springs that bubbled to the surface in several areas. These springs fed a network of streams draining through the Las Vegas Wash to the Colorado River. The areas surrounding the springs were desert oases: sprawling collections of grasses, trees, and wildlife. Many springs lay in areas that would eventually become the center of the modern Las Vegas metropolis. For about 4000 years, the Archaics thrived in a culture that included many signs of early civilization. Signs of even more advancement appeared halfway through the first millennium a.d. , when the Anasazi Indians inhabited the valley. Far more progressive than the Archaics, the Anasazi utilized such formal agricultural techniques as irrigation to assist their harvest. This permitted the Anasazi to achieve a benchmark of advanced society — the ability to live in permanent shelters year-round without need to follow wildlife. Mysteriously, the Anasazi vanished from the valley around a.d.

The term \\"Viking metal\\" has sometimes been used as a nickname for the 1990s Norwegian black metal scene, which was \\"noisy, chaotic, and often augmented by sorrowful keyboard melodies\\". It has also been variously described as a subgenre of black metal, albeit one that abandoned black metal's Satanic imagery, \\"slow black metal\\" with influences from Nordic folk music, straddling black metal and folk metal almost equally, or running the gamut from \\"folk to black to death metal\\". Typically, Viking metal artists rely extensively on keyboards, which are often played at a \\"swift, galloping pace\\". These artists often add \\"local cultural flourishes\\" such as traditional instruments and ethnic melodies. It is similar to folk metal, and is sometimes categorized as such, but it uses folk instruments less extensively. For vocals, Viking metal incorporates both singing and the typical black metal screams and growls. Overall, Viking metal is hard to define since, apart from certain elements like anthem-like choruses, it is not based entirely on musical features and overlaps with other metal genres, with origins in black and death metal Some bands, such as Unleashed and Amon Amarth, play death metal, but incorporate Viking themes and thus are labeled as part of the genre. Generally, Viking metal is defined more by its thematic material and imagery than musical qualities. Rather than being a mock-up of medieval music, \\"it is in the band names, album titles, artwork of album covers and, especially, in the song lyrics that Viking themes are so evident.\\" Viking metal, and the closely related style pagan metal, is more of a term or \\"etiquette\\" than a musical style. Since they are defined chiefly by lyrical focus, any musical categorizations of these two styles is controversial. Thus, Viking metal is more of a cross-genre term than a descriptor of a certain sound. Ashby and Schofield write that \\"The term 'Viking metal' is one of many that falls within a complex web of genres and subgenres, the precise form of which is constantly... Answer:","response":"Viking metal is influenced by three main genres: black metal, folk metal, and death metal. It has its origins in the 1990s Norwegian black metal scene, characterized by its \\"noisy, chaotic, and often augmented by sorrowful keyboard melodies.\\" It also incorporates Nordic folk music influences, straddling between black metal and folk metal. Additionally, some bands like Unleashed and Amon Amarth play death metal but infuse Viking themes, hence being labeled as part of the Viking metal genre."},{"question":"Build a movie plot around this: What do the bombers attack?

Premise: \\"Five youngsters making graffiti.\\" Hypothesis: \\"Some kids tag a wall.\\" Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise? Options: - yes - no - it is not possible to tell A: it is not possible to tell Explain how we arrive at this answer:","response":"In the given natural language inference problem, we have a premise: \\"Five youngsters making graffiti,\\" and a hypothesis: \\"Some kids tag a wall.\\" We are required to determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. Entailment in this context means that the truth of the premise guarantees the truth of the hypothesis, or that the hypothesis is always true if the premise is true. Let's break down the premise and hypothesis. Premise: \\"Five youngsters making graffiti.\\" - Subject: Five youngsters - Action: making graffiti Hypothesis: \\"Some kids tag a wall.\\" - Subject: Some kids - Action: tag a wall The two sentences have related subjects: \\"youngsters\\" and \\"kids.\\" Both terms refer to children or younger individuals. The actions are slightly different, though. \\"Making graffiti\\" implies creating an artistic piece or design, whereas \\"tagging a wall\\" typically refers to marking or writing on a wall (which could be a subset of creating graffiti). However, the two actions are related in that they both involve writing or drawing on a surface. Given the premise, we know that there are five young individuals who are making graffiti. But whether this graffiti constitutes a \\"tag\\" on a wall is unclear. Similarly, we can't determine if the youngsters in the hypothesis are the same as the youngsters in the premise. The sentences are related but not specific enough to conclude that the truth of the premise guarantees the truth of the hypothesis. Therefore, the answer is \\"it is not possible to tell\\" if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."},{"question":"Here is a goal: how to peel a potato How would you accomplish this goal?","response":"To accomplish the goal of peeling a potato, follow these step-by-step instructions: Step 1: Gather necessary tools and items Gather a potato, a potato peeler (or a sharp knife if you don't have a potato peeler), a cutting board, and a bowl or container for the peeled potato. Step 2: Wash the potato Wash the potato by running it under lukewarm water to remove any dirt or impurities. Gently scrub the surface using your hands or a soft brush. This ensures that your peeled potato will be clean. Step 3: Position the potato on the cutting board Place the clean potato on the cutting board, which will provide a steady surface for peeling. Step 4: Grip the potato and the peeler Hold the potato firmly using your non-dominant hand, keeping your fingers away from the area you will be peeling. Hold the potato peeler or knife securely using your dominant hand. Step 5: Begin peeling Using the potato peeler, place the blade at the top of the potato and apply slight pressure while moving the peeler away from your hand, following the curvature of the potato. If using a knife, follow the same process but be cautious not to remove too much of the potato or cut yourself. Step 6: Rotate and repeat Rotate the potato as needed to peel all sides. Continue peeling until the entire potato has been rid of its skin. Step 7: Inspect for missed spots After you have peeled the entire potato, inspect it for any remaining spots of skin or imperfections and remove them using the peeler or knife as necessary. Step 8: Rinse the peeled potato Once the potato has been fully peeled, rinse it under water to remove any remaining bits of skin or debris. Step 9: Store or use the peeled potato Transfer the peeled potato to the bowl or container, or immediately use it for your desired cooking purposes.

Would a Dolce & Gabbana suit wearer be shunned by their Amish cousins? What is the step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the answer: yes?","response":"Step 1: Understand the context First, we need to understand the context of the situation. Dolce & Gabbana is a luxury fashion brand known for its high-priced, fashionable clothing, and the Amish are a religious group that values simplicity, humility, and modesty in their clothing. Step 2: Consider the Amish values Amish people typically wear plain, simple clothing as a symbol of their religious values and commitment to living a modest life. They avoid bright colors, flashy adornments, and fashionable designs that can be considered worldly or self-promoting. Step 3: Contrast Dolce & Gabbana suit with Amish clothing A Dolce & Gabbana suit is the polar opposite of typical Amish attire, as it is often designed to be fashionable, stylish, and expensive – all things that the Amish would generally avoid. Step 4: Determine the potential reaction Now that we've established that a Dolce & Gabbana suit does not align with the Amish values of modesty and simplicity, we can infer that wearing such a suit could potentially be viewed as disrespectful or even offensive to Amish people. Step 5: Consider the concept of shunning Shunning is a practice some Amish communities use to enforce their religious and community values. It involves socially isolating individuals who deviate from these values, and do not engage in repentance. Step 6: Apply the concept of shunning to the situation While wearing a Dolce & Gabbana suit may not be sufficient grounds for formal shunning in all Amish communities, it could certainly strain relationships between the suit-wearer and their Amish cousins, leading to social disapproval or informal shunning. Conclusion: Based on the above reasoning, it is likely that a Dolce & Gabbana suit wearer would be shunned or at least experience social disapproval from their Amish cousins, as their choice of clothing directly conflicts with the religious values and lifestyle of the Amish community."},{"question":"Select your answer from the options.

Think slowly and carefully, before giving your answer.","response":"An American might experience some language barriers at Disneyland Paris, but it is unlikely that they would feel completely lost, due to several factors: 1. Multilingual staff: Disneyland Paris aims to cater to a diverse range of guests, and as a result, many of the staff are multilingual, including speaking English. This means that an American visitor would usually be able to find someone who speaks English, especially among Cast Members who interact with guests directly. 2. Signage and Maps: Signage and park maps in Disneyland Paris are typically provided in multiple languages, including English. This would make navigating the park and understanding essential information manageable for an American visitor. 3. Cultural familiarity: Although there are some differences in the Disney experience between American Disney parks and Disneyland Paris, the core infrastructure, attractions, and entertainment are relatively similar. This familiarity would help an American visitor feel more comfortable in Disneyland Paris, even with potential language barriers. 4. Common language of Disney: The language of Disney movies and characters transcends cultural barriers, as many are familiar to people across the globe, regardless of nationality. This shared appreciation for Disney can help bridge gaps in communication at the park. In conclusion, while an American visitor might encounter some language barriers at Disneyland Paris, they would likely not feel completely lost, thanks to multilingual staff, English signage and maps, cultural and entertainment familiarity, and the shared love for all things Disney."},{"question":"Select the correct sentiment of the following review: This is definitely a 'must see' for those who occasionally smoke a reefer in their secret hide-out, trying to avoid being caught by parents, teachers, the police, etc...

How to seal and stain pressure treated wood decking Remove staining, mildew and old finish with a commercial deck cleaning solution. Pressure washing is almost always a must on older decks, but be sure not to use too much pressure. You can damage the wood if it's turned up too high.","response":"After the step of removing stains, mildew, and old finish with a commercial deck cleaning solution and following up with a pressure wash, the next steps involve drying, sealing, and staining your pressure-treated wood decking. 1. Let it Dry: Once the decking is clean, it's imperative to let the deck dry completely. This may take several days, depending on your local weather conditions. For the sealing and staining to be most effective, the wood should be thoroughly dry so that it can absorb the sealant and stain properly. 2. Sanding: After the deck is completely dry, you can sand any rough spots. To do this, use a power sander or sandpaper to soften splinters and rough edges and prepare the wood for the sealant. Sand in the direction of the grain to avoid gouges. This step will ensure a smooth final finish. 3. Apply the Wood Sealant: Before applying the stain, it's best to apply a wood sealant. The sealant will penetrate the wood and gives protection from within, which is especially necessary for pressure treated decking. Sealants usually come with a garden-spray like nozzle, making them easy to apply. Always follow the specific instructions given on the sealant's packaging. 4. Let the Sealant Dry: Once the sealant is applied, again you would need to allow the deck to dry completely before moving onto the next phase. It's important to have patience during these stages, as rushing the process can affect the durability of the finished project. 5. Apply the Stain: When the deck is dry, you can begin staining. Make sure to choose a stain that's suitable for pressure-treated wood. Use a paint brush or a sprayer to apply the stain. Start at one end of the deck and work your way to the other, staining along the grain of the wood. 6. Allow the Stain to Dry: Just like with the cleaning and sealing processes, it's crucial to let the stain dry completely. Again, this could take a few days depending on weather conditions. Avoid using your deck during this time to prevent smudging or smearing the stain. 7. Apply Additional Coats: Depending on the look and the level of protection you want, you may decide to apply additional coats of stain. Always allow each coat to dry completely before applying the next. 8. Regular Maintenance: Sealed and stained decks aren't maintenance-free. Clean your deck periodically and re-apply sealant and stain as needed to maintain the deck's appearance and longevity. While staining and sealing your deck may seem like a large task, it's certainly doable with a little bit of time and patience. Take care to thoroughly complete each step and you will end up with a beautifully finished, durable space that will serve you for many years to come."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given a dialogue between a user and an assistant, where users and assistants converse about geographic topics like geopolitical entities and locations.

ABKCO Industries was formed in 1968 by Allen Klein as an umbrella company to ABKCO Records. Klein hired May Pang as a receptionist in 1969. Through involvement in a project with ABKCO, Lennon and Ono met her the following year. She became their personal assistant. In 1973, after she had been working with the couple for three years, Ono confided that she and Lennon were becoming estranged. She went on to suggest that Pang should begin a physical relationship with Lennon, telling her, \\"He likes you a lot.\\" Astounded by Ono's proposition, Pang nevertheless agreed to become Lennon's companion. The pair soon left for Los Angeles, beginning an 18-month period he later called his \\"lost weekend\\". In Los Angeles, Pang encouraged Lennon to develop regular contact with Julian, whom he had not seen for two years. He also rekindled friendships with Starr, McCartney, Beatles roadie Mal Evans, and Harry Nilsson. While Lennon was drinking with Nilsson, he misunderstood something that Pang had said and attempted to strangle her. Lennon relented only after he was physically restrained by Nilsson.In June, Lennon and Pang returned to Manhattan in their newly rented penthouse apartment where they prepared a spare room for Julian when he visited them. Lennon, who had been inhibited by Ono in this regard, began to reestablish contact with other relatives and friends. By December, he and Pang were considering a house purchase, and he refused to accept Ono's telephone calls. In January 1975, he agreed to meet Ono, who claimed to have found a cure for smoking. After the meeting, he failed to return home or call Pang. When Pang telephoned the next day, Ono told her that Lennon was unavailable because he was exhausted after a hypnotherapy session. Two days later, Lennon reappeared at a joint dental appointment; he was stupefied and confused to such an extent that Pang believed he had been brainwashed. Lennon told Pang that his separation from Ono was now over, although Ono would allow him to continue seeing her as his mistress.

Kerala's leader is Kochi. What data can be extracted from this sentence?","response":"From the given sentence, we can extract the following data points: 1. Name of the College: The name of the college mentioned is AWH Engineering College. 2. College Location: The college is located in Kerala, which is a state in southern India. 3. Number of Academic Staff: AWH Engineering College has an academic staff strength of 250. 4. Kerala's Leader: The sentence states that Kochi is Kerala's leader. However, the term \\"leader\\" may create confusion, as it has multiple meanings. If the statement is referring to a significant city in Kerala, Kochi could be considered an important city in the locality. However, if the statement is referring to a specific person or a government official, then it may not make sense to associate leadership with Kochi, as it is a city rather than an individual. 5. Geographic Hierarchy: The information provides a sense of geographical hierarchy as well. The engineering college is situated within the larger context of the state of Kerala. However, we do not have any details about the college's specific location within the state. 6. Type of College: As the name suggests, AWH Engineering College is an institution that focuses on engineering education. 7. Focus on Engineering: Considering the college emphasizes engineering, it's likely that the academic staff of 250 includes faculty members with expertise in various engineering fields like civil, mechanical, electrical, computer science, and more. However, further information would be necessary to understand which departments or programs AWH Engineering College offers. In summary, the extracted data from the sentence provides insight into the basic structure and context of AWH Engineering College, including its name, location, and academic staff strength. The sentence also mentions Kerala's leading city, Kochi. However, additional information would be necessary to clarify the meaning of \\"leader\\" in this context and to dive deeper into the programs, departments, and offerings of the institution."},{"question":"İki ortak daha çok film festivalleri ve sanat çevresini hedeflemekle birlikte, Permeti filmin öyküsünün evrenselliğinin bütün seyircileri çekeceğine inanıyor.

Zappa's relationship with long-time manager Herb Cohen ended in 1976. Zappa sued Cohen for skimming more than he was allocated from DiscReet Records, as well as for signing acts of which Zappa did not approve. Cohen filed a lawsuit against Zappa in return, which froze the money Zappa and Cohen had gained from an out-of-court settlement with MGM over the rights of the early Mothers of Invention recordings. It also prevented Zappa having access to any of his previously recorded material during the trials. Zappa therefore took his personal master copies of the rock-oriented Zoot Allures (1976) directly to Warner Bros., thereby bypassing DiscReet.In the mid-1970s Zappa prepared material for Läther (pronounced \\"leather\\"), a four-LP project. Läther encapsulated all the aspects of Zappa's musical styles—rock tunes, orchestral works, complex instrumentals, and Zappa's own trademark distortion-drenched guitar solos. Wary of a quadruple-LP, Warner Bros. Records refused to release it. Zappa managed to get an agreement with Phonogram Inc., and test pressings were made targeted at a Halloween 1977 release, but Warner Bros. prevented the release by claiming rights over the material. Zappa responded by appearing on the Pasadena, California radio station KROQ, allowing them to broadcast Läther and encouraging listeners to make their own tape recordings. A lawsuit between Zappa and Warner Bros. followed, during which no Zappa material was released for more than a year. Eventually, Warner Bros. issued different versions of much of the Läther material in 1978 and 1979 as four individual albums (five full-length LPs) with limited promotion.Although Zappa eventually gained the rights to all his material created under the MGM and Warner Bros. contracts, the various lawsuits meant that for a period Zappa's only income came from touring, which he therefore did extensively in 1975–77 with relatively small, mainly rock-oriented, bands. Drummer Terry Bozzio became a regular band member, Napoleon Murphy Brock stayed on for a while, and...

Step 1) Identify the two parts of the comparative pattern: X: contented the nurses began to believe that we were going to pretend to be Y: angry we grew at the doctors Step 2) Checking the grammatical structure of both parts: X: This part should be rephrased to \\"the more contented the nurses believed we were pretending to be\\" for clearer meaning and grammatical coherence. Y: This part seems to be grammatically correct. Step 3) Reformulating the sentence with the adjusted part X: \\"The more contented the nurses believed we were pretending to be, the more angry we grew at the doctors.\\" Thus, according to the analysis, the original sentence can be considered: 1) Unacceptable.

Options: - promotions - stress - bad mood - for a party - exhaustion Reasoning process:","response":"One reason to keep going to work is promotions. Here's the reasoning process: 1. Understanding the context: The question asks for a reason to continue attending work, which implies it is looking for a positive or practical outcome resulting from attendance. 2. Analyzing the provided options: a. Promotions: Attending work regularly and consistently can be associated with a positive outcome such as a better position within the organization. b. Stress: Generally considered a negative experience that can damage physical and mental health, making it an unlikely reason to continue going to work. c. Bad mood: Also a negative experience, potentially harming relationships and emotional well-being, thereby not a sensible reason to attend work. d. For a party: While attending a work event can be positive, it is a singular occurrence rather than an ongoing reason to continue going to work and, thus, not a strong reason in this context. e. Exhaustion: Another negative experience; physical exhaustion is typically associated with burnout or overwork, making it an unsuitable reason to continue working. 3. Evaluating the options: Among these choices, promotions stand out as it has a clear positive outcome resulting from consistent work attendance. In contrast, the other options indicate negative experiences or are not strong enough reasons to keep going to work. Thus, one reason to keep going to work is promotions, as it provides a practical, positive incentive for ongoing attendance and effort in a job."},{"question":"Customers came from all over the south visited Shoreham Knitting and Needlecraft to celebrate its 45th anniversary and Rowan Flagship status.

Darwin saw two distinct kinds of variation: (1) rare abrupt changes he called \\"sports\\" or \\"monstrosities\\" (example: ancon sheep with short legs), and (2) ubiquitous small differences (example: slightly shorter or longer bill of pigeons).

The northern province has more fertile soil, more trees. But I can use this background: Besides anthropogenic productivity of the land, the biodiversity of degraded land also declines, as previously mentioned.[12] With less biodiversity, this ecosystem is less adaptable to when disasters strike it[11][8] It has a smaller available food supply, in terms of plants, for animals, who then may die out or more likely may relocate. Proof of this decline is that presently 15-20% of Tibetan Plateau species are now considered endangered; and now because of this animal and plant absence, the soil quality of these degraded lands is very poor.[1] It does not hold the necessary nutrients, such as water, nitrogen, and carbon, essential to either supporting life or inviting life back to that land.[6] As a result of such carbon and nitrogen loss in the Tibetan Plateau, 8,033/ha and 13,315/ha were respectively lost in economic terms. Soils are further weakened by dust storms whose frequency increases because of degradation.[11][4] Erosion of soil becomes a bigger problem, since no longer are there as many plants to anchor in the soil. In the northern Chinese province alone, 400 million are affected every year with an associated 54 billion yuan of annual economic loss due to grassland degradation.

Hard. I know he didn't mean to hurt me, but I was mad about it all. Day. Long. I just couldn't get over the fact that he technically hit me! I started to consider things like, “Is he really sorry?” “Will he do it again?” “Should I leave him?” And gave myself reasons like “He didn't mean to!” “He's been apologizing all day!” “He was just playing!” “He meant to have fun, He's sorry!” Yet countered it with one simple statement, “Yeah that's what all abused women say.” In the end, I felt the question that should determine whether or not I should leave is: “If I stop talking to him tomorrow and can never see him or speak to him again, will I be okay with that?” and the answer was “No”, so obviously I shouldn't leave him. He is very well aware that I was considering leaving him, (I have a very strict 0 tolerance policy of abuse in my relationships, as I was abused terribly growing up,) and he still apologizes to this day, but he has certainly made it a point to never do that again. I definitely trust him, and he actually was being playful, but otherwise that has been the only “real” hitch we have come across. I mean, we argue, but that's only when either of us are mad, and it's usually over small stupid stuff. Like, really stupid stuff. We argued over traffic signs before, LOL.

Wood senior had started in his family's pawnbroking business, but by the time of his son's birth he was trading as a jeweller, optician and engineering modeller, much sought-after for his model engines. It was a musical household: Wood senior was an amateur cellist and sang as principal tenor in the choir of St Sepulchre-without-Newgate, known as \\"the musicians' church\\". His wife played the piano and sang songs from her native Wales. They encouraged their son's interest in music, buying him a Broadwood piano, on which his mother gave him lessons. The young Wood also learned to play the violin and viola. Wood received little religious inspiration at St Sepulchre, but was deeply stirred by the playing of the resident organist, George Cooper, who allowed him into the organ loft and gave him his first lessons on the instrument. Cooper died when Wood was seven, and the boy took further lessons from Cooper's successor, Edwin M. Lott, for whom Wood had much less regard. At the age of ten, through the influence of one of his uncles, Wood made his first paid appearance as an organist at St Mary Aldermanbury, being paid half a crown. In June 1883, visiting the Fisheries Exhibition at South Kensington with his father, Wood was invited to play the organ in one of the galleries, making a good enough impression to be engaged to give recitals at the exhibition building over the next three months. At this time in his life, painting was nearly as strong an interest as music, and he studied in his spare time at the Slade School of Fine Art. He remained a life-long amateur painter.After taking private lessons from the musicologist Ebenezer Prout, Wood entered the Royal Academy of Music at the age of seventeen, studying harmony and composition with Prout, organ with Charles Steggall, and piano with Walter Macfarren.

Although violence between drug cartels has been occurring long before the war began, the government used its police forces in the 1990s and early first decade of the 21st century with little effect. That changed on December 11, 2006, when newly elected Mexican President Felipe Calderón sent 6,500 federal troops to the state of Michoacán to put an end to drug violence there. This action is regarded as the first major retaliation made against cartel operations, and is generally viewed as the starting point of the Mexican Drug War. As time progressed, Calderón continued to escalate his anti-drug campaign, in which there are now well over 25,000 troops involved. During the Felipe Calderón, the Mexican government has spent approximately US7 billion in an 18-month-old campaign against drug cartels. It is estimated that during 2006, there were about 2,000 drug-related violent deaths, about 2,300 deaths during 2007, and more than 6,200 people by the end of 2008. Many of the dead were gang members killed by rivals or by the government, some have been bystanders. Answer this question: How many more drug-related violent deaths were there in 2008 than in 2006?","response":"There were significantly more drug-related violent deaths in 2008 than in 2006. According to the provided data, there were approximately 2,000 drug-related deaths in 2006 and more than 6,200 in 2008. To find the difference in the number of deaths between these two years, you can subtract the number of deaths in 2006 from the number of deaths in 2008: 6,200 (deaths in 2008) - 2,000 (deaths in 2006) = 4,200 (difference in deaths) Therefore, there were 4,200 more drug-related violent deaths in 2008 than in 2006. This significant increase highlights the escalated violence and ongoing challenges faced during the Mexican Drug War."},{"question":"Apart from the members and commanders of the special unit, including the primary inductees for the assassination, Legija and Jovanovic, reports were also filed against Kostunica, leader of the opposition Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS).

Which island contributed more to global warming? Hint: Pollutants also affect the atmosphere through their contribution to global warming. Global warming is an increase in the Earth’s temperature. It is thought to be caused mostly by the increase of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide. Greenhouse gases can be released by factories that burn fossil fuels. Over the past 20 years, burning fossil fuels has produced about three-quarters of the carbon dioxide from human activity. The rest of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is there because of deforestation, or cutting down trees ( Figure below ). Trees absorb carbon dioxide during cellular respiration, so when trees are cut down, they cannot remove carbon dioxide from the air. The answer to this question is:","response":"Long Island contributed more to global warming as compared to Snail Island. To begin with, Long Island was densely populated, which led to a higher rate of resource consumption. The residents of Long Island used their natural resources heavily and relied upon fossil fuels to meet their energy demands. The burning of fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, results in the release of large amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. These greenhouse gases are known to trap heat within the Earth's atmosphere, contributing to the overall increase in global temperatures, a phenomenon known as global warming. Additionally, Long Island's industrial activity and other human activities likely resulted in deforestation, or the large-scale clearing of trees, to make way for development. As mentioned in the hint, trees are natural carbon sinks and absorb CO2 during the process of photosynthesis. When trees are cut down and forests destroyed, the ability of these ecosystems to remove CO2 from the atmosphere is severely compromised, further exacerbating the effects of global warming. On the other hand, Snail Island was characterized by its mindfulness towards environmental protection and conservation. With fewer people living there, resource consumption and the subsequent release of greenhouse gases were inherently lower than those of Long Island. Snail Island's focus on preserving the natural environment led to a reduced strain on its resources, and a lesser release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. This allowed the island to play a lesser role in contributing to global warming. In conclusion, Long Island, with its densely populated regions, resource-intensive lifestyle, and reliance on fossil fuels, contributed significantly more to global warming compared to Snail Island, which prioritized environmental preservation and had a smaller population. The combined impact of greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels and deforestation on Long Island far exceeded the environmental footprint of Snail Island, making it a larger contributor to the global warming process."},{"question":"What is the final step of the following process: - Gather the ingredients for the cake - Mix the flour, sugar, egg, and water to make batter - Pour the mixture into a cake pan - Place the cake in the oven to cook - Take the cake out when it is cooked through - Let the cake cool","response":"The final step of the process after letting the cake cool is to apply frosting and decorations if desired, followed by slicing and serving the cake to your guests. To do this, follow these steps: 1. Prepare the frosting: If you're making your own frosting, gather the necessary ingredients and prepare it according to the recipe. If using store-bought frosting, ensure that it is at room temperature and easily spreadable. 2. Place the cake on a serving dish or cake stand: Carefully transfer the cooled cake onto a clean serving dish or cake stand that provides enough space and stability for the cake and makes it easier to frost and serve. 3. Apply a crumb coat: Spread a thin layer of frosting over the entire cake using a cake spatula or a palette knife. This initial layer is called the crumb coat, which helps to seal in any crumbs and create a smooth surface for the final layer of frosting. Allow the crumb coat to set in the refrigerator for 15-20 minutes. 4. Apply the final layer of frosting: Spread a generous layer of frosting over the entire cake, starting from the top and working your way down to the sides. Use a cake spatula or palette knife to create a smooth and even surface. If you prefer a more rustic look, use the spatula or palette knife to create swirls or other desired textures on the frosting. 5. Decorate the cake: If you're adding decorations such as edible flowers, fruit, candy, chocolate shavings, or sprinkles, place them on the cake as desired. For more elaborate designs, you can use a piping bag fitted with a decorative nozzle to create various designs and patterns with frosting. 6. Chill the cake (optional): For an even better texture and flavor, you may choose to chill the cake in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes before serving. This helps the frosting to set and the flavors to meld together. 7. Slice and serve the cake: When you're ready to serve the cake, use a sharp knife or a cake slicer to cut the cake into even slices. Serve the cake along with your choice of accompaniments such as whipped cream, ice cream, or fresh fruit.

Possible answers: (i). yes. (ii). it is not possible to tell. (iii). no.","response":"In order to provide a detailed and long answer to this question, it is crucial to understand the context of the term \\"snowbirds.\\" Snowbirds generally refer to people who migrate from colder regions to warmer areas during the winter months in order to avoid harsh weather conditions. It is a colloquial term often used to describe retirees or vacationers who reside in cold locations, such as the northern parts of the United States, Canada, or Europe, and then travel to warmer areas like Florida, Arizona, or Mexico during the winter months. Now, regarding the question, \\"If and which ones were the snowbirds, can we conclude that 'Which ones were the snowbirds?'\\" The question needs to be paraphrased in order to better understand its intent. Essentially, the question seems to ask if one can identify or confirm the snowbirds when given information about their identities or characteristics. Before delving into possible answers, it's important to recognize that the context and specific details describing those referred to as snowbirds will determine the accuracy of recognizing and confirming their identity. (i) Yes: If we have enough reliable information about those referred to as snowbirds, such as their location, origin, duration of stay, or any other defining characteristics, then it may be possible to conclude who the snowbirds are. For instance, if we know that a group of retirees from New York City travels to Florida each winter, we could then correctly identify these people as snowbirds. (ii) It is not possible to tell: In situations where the information provided is either insufficient, unclear, or unreliable, it may not be feasible to determine who the snowbirds are. For instance, if we are only given vague information about a group of people who may or may not travel to warmer climates, we cannot definitively say who the snowbirds are. (iii) No: If we know that the individuals or groups in question do not fit the typical profile of snowbirds as they do not migrate from colder regions to warmer areas during the winter months, then we can conclude that they are not snowbirds. For example, if a group of people stays in their cold-weather location throughout the winter, we can confidently say they are not snowbirds. In conclusion, whether the question \\"Which ones were the snowbirds?\\" can be answered with certainty depends on the context and the specific information available. If sufficient and reliable details are provided, then it is possible to conclude who the snowbirds are; otherwise, it may not be feasible to determine their identity."},{"question":"În calitate de cetăţean al Poloniei, ţară care a aderat la Uniunea Europeană în 2004, ştiu că strategia de extindere reprezintă unul dintre domeniile cele mai eficiente ale politicii UE.

In its ground state, CTX is indistinguishable from water, but when placed under the right temperature conditions for long enough, a single liter of it can explode with enough force to level a fifteen-story building. The agents begin to suspect its intended use by the assassins, when Kim, a scientist working at a lab connected to CTX, is assassinated by Bang-hee.Park and his agents ambush a military convoy with several liters of CTX, killing all the soldiers and making off with the dangerous liquid before the agents could arrive in time to warn them.

A:","response":"Based on the information provided, it appears that zinc could indeed be considered the right answer to the question \\"what is linked to wounds recovering faster?\\" given the correlation found between zinc and wound recovery. Zinc is an essential trace element that plays a vital role in various biological processes, including immune function, protein synthesis, DNA synthesis, and cell division. It is especially crucial for proper wound healing, as it is involved in numerous aspects of the healing process, such as inflammation control, collagen synthesis, and tissue repair. Several studies have demonstrated a positive correlation between zinc supplementation and improved wound healing rates, particularly in individuals with zinc deficiency or slow-healing wounds, such as diabetic ulcers or burns. Moreover, zinc has antibacterial properties and can help protect wounds from infection during the healing process. However, it is essential to note that while zinc is a critical factor contributing to wound recovery, it is not the sole factor involved. Proper wound care, nutrition, hydration, and overall health also play a significant role in the rate at which wounds can recover. Moreover, the effect of zinc on wound healing may vary depending on an individual's overall health and nutritional status. Consulting a healthcare professional before adding zinc supplements or making drastic changes to one's diet is always recommended."},{"question":"Article: Spider-Man 3 (<<3>> )got 29.15 million on the very first day in 16 overseas markets and beat the first two Spider-Man movies. \\"The movie had the best opening day ever in some countries on Tuesday, including France, Italy and South Korea.\\" a man from Sony Pictures said. \\"Spider-Man 3 will open during the next few days in many other countries, including the United States on Friday.

If we’re currently in a year that’s later than 2010, then it would be correct to say that he was in the film \\"As You Like It\\" over four years ago. The sentence doesn't provide the exact current time for us to make a conclusive judgement. However, if we make the assumption based on the time since the film's release in 2006, the sentence \\"He was in 'As You Like It' over four years ago\\" would certainly be true.

Article: A scientist turns out to be able to see the future by offering each of some four-year-olds a piece of candy and watching how he or she deals with it. Some children reach eagerly for the treat they see. Some last a few minutes before they give in. But others are determined to wait until the last moment. By the time the children reach high school, something remarkable has happened. A survey found that those who as four-year-olds had enough self-control to hold out generally grew up to be more popular, adventurous, confident and dependable. The children who gave in to temptation early were more likely to be lonely, easily frustrated and inflexible . Actually, the ability to delay reward is a sign of emotional intelligence which doesn't show up on an IQ test. The hardware of the brain and the software of the mind have long been scientists' concerns. But brain theory can't explain what we wonder about most, like the question why some people remain _ in the face of troubles that would sink a less resistant soul. Here comes the theory of Daniel Goleman, writer of Emotional Intelligence: when it comes to predicting people's success, brain ability measured by IQ may actually matter less than the qualities of mind once thought of as \\"character\\". EQ is not the opposite of IQ. What researchers have been trying to understand is how they work together; how one's ability to handle stress, for instance, affects the ability to concentrate and put intelligence to use. Among the ingredients for success, researchers now generally agree that IQ counts for about 20%; the rest depends on everything from social class to luck. While many researchers in this relatively new field are glad to see emotional issues finally taken seriously, some few fear EQ invites misuse. Question: The experiment with the four-year-olds makes it clear that _ . Options: A: the age of 4 is a proper time for scientific experiment B: emotional intelligence won't show up until adolescence C: the ability of self-control plays a role in personal success D: candy can be used to measure a person's emotional intelligence The answer is:","response":"C: The ability of self-control plays a role in personal success. Justification: Given the information from the article, in the experiment, the children who exhibited self-control at a young age, specifically through resisting the temptation of candy, were found to develop more desirable characteristics and be more successful later in life. Therefore, the experiment shows that the ability of self-control can play a role in personal success. Other options like A and D do not exactly capture the core point made by the experiment and B is directly contradicted by the information that four-year-olds could already demonstrate facets of emotional intelligence such as self-control."},{"question":"Given the sentence \\"An asian teenager in a red jacket has his thumb up and his tongue sticking out.\\" is it true that \\"A teenager in a blue jacket has his thumb down.\\"?

Question: Which of the following is always present in invetebrates, a nerve or a brain? Context: The brain is an organ that serves as the center of the nervous system in all vertebrate and most invertebrate animals. Only a few invertebrates such as sponges, jellyfish, adult sea squirts and starfish do not have a brain; diffuse or localised nerve nets are present instead. The brain is located in the head, usually close to the primary sensory organs for such senses as vision, hearing, balance, taste, and smell. The brain is the most complex organ in a vertebrate's body. In a typical human, the cerebral cortex (the largest part) is estimated to contain 15–33 billion neurons, each connected by synapses to several thousand other neurons. These neurons communicate with one another by means of long protoplasmic fibers called axons, which carry trains of signal pulses called action potentials to distant parts of the brain or body targeting specific recipient cells.

Steve hurried through his tests, and continued to dream of other things. His heart was not in school, but in the woods. One day, Miss White's impatient voice broke into his daydreams. \\"Steve! Pay attention!\\" Steve turned to look at her, fixing his eyes on Miss White, as she began to go over the test results for the seventh grade. \\"You all did pretty well,\\" she told the class, \\"except for one boy, and it breaks my heart to tell you this, but...\\" She hesitated, her eyes searching his face. \\"...The smartest boy in the seventh grade is failing my class!\\" She just stared at Steve. Steve dropped his eyes. After that, it was war! Steve still wouldn't do his homework. Even as the punishments became more severe, he remained _ \\"Just try it! ONE WEEK!\\" He was unmoved. \\"You're smart enough! You'll see a change!\\" Nothing touched him. \\"Give yourself a chance! Don't give up on your life!\\" Nothing. \\"Steve! Please! I care about you!\\" Wow! Suddenly, Steve got it! Someone cared about him? Steve went home from school, thoughtful, that afternoon. Walking into the house, both parents were out. He, quickly, gathered up a jar of peanut butter, a loaf of bread, a bottle of water, and this time...his schoolbooks. The following Monday he arrived at school on time, and he waited for Miss White to enter the classroom. She walked in, all smiles! God, she was beautiful! Miss White, immediately, gave a quiz on the weekend homework. Steve hurried through the test and was the first to hand in his paper. With a look of surprise, Miss White took his paper. Obviously puzzled, she began to look it over. Miss White's face was in total shock! The smartest boy in the seventh grade had just passed his first test! From that moment nothing was the same for Steve. Life at home remained the same, but life still changed. He discovered that not only could he learn, but he was good at it! He discovered that he could understand knowledge and translate the things... Question: Steve used to be bad at his lessons because _ . Yes or no, is the answer \\"he hadn't put his heart into his studies\\"? Answer:","response":"Yes, the answer \\"he hadn't put his heart into his studies\\" is accurate based on the information provided in the text. The story describes how Steve was uninterested in school and more focused on daydreaming and his fondness for the woods, indicating a lack of engagement with his studies. He hurried through tests and did not do his homework, demonstrating a lack of effort and commitment to his education. Further, the narrative shows that once Steve became aware that someone cared about him, specifically Ms. White, his attitude towards school work changed significantly. He started to take homework, arrived on time for school, and even managed to pass a test. His changed attitudes suggest that his previous poor performance was largely due to his lack of investment and interest in academics. His life at home remained stable, indicating that the environment was not a key factor affecting his study. The narrative also does not outline examples of learning difficulties or intellectual limitations that could have hindered Steve's academic progress. Thus the assertion that \\"he hadn't put his heart into his studies\\" appears to be a comprehensive explanation for Steve's initial poor academic performance. In conclusion, Steve's academic difficulties stemmed from his lack of emotional investment and focus on his studies. His shift in attitude towards schoolwork, coupled with his inherent smartness, were key components that lead to his academic improvement."},{"question":"Please answer the following question by reasoning step-by-step.

He warns her of an impending apocalypse and offers to take her with him, but concerned for her family, Eep stays, getting a shell horn from him to blow in case she needs his help. Reuniting with her frantic family, she tries to tell them what Guy told her, but fearing things that are \\"different\\" and \\"new\\", they destroy her horn. A massive earthquake then destroys their home, and to avoid carnivores and omnivores, they descend down into a tropical forest that lay hidden behind their cave all the time. Encountering a \\"Macawnivore\\", a brightly colored feline that Gran dubs \\"Chunky\\", the family flees him until he is scared off by swarms of piranhakeets that devour a ground whale. Using another horn, Eep calls to Guy who rescues them from the birds with his fire. After a great deal of confusion regarding their first contact with fire, Grug imprisons Guy in a log until he can guide them somewhere safe. Guy suggests the Croods go to a mountain where there are caves because the Crood family desires a cave. Grug refuses at first, but he decides to go with the promise of a cave.

Article: Below are some tips for women traveling alone. Exercise hotel safety There are many ways you can make a solo stay at a hotel safer. At cheek-in, you might consider asking for a room near the elevator so you won't need to walk down long, potentially ill-lit hallways to reach your room. When filling out guest registration forms, consider using your first initial instead of your name, and skip the\\" Mrs/Miss/Mr\\" check box. Additionally, make sure the clerk writes down your room number instead of saying it out loud. This will prevent anyone nearby from knowing where to find you later. Arrive during the day Arrive in new cities during the day. Areas around bus and train stations can be scary and/ojr deserted, and small towns tend to shut down early. Veteran solo traveler Mara Rothman of San Francisco notes that plenty of beautiful towns can appear mysterious at night, and locals who are genuinely trying to help you can appear unnecessarily threatening. Arriving during the day means you'll be able to find a place to stay and get to know where you are before dark. Keep your documents safe If you choose to wear a money belt, use it for storage and not as a purse. Constantly reaching under your shirt for money draws attention to it, and tends to defeat the purpose. Instead,keep your passport, extra stores of money, and other important documents well hidden, and use a bag or purse for carrying daily spending money. Dress appropriately To avoid attracting unwanted attention, dress as conservatively as the women you see around you. This doesn't necessarily mean wearing the traditional dress, as that can sometimes have the opposite result. A good rule of thumb is to dress modestly. Think knee-length or longer skirts. Bare arms, shoulders, and legs are considered risked in some countries, so do the research before you go and once you're there. Note which body parts the local women cover and do the same.

A world famous conductor brilliantly played by Michael Nyqvist seeks peace from stress by moving back to his childhood village. The villagers, who has followed the genius in silence, are slowly tempting him to share of his greatness. Each role in this movie, has a very specific purpose and shows a remarkable potential in each of the actors playing their own chord in short but precise words, a symphony of love. Not love in the sense of relationship, but in the tone of the spirit deeply buried within each of the characters, each revealing their own present story, their needs, their skeletons, desires and much more. I shall not forget to mention, the two main parts played by Frida Hallgren and Michael Nyqvist, whose dramas are played in unforgettable harmonies of emotional feedback. They touch each other with a pain connected in their own disability to love themselves. Michael Nyqvist is really put to the test here in a very difficult setup, in one of those movies that either end up as catastrophic or fantastic. And fantastic it became from start to end, not one second less or more than enough, you are left with a feeling of change and a taste for more.

Can’t wait until your league’s draft day? FOXSports.com has you covered. Test your fantasy football knowledge and strategies with a free and easy This makes me really uncomfortable. Be it talcum powder, salves, creams or John Madden breaking down a door – BOOM! – all I want is for those queries to experience some relief as soon as possible.

To avoid becoming the next fantasy football draft day casualty, please consume the following information with a glass of water, but please don’t call me in the morning. Twitter is acceptable: @FOXSportsFowler. Question: Can the Giants’ receivers repeat and/or exceed their fantasy production in 2012? Answer: No because of strength of schedule versus solid pass defenses. I’ll elaborate on that point in a second. Hakeem Nicks (broken foot) came off the PUP list on August 13. He told the New York Daily News that he’s experienced no setbacks in his rehab. He and Victor Cruz were a viable one-two punch in the Eli Manning’s passing game last season combining for over 2,700 yards and 16 touchdowns. The third-fiddle, Mario Manningham, is now in San Francisco leaving the third WR spot up for competition. My early favorites to fill the void are Domenik Hixon and rookie Reuben Randal. Both will benefit from extra reps in camp with Nicks on the mend. Getting back to my initial answer, half of the Giants schedule (SOS: toughest in NFL), is against pass defenses that finished in the Top 12 last year: Eagles (twice), Redskins (twice), Steelers, Browns, Ravens, and Bengals. While I think Nicks and Cruz are still worthy WR1 fantasy picks, don’t expect them to torch secondaries in 2012. Need help with your fantasy football draft? Our experts provide a helpful that includes rankings, stats, mock drafts, and downloadable cheat sheets. Question: Should fantasy owners avoid Dez Bryant? Answer: No, but I’m not in a hurry to draft him. If he falls to a round where I see value, I’ll snatch him up. Off-the-field issues aside, Bryant had a good 2011 fantasy football season. He didn’t have a great one. While he finished tied for fourth in touchdowns (9), he ranked 30th in receiving yards (928). Now some could argue that Laurent Robinson stole some of Bryant’s thunder, but I would counter with the fact Bryant received 22 more targets (103-81) than Robinson and played in one more game (15-14). It’s fair to say Romo and Robinson were far more efficient when they connected. Now that Robinson is gone, Miles Austin and Jason Witten are the main threats to Bryant’s fantasy production – outside of himself and Roger Goodell, of course. Austin missed six games last season (hamstring), but managed to still haul in seven touchdowns and Witten remains Romo’s favorite target (117 for 992 yards) last year). My advice is to avoid overvaluing Bryant in 2012. If you feel comfortable with your QB/RB situation after the first two rounds, go ahead and start to think about drafting him, but not before. Question: Who should I rank higher: Desean Jackson or Jeremy Maclin? Answer: I’d take Maclin with a side of “don’t forget about Brent Celek.” D-Jax may receive more media attention, but Maclin is the guy you want in fantasy leagues. If not for a number of injuries last season, J-Mac would have led the Eagles in targets for the second consecutive season. Take a look at the 2011 stat breakdown among the team’s top receivers: Celek finished 2011 on fire with 13 catches for 294 yards and three touchdowns in Philly’s final three games. If you miss on Gates, Witten Gronk and Graham, Celek is somebody to target in drafts. Question: Should I take a gamble on Fred Davis early? Answer: Yes, but as much as I believe in his ability to help your fantasy team, I’ve started to worry if we can trust him to stay out of trouble. Most are aware that Davis was suspended the final four weeks of the 2011 season for failing a drug test. Well now, he’s mixed up in a whacky civil suit with a former friend that has all the making of a compelling Judge Judy episode. It’s a slight distraction, but no punishment is likely to come from the awkwardness or Davis’ unique use of legal jargon. That’s what I mean when I worry about trust issues with drafting Davis. The flip side of that are his 2011 stats. He was among the league leaders at his position the first month and, despite missing the final four games, finished eighth in receiving yards among tight ends (59 rec. / 796 yards) with three touchdowns. When he’s good, he’s among the best, but there is also the factor of working with a rookie quarterback and not Rex Grossman. Did I just type that? Davis should be on your radar, but don’t reach. You like how I avoided the team’s uber-running back by committee? All in due time. Question: Is it even worth taking a Packers’ running back in 2012? Answer: Sure, if James Starks is your fourth running back. I love breaking down the pass-happy Pack’s 2011 rushing stats. At first glance, you’ll notice the team finished 27th in yards on the ground (1,558) – not a surprise. However, owners may see a glimmer of hope with 12 rushing touchdowns, 16th in the NFL last season. Not so fast. The 12 scores breakdown like this: John Kuhn (4) , Aaron Rodgers (3), Ryan Grant (2), Starks (1), Matt Flynn (1) and …B.J. Raji (1). We'll wait and see how Cedric Benson's role is defined in the next few weeks. Question: Outside of Stafford and Megatron, who should fantasy owners target in the Lions’ offense? Answer: Let’s start with the running back by committee. With Jahvid Best’s concussion history, I wouldn’t invest a lot in Best as a RB1 or RB2. He’s a fringe RB3 as the team plays it safe with him. Mikel Leshoure will make his regular season debut this season after missing all of last with an Achilles injury. I think he’s a low-end gamble as a RB2 high-end RB3. That leaves Kevin Smith as the “starting” running back and one I would label a RB3 without blinking. The two guys who interest me the most are Titus Young and Brandon Pettigrew. If not for Nate Burleson (110 targets / 71 recs. / 757 yards), Young would be my second Lions’ commodity on draft day. In that same breath, Pettigrew could be one of the leading fantasy scorers among tight ends if not for the vulture Tony Scheffler. The Mad Scheff received a third of the targets (42 compared to 126) than Pettigrew enjoyed, but caught one more touchdown (six to five) last season. At the end of the day, I think Young has the most potential to help your fantasy team this season. Although I prefer to start a third RB in the flex, Young is closing in on the ability to contribute in that slot. Question: Which round should owners target Brandon Marshall? Answer: I’d say third with some thought to take him in the second depending how things shake out. When we last saw Marshall and Kyle Orton as a 1-2 punch, the year was 2008. The city was Denver. Marshall opened up that campaign by setting a NFL-record by hauling in 18 passes for 166 yards and a touchdown versus the Chargers. He finished with 104 catches for over 1,200 yards and six touchdowns that season. The six scores have been his average per season over the last three years (w/ DEN / MIA / MIA). Matt Forte was the Bears’ most-targeted player in 2011, but Johnny Knox “led” the team in receiving with 727 yards. Kellen Davis led the team in receiving touchdowns with five. My guess is a good number of casual fantasy players have never heard of Davis. It’s okay, in 2012 Marshall will be the name to remember. Question: Who is the fantasy sleeper up in Minnesota? Answer: The name that keeps coming up is tight end Kyle Rudolph. Google his name and you will wish certain fantasy writers got a room before their lovefest ensued. In case you missed it (or ICYMI for the Twitter crowd), Visanthe Shiancoe is now part of the New England Patriots hoard of receivers and tight ends. This leaves Christian Ponder Rudolph and John Carlson (formerly of SEA) as his top two tight ends. Rudolph didn’t post a “wow, look at me” game in 2011, but did finish with 26 receptions for 249 yards and three touchdowns. After posting big numbers with Matt Hasselbeck in 2009 and 2010, Carlson was a dud in 2011 with Tarvaris Jackson behind center. He recorded over 1,200 yards with 12 touchdowns in ’08 and ’09 combined. He had one score in 2011. Why couldn’t he be the sleeper? It’s also worth noting that Adrian Peterson insurance is a must this season with Toby Gehart as his handcuff. The third-year back out of Stanford had three games where he rushed for over 90 yards last season. Question: What do we make of the Saints’ rushing attack in 2012? Answer: Similar to the Packers, I think Pierre Thomas, Mark Ingram and, in certain leagues, Chris Ivory possess value, just not enough to move the needle. It’s scenarios like this (heavy RBBC) where I believe fantasy leagues could begin to adopt a new rule where you draft a team’s entire rushing unit instead of individual players. Thomas and Ingram are low-end RB2, high-end RB3, but Sproles still intrigues me. Some fantasy writers believe without Sean Payton on the sidelines, the speedy back could see his touches diminish in 2012. I disagree. As I’ve said before, all due respect (is it really due?) to Joe Vitt, but Drew Brees is going to run this offense on the field. Sproles was second in targets last season. Granted, Marques Colston would have caught him had he not missed time due to injury, but Sproles is a tasty checkdown and a fantasy player I’d feel comfortable drafting and starting as my flex play. Question: Is Cam Newton a first-round lock in standard-scoring leagues? Answer: Lock? No. Would I take him in the first round? Yes. Cynicism runs rampant during fantasy football draft season. Some of the same guys who questioned Cam Newton’s fantasy draft value a year ago (hand is raised) are the same ones now claiming “he can’t do it again.” So, believe me, there are plenty of Newton pessimists to go along with owners ready to anoint him a fantasy overlord. Here’s what I want those considering Newton to keep in mind. Through his first four starts last season, he averaged 346.5 passing yards per game. During his final 12 games, he averaged 222 passing yards per game. His 21 passing touchdowns just missed the top 10, good enough for 11th in the league. His 17 picks were good enough for the top ten – sixth-most in the NFL. The fantasy risk-versus-reward comes down to Newton’s feet, not his arm. He averaged less than 50 rushing yards per game, but made up for it with 17 rushing touchdowns. Mike Tolbert was picked up in the offseason and could vulture the vulture inside the five. Question: Should I be weary of Julio Jones or should I embrace him? Answer: I’m comfortable enough to embrace him as a low-end WR1. Jones finished with a flurry of fantasy excellence the last month of the regular season. He averaged over 92 receiving yards per game with six touchdowns in the final six games. It comes down to if owners believe enough touches exist for Jones when Roddy White, Michael Turner and Tony Gonzalez continue to splinter targets. Question: Lots of new faces in Tampa Bay, how does it impact fantasy football draft strategy? Answer: I’m a fan, but then again, I was one of those owners burned by LeGarrette Blount in 2011. So, take it with a grain of salt. This year’s trendy running back pick is Doug Martin (low-end RB1). No question, he’s going to get a chance to start because of Blount’s struggles – let’s just say in a variety of areas – last season. Still, I’m not completely bailing on Blount (RB3/flex). He could be a great option to vulture on the goal line. Think Brandon Jacobs when Ahmad Bradshaw was healthy last year. Josh Freeman has the weapons to be a QB1, but do we trust him that much? I don’t. I’m very interested to see how Mike Williams (WR2) bounces back this season with Vincent Jackson (low-end WR1) drawing so much attention on the other side of the field. If Dallas Clark (TE2) stays healthy, he could be a late-draft steal at tight end or one you draft and stash on your bench in the hopes a desperate owner comes looking for an upgrade. Question: Where should we buy Randy Moss? Answer: I’m targeting him as a WR4 at the moment. As silly as it may sound, players like Moss are ones I want to see in preseason games (even though his reps will be limited). He’s 35 years old and I want to see if he can separate from defensive backs. The Niners were 29th in passing offense last season. So, it’s going to take a lot for owners to trust Alex Smith and invest in his receiving corps outside of Vernon Davis (792 yards and six TDs last season). If I were to gamble on a 49ers receiver, it would have to be Mario Manningham. The former Giants’ receiver was brought in to help that 29th pass offense improve, but durability has been linked to Super Mario in the past. When you combine injury concerns with Alex Smith as his QB, it may be enough to turn owners away. Question: Who is the sleeper in Seattle? Answer: Do not sleep on Doug Baldwin … again. Marshawn Lynch is likely to be suspended to start the season. This opens up a world of opportunity for the Seahawks passing game and their new trigger behind center. Baldwin finished with a team-high 788 receiving yards and four touchdowns last season. Most owners would agree that Matt Flynn is an upgrade over Tarvaris Jackson at quarterback. Let’s hope Flynn sees the value in targeting Baldwin. Sidney Rice is coming off surgery on BOTH of his shoulders. The team did make a move to acquire tight end Kellen Winslow, which could cut into Baldwin’s productivity, but not much. Baldwin is a low-end WR2/WR3. Question: Is the Rams wide receiver corps still a mess? Answer: Yes. The team-leader in receiving last season was Brandon Lloyd (683 yards, five TDs), now in New England, and he only played in 11 games with the Rams after he was dealt by Denver. Danny Amendola (back from a nasty elbow injury) is worthy of consideration in PPR leagues, but after that it’s a crap shoot. Danario Alexander, Brian Quick Brandon Gibson and Chris Givens are in the mix. The team did sign “the other” Steve Smith this offseason who, in this bunch of WR2’s, could prove useful. My head hurts thinking about the Rams receivers. Try to avoid them as WR1-3. Question: Should owners trust Beanie Wells and/or Ryan Williams in the running game this year? Answer: Trust is such a strong word with a RBBC where both backs are coming off knee surgeries. Beanie (career-high 1,047 rush yards and 10 TDs in 2011) began the season on the active/PUP list. Williams missed all of last season with a torn patella tendon. So, at face value, owners who draft one or the other are investing in a lot of hope – or as my colleague Joel Beall said – a lot of “ifs”. If Kevin Kolb is the starting quarterback, if Kolb utilizes rookie Michael Floyd in the passing game, if the defense keeps the team in games to allow the rushing attack to play a role all four quarters are all bullet points owners should consider before gambling on Wells and/or Williams. For right now, I’d feel safe calling them middle-to-low RB2s.

He is a pioneer of the social and economic history of the Middle East and is famous for his extensive research of the Ottoman archives. He began his research career with the study of medieval Arab, especially Syrian, history. His first article, dedicated to professional guilds of medieval Islam, had been widely regarded as the most authoritative work on the subject for about thirty years. However, after the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948, scholars of Jewish origin found it more and more difficult to conduct archival and field research in the Arab countries, where they were suspected of espionage. Therefore, Lewis switched to the study of the Ottoman Empire, while continuing to research Arab history through the Ottoman archives which had only recently been opened to Western researchers. A series of articles that Lewis published over the next several years revolutionized the history of the Middle East by giving a broad picture of Islamic society, including its government, economy, and demographics. Lewis argues that the Middle East is currently backward and its decline was a largely self-inflicted condition resulting from both culture and religion, as opposed to the post-colonialist view which posits the problems of the region as economic and political maldevelopment mainly due to the 19th-century European colonization. In his 1982 work Muslim Discovery of Europe, Lewis argues that Muslim societies could not keep pace with the West and that \\"Crusader successes were due in no small part to Muslim weakness.\\" Further, he suggested that as early as the 11th century Islamic societies were decaying, primarily the byproduct of internal problems like \\"cultural arrogance,\\" which was a barrier to creative borrowing, rather than external pressures like the Crusades. In the wake of Soviet and Arab attempts to delegitimize Israel as a racist country, Lewis wrote a study of anti-Semitism, Semites and Anti-Semites (1986). In other works he argued Arab rage against Israel was disproportionate to other tragedies or injustices in the Muslim world, such as the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and control of Muslim-majority land in Central Asia, the bloody and destructive fighting during the Hama uprising in Syria (1982), the Algerian civil war (1992-98), and the Iran-Iraq War (1980-88). In addition to his scholarly works, Lewis wrote several influential books accessible to the general public: The Arabs in History (1950), The Middle East and the West (1964), and The Middle East (1995). In the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks, the interest in Lewis's work surged, especially his 1990 essay The Roots of Muslim Rage. Three of his books were published after 9/11: What Went Wrong? (written before the attacks), which explored the reasons of the Muslim world's apprehension of (and sometimes outright hostility to) modernization; The Crisis of Islam; and Islam: The Religion and the People.

Her departure devastated Ray Davies, and it inspired him to write the song \\"Rosy Won't You Please Come Home\\", included on the 1966 album Face to Face. The lead character in the album, the fictional Arthur Morgan—modelled after Anning—is a carpet layer whose family's plight in the opportunity-poor setting of post-war England is depicted. Writer Julian Mitchell detailed the story line and characters in depth, explaining in the liner notes for the album's LP release: Arthur Morgan ... lives in a London suburb in a house called Shangri-La, with a garden and a car and a wife called Rose and a son called Derek who's married to Liz, and they have these two very nice kids, Terry and Marilyn. Derek and Liz and Terry and Marilyn are emigrating to Australia. Arthur did have another son, called Eddie. He was named after Arthur's brother, who was killed in the battle of the Somme. Arthur's Eddie was killed, too—in Korea. Davies would later comment in his autobiography, X-Ray, that Anning later \\"told me that he ... knew it [Arthur] had been partly inspired by him ... [it] reminded him of home ... I told Arthur that I felt guilty for using him as a subject for a song, but he shrugged off my apology, saying that he was flattered.\\" With an underlying theme of nostalgia, the songs describe the England that Arthur once knew (\\"Victoria\\", \\"Young and Innocent Days\\"), the promise of life in Australia for one of his sons (\\"Australia\\"), the emptiness of his superficially comfortable life in his home (\\"Shangri-La\\"), the resolve of the British people during the Second World War (\\"Mr. Churchill Says\\"), the privations that marked the austerity period after the war (\\"She's Bought a Hat Like Princess Marina\\"), and the death of his brother in World War I (\\"Yes Sir, No Sir\\", \\"Some Mother's Son\\").

The answer to this question is:","response":"\\"Shades of Shangri-La: A Family's Journey Through Nostalgia and Loss\\""},{"question":"Generate a context and a hypothesis.","response":"Context: The recent decline in the bee population has raised concerns among environmentalists, researchers, and the general public. Bees play an essential role in pollination, which contributes significantly to the growth and reproduction of plants. Many of the fruits, vegetables, and nuts that form a substantial part of the human diet rely on pollinators like bees for successful yields. The decline in bee populations has been attributed to a combination of factors such as habitat loss, pesticides, climate change, disease, and parasites. Failing to address this issue could have severe ramifications for food security, biodiversity, and the health of ecosystems that support human life. Hypothesis: Introducing strategic bee-friendly policies and practices at regional and national levels can potentially reverse the decline in bee populations, thereby improving crop yields and maintaining biodiversity. These policies and practices could include reducing the use of harmful pesticides, promoting the growth of native plants, creating and preserving bee habitats, and supporting research on the health and behavior of bee populations. In order to test this hypothesis, a series of studies and experiments should be designed and implemented. These may include: 1. Analyzing the current state of bee populations and identifying the contributing factors to their decline in different regions. 2. Identifying and comparing bee-friendly policies and practices that have been implemented in various countries or regions. This will serve as a basis for finding effective solutions. 3. Implementing experimental bee-friendly policies and practices in select regions, either at a local or national level. This could include measures such as restricting the use of neonicotinoid pesticides, which are known to be harmful to bees, and promoting the planting of native flowering plants that provide valuable sources of nectar and pollen for bee populations. 4. Encouraging farmers to implement crop rotation practices and avoid planting monoculture. This will diversify the sources of pollen and nectar available for bees, which can aid in the support of healthier bee populations. 5. Monitoring and evaluating the effects of these policies and practices on bee populations, crop yields, and biodiversity over a specified period. Data should be collected to measure changes in bee population sizes, pollination rates, and the health of bees. 6. Comparing the results of the implemented policies and practices with control groups where no changes have been made. This information can be used to determine the effectiveness of the measures taken and make any necessary adjustments. 7. Disseminating the findings of these studies and promoting the adoption of successful bee-friendly policies and practices among farmers, policymakers, and the broader public. If the hypothesis is supported by the data, it would indicate that adopting bee-friendly policies and practices can not only help to reverse the decline of bee populations but also improve crop yields and maintain biodiversity. This would provide further justification for advocating the widespread implementation of these measures and dedicating resources towards understanding and supporting healthy bee populations."},{"question":"Generate a correctly punctuated version of the following text: If it will be possible to build large scale power plants in the future they should be built in desert like the Sahara or the Gobidesert because of the intensity of the sun","response":"If it will be possible to build large-scale power plants in the future, they should be built in deserts, like the Sahara or the Gobi Desert, because of the intensity of the sun."},{"question":"Q:Read the bio below and try to give details on ada williams -lrb- baby farmer -rrb- 's: - conviction - charge - conviction status - conviction penalty - death date - spouse - alias - birth date - name - death place Bio: ada chard williams -lrb- 1875 -- 1900 -rrb- was a baby farmer who was convicted of strangling to death 21-month-old selina ellen jones in barnes in london in september 1899 . florence jones , a young unmarried mother , had read an advert in the local newspaper which offered to find homes for unwanted children . she agreed to pay # 5 to a mrs hewetson -lrb- ada chard williams -rrb- but could only give her # 3 on the day . being an honest woman , she went back later with the balance and found that mrs hewetson and selina had vanished . florence reported the matter to the police . ada chard williams wrote a letter to the police denying the crime but in effect admitting she was a baby farmer who bought and sold babies for profit . the police soon discovered that mrs hewetson was ada chard williams . however , they had no body with which to prove there had been a murder , at least not until selina 's corpse was washed up on the bank of the thames at battersea . like amelia dyer , ada chard williams had her own \`\` signature '' way of tying up bodies she wished to dispose of , using a knot called a fisherman 's knot or bend and which was a crucial piece of evidence at her trial at the old bailey on 16 and 17 february 1900 . she was hanged , aged 24 , in the yard of newgate prison on 6 march 1900 , the last woman to be hanged there . she was suspected of killing other children although no proceedings were brought .

Luis Suarez's actions during the 2014 World Cup match between Uruguay and Italy were unacceptable and have no place in the sport of football. Biting an opponent on the shoulder is not only dangerous, but it also demonstrates a complete lack of respect for both the game and fellow players. Therefore, to hold him accountable, the experts at Sportsmail believe that Suarez should receive a punishment that would send a strong message, not only to the player himself, but also to the entire footballing community. The proposed worldwide 15-match ban would be a significant penalty, as it would impact not only Suarez's international career, but also his future performance at the club level. By serving such an extensive ban, Suarez would miss key matches and have to work diligently to regain the trust and support of his coaches, teammates, and fans. In addition to the ban, experts also suggest that Suarez should face additional consequences for his actions. This could include a mandatory anger management course, a hefty fine, and a public apology to Giorgio Chiellini, the victim of the bite, as well as the entire footballing community. Furthermore, this incident offers an opportunity for FIFA to address the prevalence of unsportsmanlike conduct in the sport and to set a strong precedent for future offenders. Implementing stricter punishments and promoting fair play would serve as crucial steps in safeguarding the integrity of the game and ensuring that all players respect the rules. In conclusion, Luis Suarez should face a comprehensive punishment including a worldwide 15-match ban, therapy or anger management, financial penalties, and issuing a formal apology, to deter any future occurrences of such behavior. This disciplinary action would emphasize the importance of sportsmanship and respect in the game of football and serve as a reminder that unsportsmanlike conduct will not be tolerated, both on and off the pitch."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Read the following article and answer the question.

Before you set up a daily school routine for your child, think about what your normal daily routine already looks like. Examine your normal daily routine to figure out how much time you have available to homeschool your children. Then, work within this amount of time. For example, if you find that you have four hours of time free each day, then this is the amount of time that you will have to homeschool your children. It is also a good idea to maintain your regular daily tasks in your schedule to help structure your days, such as getting dressed in the morning, running errands on a specific day, or preparing meals at a certain time. Setting a time boundary is important when you are homeschooling because this will help to prevent you from working too long or starting too late. Try to set a daily start time and identify the days of the week that will be “school” days. For example, you might decide to start school at 9am every day and end school at 3pm every day. Make sure that you make your kids aware of these start and end times, such as by posting them somewhere visible. It can be hard for kids to focus on one task for too long, so you might want to schedule tasks in 15 minute blocks. If your child ends up needing less time to complete a task, then that is fine. Just try to avoid scheduling tasks that might take more than 15 minutes to complete. For example, you might schedule a short reading or a worksheet for one 15 minute block. However, scheduling an entire book chapter, or a packet of worksheets would be too much for 15 minutes. Including meal and break times on the schedule is also important to maintain structure in your child’s environment. Make sure that you include snack times, meal times, and other important breaks on the schedule. For example, you might schedule in a snack from 10 to 10:15am and then schedule lunch for 12:30 to 1:30pm. To ensure that your kids can always find out what tasks they should be working on at a given time, post the schedule somewhere that is easy for them to access, such as on the kitchen table or on the refrigerator. You might even want to take a few minutes each day to review the schedule with your kids and make sure that they know what tasks they will be working on and when they will be working on those tasks. What is a summary of what this article is about?","response":"This article is about creating a daily school routine for children who are homeschooled.

In a twist fit for primetime television, expletive-laden emails written by President Donald Trump's attorney Marc Kasowitz have surfaced on the same day the lawyer filed court documents, for his other client AMC, that derided obscenity-fueled emails written by The Walking Dead co-creator Frank Darabont. A Rachel Maddow viewer emailed Kasowitz and suggested he should quit working for Trump, ProPublica reports. The lawyer responded in a series of messages that started with \\"F*ck you\\" — asterisk included. \\"Watch your back, bitch,\\" states a second message. \\"Don't be afraid, you piece of shit,\\" says a third. In the fourth message, Kasowitz says he's Jewish and presumes the man who emailed him is too. He then tells the man, \\"I already know where you live, I'm on you. You might as well call me.\\" Kasowitz spokesman Mike Sitrick issued a statement in response to the incident: \\"Mr. Kasowitz, who is tied up with client matters, said he intends to apologize to the writer of the email referenced in today’s ProPublica story. While no excuse, the email came at the end of a very long day that at 10 p.m. was not yet over.\\" He also included a statement from the attorney himself. \\"The person sending that email is entitled to his opinion and I should not have responded in that inappropriate manner,\\" said Kasowitz. \\"I intend to send him an email stating just that. This is one of those times where one wishes he could reverse the clock, but of course I can’t.” AMC has not yet responded to a request for comment. ||||| The Trump Administration The 45th President and His Administration Marc Kasowitz, President Trump’s personal attorney on the Russia case, threatened a stranger in a string of profanity-laden emails Wednesday night. The man, a retired public relations professional in the western United States who asked not to be identified, read ProPublica’s story this week on Kasowitz and sent the lawyer an email with the subject line: “Resign Now.’’ Kasowitz replied with series of angry messages sent between 9:30 p.m. and 10 p.m. Eastern time. One read: “I’m on you now. You are fucking with me now Let’s see who you are Watch your back , bitch.” In another email, Kasowitz wrote: “Call me. Don’t be afraid, you piece of shit. Stand up. If you don’t call, you’re just afraid.” And later: “I already know where you live, I’m on you. You might as well call me. You will see me. I promise. Bro.” Kasowitz’s spokesman, Michael Sitrick, said Thursday he couldn’t immediately reach Kasowitz for comment. ProPublica confirmed the man’s phone number matched his stated identity. Technical details in the emails, such as IP addresses and names of intermediate mail servers, also show the emails came from Kasowitz’s firm. In one email, Kasowitz gave the man a cell phone number that is not widely available. We confirmed Kasowitz uses that number. The exchange began after the man saw our story featured last night on the Rachel Maddow show on MSNBC. We reported that Kasowitz is not seeking a security clearance even though the Russia case involves a significant amount of classified material. Experts said Kasowitz could have trouble getting a security clearance because of what multiple sources described as a recent history of alcohol abuse. Former employees also said Kasowitz had engaged in behavior that made them uncomfortable. Since the story was published, his spokesman issued a statement disputing several parts of the story: “Marc Kasowitz has not struggled with alcoholism,” Sitrick wrote. “He has not come into the office intoxicated, attorneys have not had to go across the street to the restaurant during the workday to consult Kasowitz on work matters.” The rigorous background investigation that goes into getting security clearance also considers “any information relevant to strength of character, honesty, discretion, sound judgment, [and] reliability.” The exchange of emails Wednesday began at 9:28 p.m. Eastern when the man sent the following message to Kasowitz’s firm account: Five minutes later, Kasowitz responded with two words: Fifteen minutes after that, Kasowitz sent a second email: The man responded politely: But Kasowitz continued to harangue him: And then, just 33 minutes after the man’s initial email, Kasowitz sent a fourth response, referring to his own Jewish heritage and the man’s name, which he presumed to be Jewish: The man told us that the email exchange disturbed him so greatly he forwarded it to the FBI so there would be a written record in case Kasowitz followed through on the threat. Experts in the laws on harassment and online threats differed on whether Kasowitz’s emails could put him in legal jeopardy. When considering whether words constitute a true threat versus protected speech, “the threat has to be credible and the person has to intend to make the victim fear imminent physical harm,’’ said Danielle Citron, a University of Maryland law professor and author of a book on online harassment. Citron pointed in particular to Kasowitz’s statements: “I already know where you live” and “you will see me. I promise.” She said: “That’s incredibly troubling language. If I’m a prosecutor I’m going to think hard about that.” Ron Kuby, a New York lawyer who argued a case that overturned a portion of the state’s harassment law on free speech grounds, said he believed Kasowitz had not violated the law with his missives. “When Kasowitz says things like ‘I already know where you live’ he is inching closer to the line. But in my view — as someone who despises the Trump administration, but who has litigated these issues — he is well on the legal side of the line.” For over 15 years, Trump has periodically retained Kasowitz, who has cultivated a tough-guy image. The New York Times reported this week that the relationship between Kasowitz and the Trump White House had soured and that Kasowitz could resign. Kasowitz’s spokesman told ProPublica Wednesday: “The NYT story is not accurate.” Kasowitz’s firm was also sued for malpractice this week by a former client in a billing dispute. A spokesman for Marc Kasowitz sent ProPublica this statement: “Mr. Kasowitz, who is tied up with client matters, said he intends to apologize to the writer of the email referenced in today’s ProPublica story. While no excuse, the email came at the end of a very long day that at 10 p.m. was not yet over. ‘The person sending that email is entitled to his opinion and I should not have responded in that inappropriate manner,’ Mr. Kasowitz said. ‘I intend to send him an email stating just that. This is one of those times where one wishes he could reverse the clock, but of course I can’t.’” Jeremy Merrill and Jesse Eisinger contributed reporting.

Here’s more information on how to leak to ProPublica. ||||| The Trump Administration The 45th President and His Administration The ongoing investigations into alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia involve reams of classified material. Yet Marc Kasowitz, the New York lawyer whom President Donald Trump has hired to defend him in these inquiries, told ProPublica through a spokesman that he does not have a security clearance — the prerequisite for access to government secrets. Nor does he expect to seek one. Several lawyers who have represented presidents and senior government officials said they could not imagine handling a case so suffused with sensitive material without a clearance. “No question in my mind — in order to represent President Trump in this matter you would have to get a very high level of clearance because of the allegations involving Russia,” said Robert Bennett, who served as President Bill Clinton’s personal lawyer. Like many Washington lawyers, Bennett has held security clearances throughout his career. As the spotlight on Russia intensifies with new email disclosures that his son, son-in-law, and then-campaign manager met in June 2016 with a Russian attorney who promised damaging information about Hillary Clinton, Kasowitz’s lack of a security clearance could hinder the president’s legal and political response to the scandal. One possible explanation for Kasowitz’s decision not to pursue a clearance: He might have trouble getting one. In recent weeks, ProPublica spoke with more than two dozen current and former employees of Kasowitz’s firm, Kasowitz Benson Torres LLP, as well as his friends and acquaintances. Past and present employees of the firm said in interviews that Kasowitz has struggled intermittently with alcohol abuse, leading to a stint in rehab in the winter of 2014-15 . Several people told ProPublica that Kasowitz has been drinking in recent months. (The vast majority of those who spoke to ProPublica for this article declined to be quoted by name, citing Kasowitz’s penchant for threatening lawsuits.) Experts on federal security reviews told ProPublica that recent episodes of alcohol abuse are a major barrier to receiving clearance, a process that involves government agents poring over a person’s past and interviewing family, friends and colleagues. Investigators typically raise flags about behaviors that might make someone vulnerable to blackmail or suggest poor judgment. Kasowitz’s spokesman said he doesn’t need a clearance. “No one has suggested he requires a security clearance, there has been no need for a security clearance, and we do not anticipate a need for a security clearance,” the spokesman said. “If and when a security clearance is needed, Mr. Kasowitz will apply for one with the other members of the legal team.” Kasowitz’s spokesman did not directly respond to questions about whether he has struggled with alcohol abuse, but said the attorney is able to drink in moderation without a problem. While not a government employee, Kasowitz has become a public face of the administration on the Russia case. Last month, he went before the cameras to deliver the president’s response to the landmark testimony of fired FBI Director James Comey. White House officials have regularly referred media inquiries about Russia-related matters, including queries about Jared Kushner and Michael Flynn, to Kasowitz. In Washington, where every word and action of the president’s lawyer is scrutinized, Kasowitz is a neophyte. Instead of negotiating deals among the capital’s power brokers or fending off FBI investigations, Kasowitz, 65, built a lucrative practice in civil court suing banks and representing, among others, a leading tobacco company. Kasowitz has been described by colleagues in the scrappy world of New York lawyers as the “toughest of the tough guys.” Bloomberg News called him a “Pit Bull Loyal to The Boss” while The New York Times described him as “the Donald Trump of lawyering.” His aggressive legal style has spurred rebukes from two judges. For over 15 years, he represented Donald Trump, earning the president’s loyalty through his eager pugilism. Kasowitz has defended him in the Trump University fraud lawsuit. He fought to keep records from Trump’s 1990 divorce private, and threatened to sue The New York Times for publishing a story in which women accused Trump of unwanted touching and sexual assault. He also recently represented Fox News’ Bill O’Reilly after multiple women accused O’Reilly of sexual harassment. Before representing Trump in the Russia inquiry, Kasowitz was informally advising the president. He has told friends he recommended firing Preet Bharara because the crusading prosecutor posed a danger to the administration. He has told people Trump wanted him to be attorney general. Trump reportedly sought a classic Washington lawyer to represent him on Russia before choosing Kasowitz. Initially Kasowitz was reluctant to take it on. “He didn’t seek this,” said Joseph Lieberman, the former senator and Democratic vice presidential candidate who is now senior counsel at the firm. “In the end, the president said, ‘I need you. I know you and trust you.’” Lieberman and Kasowitz grew up in the same neighborhood in New Haven, Connecticut. The future senator used to see Kasowitz’s father, who ran a scrap-metal business, walking through the neighborhood, greeting everyone as he went. Kasowitz went to Yale to study American history and then to Cornell Law School. After graduating in 1977, he started his law career in New York. In 1993, Kasowitz broke off from the prominent firm Mayer Brown to found his own firm. As the firm met with early success, Kasowitz became wealthy. He brags to friends he makes anywhere from 10 million to 30 million per year. He owns an apartment in a white-glove building on Park Avenue and a mansion in Westchester County. He travels by private jet and, when in New York, is driven around in a black Cadillac SUV. He owns at least two horses, according to a lawsuit Kasowitz once filed against his daughter’s equestrian stable. From the start, Kasowitz Benson had a hard-drinking culture that its leaders epitomized. “It’s like a time warp,” said one former employee, citing the firm’s “macho, scotch-drinking, fist-fighting” ethos. Multiple former attorneys said they saw Kasowitz under the influence at the office, an accusation Kasowitz denies. Associates would vie to join powerful partners in Kasowitz’s inner circle during the day at the Palm West Side, the steakhouse just across the street from the firm’s offices, and more recently, at another midtown steakhouse a couple of blocks away called Gallaghers. A framed magazine profile of Kasowitz hangs on the wall across from the bar at the Palm. Three former employees at the firm recall attorneys having to go across the street to the restaurant during the workday to consult Kasowitz on work matters, as he held court, drinking and eating. In response to questions, a spokesman for Kasowitz disputed that, saying he never had a drink during the day at the Palm outside of lunch and dinner and never handled firm business while at the restaurant. Former employees pointed to reckless behavior by Kasowitz while drinking. ProPublica spoke with 10 people who attended the firm’s holiday party on Dec. 10, 2013, at the Edison Ballroom in Manhattan. Spouses and significant others were not invited. Kasowitz, according to an attendee, was visibly inebriated, appearing to have a hard time standing on his feet without support. During the festivities, Kasowitz and a much younger woman not employed by the firm hit the dance floor. According to multiple eyewitnesses, they danced intimately in a way many employees felt was inappropriate for a work event. One person described it as “dirty dancing.” Some employees had seen Kasowitz’s dancing partner before: the then-25-year-old woman had been a hostess at the Palm. “It made women feel uncomfortable,” said one former female attorney who attended the party. Kasowitz’s spokesman, Michael Sitrick, initially said Kasowitz “does not recall whether he danced with her at a holiday party over 3.5 years ago.” Later, he said that the descriptions of Kasowitz dancing at the party were “untrue.” Kasowitz said in a statement he never had “a romantic relationship” with the woman, “who many of us came to know (as we have many others) because she worked at the Palm Restaurant across the street from our offices.” Kasowitz has been married for 25 years to Lori Kasowitz, a former Mayer Brown administrator and regular on the Manhattan charity circuit. The couple has one daughter. Sitrick supplied eight statements from Kasowitz employees attesting to his character and behavior at the party and denying the allegations about the young woman. He said ProPublica could not quote the employees’ statements by name without their permission. ProPublica reached out to all of them. Two declined to be named, and six did not respond to requests to use their names. That was not the only dramatic incident involving Kasowitz and the Palm hostess. Late one Thursday night in March 2013, the same woman was arrested for felony assault at Beauty & Essex, a lower Manhattan restaurant and club, after allegedly throwing a bottle that hit another woman in the head, according to NYPD records. A former partner in the law firm said that Kasowitz was with her and sustained an injury. Afterwards, Kasowitz walked around the office with two black eyes looking “like a raccoon,” according to the former partner. Asked about that incident, Sitrick did not answer directly. He said Kasowitz attended a dinner at a restaurant where the woman was in attendance. As Kasowitz was leaving the restaurant, he was “assaulted by a total stranger,” Sitrick wrote in a statement. The Palm hostess was not involved in that assault and Kasowitz’s assailant was arrested, the spokesman said. According to current and former attorneys at the firm, Kasowitz hit a low point in the winter of 2014-15. He abruptly left New York for Florida, where he owned a mansion at the Equestrian Club Estates in Wellington. Kasowitz sought alcohol treatment at the nearby Caron, a high-end rehab facility, according to two people who heard it from Kasowitz himself. According to Sitrick, that winter had been difficult for Kasowitz because of the death of his father and that he had “sought out counseling” like “millions of Americans.” The spokesman did not answer directly whether Kasowitz was in rehab that winter but said he was not “at Caron in January 2015.” Anyone whose job involves classified information, from White House officials to State Department diplomats to outside contractors, must get a security clearance. The applicant fills out paperwork disclosing where he or she has lived, worked and traveled abroad, as well as any contacts with foreign government officials. The form also asks about substance abuse, criminal history and mental health. The government then undertakes an investigation that can take anywhere from weeks to over a year, depending on the position. In the case of White House positions, the FBI does the investigation. Agents comb through educational and financial records and speak to neighbors, former employers and associates. They then present a recommendation to the hiring agency, which makes the final call. It’s not clear who currently makes decisions on clearances for White House hires. Spokeswoman Hope Hicks told ProPublica that the Trump administration does not comment on security clearance issues. Alcohol abuse is one of many issues examined as part of the security clearance process. The standard form that those seeking clearance must fill out asks whether in the last seven years “your use of alcohol had a negative impact on your work performance, professional or personal relationships, your finances, or resulted in intervention by law enforcement.” According to the official security clearance guidelines, “Alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work in an intoxicated or impaired condition, [or] drinking on the job” can be a reason to withhold clearance. While all clearance decisions are subjective, “You probably wouldn’t get your clearance if you had serious drinking problems in the last five years,” said Sheldon Cohen, a longtime Washington, D.C, security clearance lawyer. The security clearance guidelines also flag personal conduct “that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a foreign intelligence entity.” In 2016, over 1,100 people appealed their denial of security clearance. Alcohol and drug use were common reasons for such denials. Attorneys representing clients in Washington frequently are required to seek security clearances in matters ranging from Hillary Clinton’s Benghazi hearings to employment disputes involving undercover CIA agents. Already, there’s ample evidence that many aspects of the Russia case involve classified material. When former FBI Director James Comey testified about his interactions with President Trump, he said that he took notes after one classified briefing. “I wrote that on a classified device,” he said. Adm. Michael Rogers, the head of the National Security Agency, testified last month of his interactions with Trump that could relate to the obstruction of justice issue: “Those conversations were classified.” Meanwhile, congressional intelligence committees looking at the Russia issue have been scheduling hearings with key witnesses in classified sessions. A congressional meeting with special counsel Robert Mueller also took place in a classified setting. In a statement, Kasowitz said that “we are unaware of and not involved in … any investigation involving ‘highly classified’ (or even classified) information.” The firm has gone through multiple rounds of punishing layoffs. In the past six years, the number of lawyers has shrunk from around 370 to 260 today. Several major rainmakers have departed, including two of the most prominent women at the firm: Eleanor Alter, a well-known divorce lawyer, and Robin Cohen, who led Kasowitz’s insurance group. Now its founder’s increasingly high-profile relationship with Trump has some partners worried that it could damage the firm’s brand and future business prospects. Last year, with Election Day weeks away, Kasowitz fired off a letter threatening to sue The New York Times for a story in which women accused Trump of unwanted touching and sexual assault. Kasowitz’s letter to the Times dismissed the women’s accounts as “false and malicious allegations” and demanded a retraction. “People were embarrassed by the letter,” said one former attorney at Kasowitz’s firm. The Times stood by its story. No lawsuit has been filed. In February, several lawyers were upset when Michael Cohen, the former personal injury lawyer and real estate investor who is best known as Trump’s former in-house attorney, arrived at the office. “I came to see him because we were working on several matters together after the inauguration,” Cohen told ProPublica regarding his multiple visits to Kasowitz. Former employees say the firm briefly converted a conference room for Cohen to use as an office, with his nameplate on it. Cohen said the “multitude of legal matters” he and Kasowitz were discussing included working as co-counsel for a client. Asked if anything came of those talks, Cohen said yes. Sitrick, the Kasowitz spokesman, said, “Michael Cohen never worked for the firm or occupied any office at Kasowitz Benson.” He added: “They were working together on one civil matter for President Trump.” He didn’t specify what it was. During roughly the same period that Cohen was visiting the firm, The New York Times reported that he was under FBI scrutiny in the Russia case. Cohen has denied wrongdoing. One Kasowitz Benson partner, Zachary Mazin, departed in May for another firm, McKool Smith. In a private Facebook post, Mazin praised many of his former colleagues, but said that he and his wife concluded their family could not be associated with the firm. “As the extent of the Firm’s support for Trump’s presidency became clear, Amanda and I concluded that we would not be living our values if I stayed,” he wrote,” adding: “Our most important consideration was the message that this choice sends to our daughters, both now and when they look back on this moment as adults.” When Kasowitz traveled to Washington to respond to the Comey testimony, he brought at least two other lawyers from the firm with him. In the rush to respond to the former FBI director’s testimony accusing President Trump of inappropriate meddling, a team of Kasowitz lawyers, along with another spokesman, Mark Corallo, drafted a statement that was riddled with errors. It started with the widely mocked misspelling, “Predisent Trump.” Corallo said in an email that the statement went out to reporters with typos because of a technical glitch. The day after the June 8 Comey hearing, sources linked to the Kasowitz team told reporters they would file a complaint against the former FBI director for giving what they described as “privileged information” to the press. Three weeks later, that plan fizzled entirely. In recent weeks, employees say, Kasowitz has tried to calm fears within the firm, holding a series of town hall-style meetings. “You can work toward steering this president toward the best possible decisions whether or not you agree with his politics,” Kasowitz said at one such event, according to a person familiar with his remarks. President Trump selected Kasowitz Benson to represent him despite high-profile instances in which judges criticized the firm for ethically questionable tactics. In one particularly heated case, the firm sued investors on behalf of a Canadian insurer, Fairfax Financial Holdings. The company accused the hedge funds and others of conspiring to release information that would send the stock lower. Michael Bowe, Kasowitz’s deputy on the Russia case, was the firm’s lead lawyer. In 2006, employees of Kasowitz’s in-house investigative arm, KBTF Consulting, tried to ensnare employees of Morgan Keegan, a broker-dealer whose insurance analyst was publishing critical research on Fairfax, according to a court document. They wanted to find out if Morgan Keegan gave certain clients access to its analysis before making its reports public. Kasowitz employees, including two lawyers who worked for the investigative arm, created a fake hedge fund called Blackwood Group Capital Partners. Posing as investors, the Kasowitz private investigators met with the Morgan Keegan analyst who covered Fairfax, asking if they could have advance copies of his reports. He said no. Trump’s Personal Lawyer Boasted That He Got Preet Bharara Fired Marc Kasowitz, President Trump’s lawyer in the Russia investigation, has bragged he was behind the firing of U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara. Years later, Morgan Keegan hired a Rutgers law professor, John Leubsdorf, to assess whether the Kasowitz employees violated New Jersey ethical standards. The state bars attorneys from misrepresenting themselves. Leubsdorf called the firm’s conduct “inconsistent with the standards of professional responsibility.” The Morgan Keegan attorneys tried to get Kasowitz’s firm thrown off the case, a request the judge rejected. But the judge said he was troubled by what the Kasowitz firm had done. “I was brought up as a person and as an attorney to think you tell the truth, that that’s the only way you can deal with life. You tell the truth and, right, wrong, or indifferent, the truth will prevail. I don’t recall as an attorney ever participating in a deception such as [this] one,” Stephan Hansbury, a judge for the Superior Court of New Jersey, said at a 2011 hearing. “I don’t think that was an appropriate use of an investigator. I don’t think you’re supposed to go out and create evidence in order to justify a case. That’s not what the law allows.” In 2007, Kasowitz had to defend his law firm from allegations of unethical conduct when another firm accused his team of violating a protective order in a legal proceeding. The order barred disclosure of bank records obtained during discovery in a federal shareholder lawsuit against Kasowitz’s client, a Canadian pharmaceutical company then known as Biovail. But when Kasowitz’s law firm filed a separate complaint in New Jersey state court on behalf of Biovail, it used the bank records from the federal proceeding to bolster its case. Lawyers for the bank cried foul and in February 2007, Kasowitz had a testy conference call with Richard Owen, the U.S. district judge overseeing the federal case. Owen was furious: “You get a whole bunch of the bank’s records and you’re sitting there drafting a complaint in New Jersey and you’re saying nobody ever said, ‘Where the hell did we get these records from, how come we have them?’” he asked Kasowitz, according to a court transcript of the call. Kasowitz said his law firm did not know about the protective order and countered that the documents were not marked “confidential.” Owen did not see that as a good enough excuse and the two men went back-and-forth. Finally, Owen lost his temper. “The record may show I hung up on Mr. Kasowitz,” said Owen, who has since died. Kasowitz’s spokesman said the firm did nothing wrong in either case. Eventually, Biovail fired Kasowitz’s legal team over the issue, only to rehire the firm a few months later. The firm was not sanctioned by Owen. How Kasowitz’s aggressive style will play during the Russia inquiry is unclear — especially without a security clearance.

The election course is complicated, and the road to the Oval Office is long. Potential candidates must present papers stating their intention to seek their party's recommendation; delegates then choose from among those running some months later at the national conferences. Before that, however, each state holds a primary election that determines how the state's voters want the party's delegates to vote. Methods of choosing the delegates vary from state to state. At the conferences, there are speeches and often heated discussions. It may take several rounds of voting before delegates can agree on a candidate. On the final day of the meeting, the presidential candidate announces his or her choice for vice president. Election Day, by law, is the Tuesday that follows the first Monday in November. On this day, registered voters may cast their votes for president, vice president, and candidates for other federal state, and local offices. The popular vote, however, does not determine who will be president. The president is chosen by a vote of the Electoral College, a group of 538 citizens from the 50 states and the District of Columbia who are chosen to cast votes for the president and vice president. The rules for choosing electors, as with the delegates, vary. Each state also decides whether its electoral votes must reflect the popular vote. The number of electors in each state is determined by the number of representatives and senators that a state sends to Congress and, therefore, may change every 10 years, depending on the results of the United States census .

Pick your answer from: * Use a wood pencil to cut the wood.; * Use a wood pencil to mark where to cut.; Answer:","response":"The best way to mark where to cut on a piece of wood is to use a wood pencil to mark where to cut. This method allows you precise control over your mark and ensures that your cut lines are accurate. Below is a step by step guide on how to do it properly. To get accurate cuts and optimize your woodworking project, you will need a few tools: a straight edge (for straight cuts), a tape measure or a ruler for measuring, a carpenter's square to ensure your lines are straight, and a good quality, sharp pencil. Here are the steps to follow: 1. **Measure your cut:** First, use a tape measure or a ruler to take the measurement for your cut. Make sure to take the time to get an accurate measurement. 2. **Mark the Cut:** Use your wood pencil to mark the measurement on your piece of wood. It helps you visualize where you would make your cut. Depending on the color of your wood, pencil lines can be perfectly visible on it. 3. **Using a Straight Edge or a Carpenter's Square:** If you're making a straight cut, line up a straight edge or a carpenter's square with the mark you've just made. For perfect perpendicular lines to your reference edge, a carpenter's square is ideal. 4. **Draw the Cut Line:** Hold the straight edge or carpenter’s square firmly against the wood to keep it from moving. Then use your pencil to draw a line along the edge of the straight edge or square onto the wood. This line will be your guiding reference when you're making your cut. 5: **Recheck Measurement:** It's always a good idea to double-check your measurements and markings before you proceed with cutting the wood. If needed, adjust your lines. 6. **Make the Cut:** Once your mark is made and you're certain it's accurate, you can then proceed to make your cut using the preferred saw suitable for the type of cut and wood you're working with. Remember that a sharp pencil is crucial. A dull pencil can create wide, vague lines that can reduce the precision of your cut. Also, make sure your line is not too heavy. It's better to have a lighter line that can be seen and followed by a saw than a heavy line that may smear or become indistinct. The advantage of using a pencil over other marking tools is that you can easily erase the mark if made in error and that it doesn't negatively affect the appearance of finished wood surfaces. In conclusion, using a wood pencil to mark where to cut in your wood is an effective and simple way to ensure a high level of precision and accuracy in your woodworking projects."},{"question":"Please add spaces between words: Yes.ThereisaninternetPointinMontaioneinthePublicLibraryinViaMarconi.Phone+39(0)571699252.","response":"Yes, there is an internet point in Montaione in the public library in Via Marconi.

Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Puskas tries to come to most of his daughters’ high school soccer games at Camp Humphreys. In fact, his family’s lifestyle at this sprawling U.S. military base is similar to one they would lead back home. “We go to church on Sundays. We see all our friends there. We’re on the soccer field most of the afternoons, or just going for bike ride, the same things we would do if we were back in the States,” said Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Puskas, with the U.S. Eight Army. This is Puskas’ fourth tour in Korea. He met and married his Korean wife Mi-jung, during an earlier tour. His children have spent much of their lives at military bases in Korea. “I think it has given me a wider world view and has helped me understand other people a lot more,” said Elizabeth Puskas, the eldest daughter of the family who will attend college next year in the United States. The U.S. military in Korea is consolidating its forces in Camp Humphreys, including its military headquarters, as it moves to close older bases in congested Seoul and other regions of the country. Camp Humphreys is now the size of a small city, encompassing over 140 square kilometers of land, with construction underway to expand its capacity to accommodate over 40,000 people. There are modern apartments for soldiers and their families, schools, movie theaters, shopping centers and fast food restaurants to help bring some of the comforts of home to military life in Korea. The base even has its own golf course. “I have been around the army for part of the last 40 years as a soldier and now as a civilian, and this is as normal as any army post I’ve ever been on.

A: Answer:","response":"When we move down a group of elements on the periodic table, the electronegativity of the elements generally decreases. So, the correct option is: IV. it decreases. The decrease in electronegativity occurs as we move down a group because the atomic size increases due to the addition of electron shells. These additional electron shells cause the outer electrons to be further away from the nucleus, leading to a weaker attraction between the nucleus and the valence electrons. As a result, the ability of an atom to attract bonding electrons decreases, leading to a decrease in electronegativity."},{"question":"Does the following review have a positive or negative opinion of the movie? p.t. anderson understands the grandness of romance and how love is the great equalizer that can calm us of our daily ills and bring out joys in our lives that we never knew were possible","response":"To identify the sentiment of the user's review, I would consider the choice of words and expressions used in the review.

Assume the user is referring to financial benefits or incentives for using a search engine. 2. Look into popular search engines (Bing, Google, Yahoo, etc.) and identify their user rewards or incentive programs, if any. 3. Currently, Bing offers a rewards program called Microsoft Rewards. This program allows users to earn points by searching on Bing, playing games, and completing other activities. These points can be redeemed for various gift cards, sweepstakes entries, or charitable donations. 4. Google, on the other hand, does not have a direct rewards program for using their search engine. However, they have other services like Google Play Points and Opinion Rewards that offer incentives for different activities, but these are not linked to using the search engine itself. 5. Yahoo does not have a rewards program for using its search engine either. 6. Comparing the incentives offered by Bing, Google, and Yahoo, Bing appears to provide more direct financial benefits for the user through its Microsoft Rewards program. 7.

The year's best meteor shower returns for its August shooting star show, courtesy of a cloud of comet dust smacking into the Earth. A bright Perseid meteor streaked down Saturday night (Aug. 7, 2010) over buildings at the Stellafane amateur astronomy convention in Springfield, Vermont. (Photo: Dennis di Cicco Sky & Telescope) Story Highlights Sunday and Monday nights are the best times to see the annual meteor shower The fireballs will streak across the sky at nearly 134,000 miles per hour You will have to stay up late; the best viewing comes from midnight to dawn Put out the lawn chair, set the alarm and maybe bring something to wet your whistle while you gaze into the nighttime sky — the year's best shooting star show has started. August's annual Perseids meteor shower peaks Sunday and Monday, promising perhaps 70 meteors an hour those evenings. \\"The Perseids are the good ones,\\" says meteorite expert Bill Cooke of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala. The Perseids take their name from their apparent origin in the constellation Perseus, the hero of ancient Greek myth born from a shower of heavenly gold. Known for producing fireballs that might streak across a third of the sky, they owe their brilliance to the speed — nearly 134,000 mph — with which they smack into the upper atmosphere. \\"It's also because of the size of the meteors,\\" Cooke says. The dust grains are about one-fifth of an inch across and burn nicely as they zip overhead. Those dust grains come courtesy of Comet Swift-Tuttle, which circles the sun once every 133 years and leaves behind a debris trail. (Comets are basically dirty snowballs that develop tails when they approach the sun and start to melt. Different ones are responsible for other regular meteor showers, such as April's Lyrids, brought by Comet C/1861 G1 Thatcher, and November's Leonids brought by Comet 55P/Tempel-Tuttle.) You will have to stay up late to see the Perseids at their peak; the best viewing comes from midnight to dawn, particularly after the half-full moon sets at 1 a.m. on Monday, says Astronomy magazine's Michael Bakich. But they should appear at night during the week before and after the peak as well. \\"Get out of the city and the lights to give yourself a chance to see them,\\" Bakich says. The rule of thumb is that you should be able to see all the stars of the Big Dipper — seven stars if you are counting — to give yourself enough darkness to catch the shooting stars. And give your eyes an hour to adjust. \\"There will be a dozen 'ooh' moments in that hour,\\" Bakich says. \\"Ones when everyone will say, 'Did you see that?'\\" Astronaut Ron Garan looks down on a Perseid meteor from the International Space Station. (Photo: Ron Garan / NASA) Although the shooting stars seem to come from the constellation Perseus, don't look there to see them, Bakich advises. Instead, look about one-third of the sky down and away from the constellation to spot meteors streaking across the sky. \\"That makes them easier to pick out,\\" he says. While you are enjoying the sky show, satellite operators are buttoning up spacecraft to protect them from the onslaught of comet dust, says Cooke, who prepares meteor shower forecasts each year for space businesses. While the 2013 Perseid shower won't affect the Hubble Space Telescope, according to Janet Anderson of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., at other times it might point the opening to its mirrors away from the direction of an outburst of meteors. Other satellites might turn vulnerable antennas away from them as well. Clouds permitting, Cooke advises skywatchers this year to take their time and enjoy the nighttime show. \\"All you need is to lie flat on your back, and the reward is meteors.\\" Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1ev828w ||||| One of the year's best astronomical events will light up the sky for the next five nights. Best of all, it's really easy to observe. You don't need telescopes or cameras, just a deckchair, blankets and a hot thermos to keep you company. Wait until late at night. If the sky is clear, find the darkest site you can with a clear eastern horizon. Plonk yourself down in the chair facing east, cover up with the blanket and wait. The Perseid meteor shower is expected to peak in the pre-dawn skies on both 12 and 13 August. The Perseids were once part of comet Swift-Tuttle. At 27 kilometres across, this is one of the largest. It orbits the sun every 133 years and last passed by in 1992. Whenever it approaches, the heat of the sun disintegrates its ice, creating a dusty tail and replenishing the Perseid stream. The Earth passes through this stream every August, sparking the meteor shower. Each one of the meteors, sometimes called shooting stars, that you see is a tiny speck of dust as old as the formation of Earth and the other planets, 4.6bn years ago. It burns with incandescent glory because it has hit our atmosphere at a speed of 160,000 kilometres per hour (100,000 miles per hour). This creates a shockwave that compresses a pocket of air in front of the dust grain and raises it to a temperature of a few thousand degrees. This is enough to burn up the dust and create a bright meteor. Swift Tuttle is the largest object to regularly pass Earth. Its orbit is known well enough for astronomers to believe it does not pose a collision hazard for at least the next 2,000 years. A Perseid meteor over the Roman castle of Bukelon, near Matochina in Bulgaria, on 13 August 2010. Photograph: Vassil Donev/EPA The Perseids are generally considered the most active and reliable of the 64 meteor showers that Earth passes through every year. A recent Nasa study found that it offers the best chance out of all the meteor showers of seeing an ultra-bright meteor called a fireball. Even if you don't see a fireball, you are guaranteed that there will be dozens of ordinary meteors every hour – providing the sky is clear and you can stay awake.

Stargazers are in for a show again on Monday night as the peak of the Perseid meteor shower once again illuminates the night sky. Perseid meteors are particles from the debris trail on the comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle and hit the Earth's atmosphere moving at 132,000 mph. Unfortunately, clouds and showers threaten to obscure the show across a large swath of the country on Monday night. Most places from the East Coast through the Tennessee Valley and the central Plains will have to find breaks in the clouds to enjoy the show. The best places to view the Perseid's will be across much of Florida, Texas and the Great Lakes, where the sky should be mostly clear for much of the night. Much of the West will also have good viewing conditions. The nation's midsection will not catch much of the shower as a front slowly sags southward, posing a threat for violent and drenching thunderstorms. RELATED: Latest U.S. Satellite AccuWeather.com Astronomy Blog Share Your Pictures of the Meteor Shower Much of the Northeast will also miss the display thanks to a front moving in from the west. During the peak, the moon will be in a crescent phase, and will set in the sky by midnight in most locations. The dark sky will aid in the spectacle, allowing even fainter meteors to be seen. \\"Any time you have a darker sky, that helps,\\" AccuWeather.com Meteorologist Mark Paquette said. The shower, nicknamed the \\"Fireball Champion,\\" produces more meteors than any other annual shower and is typically bright enough at its peak to be seen in areas that suffer some light pollution. \\"Most people consider this the best meteor shower of all to see shooting stars,\\" Paquette said. If the weather or other plans prevented you from viewing the meteor shower on Sunday night, the show should be just as brilliant on Monday night--weather dependent. |||||Summary:","response":"The Perseids meteor shower is an annual event that peaks around August 12-13, lighting up the night sky as Comet Swift-Tuttle's debris trail collides with Earth's atmosphere. The meteorites can travel at speeds of nearly 134,000 miles per hour and can produce spectacular fireball displays. The best viewing times are from midnight to dawn, away from city lights. The Perseids meteor shower is considered one of the best astronomical events of the year as it offers excellent chances of seeing bright and fast meteors. The Perseid meteors get their name from their apparent origin in the constellation Perseus, which is related to ancient Greek mythology.

It needed to be designed to explode in a different way, and even then had to be targeted with extreme precision.

Should I validate this answer? OPTIONS: (A). No; (B). Yes; The answer is:","response":"(A). No; The suggested answer focuses on the music video directed by Anton Corbijn and its critical acclaim rather than addressing the actual question about what the song \\"Heart-Shaped Box\\" is about. A more appropriate and detailed answer would be: \\"Heart-Shaped Box\\" is a song by the American rock band Nirvana, written by the band's frontman Kurt Cobain. The song was released as the first single from their third and final studio album, \\"In Utero\\" in 1993. While the interpretation of the song's meaning can vary, Kurt Cobain has mentioned in interviews that the lyrics were inspired by several themes, such as his personal and professional life, obsession, and love. The term \\"heart-shaped box\\" is believed to symbolize both love and the human body. In some interpretations, it represents a box that Cobain's then-wife Courtney Love had gifted to him filled with memorabilia, symbolizing their relationship. Another interpretation reflects that the song could be about Cobain's complex feelings towards the music industry and the feelings of being trapped by fame. In terms of the music video, it was indeed directed by Anton Corbijn and received critical acclaim. The video's imagery, which includes scenes of an old man climbing a crucifix, fetuses hanging on trees, and a heart in a box, contributes to the overall dark and surreal tone that further emphasizes the song's themes. To validate the answer, it would be important to focus on the themes and interpretations of the song itself in addition to the music video's role in portraying those themes."},{"question":"The Stratocaster and Telecaster guitars are manufactured by which company????","response":"To find the answer to this question, I will need to search for information about Stratocaster and Telecaster guitars to determine which company manufactures them.

Article: In Jane Austin's time, unmarried girls were always closely guarded, and hardly allowed to be alone with a young man; and during the Victorian period (just the period after Jane Austin) exposure of the body in particular was thought to be most immoral, Victorian ladies wore dresses reaching down to their feet, long in the sleeve and high at the neck. Since then, ways of dressing as well as times have changed. Girls were no longer guarded, and they can do more or less what they like. And yet among all these astonishing changes, one thing has remained much the same for most people, and that is the same of becoming a mother before being married. If this does happen, there often comes a quick marriage with the responsible man. If this is impossible, the affair may bring considerable shame to the girl's parents as well as to herself. It is now quite normal for a girl, once past the age of about fifteen, to go out with a boyfriend, and although her parents will probably insist that she come home at a certain time, beyond this they depend on her or look after herself. Kisses between young men and women are now considered to be perfectly normal, but although times have changed so much, most people still believe that a woman should not become a mother before being married.

Generate a negative review for a place","response":"Title: Disappointing Experience at The Hyped Haven I had a chance to visit The Hyped Haven last weekend, a place I was eagerly looking forward to trying after hearing all the rave reviews from friends and social media. However, my excitement was short-lived as I was met with a series of letdowns that called into question whether it was worth the effort, time, and resources. I am disappointed to say that my expectations were not met, and I will be sharing my thoughts on what went wrong in this review. Upon walking into The Hyped Haven, the first thing I noticed was the lack of proper lighting. The place felt drab and unwelcoming, a far cry from the trendy and cozy atmosphere I had anticipated. The dim lighting did not do the aesthetically pleasing décor justice, as it was difficult to appreciate its uniqueness. Moving on to the service, this was another aspect that left me less than impressed. The waiting staff seemed overwhelmed and disorganized as they took an unusually long time to greet us, get the menus, and take our order. When I asked for recommendations, the server, albeit polite, appeared unsure of what to suggest and seemed to have little knowledge of the items on the menu. The food arrived after an agonizing wait of over 45 minutes. This would not have been an issue if the quality of the food had made up for the delay. Unfortunately, that was not the case. I ordered the Chef's Special Pasta, while my partner opted for the highly praised Haven Burger. My pasta was overcooked, and the sauce was overly rich and heavy on the salt. It lacked a harmonious balance of flavors, and the experience of eating it was underwhelming. The burger, although cooked to the right temperature, was drowning in a pool of condiments which inhibited the taste of the beef patty and toppings. Sadly, the desserts did not save the day either. The Chocolate Lava Cake was underbaked in the middle, making it runny and unappealing with every bite. My partner's Panna Cotta was too stiff, indicating that too much gelatin was employed, and the accompanying fruit coulis lacked brightness in its taste. The ambience proved to be another fail. The noise level was surprisingly high, making it difficult for us to maintain a conversation. Between the loud music and other diners’ chatter, my partner and I were not able to relax and focus on our dining experience. Ultimately, the prices failed to justify the unfavorable experience we had. Given that The Hyped Haven is considered an upscale eatery with fairly steep prices, we expected them to deliver both quality service and exceptional food. In this case, the combined factors led to our overall disappointment. In conclusion, I had a negative experience at The Hyped Haven and would recommend potential visitors to think twice before visiting. With numerous other restaurants in the area offering better service, food, and atmosphere, I find it hard to justify returning when there are countless superior alternatives. I sincerely hope The Hyped Haven takes this review to heart and makes the necessary improvements to ensure future customers do not undergo the same disappointment."},{"question":"\\"Tsunami\\" is a song by Manic Street Preachers, released as a single on July 5, 1999 through Epic.

His neighbor, Maggie Gault The answer is:","response":"Step 1: Define the main characters and their backgrounds. Larry: A middle-aged man who dreams of changing his career and pursuing his passion for writing. He is married but feels unsupported by his wife when it comes to his dreams. Maggie Gault: An artistic and kind-hearted neighbor who has recently moved into the house next to Larry's. She has a background in theatre and a deep understanding of the arts. Step 2: Establish the setting and time period. The movie takes place in a suburban neighborhood in present-day. The setting is important because it represents the everyday mundaneness that Larry wants to escape from. Step 3: Develop the main conflict. Larry is stuck in a dead-end job, and he feels trapped in his current life. He wants to pursue his passion for writing but is too afraid to take the leap due to fear of failure and lack of support from his wife. Larry's internal conflict is then established when he meets his new neighbor, Maggie Gault, who encourages him to chase his dreams. Step 4: Build up tension and subplots. While Larry's wife remains unsupportive, he starts to develop a close friendship with Maggie. Together, they work on a play that Larry has always wanted to write. Through their creative collaboration and meaningful conversations, Larry starts to regain his sense of confidence and hope for his future. Meanwhile, his wife grows increasingly suspicious of their relationship. Step 5: Create a turning point and climax. As the play nears completion, Larry's wife confronts him about his relationship with Maggie. She accuses him of having an affair. An emotional confrontation ensues, during which Larry finally stands up for himself and declares his commitment to pursuing his dreams, regardless of her support or lack thereof. This turning point changes their marital dynamics. Step 6: Provide a resolution After the confrontation, Larry's wife starts to see the value in her husband's passion and begins to understand the importance of chasing one's dreams. Realizing her past mistakes, she chooses to support Larry as he pursues his writing career. On the other hand, Maggie decides to move to a new town to chase her own dreams and, though sad to part ways, Larry and Maggie remain friends and maintain contact. Step 7: Conclude the plot With renewed strength and support from his wife, Larry embarks on his writing journey with hope for success and a deeper appreciation for the people who supported him in the pursuit of his dreams. The movie ends on a hopeful note, showing Larry's first play being successfully produced at a local theatre, leaving the audience inspired and rooting for Larry's success. In summary, the movie plot would revolve around Larry's internal and external conflicts, the role of Maggie Gault as a catalyst for change, and the importance of supporting the passions and dreams of those we love. The plot intertwines relationships, self-discovery, and the pursuit of happiness, ultimately showcasing the transformative power of encouragement and support within relationships."},{"question":"Continue the following story. So Pick your answer from: --Katrina ignored the ice because Katrina was hot and thirsty while Patricia just drank some water.. --Patricia ignored the ice because Katrina was hot and thirsty while Patricia just drank some water..","response":"One sunny day, Katrina and Patricia were out playing in the park. They were running around, laughing, and having a great time. As they played, they began to feel very hot and thirsty because the sun was shining brightly and their bodies were working hard to keep up with all the fun they were having. Now, at the edge of the park, there was a little ice machine, full of cold and frosty ice cubes. Patricia saw it and thought, \\"Hmm, I could use some of that ice to cool down.\\" But then she remembered that she had just taken a big sip of water from her water bottle, and she wasn't as thirsty as her friend Katrina. So Patricia ignored the ice, because Katrina was the one who was really hot and thirsty, while Patricia had just drank some water. Patricia decided to share her water bottle with Katrina, so they could both stay cool and hydrated while they continued playing in the park. Together, they went back to their games and adventures, feeling refreshed and ready to have even more fun under the warm sun that day, thanks to Patricia's thoughtfulness and their teamwork in sharing the water.

Now, think about a time when you knew how many of the mixed-up candies were in the bowl. That's like the distortion being quantifiable. Just because you can't tell how many mixed-up candies are in the bowl now, that doesn't mean you knew for sure how many were there in the past.

This can also apply to military figures, or civilians impersonated for political or espionage purposes. Based on that paragraph can we conclude that this sentence is true? A political decoy impersonates someone for the fun of it. Select from: [+] Yes [+] It's impossible to say [+] No","response":"[+] No The sentence \\"A political decoy impersonates someone for the fun of it\\" is not true based on the given paragraph. Based on the provided information, a political decoy impersonates a politician or other person of importance to either draw attention away from them or to take risks on their behalf. The primary motive behind employing a political decoy is not for pure amusement or entertainment, but rather to serve strategic, practical, security-related, and political purposes. While a political decoy might get some personal satisfaction or enjoyment out of the act of impersonation, the main intent is to protect the person they are impersonating and/or to further the goals and objectives of the person, organization, or government employing them. In this sense, it is not an activity undertaken purely for fun but a task typically carried out with specific objectives in mind. Moreover, the concept of a political decoy goes beyond simple impersonation. In many cases, these decoys must have a keen understanding of the person they impersonate, their mannerisms, beliefs, and speaking style, to convincingly portray that individual in public. Their roles may extend to participating in public events, speaking engagements, or even engaging in diplomatic relations—all with the aim of protecting the real individual. Throughout history, there have been several notable political decoys, which have played crucial roles in different capacities. For example, one of the most famous political decoys in history is the alleged use of body doubles by Joseph Stalin. These decoys were believed to have been used for a range of purposes, including public appearances, to help maintain the Soviet leader's authority and security. Another example is the use of impersonators by Saddam Hussein, who employed lookalikes to potentially thwart assassination attempts and confuse his enemies. In conclusion, political decoys primarily impersonate someone for strategic, security-related, or political reasons rather than for mere personal amusement. While some may find the act of impersonation enjoyable, the main purpose of their role is to provide protection, strategic advantage, or misinformation to benefit the person they impersonate or the organization employing them."},{"question":"Which journalist became the 172nd president of the MCC?

President Barack Obama speaks during a 'Lawyers for Obama Luncheon' fundraiser, Friday, March, 16, 2012, at the Palmer House Hotel in Chicago. (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais) (Associated Press) Obama increased fundraising efforts during the month, collecting nearly twice as much as the 23 million per month average he raised during the final three months of 2011 and more than the 29.1 million he raised in January. The money was spread among Obama's campaign, the Democratic party and two campaign funds. Obama's campaign said nearly 350,000 people contributed in February, and the average donation was about 59 for the entire election cycle. Nearly 98 percent of the donations were 250 or less. The fundraising reports were being filed ahead of a Tuesday campaign finance deadline for presidential campaigns. With Republicans locked in an extended primary campaign to win that party's nomination, Obama's team has tried to build a large 50-state operation that will help it register new voters, bring back past supporters and boost turnout. Obama's campaign had about 75 million in the bank through the end of January, and totals for February were not immediately available. Campaign officials have implored supporters to donate money and get involved, pointing to Republican-leaning super political action committees that are expected to raise hundreds of millions of dollars to defeat the president. Obama's campaign said earlier this year that it would bless big-money super PACs supporting Democrats as a way of countering the Republican effort. That was a turnaround from Obama's earlier opposition to the new groups. In an email to donors last week, campaign manager Jim Messina cited a poll showing Obama trailing against Republican front-runner Mitt Romney and asked them to get involved. \\"We're looking at a race that will be tighter than you think. And the other side has groups ready to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to tear down President Obama,\\" Messina said. Obama's totals for February fell short of the 56 million he raised in February 2008, when he was seeking the Democratic nomination against now-Secratary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton. Republicans said it was a sign of tepid support. Kirsten Kukowski, a Republican National Committee spokeswoman, said Obama was \\"having a hard time convincing voters he deserves another term\\" following three years of \\"record debt, high unemployment and soaring gas prices and health care costs.\\" Obama has boosted fundraising efforts in recent weeks, holding events last month in Miami, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle. Last week, Obama raised money in Chicago and Atlanta. ||||| RNC spokeswoman Kirsten Kukowski reacts to President Obama's 45M February haul, noting that it's far less than his February 2008 haul: “After three years of policies that have left our country with record debt, high unemployment, and soaring gas prices and healthcare costs, it’s clear President Obama is having a hard time convincing voters he deserves another term. The president who ran on change and hope has left our country wanting and whether it’s showing in fundraising or in the polls, Americans are enthusiastic about replacing him in November.” ||||| Summary:","response":"In February 2012, Barack Obama raised 45 million for his re-election campaign, taking the total funds raised thus far to approximately 300 million. This figure was nearly double the 23 million average per month he had raised during the final quarter of 2011 and an increase from the 29.1 million raised in January 2012. The donations were from almost 350,000 contributors, and about 98% of them were 250 or less—a significantly smaller sum than the 56 million he raised in February 2008 when he was competing for the Democratic nomination against Hillary Rodham Clinton. The funds were dispersed among the president's campaign, the Democratic party, and two campaign funds. The increase in fundraising efforts for February aimed to better consolidate support and counter the fundraising efforts of Republican-leaning super political action committees, which were expected to raise hundreds of millions of dollars to defeat Obama. Campaign manager Jim Messina cited a poll that showed Obama lagging behind Republican front-runner Mitt Romney and warned that the race would be tighter than expected. In response to the fundraising report, Republicans claimed that it showcased tepid support for Obama due to his administration's policies that led to a record debt, high unemployment, and growing gas prices and health care costs."},{"question":"Given the question: Information: - A \\"metropolitan area\\", sometimes referred to as a \\"metro area\\" or just \\"metro\\", is a region consisting of a densely populated urban core and its less-populated surrounding territories, sharing industry, infrastructure, and housing.

Thus if a tributary stream joins a brook that in turn joins a small river which is a tributary of a larger river, there is a series of successively larger (and lower elevation) drainage basins. For instance, the Missouri and Ohio rivers are within their own drainage basins and also within the drainage basin of the Mississippi River. - A lagoon is a shallow body of water separated from a larger body of water by barrier islands or reefs.

How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer is:","response":"The question appears to be a combination of two unrelated topics: the melting of a rock and the functions of the pancreas. To provide a detailed and long answer, we will first address the different aspects of the question separately and then attempt to establish a connection between these two unrelated topics. First, let us discuss the functions of the pancreas in maintaining blood sugar levels, and producing and secreting digestive enzymes. 1. Pancreatic functions: The pancreas is an essential organ in the regulation of blood sugar levels and the digestion process. It is responsible for producing hormones such as insulin and glucagon, which are crucial in maintaining blood sugar balance. Insulin lowers blood sugar levels when they are too high, while glucagon raises them when they are too low. Additionally, the pancreas produces digestive enzymes that are secreted into the small intestine to break down fats, proteins, and carbohydrates. These enzymes are released by the exocrine pancreas cells, which make up more than 99% of the pancreas. 2. Melting of a rock: In a separate context, the question refers to a rock that reaches its melting point, causing it to transform from a solid to a liquid state. This process typically occurs due to high temperatures and pressures that can be found deep within the Earth's mantle or under volcanic conditions. 3. Connecting the topics: Now, we attempt to establish a connection between these two unrelated topics. The question introduces a \\"supposed perturbation\\" that would affect the pancreas by making it \\"work SOFTER\\" in response to the melting of a rock. However, given that the pancreas is an internal organ and functions independently of geological changes, the melting of a rock would have no direct impact on the pancreas. 4. Evaluation of the second effect mentioned: The second effect mentioned in the question is the release of glucagon into the bloodstream when blood sugar levels are too low. As previously stated, there is no direct connection between the melting of a rock and the functioning of the pancreas. Therefore, it can be concluded that the supposed perturbation resulting from the rock melting would have no effect on the pancreas' ability to regulate blood sugar levels through the release of glucagon. In summary, while the pancreas plays a critical role in regulating blood sugar levels and producing digestive enzymes, its functions are not directly affected by geological phenomena such as the melting of rocks. Consequently, the supposed perturbation resulting from a rock melting would have no effect on the pancreas' ability to maintain blood sugar balance and secrete digestive juices."},{"question":"Question: Bailey liked playing games against other people.

He was known nationally by the mid-1830s. Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? John Henry Newman was British.","response":"Yes, the next sentence does follow given the preceding text. John Henry Newman (21 February 1801 – 11 August 1890) was a religious figure from England in the 19th century, as mentioned in the text. Since England is a part of the United Kingdom, it is accurate to state that John Henry Newman was British. To provide more context and a detailed answer, John Henry Newman was born in London, England, which makes him a British national. Throughout his life, he made significant contributions to the religious landscape of England and the United Kingdom through his roles as an Anglican priest, poet, and theologian, and later as a Catholic cardinal. Newman was an influential figure in the Oxford Movement, which sought to revive the religious traditions and practices within the Church of England, inspired by the early Christian church and the High Church Anglican tradition. He played a key part in voicing the theological foundations for this movement. However, his journey to Catholicism, prompted by his interest in the Fathers of the Church and his growing discomfort with Anglicanism's theological inconsistencies, made Newman an increasingly controversial figure within English religious circles. In 1845, he converted to Roman Catholicism and was subsequently ordained as a Catholic priest. This conversion further fueled the controversy surrounding his beliefs, as the Anglican Church and Roman Catholic Church had a history of strained relations in England. Despite the controversy, Newman continued to work as a theologian, philosopher, and writer, contributing to the intellectual life of the Roman Catholic Church. In recognition of his contributions to theology, Pope Leo XIII elevated him to the rank of cardinal in 1879. Newman's works on theology and religious thought, particularly concerning the development of Christian doctrines, the nature of religious belief, and the relationship between faith and reason, had a lasting influence on both Anglican and Catholic traditions. In 2019, Newman was canonized as a saint by Pope Francis, further cementing his legacy as an important figure in British religious history."},{"question":"What would be an example of an positive review?","response":"Title: A Heavenly Stay at the Tranquil Gardens Hotel --- Last month, I had the incredible opportunity to stay at the Tranquil Gardens Hotel, and I cannot emphasize enough just how amazing the overall experience was.

In the fictional town of It Had To Be, Indiana, fullback Blue Grange scores the winning touchdown for It Had To Be University in the 1963 National Championship game. Afterwards, a shunned cheerleader named Bambi is seen fawning over Grange's locker before the on-field celebration pours into the locker room. As a group of cheerleaders are cleaning up the field after the game, all five are skewered with a javelin thrown by an unknown assailant. The bizarre murder makes headlines, as does a subsequent murder involving exploding pompons. As a result, the college's summer cheerleading camp is closed down. In 1982, the camp reopens with Bambi as the instructor. After arriving on campus, she meets Pepe the maintenance man and his mother Salt, both of whom warn her against reopening the camp as they believe it to be cursed with death, but Bambi is undeterred. At a bus station, a young woman named Candy (labeled Victim #1) prepares to board a bus to the cheerleading camp but her religious fanatic mother tries to dissuade her. As they quarrel, red beams of light suddenly streak from Candy's eyes and levitate her mother into the air. As she hangs suspended, Candy tells her that she just wants to be normal and marches away to catch the bus. In another part of town, a male cheerleader named Glenn Dandy (Victim #2) says goodbye to his unconventional family before leaving for camp. Next, Mandy (Victim #3) is introduced by her father in a beauty pageant-style interview, revealing her obsession with dental hygiene. Sandy (Victim #4) asks for directions to the camp at a food truck and decides to hitchhike, but insists on getting references from every driver she passes (eventually accepting a ride with then-U.S. President Ronald Reagan). Andy and Randy (Victims #5 and #6 respectively), two lecherous cheerleaders, are shown smoking marijuana while driving to the camp. The cheerleaders assemble at the camp and are greeted by Bambi.

Question: suppose more eggs are laid happens, how will it affect more baby birds will grow into adults. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer is:","response":"More The process outlined above describes the life cycle of a bird, which involves the bird laying eggs, the eggs hatching into baby birds, the baby birds eating and growing into adult birds, and then these adult birds finding mates and starting the process all over again. If more eggs are laid by the birds, this will directly impact the number of baby birds that will grow into adults. Laying more eggs will have a greater effect on the population because it increases the number of offspring that will grow into adults and potentially reproduce, thus adding more birds to the overall population. This increase in offspring can contribute to various impacts on the ecosystem and environment in which the birds reside. For example, a higher number of birds may lead to increased competition for resources such as food, water, and nesting sites among their own population and with other species as well. This can result in some birds not being able to find adequate amounts of food or an appropriate nesting site, which may potentially decrease the overall survival rate of the baby birds growing into adults. On the other hand, having more birds in the population can lead to a stronger presence against natural predators, as there will be more individuals available to defend against threats. This can also lead to a greater genetic diversity within the population, which may increase the adaptability and resilience of the species, making it more likely for them to survive and thrive in changing environments. The process of laying more eggs can also impact various ecological factors such as seed dispersal, pollination, and balance within food chains. For instance, if the bird species is a primary consumer and feeds on insects, an increased population could help to control insect populations, potentially having a beneficial impact on the ecosystem. Conversely, if their population becomes too high, it could ultimately lead to the decline of other species that the birds compete with or prey upon. In summary, laying more eggs will have a significant impact on the number of baby birds that will grow into adults. This effect can have a range of both positive and negative implications for the ecosystem and environment, based on the relationships between the bird species, their food sources, and their interactions with other organisms. Overall, the perturbation of laying more eggs can lead to a more significant effect on the number of baby birds growing into adults, influencing the bird population, their ecological roles, and the dynamics of the ecosystem in which they reside."},{"question":"Consider the question.

Club that he decided to write a children's story when he was trying to find a publisher for his first novel, The Basic Eight. One of the publishers, HarperCollins, passed on The Basic Eight, but they were interested in him writing a story for children. Handler thought it was a terrible idea at first, but met with the publishers to discuss the book. They challenged him to write the book he wished he could have read when he was 10. He retooled a manuscript he had for a mock-Gothic book for adults, which became \`\`the story of children growing through all these terrible things'', a concept which the publishers liked, to Handler's surprise. Is this statement correct \\"is a series of unfortunate events based on a real story\\"?","response":"The statement \\"is a series of unfortunate events based on a real story\\" is not correct. A Series of Unfortunate Events is a work of fiction written by Daniel Handler under the pseudonym Lemony Snicket. While the author might have drawn inspiration from various sources or experiences in his life, the story itself, which follows the lives of the Baudelaire siblings as they face numerous calamities and misfortunes, is not based on any real events or true stories. Handler did mention that he was challenged by HarperCollins to write the book he wished he could have read when he was 10 years old. He transformed a manuscript he had for a mock-Gothic book for adults into a story that explored children enduring various unfortunate events. Although the concept was appreciated by the publishers, the events portrayed in the series are fictional and imaginative. The series, consisting of 13 books, presents a unique blend of dark humor, irony, and Gothic elements. It has been widely praised for its distinctive narrative style, engrossing mysteries, and thought-provoking themes. Daniel Handler's use of the pseudonym Lemony Snicket as both the narrator and a character in the story further highlights the fictional nature of the series. Therefore, it is essential to remember that A Series of Unfortunate Events is a work of fiction and not based on a real story."},{"question":"Two neighboring towns had different methods of growing crops.

It passes as one of those cheesy horror movies you might waste time with in the middle of the night when you can't sleep, although admittedly it's no better quality than that. It's true that the acting isn't great - I thought Marianne McAndrew as Cathy Beck, for example, came across as completely passionless - but the main problem is that several aspects of the plot didn't really make sense to me. The Becks are on a trip described by John (Stewart Moss) as part work and partly the honeymoon they never had (now that's romantic!) The work part has something to do with touring caves, which in itself sounds strange (how does being part of a tour group through a cave relate to anyone's work?) but it gets stranger when we find out that he's a doctor doing research in the area of preventative medicine (huh? That connection completely lost me.) Bitten by a bat while he's in the cave, he begins to transform into what I guess was supposed to be a human-bat hybrid (although when we finally see him in makeup he looks a lot more like an ape-man of some sort) and a killing spree starts. Here's another problem. The first killing is a nurse in a hospital. At first, everyone thinks her death was an accident. The second murder is of a young girl, who is described as having her throat ripped out. The sheriff (Michael Pataki) then tells us that her death was similar to the nurse's (meaning throat ripped out? - How could anyone think that was an accident?) And what's with the sheriff? He seems pretty no-nonsense until the scene in Cathy's hotel room when he takes a swig of liquor and then almost rapes her, after which everything seems to go back to normal. It's saddled with an ending that left almost everything unresolved, and also with one of the most irritating theme songs I've ever heard in a movie.

Premise: Said Gauve. This premise states that Gauve said or communicated something. We do not have any information on what Gauve said or the context of the situation, but we know that Gauve was speaking or expressing something. It implies that Gauve wasn't silent at this particular moment. Hypothesis: Gauve was silent. This hypothesis contradicts the premise. It indicates that Gauve didn't say anything and was silent, which is the opposite of what the premise suggests. Now, let's evaluate the three choices provided: (I). Yes This option suggests that if the premise is true, the hypothesis is also true. However, as mentioned earlier, the premise and hypothesis contradict each other. By saying that the premise is true – meaning Gauve spoke – indicates Gauve isn't silent, thus making the hypothesis false. (II). It is not possible to tell This option implies that there is insufficient information available to determine if the hypothesis is true or false based on the premise. However, since the premise states that Gauve spoke and the hypothesis says Gauve was silent, we can determine that the two statements are opposing. (III). No This option states that if the premise is true, the hypothesis is not necessarily true. Since the premise presents a situation where Gauve is speaking, it contradicts the hypothesis suggesting Gauve is silent. Based on the analysis of the premise and the hypothesis, we can conclude that the correct answer is (III). No, it is not possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. The two statements contradict each other, making it impossible for both to be true at the same time."},{"question":"Pick your answer from: *yes. *no.

Attempt the reverse cradle hold. Experiment with the Clutch Hold. Try the side-lying position. Try the laid back position.","response":"Title: Experimenting with Breastfeeding Positions: A Guide for New Mothers Introduction Breastfeeding is a natural and beautiful way for mothers to bond with their babies, while providing essential nutrition for the little one's growth and development. Finding the perfect breastfeeding position can make a world of difference in comfort and success during nursing. The following guide explores different breastfeeding positions that new mothers can experiment with to find the best fit for their needs. The positions discussed include the cradle position, reverse cradle hold, clutch hold, side-lying position, and laid-back position. Cradle Position The cradle position is the most common breastfeeding position for new mothers. To try this position, follow these steps: 1. Sit comfortably with your back supported and your feet flat on the ground. 2. Place a pillow on your lap to support your baby's weight. 3. Hold your baby in your arms, with their head resting in the crook of your elbow and their body facing towards you. 4. Bring your baby close to your breast, ensuring their mouth is level with your nipple. Use your free hand to support your breast if needed. 5. Wait for your baby to latch on and begin feeding. Reverse Cradle Hold The reverse cradle hold is a variation of the cradle position that can provide added support, especially for newborns. To try the reverse cradle hold: 1. Follow steps 1 to 3 of the cradle position, but place your baby's head in the opposite arm than used in the standard cradle position (i.e., if you cradle with your left arm, use your right). 2. Use your free hand to guide your breast and help your baby latch onto your nipple. 3. Like in the cradle position, wait for your baby to latch on and begin feeding. Clutch Hold Also known as the football hold, the clutch hold is ideal for mothers who have large breasts or have had a cesarean section. To try the clutch hold: 1. Sit in a comfortable chair with your back supported and place a pillow on your side to support your baby's weight. 2. Hold your baby on the side with their head facing your nipple, and their body tucked under your arm. 3. Support your baby's head with your hand, and use your forearm to support their body. 4. Guide your baby's mouth towards your nipple, ensuring proper latch. 5. Wait for your baby to latch on and begin breastfeeding. Side-Lying Position The side-lying position is great for nighttime feedings or if you need to rest while breastfeeding. To try the side-lying position: 1. Lie on your side, with your baby facing you. 2. Place a pillow behind your back for support, and use your bottom arm to support your head. 3. Position your baby so their mouth is level with your nipple. 4. Use your free hand to support your breast if needed. 5. Guide your baby's mouth to your nipple and wait for them to latch on and start feeding. Laid-back Position The laid-back position, also known as 'biological nurturing,' involves leaning back in a semi-reclined position. This allows gravity to help guide your baby to your breast, making it easier for them to latch on. To try the laid-back position: 1. Lean back in a reclining chair or use pillows on a bed or couch to provide back support. 2. Place your baby on your chest, facing downward. 3. Let your baby naturally guide themselves towards your breast and find your nipple. 4. Support your baby's head and body as needed, allowing them to latch on and start breastfeeding. Conclusion Trying different breastfeeding positions can help new mothers find the most comfortable and effective way to nurse their babies. The cradle position, reverse cradle hold, clutch hold, side-lying position, and laid-back position offer various support options for both the mother and baby. By experimenting with these positions, you can give yourself and your baby the best possible start on your breastfeeding journey."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: Given reviews from Amazon, classify those review based on their content into two classes: Negative or Positive.

The Grand Ole Opry is a weekly country-music stage concert in Nashville, Tennessee, which was founded on November 28, 1925, by George D. Hay as a one-hour radio \\"barn dance\\" on WSM. Currently owned and operated by Opry Entertainment (a division of Ryman Hospitality Properties, Inc.), it is the longest-running radio broadcast in US history. Dedicated to honoring country music and its history, the Opry showcases a mix of famous singers and contemporary chart-toppers performing country, bluegrass, Americana, folk, gospel, and comedic performances and skits. It attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors from around the world and millions of radio and Internet listeners. Following the departure of the Opry, Ryman Auditorium sat mostly vacant and decaying for twenty years. An initial effort by National Life & Accident to tear down the Ryman and use its bricks to build a chapel at Opryland USA was met with resounding resistance from the public, including the influential musicians of the time. The plans were abandoned, and the building remained standing with an uncertain future. Despite the absence of performances, the building still held such significance as an attraction that it would remain open for tours. In 1991 and 1992, Emmylou Harris performed a series of concerts there and released some of the recordings as an album entitled At the Ryman. The concert and album's high acclaim renewed interest in reviving Ryman Auditorium as an active venue. Beginning in September 1993, Gaylord Entertainment undertook a full renovation of the Ryman, restoring it into a world-class concert hall that reopened with a broadcast of A Prairie Home Companion on June 4, 1994. On Sunday, October 18, 1998, the Opry held a benefit show at Ryman Auditorium, marking its return to the venue for the first time since its final show on March 15, 1974. The show was well received by fans, performers, and management alike, and so the decision was made to host the Opry's regular shows there on January 15 & 16, 1999 as part of the celebration to commemorate 25 years at the new venue. Beginning in November 1999, the Opry was held at Ryman Auditorium for three months, partly due to the ongoing construction of Opry Mills. The Opry has returned to the Ryman for the three winter months every year since, allowing the show to acknowledge its roots while also taking advantage of a smaller venue during an off-peak season for tourism. While still officially the Grand Ole Opry, the shows there are billed as Opry At The Ryman. From 2002 to 2014, a traveling version of the Radio City Christmas Spectacular took up residence at the Grand Ole Opry House each holiday season while the Opry was away.

Here's an English translation of the sentence: \\"We hope that this will not become a precedent for future reforms.\\" Finnish is one of the two official languages of Finland, the other being Swedish. It is a member of the Finnic group of languages, which also includes Estonian, Karelian, and several other languages spoken in the Baltic and Scandinavian regions. Finnish is known to be quite different from most European languages in terms of grammar and vocabulary, and it's known for its vowel harmony and agglutination, meaning that words tend to be assembled from smaller morphemes and affixes. In Finland, education in Finnish is mandatory, ensuring that the majority of the population is competent in the language. In addition, there is a thriving Finnish-speaking community in Sweden, and a significant number of speakers can also be found in countries such as Norway, Russia, and Estonia. Finnish literature has a long history dating back to the 16th century, with the most significant milestone being the publication of the Finnish translation of the Bible in 1642. This work, known as the \\"Biblia,\\" was translated by Mikael Agricola, and it played a significant role in shaping the modern Finnish language. Additionally, Finnish culture has produced numerous prominent writers, poets, and playwrights who contributed to the richness and versatility of the language. Learning Finnish can be challenging for non-native speakers due to its unique grammar rules and structure.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Lukather is the original lead guitarist for Toto, serving in that capacity for the band's entire history, as well as a lead and backing vocalist and composer. Lukather won three of his five Grammy Awards for work with Toto, twice as an artist and once as a producer. David Paich led the band's songwriting efforts during the development of 1978's Toto—he penned all but two of the album's tracks, including all four of its singles. Lukather also credits Jeff Porcaro for his leadership within the band during that period. However, Lukather's role in Toto evolved over time owing to the changing needs of the band. In August 1992, Jeff Porcaro collapsed while doing yard work at home and subsequently died of heart failure. The death profoundly affected Toto and Lukather in particular, who felt that he needed to step up and make sure the band kept going. Thus, he began taking more of a leadership role. Toto went through several lead vocalists over the years, including Bobby Kimball, Fergie Frederiksen, and Joseph Williams. After the 1990 dismissal of their fourth vocalist, Jean-Michel Byron, Toto was without a lead singer until around 1997; Lukather assumed most of the vocal duties for the band during that time. He performed lead vocals for every track on 1992's Kingdom of Desire and 1995's Tambu except for two instrumental tracks. The Tambu single \\"I Will Remember\\", co-written by Lukather and Stan Lynch, reached number 64 on UK charts. Some Tambu reviewers contrasted Lukather's vocals with those of former singers Kimball and Williams (and indeed, heavily criticized the entire album), some concert reviewers noted that he struggled vocally on certain songs, and a number of backup singers and guest vocalists accompanied the band's live shows during that period. It was not until Toto brought back Williams and Kimball to collaborate on 1998's Toto XX that Lukather returned predominantly to the role of backup vocalist.Lukather's songwriting contributions grew from a smattering of tracks on early Toto albums to co-writing... Answer:","response":"The original lead guitarist for Toto, Steve Lukather, performed lead vocals on the following albums: 1. Kingdom of Desire (1992): Lukather performed lead vocals on every track of this album, which was released after the death of Jeff Porcaro in August 1992. 2. Tambu (1995): Lukather also performed lead vocals on this album, except for two instrumental tracks. The Tambu single \\"I Will Remember,\\" co-written by Lukather and Stan Lynch, reached number 64 on the UK charts. During this period, Toto was without a lead singer, and Lukather took on the responsibility of being the primary vocalist for the band until the return of Joseph Williams and Bobby Kimball for the 1998 album Toto XX."},{"question":"It was a dream, then a place, then a memory. My father built it near the Suwannee River. I like to think it was in the heart of Florida, because it was, and is, in my heart. Its name was Dogland. Some people say you can know others if you know the central incidents that shaped their lives. But an incident is an island in time, and to know the effect of the island on those who land there, you must know something about the river they have traveled. And I must warn you before we begin, I don't know that river well. I visit that time and place like a ghost with poor vision and little memory. I look up the river and see fog rolling in. I look down the river, and the brightness of the approaching day blinds me. I see shapes moving behind me and beyond me, but who they are and what they do, I cannot say. I will tell what I know is true, and I will invent what I believe is true, and that, I think, is all you can ask any storyteller to do. I learned the Nix family history from the stories Pa told. Even at the age of four, I suspected that Pa's stories might not be perfectly true. When Pa said we Nixes came to North America as indentured servants working our way out of debtor's prison, Grandma Bette would make a face and say he couldn't know that. When he said we Nixes had Lakota and Ojibwe blood in our veins, Grandma Bette would say she wasn't prejudiced, but it simply wasn't so: she and Pa and his brothers and sisters were dark because her people were Black Dutch, from a part of Holland where everyone had black hair and black eyes.

Start from the beginning of the sentence. 2. Whenever a recognizable word ends and another word starts, insert a space. So based on the steps, I parsed the sentence into: \\"The international jury´s decision to award BIG´s entry first place in the competition was unanimous and was presided by the vice mayor Taavi Aas.\\" Thus, by using my understanding of English words and sentence structure I am able to successfully add spaces to the provided text and form a coherently readable sentence from it."},{"question":"2.

The statement \\"While parachuting, a man is surfing waves\\" is somewhat ambiguous, and it does not clearly convey whether the man is surfing the waves with a parachute or not.

However, it is uncertain whether these activities are directly connected or simply happening at the same time. It could be interpreted as the man surfing waves while a parachute is still attached to him or that the man is surfing after having just parachuted into the water, but these assumptions can't be confirmed without further information.

Halévy about completing his old tutor's unfinished opera Noé. Although no action was taken at that time, Bizet remained on friendly terms with the Halévy family. Fromental had left two daughters; the elder, Esther, died in 1864, an event which so traumatised Mme. Halévy that she could not tolerate the company of her younger daughter Geneviève, who from the age of 15 lived with other family members. It is unclear when Geneviève and Bizet became emotionally attached, but in October 1867, he informed Galabert: \\"I have met an adorable girl whom I love! In two years she will be my wife!\\" The pair became engaged, although the Halévy family initially disallowed the match. According to Bizet they considered him an unsuitable catch: \\"penniless, left-wing, anti-religious and Bohemian\\", which Dean observes are odd grounds of objection from \\"a family bristling with artists and eccentrics\\". By summer 1869, their objections had been overcome, and the wedding took place on 3 June 1869. Ludovic Halévy wrote in his journal: \\"Bizet has spirit and talent. He should succeed\\".As a belated homage to his late father-in-law, Bizet took up the Noé manuscript and completed it. Parts of his moribund Vasco da Gama and Ivan IV were incorporated into the score, but a projected production at the Théâtre Lyrique failed to materialise when Carvalho's company finally went bankrupt, and Noé remained unperformed until 1885. Bizet's marriage was initially happy, but was affected by Geneviève's nervous instability (inherited from both her parents), her difficult relations with her mother and by Mme. Halévy's interference in the couple's affairs. Despite this, Bizet kept on good terms with his mother-in-law and maintained an extensive correspondence with her. In the year following the marriage, he considered plans for at least half a dozen new operas and began to sketch the music for two of them: Clarissa Harlowe based on Samuel Richardson's novel... contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the person that told Galabert \\"In two years she will be my wife!\\", what is it ?

Answer: Options are: I. No II. Yes A:","response":"I. No The product review appears to be negative, rather than positive. The title of the review itself states \\"Disapointed,\\" which already provides a clue that the customer is not satisfied with the product. Moreover, the body of the review mentions that the unit does not work with most car racing games, particularly the Need for Speed series, which the reviewer's son loves. This compatibility issue signifies that the product did not meet the customer's expectations and left them unhappy with its performance. A product that does not perform well or fulfill the primary purpose for which it was purchased generally tends to generate negative feedback, as customers tend to expect seamless integration with a range of games, especially popular ones such as the Need for Speed series. Additionally, the review mentions that the setup of the product is \\"awkward and not user friendly.\\" User experience is a critical aspect of customer satisfaction, as a product that is difficult to use or set up can create frustration, disappointment and hinder the enjoyment of its features. This comment serves as another strong indicator of the reviewer's dissatisfaction with the product and contributes to the overall negative sentiment of the review. In conclusion, based on the issues related to compatibility, setup, and user experience, coupled with the dissatisfaction expressed in both the title and the body of the review, it is more than safe to assert that the product review is negative."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

Despite increased security for the flight, Kim arranges for a time-release crate full of venomous snakes to be placed in the cargo hold in an attempt to bring down the plane before it reaches Los Angeles International Airport (LAX). To ensure the snakes attack the passengers without being provoked, he has one of his henchmen disguised as an airport ground employee spray the passengers' leis with a special pheromone which makes the snakes highly aggressive. The crate opens midway through the flight and the snakes make their way through the cabin. A couple having sex in the bathroom, and a man using the bathroom are the first killed. The plane's captain, Sam McKeon, investigates and fixes an electrical short, but is killed by the viper that caused it. Co-pilot Rick, unaware of the snake, believes Sam has suffered a heart attack and continues toward LAX. Some of the snakes attack Rick, and while fending them off he accidentally releases the oxygen masks throughout the plane, causing several snakes to drop into the cabin with them. Numerous passengers, including Agent Sanders, are killed when the snakes invade the cabin. The surviving passengers, who have made their way to the front of the plane, put up blockades of luggage in a desperate attempt to stop the snakes.

And again with their settlement with the FCC back in 2011 (that they likely violated with their recent offenses) over deceiving consumers by telling them their information was private, but then repeatedly sharing it and making it public.

His parents had passed away when he was very young, and the kung fu school was the only home he had ever known. The boy, who was named Li, showed incredible talent and determination in mastering the martial art. He dreamed of one day becoming a famous kung fu master and bringing honor and fortune to the school that had raised him. One day, while practicing his forms in the courtyard, Li caught the attention of Wang, a wealthy and influential businessman in the village. Wang was impressed by Li's focus and skill, and he invited the young orphan to join him for dinner at his home. Li graciously accepted the invitation, and the seeds of a lasting friendship were sown. Over a splendid feast, Li discovered that Wang's daughter, Li's childhood friend, worked at a five-star French restaurant in the big city. She had honed her culinary skills and worked her way up to become the head chef. Wang was visibly proud of his daughter's achievements, and Li couldn't help but feel inspired by her success too. As they continued to bond during the meal, Wang expressed his love for the game of basketball. He told Li about a local basketball team he was sponsoring – First University. The team was good, but they were missing something – a new star player that would tip them into greatness. Wang Li saw something special in Li and, knowing the boy's extraordinary physical abilities, invited him to play basketball for First University as the new star of their team. Li felt honored and excited by the opportunity. Even though he had never played basketball before, Li accepted Wang's offer, ready for a new challenge in his life. In no time, Li's natural aptitude for sports paired with his kung fu skills helped him adapt rapidly to basketball. He soon rose to prominence as an exciting and unique player, capturing the imagination of fans both within and outside the First University. As the city's annual basketball championship approached, Li's team was well-aware of the hurdles they were about to face. Rumors swirled regarding the opposing team, known for their ruthless and dirty tactics to prevent First University from winning, up to and including injuring their star players, Shi-jie Ting Wei and Xiao Lan. Li's teammates were concerned and fearful, but Li stood steadfast, adamant about finding a way to overcome these challenges. Li decided to combine his kung fu skills with basketball techniques, creating a unique and unstoppable form of play. His teammates followed suit, training diligently under his guidance. This new fusion of martial arts and basketball seemed almost invincible, and Li knew they could triumph in the championship game as long as they played together and stayed focused. The day of the final match arrived, and the atmosphere at the stadium was electric. Wang Li, his daughter, the entire village, and the kung fu school had come to cheer for Li and the First University team. The opposing team tried their underhanded tactics to bring down Shi-jie Ting Wei and Xiao Lan, but Li and his teammates stood strong, fighting back with their newfound skills. In the end, Li's unwavering determination and innovative play inspired his team to victory, overcoming adversity and claiming the championship for First University. The crowd erupted in cheers and applause, and Wang Li couldn't be prouder of his protégé. From that day on, Li was hailed as a hero in his village and the basketball community. He had proven that the power of determination, skill, and teamwork could overcome even the greatest challenges. And although Li's heart always yearned for the kung fu school that was his first home, he knew that he had found his place in the world on the basketball court as a shining example to others of what was possible when one's passion is fueled by resilience and perseverance."},{"question":"Write a title: Phoenix -- Baseball #39;s union leaders, facing calls from some of its members to crack down on steroids, will discuss changing its drug-testing policy today after reports of Barry Bonds #39; and Jason Giambi #39;s explosive grand jury testimony in the BALCO case.

The independent association between adipocytokines and body mass index (BMI), measures of inflammation (C-reactive protein [CRP], interleukin-6 [IL-6], and tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNFalpha]), and radiographic joint damage (Larsen score; n = 93 patients) was examined in RA patients by multivariable regression analysis first controlling for age, race, and sex, and then for obesity (BMI) and inflammation (TNFalpha, IL-6, and CRP).', 'Concentrations of all adipocytokines were significantly higher in RA patients than in controls; for visfatin and adiponectin, this association remained significant after adjusting for BMI, inflammation, or both. Visfatin concentrations were associated with higher Larsen scores, and this association remained significant after adjustment for age, race, sex, disease duration, BMI, and inflammation (odds ratio [OR] 2.38 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.32-4.29], P = 0.004). Leptin concentrations showed a positive association with the BMI (rho = 0.58, P < 0.01) and showed a negative association with the Larsen score after adjustment for inflammation (OR 0.32 [95% CI 0.17-0.61], P < 0.001), but not after adjustment for BMI (OR 0.86 [95% CI 0.42-1.73], P = 0.67).Question: Are adipocytokines associated with radiographic joint damage in rheumatoid arthritis? Output:","response":"Yes, adipocytokines are associated with radiographic joint damage in rheumatoid arthritis. In the study, visfatin concentrations were found to be associated with higher Larsen scores, indicating joint damage, even after adjustments for age, race, sex, disease duration, BMI, and inflammation."},{"question":"Article: A Fresno man rescued after getting stuck on top of Morro Rock is now under arrest.Investigators said 27-year-old Michael Banks climbed to the top to propose to his girlfriend but then got stuck on the way down.

(Photos courtesy Morro Bay Fire Department) Emergency crews were called to Morro Rock Thursday morning after a man became stuck while illegally climbing it. Morro Bay Fire Chief Steve Knuckles says a witness heard the man yelling for help at about 8:45 a.m. and called rescue crews. The man was reportedly stranded on a very small piece of rock about three-quarters of the way down. A California Highway Patrol helicopter was used to lower a firefighter to the man and rescue him. That man has been identified as Michael Banks of Fresno. The firefighter who rescued him says Banks told him he climbed the rock in order to propose to his girlfriend over FaceTime. She reportedly said yes, but was upset by the stunt. Banks was not hurt, but he does face a fine for climbing Morro Rock, which is illegal. \\"It is illegal to climb Morro Rock because it kills people,\\" said Chief Knuckles. \\"I have been on at least four calls where people have died on the rock. Since this time last year, we have had four incidents where we have had to use rope to get people off the rock.\\" Chief Knuckles says Banks will also have to pay for the cost of the rescue, which will likely cost a few thousand dollars.

Banks, 27, scaled 600-foot Morro Rock just off California's Central Coast early Thursday morning to propose to his girlfriend, who was watching via FaceTime video. The good news: Banks' girlfriend said yes, according to Morro Bay fire Capt. Todd Gailey. The bad news: Banks got stuck, and had to be plucked by helicopter for a tricky, post-proposal flight to safety. Banks \\"took a different trail down, much steeper\\" and became stranded, Gailey said. \\"He couldn't go any direction, on a sheer ledge, with his feet dangling 80 feet off the ground.\\" Rescuers called in a helicopter, and Gailey descended by cable to hoist Banks from the narrow ledge, with the rotors spinning near the cliff and ocean spray battering both men. Banks was calm for most of the ordeal, but \\"a little unnerved\\" at that part, Gailey said. Morro Rock is a landmark located just offshore from the community of Morro Bay. Climbing is banned but some go anyway and there have been several fatal falls over the years. Typically when someone needs to be rescued they are ticketed, Gailey said. It was not immediately clear if Banks, who was unharmed, was cited. Banks said nothing during the rescue about any second thoughts on his choice of setting for the proposal, Gailey said. However, the fire captain said others should consider a place \\"where you're not in danger of falling off a cliff.\\" ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

Some have already refused to support him, while others are doing so with varying levels of excitement. Here are four ways lawmakers have approached the question and some notable lawmakers in each camp: Senator and former presidential candidate Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.) has been one of the most outspoken critics of Trump in the Senate. Another, freshman Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska, has called for a third-party candidate to mount a challenge and presumably whittle away at Trumpâs support. A common thread among the group: not being on the ballot in November. âHe has not displayed a respect for the Constitution. And, he is not a consistent conservative.â (Link) âI vehemently oppose our nomineeâ (Link) âThere are literally dumpster fires in my town tonight more popular than either Trump or Clinton.â (Link) [Trump Civil War: Republican brothers John McCain and Lindsey Graham on different sides of battle] While Ryan seemed to warm to Trump after a meeting on Capitol Hill on May 12, he has withheld his endorsement of the billionaire, whose policy solutions differ from his own on many fronts.

But after it became clear that Trump would win, McConnell and several other leaders fell in line and expressed support, if less than enthusiastically, for him in the name of uniting the party to win down-ballot races. In a sign of support coalescing behind Trump, nine of 20 House committee chairmen endorsed Trump in a joint statement on May 13. âRepublicans are committed to preventing what would be a third term of Barack Obama.â (Link) â[Campaign press release]: Kelly plans to support the nominee.

Step 2: Identify the top and bottom of the pit - Look closely at the shape of the pit. The slightly pointier end is the top, and the flatter end is the bottom. - The top is the part of the pit that will sprout, while roots will grow from the bottom. Step 3: Insert toothpicks - Take 3-4 toothpicks and insert them evenly around the avocado pit's circumference, approximately halfway down its length. The toothpicks will provide support and prevent the pit from fully submerging in water. - Position the toothpicks so that they are sticking out at a slightly upward angle. Step 4: Suspend the pit over a glass or jar - Place the avocado pit with the toothpicks over a glass or jar, ensuring the bottom part of the pit is submerged in water. - Make sure the glass or jar is transparent so you can monitor the water level and root growth. Step 5: Provide optimal conditions - Choose a spot for the glass or jar where it will receive plenty of indirect sunlight and remain at room temperature. - Check the water level daily to ensure the bottom of the pit is submerged. Replenish or change the water as needed to maintain cleanliness and avoid odors or mold. Step 6: Wait for the pit to sprout - It can take several weeks to a few months for the avocado pit to sprout. During this time, keep monitoring the water level and maintain clean water. - Once the pit splits and a small sprout emerges from the top, and roots begin to grow downward, the pit is ready for planting. Step 7: Plant the avocado pit - Prepare a pot with well-draining soil. The pot should have a drainage hole to prevent excess water buildup. - Carefully transplant the sprouted avocado pit into the pot, with the roots extending downward into the soil. - Bury the pit in the soil, leaving half or slightly less than half of the pit exposed. - Water the soil thoroughly, ensuring it is evenly moist, and place the pot in a location with bright, indirect sunlight. Step 8: Care for the avocado plant - Water the plant regularly, allowing the top inch of soil to dry out between watering sessions. Avoid overwatering, as this can lead to root rot. - Monitor the growth of the plant and consider adding a support stake if needed. - As the plant grows, you can gradually introduce it to more sunlight and eventually repot it into a larger container if necessary. By following these steps, you will have successfully prepared and planted an avocado pit. Remember to be patient, care for your plant, and enjoy watching it grow!"},{"question":"Summarize this article: This is kind of awesome. Eleven-year-old Rowan Hansen wrote to DC Comics asking why there weren't more female superheroes, and why the female heroes don't wear more practical costumes. They responded with a drawing of Hansen as a superhero. Her response: Thanks, but that's not what I asked for. Hansen, who appeared on the Today Show this morning (see below), is incredibly eloquent and gets to the heart of the problems with female characters in superhero comics. Some choice quotes: \\"It's not like the male superheroes are better than the female superheroes, but there are just more of them.\\" \\"If Batman gets to wear armor, then why doesn't Wonder Woman get to wear armor? I know that she's kind of invulnerable, but it would still be nicer if she didn't have to wear a bathing suit all the time.\\" \\"If you're fighting crime, then I don't understand how you're going to camouflage yourself if you're wearing a bright pink suit. That's not very practical.\\" She wrote to DC Comics about this, which tweeted at her, \\"Thanks, Rowan. We agree, we're working hard to create more superhero fun for girls!\\" And today, she was on the Today Show, where DC presented her with a gift basket full of stuff, including a cute framed picture (see above) showing Hansen as a superhero. Which is a sweet gesture, but doesn't actually add to the roster of characters in the comics (unless DC is going to license Hansen's image.) Advertisement So Hansen's response is perfect: \\"I don't want people to think, 'Oh yeah, they responded to her. Now it's over.' I want people to keep trying to make this happen. Because it's very important to me.\\" [via Comic Book Resources, h/t Joe] ||||| On the show Girl, 11, demands more female superheroes: See how DC Comics responded Feb. 20, 2015 at 8:21 AM ET Rowan Hansen’s superpowers don’t include bending steel or flying with a cape, but that hasn’t stopped the 11-year-old girl from saving the day with her call for more female superheroes. Last month, the Champaign, Illinois, fifth-grader addressed a letter to DC Comics — whose characters include Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman — to express her frustrations. “I love your comics,\\" she wrote, \\"but I would love them a lot more if there were more girls.\\" In Rowan’s quest for truth, justice and the American way, her letter became more than a conversation; it became a movement that DC Comics couldn't ignore. Courtesy of Rowan Hansen “I have never really understood why they've had more male superheroes,” Rowan told TODAY. “It's not like the male superheroes are better than the female superheroes. But there are just more of them.” She was reminded of this when she received a birthday gift of Justice League figures, whose set of 12 only includes two female characters. In addition to requesting action figures of Hawkgirl, Catwoman and other female DC characters, she asked for better efforts when it comes to green-lighting projects on television and the silver screen. \\"There are Superman and Batman movies, but not a Wonder Woman one,\\" she wrote. \\"You have a Flash TV show but not a Wonder Woman one. Marvel comics made a movie about a talking tree and raccoon awesome, but you haven't made a movie with Wonder Woman.\\" Although Wonder Woman is expected to appear in next year's \\"Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice,\\" no finalized plans for a movie of her own have been announced. In closing, Rowan's letter called for greater action across the board. \\"Please do something about this,\\" she wrote. \\"Girls read comics, too, and they care.\\" Courtesy of the Hansen family She also questioned the practicality of women superheroes’ costumes. “If Batman gets to wear armor, then why doesn't Wonder Woman get to wear armor?” she said. “And I know that she's kind of invulnerable, but it would still be nicer if she didn't wear a bathing suit all the time.” Her parents, Jim Hansen and Renée Trilling, who are English professors at the University of Illinois, said Rowan has been aware of gender inequity for years. Courtesy of the Hansen family “You go to the store and they don't have a Hawk Girl T-shirt, [but] they have Superman everywhere and Batman everywhere,” Renée said. “I don't think it diminished her enjoyment of the stories or the characters at all. But it made her feel like she couldn't quite participate in the way that she wanted to.” Jim added that Rowan's curiosity piqued his own. “[She'd ask], ‘Why does Wonder Woman always have to be caught by Superman? Why doesn't Wonder Woman ever catch Superman?’\\" Jim said. \\"I was like, 'These are good questions.'\\" Once Jim posted Rowan's letter online, it went viral faster than a speeding bullet. It even penetrated the walls of DC Comics, whose staff responded Jan. 30 on Twitter to show solidarity. Rowan was thrilled by the tweets, but hasn’t lost focus on the greater goal. “I was just, like, ‘Oh, my God, I can't believe this,’” she said with a laugh. \\"It was really, really cool, ’cause they're so big and important people. But I thought 'I don't want people to think, \\"Oh, yeah, okay, they responded to her. Now it's over.’ I want people to keep trying to make this happen, ’cause it's really important to me.” For now, DC appears to be putting their words into action. Through TODAY, DC presented her with a sketch of a new superhero: Rowan, herself. DC Comics Her parents were moved by the gesture. When Jim suggested it be placed above a mantle, Rowan agreed. “It needs to have, like, a place of honor,” she said, laughing. And DC may have an ally in Rowan if it decides to green-light that Wonder Woman movie. When TODAY asked Rowan if she’d be interested in writing the screenplay, she said she’d consider it — once she finishes fifth grade.

Sample A is a straight-chain molecule; sample B is a branched-chain molecule; and sample C is a cyclic molecule. Mark's job is to determine the characteristics of each sample. Which sample would have higher boiling point, sample A or sample C? A:","response":"Sample A would likely have a higher boiling point than sample C. Sample A is a straight-chain molecule, which means it consists of a linear arrangement of atoms. This type of molecule typically exhibits stronger intermolecular forces, like van der Waals forces, due to the larger contact surface between adjacent molecules. The increase in these intermolecular forces makes it more difficult for molecules to move apart from each other, thus requiring more energy and, consequently, a higher boiling point. Sample C is a cyclic molecule, which means it has a ring-like structure formed by the arrangement of atoms. This structure usually results in weaker intermolecular forces between adjacent molecules when compared to straight-chain molecules. This is because the ring structure can create steric hindrance, leading to a smaller contact surface between the cyclic molecules and hence weaker van der Waals forces. As a result, the cyclic molecules require less energy to overcome these forces, leading to a lower boiling point compared to the straight-chain molecule (Sample A). However, it's important to note that other factors, such as hydrogen bonding and polarizability, can also influence boiling points. To conclusively determine the boiling point of each sample, Mark would need to consider these other factors and perform appropriate experiments or calculations."},{"question":"Build a movie plot around this: Who is Julien?

The iconic singer told his loved ones he wanted to “go without any fuss” and not have a funeral service or public memorial. A source in New York told the Mirror: “There is no public or private service or a public memorial. There is nothing.” Since the singer's death on Sunday music lovers have been speculating about what plans the legendary showman had for his funeral. But unbeknown to his millions of fans around the world, his body was quietly cremated shortly after he died. (Image: XPOSUREPHOTOS.COM) As the star bravely battled liver cancer over the last 18 months, he made his plans clear to his family, including wife Iman, 60, for what he wanted to happen when the time came. The Starman singer said he only wanted to be remembered for the good times they shared and the music he made.

And he wanted to do it his way and he wanted to do it the best way,” he said. “His death was no different from his life - a work of art. He made Blackstar for us, his parting gift.” (Image: Vantagenews.com) The singer may have had what is known as a “direct cremation”, described on the New York State’s health department website as “the disposition of human remains by cremation without a formal viewing, visitation, or ceremony\\". It is also variously described as one of the more affordable ways to dispose of someone who has passed away, costing between 700 to 900. The deceased is generally collected from the place of death and transferred to the crematory. Once the required paperwork is done, they are then cremated. (Image: Daily Mirror) The remains are then generally returned to the family unless otherwise specified. While Bowie has asked there not to be a public memorial to him, there are plans in place elsewhere, however, to honour his contribution to music. There will be a tribute next month at the Brit Awards with the chairman Max Lousada saying: “Naturally, we wish to honour his extraordinary life and work at the forthcoming Brit awards and pay a fitting tribute to one of our greatest icons.” (Image: Getty) Bowie will also be honoured with a memorial concert at New York’s Carnegie Hall on March 31. The concert to celebrate Bowie’s musical legacy was announced hours before his death and tickets sold out within hours.

At the end of the song she fell to the floor. Later, the Queen of Pop tweeted: “Paying Tribute to My Favorite Rebel heart!” Canadian indie rock band Arcade Fire , who collaborated closely with Bowie, also said in a statement: “David Bowie was one of the band’s earliest supporters and champions. \\"He not only created the world that made it possible for our band to exist, he welcomed us into it with grace and warmth. “We will take to the grave the moments we shared - talking, playing music and collaborating - as some of the most profound and memorable moments of our lives.” Sir Elton John praised Bowie for dealing with his cancer battle with dignity. He said: “What I loved about him towards the end was his incredible privacy during what must have been 10 years of incredible bad luck with illnesses, heart attacks, cancer, whatever. \\"He kept it private in an age we’re living in with Twitter when everyone knows everything about everything - he kept it to himself. (Image: Getty) \\"He made two albums without anybody knowing he was making them. He had treatment for his illnesses without anyone knowing or anyone saying anything. \\"And that is the mystique of the man, because we know David Bowie the figure, the singer, the outrageous performer, but actually, we don’t know anything about him - and that’s the way it should be in music and should be in any art form whatsoever.” Meanwhile, one of Bowie’s closest aides told how it was almost as if the singer knew he was going to die two days after his birthday. (Image: Andrew H. Walker/Getty Images for DKMS) Ivo van Hove, the director of Bowie’s musical Lazarus, believes that the late singer’s album drops clues about the his death. In one song The Girl Loves Me, Bowie sings “where the f*** did Monday go?” Bowie died on a Sunday. Hove says: “I’m not sure if he planned his death, but it seems a bit too coincidental. “He certainly planned for Blackstar to be released when it did – his birthday. “It’s too coincidental. On the song The Girl Loves Me he asks ‘where the f*** did Monday go?’ “I’ve got no evidence but I think he did. \\"It was like Mozart writing his requiem or the famous Dennis Potter who kept writing scripts on his deathbed.” ||||| About a week before his death, with Blackstar nearing release, David Bowie called his longtime friend and producer Tony Visconti via FaceTime, and told him he wanted to make one more album. In what turned out to have been the final weeks of his life, Bowie wrote and demo-ed five fresh songs, and was anxious to return to the studio one last time. Bowie had known since November that his cancer was terminal, according to Visconti, but if their final conversation was any indication, he had no idea he had so little time left. \\"At that late stage, he was planning the follow-up to Blackstar,\\" says Visconti, that album's producer, in an interview conducted Wednesday for a Bowie memorial package in the next issue of Rolling Stone. Sidebar \\"And I was thrilled,\\" Visconti continues, \\"and I thought, and he thought, that he'd have a few months, at least. Obviously, if he's excited about doing his next album, he must've thought he had a few more months. So the end must've been very rapid. I'm not privy to it. I don't know exactly, but he must've taken ill very quickly after that phone call.\\" Visconti has been working with Bowie on and off since 1969's Space Oddity, producing numerous key albums, among them 1970's The Man Who Sold the World, 1977's Low, 1980's Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps), and 2013's surprise comeback The Next Day. Visconti first learned of Bowie's illness a year ago, when he showed up for Blackstar recording sessions in New York. \\"He just came fresh from a chemo session, and he had no eyebrows, and he had no hair on his head,\\" says Visconti, \\"and there was no way he could keep it a secret from the band. But he told me privately, and I really got choked up when we sat face to face talking about it.\\" \\"In November, [the cancer] had spread all over his body, so there's no recovering from that.\\" Around the middle of 2015, however, Bowie's prognosis seemed to improve. \\"He was optimistic because he was doing the chemo and it was working,\\" says Visconti, \\"and at one point in the middle of last year, he was in remission. I was thrilled. And he was a bit apprehensive. He said, 'Well, don't celebrate too quickly. For now I'm in remission, and we'll see how it goes.' And he continued the chemotherapy. So I thought he was going to make it. And in November, it just suddenly came back. It had spread all over his body, so there's no recovering from that.\\" Sidebar Bowie had already finished Blackstar by November. But even before then, Visconti noticed the tone of some of the lyrics and told him, \\"You canny bastard. You're writing a farewell album.\\" Bowie simply laughed in response. \\"He was so brave and courageous,\\" says Visconti. \\"And his energy was still incredible for a man who had cancer. He never showed any fear. He was just all business about making the album.\\" As far as Visconti knows, rumors of additional health problems between Bowie’s 2004 heart attack and his cancer diagnosis 18 months ago are false. \\"When I met up with him in 2008 or 2009,\\" he says, \\"he actually had some weight on him. He was robust. His cheeks were rosy red. He wasn't sick. He was on medicine for his heart. But it was normal, like a lot of people in their 50s or 60s are on heart medication, and live very long lives. So he was coping with it very, very well.\\" In the time between the heart attack and the 2013 release of The Next Day, Bowie even took boxing lessons. When Visconti learned of Bowie's death, the producer was on the road with Holy Holy, a Bowie tribute project that includes former Spiders from Mars drummer Mick \\"Woody\\" Woodmansey. \\"We deliberated whether we should continue the tour because we were all knocked sideways,\\" Visconti says. \\"Monday was the worst day of my life. I gotta say. But we talked about it and said, 'We’re musicians, this is what we do. David would like it.' We played for the first time since his death last night to a very, very enthusiastic Toronto audience. There were people crying, but there were people smiling and clapping and jumping around. Listen, it was a wonderful experience to be able to acknowledge him, to celebrate his life.\\" Visconti and many other Bowie friends and collaborators reminisce about the musician in the next issue of Rolling Stone. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","response":"This article talks about how the famous singer, David Bowie, didn't want any fuss when he passed away, so he secretly asked for his body to be cremated without any family or friends present.

Sure we all know that we're the apple of our parent's eyes, and that our Grandmas think we're great talents and our Uncle Roberts think that we will go to the Olympics. But sometimes it's a lot harder to think such nice thoughts about ourselves. If you find that believing in yourself is a challenge. It is time you built a positive self-image and learn to love yourself. Self-image is your own mind's picture of yourself. This image includes the way you look, the way you act, the way you talk and the way you think. Interestingly, our self-images are often quite different from the images others hold about us. Unfortunately, most of these images are more negative than they should be. Thus changing the way you think about yourself is the key to changing your self-image and your whole world. The best way to defeat a passive self-image is to step back and decide to stress your successes. That is, make a list of you need to, but write down all of the great things you do every day. Don't allow doubts to occur in it. It very well might be that you are experiencing a negative self-image because you can't move past one flaw or weakness that you see about yourself.

The family enjoyed playing lengthy and shorter games, that night they played the pick from the following. i. shorter game because the time was limited.. ii. lengthy game because the time was limited..","response":"The family enjoyed playing lengthy and shorter games. That night, they played the shorter game because the time was limited. This decision was made to ensure that everyone could fully participate and enjoy the game without feeling rushed or pressured to finish quickly. Playing a shorter game allowed the family to spend quality time together without taking up the entire evening. The limited time constraint may have been due to various reasons, such as busy schedules, early morning commitments, or even a simple desire to engage in other activities that night. Shorter games can be just as enjoyable, and sometimes even more engaging, than their lengthier counterparts. By choosing a shorter game, the family was able to experience a variety of emotions, such as excitement, tension, and laughter within a condensed time frame. This enabled them to quickly switch between different games or activities during the evening and kept the atmosphere lively and dynamic. Additionally, playing a shorter game ensured that the interest and motivation of the players remained constant. Lengthy games can sometimes lead to players growing tired or losing interest over time, which can ultimately affect the overall enjoyment and cohesion of the group. In choosing the shorter game, the family was also able to accommodate the different attention spans and skill levels of its members. Some might have preferred games with a faster pace, while others might have needed a less overwhelming experience, especially in a limited timeframe. Moreover, playing a shorter game allowed the family to bond and create new memories in a short period. These memorable moments were an essential aspect of the family's time together that night, contributing to the building of relationships and the strengthening of their emotional connections. In conclusion, that night the family played the shorter game because the time was limited. This decision not only made the best use of the available time but also ensured that everyone maintained their interest, the atmosphere remained lively, and each member could fully enjoy the bonding experience. It highlights the importance of adjusting plans and activities to suit the circumstances and preferences of those involved, ultimately fostering quality time spent together and the creation of lasting memories."},{"question":"Review: I can sit through this movie once, but I doubt I could make it through a second time. Mildly entertaining mainly for the physical presence of Lindsay Lohan. The fun of Matt Dillon(think Something About Mary), and the re-emergence of a more serious acting Micheal Keaton. This is not the fun romp The Love Bug was but it is watchable. One of my main detractions from the movie was the fact that Herbie had evolved into R2D2 antics for the most part. I was bored with the headlight eyes effects about the second time of the 30 or so times they were used and the bending front fender caused the same reaction from me. Go see this with your little ones, i.e. the \\"single digit bracket\\" kids and don't expect a lot from this film. _X What is the sentiment of this review? Options are: 1). negative; 2). positive;","response":"The sentiment of this review can be best categorized as 1). negative. The reviewer expresses disappointment on several aspects of the movie. They cite being only mildly entertained, not finding the movie as fun as its predecessor, and notably criticizing the repetitive use of visual effects on the character Herbie, comparing it to R2D2 from Star Wars. While they note a few positive aspects, like the acting by Micheal Keaton and Matt Dillon, these points seem somewhat overshadowed by their overall dissatisfaction with the movie. They specifically advise going to see it with young children and tempering expectations, implying that it might not live up to the viewer's potential expectations for entertainment or cinematic quality. Therefore, the overall tone of the review is negative, citing more issues with the film than praises."},{"question":"Summarize this article: It'll be in the All Apps area of the Start menu in Windows, and in the Applications folder on macOS.

To help solve this problem, she co-founded the California Architecture Archives Network (or CalArchNet) with her Cal Poly SLO colleague Jessica Holada. Together they have organized a series of one-day mini-conferences designed to foster dialogue and collaboration among librarians, archivists, and curators at California institutions that house architecture archives. The goal of these semiannual meetings is to create a space for convergence among professionals who intersect with architectural archives in different ways. Architecture archives, often containing large drawings and scale models, present unique problems due to their size and fragility. CalArchNet participants are interested in improving the overall user experience for visitors to the archives by looking for solutions to obstacles to access. This space for an informal exchange of ideas provides an opportunity to be transparent about the challenges repositories face when managing and processing architecture holdings, as well as encourages investigation and experimentation into ways new technologies may help to solve accessibility issues, such as improved interaction with digitized collections via the IIIF protocol or 3D-scanned facsimile models and virtual walk-throughs. October 27 marked the third meeting of CalArchNet, held at the Palm Springs Art Museum, Architecture and Design Center, with representatives from 13 institutions in attendance. Topics discussed included historic site preservation research methodology, leveraging statewide resources to enhance discovery of collections, security considerations, GIS mapping technologies, and the use of linked open data to make connections between collections. The day concluded with a curator-led tour of the exhibition Albert Frey and Lina Bo Bardi: A Search for Living Architecture. If you’re an archivist, librarian, or curator working with architecture...

Some organisms, like sea sponges, lack a true nervous system. Others, like jellyfish, lack a true brain and instead have a system of separate but connected nerve cells (neurons) called a “nerve net. ” Echinoderms such as sea stars have nerve cells that are bundled into fibers called nerves. Flatworms of the phylum Platyhelminthes have both a central nervous system (CNS), made up of a small “brain” and two nerve cords, and a peripheral nervous system (PNS) containing a system of nerves that extend throughout the body. The insect nervous system is more complex but also fairly decentralized. It contains a brain, ventral nerve cord, and ganglia (clusters of connected neurons). These ganglia can control movements and behaviors without input from the brain. Octopi may have the most complicated of invertebrate nervous systems—they have neurons that are organized in specialized lobes and eyes that are structurally similar to vertebrate species.

Think carefully first, then make a decision:","response":"To find out how much more money Gretel will make compared to Hansel, let's first calculate the new salaries for both of them after their respective raises. 1. Calculate Hansel's new salary: Hansel's current salary = 30,000 Hansel's raise = 10% of 30,000 = (10/100) * 30,000 = 3,000 Hansel's new salary = 30,000 + 3,000 = 33,000 2. Calculate Gretel's new salary: Gretel's current salary = 30,000 Gretel's raise = 15% of 30,000 = (15/100) * 30,000 = 4,500 Gretel's new salary = 30,000 + 4,500 = 34,500 Now, we will subtract Hansel's new salary from Gretel's new salary to find out the difference in their earnings.

No, the sentence \\"Is 'I've a' grammatically correct?\\" is not grammatically correct because it lacks proper punctuation and phrasing. A more appropriate way to ask the question would be: \\"Is the phrase 'I've a' grammatically correct?\\" Question 2: \\"Is 'I've a' grammatically correct?\\" Available options: (1). no; (2). yes; To answer question 2, we need to analyze the phrase \\"I've a\\" and discuss its grammatical correctness. \\"I've\\" is a contraction of \\"I have.\\" Contractions are formed by combining two words into one, where an apostrophe replaces the omitted letter(s). In this case, the letter 'h' and the space between the two words are replaced by an apostrophe. When the contraction \\"I've\\" (I have) is followed by a verb in the -ing form (e.g., \\"I've been running\\" or \\"I've finished\\"), it is grammatically correct. However, using \\"I've\\" before a noun (\\"I've a book\\" or \\"I've a car\\") may not sound standard, especially in American English. In British English, though, the construction \\"I've a\\" can sometimes be idiomatic and informal, especially in spoken English.

As for the final question, \\"Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?\\", the answer is no. While question 2 is asking specifically about the grammatical correctness of the phrase \\"I've a,\\" question 1 asks about the grammatical correctness of the sentence itself without specifying which sentence is being referred to.

Equation weights are given as a list. x = 0, equation weights = [8, 6] A:","response":"Part #1: Understanding the polynomial equation. Usage: A polynomial equation is a sum of terms; each term is either a constant number or consists of the variable x raised to a certain power and multiplied by a number, called weights. Example: 2x^2 + 3x + 4. Here, the weights are 2, 3, and 4, and the equation is made up of three terms. Part #2: Representing a polynomial equation using weights. Usage: A polynomial equation can be represented using a list of its weights. Example: equation weights = [6, 4] represent the equation 6x + 4. In this case, the list [6, 4] shows that the weights of x are 6 and 4, respectively, in a 1-degree polynomial equation. Part #3: Substituting a given value of x in the polynomial equation. Usage: Calculate the result of the polynomial expression by substituting a given value of x. Example: x = 0, equation weights = [8, 6] represent the equation 8x + 6.

Stream of consciousness reasoning: To determine whether it is possible to count the exact number of sand grains on Earth, we must consider various factors such as the vast number of locations containing sand, the imprecise definition for sand grain sizes, and the fact that Earth's landscape is continuously changing. Sand can be found in deserts, beaches, dunes, rivers, seabeds, and even underground in some locations. Compiling a comprehensive list of these areas and measuring the sand quantity in each location would be a monumental task that would likely take years to complete, if it were even feasible. Additionally, these locations are ever-changing due to natural phenomena like weather, erosion, and sediment transportation, which would cause the total number of sand grains to fluctuate constantly. Another issue in counting sand grains arises from defining what a sand grain is. Different classification systems specify various size ranges for sand, so the criteria for what constitutes a sand grain can vary, making it difficult to establish a standard definition for counting purposes. Considering these complexities—countless locations with ever-changing landscapes, and the lack of a universally accepted definition for sand grains—it is not possible to tell the exact number of sand grains on Earth."},{"question":"Of the following two sentences, which one is against common sense?

It wasn't a big house or a car. It wasn't cash or gold. In the eyes of the world my father died a poor man. He was a simple mechanic who worked hard to support his family. My father's treasure, rather, was in a thousand wonderful memories that he gave me over the course of his life. One particular one stood out in my mind today. I was just a boy playing in the backyard of a friend's house while my father spent the afternoon under the hood of an old car, trying to get it running again. It seemed to take hours and I wasn't sure whether he could bring the ancient car back to life again this time. At long last, though, he closed the hood and turned the key in the ignition . There was a sweet smile of satisfaction on his face as the engine started. There was a twinkle of joy in his eye when he shook his head. And there was a quiet hum of happiness in his voice as we drove back home that day. This memory made a home in my heart and became a priceless pearl for my soul to cherish. Time and time again, my father showed me that a kind life, a giving life and a heavenly life was created one choice at a time. Not all of his choices were the right ones, but most of them were. He did the best he could. He lived the best he could. And he helped to bring out the best in me, too. He once said to me, \\"It is lucky that all of your choices are driven by love and inspired by joy.\\" As I look back into those memories my father left me, I realize that each one of them inspired me to live and to love. May all of your choices bring memories of happiness to those around you! Question: What does the author learn from his father?

Before âOrange Is the New Blackâ or âArrested Developmentâ or âHouse of Cardsâ there was âLilyhammer,â the original Netflix original series. Now that a second season of the show is arriving on Friday, it feels as if a landmark has been reached â one full cycle in the companyâs new life as a content provider. âOriginalâ has an asterisk in this case â Netflix shares âLilyhammerâ with the Norwegian network NRK, where it appears first as a television series. And itâs the showâs hybrid nature that makes it interesting. Built on the persona that its American star, Steven Van Zandt, developed as the mobster Silvio Dante on HBOâs âSopranos,â the Netflix series is an occasionally violent, low-key Nordic comedy. It combines affectionate sendups of gangster-film conventions with culture-clash satire that cuts both ways, making fun of the Scandinavian welfare state while tacitly critiquing American rapaciousness. Mr. Van Zandtâs Johnny Henriksen is the avatar of that cutthroat imperialistic menace. Having chosen Lillehammer, Norway, as his witness-protection destination (he liked the way it looked during the 1994 Winter Olympics), he proceeds to take over. Every feature of Norwegian life he finds inconvenient â mandatory language classes, socialized medicine â can be overcome with bribery, blackmail and the occasional beating. In the first season, Johnny opened a bar that echoed Silvioâs Bada Bing club in âThe Sopranos,â and fell in love with a schoolteacher whose son was a level-headed, teenage version of Tony Sopranoâs favorite nephew, Christopher. He also gathered a motley band of welfare bums and petty thieves and turned them into his crew, teaching them Arctic omertÃ (leading to an amusing scene in a rowboat that paid homage to Michael and Fredo in âThe Godfather: Part IIâ). The familiar mafia elements can make âLilyhammerâ feel like an American show, and you need to remind yourself that itâs Norwegian to notice the main thrust of the satire: In a homogeneous country where issues of race and immigration are contentious, Johnny is the ultimate immigrant success story â a hard-working and polite businessman, as long as you donât look too closely. The second season continues the theme of the outsider, as Johnny and his crew â including his shaky capo Torgeir and his debauched business adviser Jan, played by the excellent Trond Fausa Aurvaag and Fridtjov Saheim â muscle into part ownership of a refugee center. But thereâs still time for mob-movie nostalgia: The first episode opens with Johnny hearing a plea for help that begins with âI believe in Norwayâ and follows the opening of âThe Godfatherâ point for point, right up to, âSomeday â and that day may never come â I will call upon you to shovel some snow.â Write a one or two sentence summary.","response":"\\"Lilyhammer,\\" the original Netflix series, returns for a second season, continuing the adventures of Johnny Henriksen, an American mobster living in Lillehammer, Norway, under witness protection.

The Film had its lows, but overall I felt the story was strong and the characters were easy to relate to. It was also pleasant to see an Animated Disney film that was not a musical. I was about pushed to the limits with Tarzan. Thankfully they gave the music thing a rest. Another nice feature about the film is that the comedy was not completely dumbed down (a la Hercules), rather subtle so it still made the kids laugh while not make the adults feel giddy or just plain stupid. One disappointment was the animation. With all the great animated films happening outside Disney studios, you would think they would move along and catch up a little.

As he sets out on a journey of self-discovery, he uncovers the shocking truth that he may be part of a grand experiment, and that those close to him might not be as human as he originally thought. The movie's plot revolves around Aaron's quest to find his true identity and what it really means to be fully aware of oneself. Act 1: In the near future, society is driven by advanced technology, and humans have gradually become more and more reliant on it. Aaron leads a seemingly perfect life, working at a prestigious tech company and living in a luxurious apartment with a loving partner named Jane. Despite his comfortable existence, Aaron can't shake the feeling that something is not quite right. He becomes increasingly skeptical of the world around him, finding subtle clues and inconsistencies in the way people behave and interact. Act 2: Aaron's curiosity intensifies and he starts investigating further, seeking out the truth behind these discrepancies. He stumbles upon a secret underground community of hackers and rebels who share his suspicion that everything might not be as it appears. They reveal to him that their world is actually a highly immersive simulation, designed by powerful elites to harness the intellectual and emotional energy of human consciousness. More shockingly, Aaron discovers that some people in his life, including Jane, are actually advanced androids designed to monitor him and keep him in check. Act 3: Determined to unveil the true reality, Aaron works with the underground resistance to find and expose the source of the simulation. He successfully liberates his mind from the system and suddenly awakens in his real body - lying in stasis, along with thousands of other humans, in a massive laboratory controlled by the elites. Aaron learns that he carries a DNA anomaly that makes him immune to the simulation's control, which is why he's been able to slowly become fully aware of his surroundings. Final Scene: Now fully aware of his own existence and the dystopian world he was born into, Aaron finds himself at the heart of the laboratory. With the help of the underground resistance, he crafts a plan to free all the trapped humans and bring down the classes that have manipulated society for so long. In an emotionally charged moment, Aaron decides to confront Jane in the real world, questioning the nature of her existence and their relationship. The film's climax sees Aaron and the resistance face off against the powerful elites in an epic showdown. Aaron successfully disconnects the rest of humanity from the simulation, leading to a massive awakening as people everywhere regain their consciousness and their true nature. In the midst of chaos, Aaron disables Jane's android body, realizing that even their relationship was a part of the manipulation. In the film's final scene, a fully aware Aaron stands tall amidst the crumbling world around him, prepared to face the challenges of rebuilding society with his newfound freedom and understanding of truth. It’s a bitter-sweet ending that symbolizes hope, resilience, and the power of awareness in transcending the darkest of circumstances."},{"question":"Definition: In this task, you're given a statement, further information available on a particular linked term from the statement, and a question.

Laughing all the way to the bank: Flintoff will receive a payment per fan for Lancashire's home games. Last year’s home fixture against Yorkshire drew a crowd of over 12,000 — more than double the figure they achieved for any of their four other Twenty20 games in Manchester. Since Jos Buttler, fresh from his heroic 121 off 74 balls in England’s defeat by Sri Lanka at Lord’s on Saturday, may also be available for selection for Lancashire, the opportunity will be there for Flintoff to add a few thousand pounds to a deal that already includes appearance fees and win bonuses. Flintoff is dreaming of a return against bitter rivals Yorkshire, but insists he only wants to play if he proves this week he is good enough for ‘cricket reasons’. Freddie, 36, came through a low-key playing comeback on Saturday by helping St Annes beat Penrith in a lowly Northern Premier League game. Comeback: Flintoff returned to cricket when he played for St Annes on Saturday. Low key: The former England all-rounder took three wickets on his return to the game. He knows if he gets selected for Lancashire on the big stage now, somebody else will have to miss out and he does not want to get a game for sympathy reasons. ‘I’d be lying to you if I said I didn’t think about playing against Yorkshire,’ said Flintoff. ‘It will be a full house, however, Friday is a long way away, it really is — if I get a go, I get a go but I’m not by any means expecting to play. ‘On Thursday I’ve got a game with the Lancashire second team, which I’m just going to go out there and enjoy. I’m not going to put any undue pressure on myself thinking that this is a trial for Friday or anything like that. I’m just going to play — and if I get picked, I get picked. ‘If I’m. going to play then someone else is going to miss out. They’ve got to be. comfortable that, when they tell the player who is missing out, it’s the. right decision for cricket reasons. And I need to be comfortable with. that as well. ‘So. it’s all down to cricket, down to what value I can give the side and. whether I can give more than the person I take over from.’ After. Saturday’s cameo, which include facing three balls as a batsman before. being caught on the boundary attempting a six, he stressed how the. competition for Lancashire is especially tough now. Realistic: Flintoff said he is not putting too much pressure on himself ahead of his comeback. Target: Flintoff has set his sights on playing against rivals Yorkshire on Friday night. ‘I’m not putting too much pressure on myself,’ added Flintoff. ‘I’m not making big hopes. ‘I’m just going to see where it goes. I appreciate that Lancashire are on a roll in Twenty20s and there’s Jos Buttler and Jimmy Anderson and people to come back into that side. ‘So it’s not a gimme that I’m going to play. But I’m going to try to put myself in the frame. The comeback has just crept up on me. It’s not something that was a goal of mine, that I set out to do. ‘It has just come around quite innocently and that’s been the nice thing about it. I’m not chasing anything. I’m just enjoying it.

Trump on Tuesday announced that the United States is ending its participation in the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) that lifted sanctions on Iran in exchange for Tehran limiting its nuclear program, and would re-impose U.S. economic sanctions on Iran. The agreement was negotiated by the administration of Trump’s predecessor, President Barack Obama, and involved five other world powers; Great Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia. Trump’s National Security Adviser John Bolton said the U.S. decision to re-impose sanctions on Iran will set a higher standard for North Korea nuclear talks by sending, “a very clear signal that the United States will not accept inadequate deals.” The U.S. policy reversal on Iran should not seriously impede diplomatic progress underway with North Korea, said Victor Cha, a noted Korea scholar with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “In terms of how the North Koreans would take it, I don’t think they’d take it one way or the other. I don’t think they’d see it as negative or positive because they think they’re different from anybody else anyway. They think they’re a very special case,” Cha said at a CSIS conference this week. While the Iran deal limited that country’s efforts to develop a nuclear bomb, North Korea already possesses 20 to 60 nuclear warheads, according assessments by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency, and between 40 to 100 nuclear development facilities, according a report from the RAND Corporation security research organization.

The most senior politician in Scotland -- and the woman leading the drive for Scottish independence -- is in Washington as part of a four-day tour of the United States that's being called a huge public relations success. The Scotsman newspaper said she was “a hit” on \\"The Daily Show\\" earlier this week, where she was jokingly compared to Saddam Hussein. The Daily Mail said she wooed MSNBC’s \\"Morning Joe\\" as she talked breezily with the hosts about dying her gray hair. In Washington on Wednesday and Thursday, Sturgeon will give speeches at the World Bank and the Council on Foreign Relations. On this side of the pond, Sturgeon’s pro-independence Scottish National Party (SNP) will be delighted by a new poll showing support for the party has risen since the British election last month, when the party scooped up 56 of Scotland’s 59 seats. So, who is this shining political star? 1. She is ‘the most dangerous woman in Britain’ At least that’s what her critics call her. Sturgeon is the first minister of Scotland and the leader of the SNP, which wants to break up the United Kingdom. The SNP is the third-largest party in the House of Commons and stands out from the other main parties for its left-wing rhetoric, including calls to “end austerity.” Under Sturgeon’s leadership, party membership has surged. “She is hugely dangerous to unionism, to anybody who wants the U.K. to stay together, for the simple reason that she is devastatingly good at what she does,” Fraser Nelson, editor of the Spectator magazine, told a recent BBC Panorama program. 2. Before last year’s referendum, Sturgeon said that such a vote for independence would be a “once in a generation” event. Don’t bet on it. In September, Scotland decisively rejected independence, 55 percent to 45 percent. Both Sturgeon and her predecessor said that a vote on independence was a once in a generation opportunity. There's a possibility that “once in a generation” could mean “a couple of years.” Although Sturgeon insisted during the recent general election that a vote for the SNP was not a vote for a second referendum, commentators say that the whole independence question is not off the table. Next May, Scots will go to the polls for Scottish parliamentary elections. The SNP is on course to increase its majority, and it could include an independence referendum in its election manifesto. Separately, sometime before the end of 2017, Britain will hold an in/out referendum on its membership in the European Union. Sturgeon has said if Britain votes to leave the E.U., it could trigger another independence vote in Scotland. “My gut says we will see an independent Scotland in our lifetimes,” Sturgeon told the hosts of \\"Morning Joe.\\" 3. She’s not a comedian, but … In his biography, “Nicola Sturgeon: A Political Life,” the journalist David Torrance quotes a comedian asking Sturgeon what she would tell her 16-year-old self, to which she replied: “Lighten up ... and then the girl of sixteen would say ‘eff off.’” But the 44-year-old political veteran has lightened up over the years, even honing her comedy chops on \\"The Daily Show.\\" She was mistakenly billed as a \\"comedian\\" on the show’s Web site, an error she immediately brought up with Stewart, saying: “You raised all these expectations that I’m going to be funny, and I’m a politician. And as you know politicians are rarely very funny.” But she landed some jokes of her own. When talking about Scotland’s oil reserves, Stewart asked: “You have oil? May we invade you?” Sturgeon responded: “I think this is progress because you just heard there Jon, presumably on behalf of the United States, asking permission to invade an oil-producing country. It doesn’t usually work that way.” 4. Margaret Thatcher was a huge influence Margaret Thatcher, Britain’s first female prime minister, is a looming figure for Sturgeon. There has long been widespread opposition to Thatcher’s economic policies by the Scots, who blame the Iron Lady for taking on the miners and letting state-funded industries fail. In his biography, Torrance quotes Sturgeon as saying: \\"Thatcher was the motivation for my entire political career. I hated everything she stood for.\\" Sturgeon grew up in Dreghorn, a former mining town in the west of Scotland. The daughter of Robert, an electrician, and Joan, a dental nurse, she was a studious but shy child. But when she was 16, she summoned the courage to ring the doorbell of a local candidate for the SNP and ask if she could help campaign. She was the first in her family to go to university, studying law at the University of Glasgow. Over the course of her long political career, she has lost seven elections, according to the BBC. She recently told the broadcaster that the stream of defeats helped to forge her character. “I’m very very grateful that I suffered so many defeats as a politician, before I experienced success. Because we know what it’s like to lose, and we know hard it is to persuade people to vote for us and to win,” she said. Nearly 30 years since the shy but tenacious teenager joined the SNP, Sturgeon is now one of the most popular politicians in the United Kingdom. Karla Adam is a reporter in the Washington Post’s London bureau. Before joining the Post in 2006, she worked as a freelancer in London for the New York Times and People magazine.","response":"Scottish politician Nicola Sturgeon, the First Minister of Scotland and leader of the pro-independence Scottish National Party (SNP), has been called \\"the most dangerous woman in Britain\\" by her critics due to her ability to influence and possibly break up the United Kingdom.

Despite the rejection of Scottish independence in a 2014 referendum, Sturgeon has not ruled out another vote on the matter in the future, particularly if the UK votes to leave the European Union in an upcoming referendum. Under her leadership, SNP membership has surged, making the party the third-largest in the House of Commons.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less saliva is produced in the mouth happens, how will it affect HURTING the animal to hibernate properly. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","response":"The supposed perturbation of producing less saliva in the mouth may have a minor indirect effect on the hibernation process. Before hibernation, an animal's adequate food consumption is essential for building up fat reserves, and saliva plays a role in the digestion process by helping break down food. However, a reduced saliva production might not significantly hurt the animal's ability to fatten up, as they might still be able to consume and digest a sufficient amount of food with the help of other digestive enzymes and mechanisms. The overall impact of this perturbation might be small, but it could potentially affect the hibernation process to some extent by limiting the animal's energy reserves."},{"question":"Question: Claim: \\"Eminem wrote a song about being Serbian.\\" Is the claim above correct, and can it be verified by human common sense and without a web search?

Lauren Stiller Rikleen, a Boston-area lawyer and author of multiple books about women in business, has turned her attention now to young people in the workplace, from teens through 30-somethings. Her newest book, You Raised Us, Now Work with Us, examines the role this generation has in corporate America and the challenges they face, as well as present, in the workplace. Rikleen stopped by Fortune to discuss her new book as well as some concepts that come out of her work doing corporate training at the Rikleen Institute for Strategic Leadership. What follows is an edited transcript. Fortune: The notion of ‘millennials’ spans such a wide range: usually those born between 1980 and 2000. Is it even a real thing, or is it an arbitrary label? Lauren Rikleen: Some researchers use 1978. But yes, when you look at the research of what is considered the same generation, you really see huge differences. Nonetheless, it’s considered the same demographic or generation. I don’t know who creates those. But I do think that some of the changes this generation represents are real, and for two reasons: The work-life integration focus, that comes from global data. You look at data on millennials anywhere in the globe, pretty much, you’re going to see a work-life integration focus like you’ve never seen in the past in terms of what matters to them in the workplace. That’s a game changer, I think. It is also the first generation coming into the workplace that is sorting out early in their career, with their significant others, whose career takes precedence. That’s if they have a relationship, though. Part of the talk about millennials is that they are getting married much later, right? Well, yes, previous generations went from adolescence right to adulthood, and now there’s this whole body of research around “emerging adulthood.” Millennials go from adolescent to emerging adult to adult because all the markers of independent adulthood are happening later: financial independence, getting married, having kids, leaving home, finishing school. It is all happening later for this generation. No, I think it’s just fine. It just is what it is. The question becomes: how should the workplace adapt? We [baby boomers] created a lot of the circumstances that we criticize millennials over. That’s part of my book, You Raised Us, Now Work With Us. We have to make changes in the workplace if we care about retention, and if we care about the growth and development of millennials as future leaders in the workplace. What changes need to be made? One of the biggest has to do with flexibility in the workplace. We have to start thinking about how work is done. Well, if you’re the first generation juggling dual careers and raising a family, how do you go about who’s going to take the kids to the doctor’s appointment, who’s going to go to the school play, who’s going to go to the field trip. So, thinking differently about remoteness, and remote work, is a part of flexibility. And being able to integrate it into the workplace is critically important for retention in leadership development. So, it’s not just that the millennials need to figure out how to schedule and be flexible, but the workplace needs to cater to them in return? Well, one thing that happened is that boomers lived life as younger people in a way that nobody ever saw, changing the world. Civil rights movement, women’s movement, fighting against the Vietnam War. Then, they got into the workplace and totally conformed. The boomers settled into their parent’s workplace. But that workplace doesn’t work anymore. For most of my generation, it’s still pretty much that the dad went to work, the mom stayed home, had a lower impact career. That’s just not the way it is. Totally gone. So, the workplace has to change. Using technology as a tool and not a tether, for example. We’ve done a great job making technology a tether to the workplace. ‘Hey, you can take that Blackberry to the soccer game! Just don’t look at any of the plays, so I know that you’re doing work!’ That’s part of the whole lack of flexibility. There are just so many differences, generationally, for millennials. They’re closer with their parents than any generation in the past. More reliant on them and more engaged with on a regular basis. You said the workplace has to change. But has it already changed a little? Up to a point. But certainly not enough. We’re still having these conversations about women and leaders, for example. We’re still counting firsts; the percentage of women on boards is still low, and women CEOs are still low. Let’s talk more about that, about women in business. You’ve also written books about that. Well, I’ve come to the conclusion that every single workplace should have training in unconscious bias and the implications of unconscious bias. How we evaluate people, how we provide opportunities. I’ve written two books on women’s success in the legal profession, I talk to women all over the country, and the factors that I hear for women leaving a job are never, ‘I left or cut back because of my family demands.’ It’s, ‘I defaulted to that because I was hitting a brick wall, and what is the point. I don’t get the same assignments as men of my same experience level. I don’t get invited to the same networking opportunities.’ We still struggle with our image of women as leaders. We still see a correlation between likeability and success: women who are more successful are less liked. How does that play out in the workplace for their opportunities? The barriers that women are facing now are just that much more subtle and pernicious, and we’re not doing enough training on how our unconscious minds work with people different than us. We have a long way to go. Is the Sheryl Sandberg ‘lean in’ concept having a real effect? I read her book and thought it was really good. She talks about unconscious bias. She has good research, footnotes and studies. The problem is, a lot of people talk about leaning in but have never read the book. They don’t understand what it means. So, now you hear senior people in the workplace using it as a weapon. Like, ‘she’s just not leaning in enough! She needs to lean in more.’ I can’t tell you how many times I’ve heard that. And they haven’t read the book! Somehow, it becomes her problem. She’s not leaning in enough. Our joke in the Women’s Bar Association is that women are leaning in so far they’re in danger of toppling over. So, her advice is fine, it’s just that the major concern I have is that I wish she would use her voice for workplace change. Is there a “lean in” equivalent you espouse? Mine is workplace change. What are the obstacles in the workplace for women, and people of color, to be able to succeed? Understand issues around unconscious bias, understand how your assignments can be fair and equitable. So, you’re placing more of an onus on the workplace and corporate America, not women to change themselves. Absolutely. I see examples, thousands since I wrote Ending the Gauntlet, of remarkably talented women who should by any measure be in a more senior position. In my profession, a woman associate and a male associate may be staffing the same case and a total difference happens in who’s getting the more interesting client exposure work. In law, women currently make up just 15% or 17% of the senior, equity partner positions. By 2000, women should have made up half of the partners already, based on how many women were coming out of law school in the ‘70s, ‘80s, and ‘90s. So, the pipeline is so clogged, it’s not moving. Let’s marry the two concepts we’ve been discussing. Are female millennials more aggressive, in the right way, then women in the past? One of the great opportunities for millennial women is that they’ve been able to go much longer in their lives without necessarily experiencing the same kind of discrimination. What a huge impact Title IX had. That was a sea change because it applied to sports, but it also had this greater dimension to it that impacts so much else. I think when you couple that with being raised with greater self-confidence, the plus side is not having seen the barriers, but the downside is that they’ll see the barriers as soon as they get married or start having kids. That’s where the rubber hits the road around people’s preconceived notions about what women in the workplace want. Rather than ask them what they want, they assume she wants to leave or travel. For women, their biology is a barrier. To what extent is this whole effort still faced with dated biases from men? Is ‘feminism’ more of a loaded term than ever? Somehow, that word has gotten hijacked. I’m not sure when or how or why, but now you can say to someone, ‘are you a feminist?’ And they’ll say, ‘oh, no!’ But then you ask, ‘do you believe in women having equal opportunity in the workplace?’ and they’ll respond, ‘well, of course!’ That word has been hijacked in our society. But we have to get around labels and focus on the issues. You can always tell who buys into these topics. About millennials, for example, I recently had an older gentlemen say to me, ‘these generational differences are meaningless. We [boomers] were idealistic and active, too. And our kids, once they have to settle down and pay a mortgage, they’ll be just like us.’ Time will tell. We don’t know. But I wouldn’t want to be betting my workplace that the differences aren’t real.

It occurred in about September 1848 at Avenue Range, a sheep station in the southeast of the Colony of South Australia. Information is scarce about the basic facts of the massacre, including the exact date and number of victims. A contemporary account of the massacre listed nine victims – three women, two teenage girls, three infants, and an \\"old man blind and infirm\\". Another account published by Christina Smith in 1880 gave the number of victims as eleven, and specified that they belonged to the Tanganekald people. Pastoralist James Brown and his overseer, a man named Eastwood, were suspected of committing the murders in retaliation for attacks on Brown's sheep. In January 1849, reports of the massacre reached Matthew Moorhouse, the Protector of Aborigines. He visited the district to investigate the claims, and based on his enquiries Brown was charged with the murders in March 1849. Proceedings against Brown began in June 1849 and continued in the Supreme Court of South Australia for several months, but were eventually abandoned. Some key witnesses, including Eastwood, either fled the colony or refused to cooperate with the investigation. There were also significant restrictions on the use of evidence given by Aboriginal witnesses, especially where a verdict could involve capital punishment. These legal hurdles and settler solidarity ensured the case did not go to trial, although the magistrate who committed him for trial told a friend that there was \\"little question of the butchery or the butcher\\". Although the details of the case were known for decades after the murders, distortions of the massacre eventually appeared in print and were embellished by local white and Aboriginal historians. Two key aspects of these later accounts were that Brown poisoned rather than shot the victims, and that he had undertaken an epic horse ride to Adelaide to establish an alibi...., can you guess it ? The answer is:","response":"The reason Brown was suspected of committing the murders was in retaliation for attacks on his sheep. This information is mentioned in the sentence that reads, \\"Pastoralist James Brown and his overseer, a man named Eastwood, were suspected of committing the murders in retaliation for attacks on Brown's sheep.\\" The step-by-step process involved in arriving at the answer is as follows: 1. I started by reading the question carefully to understand what specific information was needed. 2. I then proceeded to read the article carefully, looking for the answer to the question. 3. Upon reading the text, I discovered a sentence where James Brown was mentioned in relation to the alleged murders. In this sentence, it mentions that he and his overseer were suspected of committing the murders due to retaliatory motives after attacks on their sheep. 4. To verify the answer, I cross-referenced the contents of the sentence with the question asked. It matched, and thus the reason Brown was suspected of committing the murders got justified. Therefore, considering the context provided and the data available, I believe that the retaliation for the attacks on Brown's sheep was the reason suspected for his involvement in the murders."},{"question":"This means that Marketing can benefit from promising a little less than the company can deliver Imagine if the customer from the previous example had the internet installed two days earlier than he had been promised and on top of this by a friendly and serviceminded technician Add punctuation.","response":"This means that marketing can benefit from promising a little less than the company can deliver.

Who will be less likely to cause dead zones in their respective lakes? Jimbo and Jedd are both farmers who have lakes and water wells downstream from their farms. Jimbo's products have been in high demand recently, so he has started to use very high amounts of fertilizers on his farms. Jedd has recently decreased the amount of fertilizer he uses because his products aren't wanted as much by the people in his town. Hint: Huge amounts of chemicals, such as fertilizers and pesticides, are applied to farm fields (see Figure below ). Some of the chemicals are picked up by rainwater. Runoff then carries the chemicals to nearby rivers or lakes. Dissolved fertilizer causes too much growth of water plants and algae. This can lead to dead zones where nothing can live in lakes and at the mouths of rivers. Some of the chemicals can infiltrate into groundwater. The contaminated water comes up in water wells. If people drink the polluted water, they may get sick. The answer is:","response":"Jedd will be less likely to cause dead zones in their respective lakes. This is because he has recently decreased the amount of fertilizer he uses on his farm, resulting in a lower risk of chemical runoff carrying those excess nutrients to nearby rivers or lakes.

Press Association Reporter. Last updated at 3:49 PM on 28th October 2011. A former nurse told her daughter her life had become a 'nightmare' after undergoing gastric bypass surgery to lose weight, an inquest heard today. Virginia Humphrey, 67, died at the Royal Sussex County Hospital (RSCH) in Brighton, East Sussex, on May 9 after losing 10 stone in six months, the inquest at Brighton County Court was told. An email sent by divorcee Mrs Humphrey to her daughter, Deborah Mitchell, who lived in the U.S., was read out to the inquest. Tragic: Virginia Humphrey, pictured with her grandchild before the operation, was worried about having the gastric bypass. In the email, sent on January 18, she described how she was unable to keep any food down and had chronic indigestion, leaving her feeling like a 'prune'. She wrote: 'Life since coming out of hospital has been a nightmare. 'Friday was an awful day ending with me being so sick I thought I turned my body inside out.' Her son, Kevin Humphrey, said that in her last few months she became wheelchair-bound as she did not enough energy to walk, and he would have to carry her up the stairs to the house they shared in the city. He told the inquest: 'I had rails fitted but she wasn’t strong enough to use the rails. 'She could walk no further than 10 steps, then she’d feel faint.' The inquest heard yesterday how Mrs Humphrey, who also had another son, suffered from malnutrition as she was unable to absorb nutrients. It was also heard that the surgeons who carried out the operation at University College London Hospital (UCLH) may have got their measurements wrong when carrying out the procedure as it was possible a channel leading to the colon was cut too short. Fatal. operation: Virginia Humphrey died in hospital in Brighton after she. lost more than ten stones following a gastric band operation. Mrs Humphrey, who suffered from type two diabetes, asthma and high blood pressure, had undergone the procedure to help her lose weight on August 31 last year and seemed to be doing well and making the progress expected in the following months. However by December she was beginning to have problems keeping food down and was admitted to the A&E department at the RSCH twice that month. The inquest heard that although she went to the hospital because of her constant vomiting, medics also found she had chest problems and so did not inform staff at UCLH of her bariatric trouble. Mrs Humphrey, who worked as an Army nurse before becoming an auxiliary nurse, went to A&E again on February 9 suffering from severe vomiting, diarrhoea, lower abdomen pain and indigestion. Medics found she was dehydrated and also had difficulty swallowing. The inquest heard staff at the RSCH decided Mrs Humphrey should be transferred to UCLH so she could have specialist bariatric care. They did not have space for her immediately but she was admitted on February 22 with symptoms of vomiting and difficulty swallowing. University College Hospital London: The hospital where Mrs Humphrey underwent her gastric bypass surgery in August last year. James Hewes, a trainee surgeon who had carried out the gastric bypass alongside consultant bariatric surgeon Marco Adamo, told the inquest these were relatively common complaints from patients following gastric surgery, and would normally last for around a year afterwards. He said on seeing her again at the hospital, her kidney function appeared to be completely normal and she appeared dehydrated, but not severely. Her albumin levels, which indicate the amount of protein in the blood and could have pointed to malnutrition at the time, fluctuated but were also said to be normal. The inquest heard that 'morbidly obese' Mrs Humphrey, who had weighed 18st 10lb (119kg) ahead of her operation on July 23, weighed 75.4kg on February 22, which was described as more than would have been expected, but not of great concern. It was heard that Mrs Humphrey, who was previously described as a 'very cheerful' person by her GP, Dr Caroline Roberts, was also a 'stoic' character who may not have let on to hospital staff just how ill she felt before she was discharged on February 28. Mr Adamo said: 'Patients are very happy because of the weight loss so sometimes they tend to minimise their symptoms. 'Patients are more inclined to say 'it's fine'.' The inquest heard Mrs Humphrey, known as Ginny, later contracted a blood stream infection, which may have contributed to her death of multiple organ failure. What are highlight points for this article?","response":"1. Virginia Humphrey, a 67-year-old former nurse, died after undergoing gastric bypass surgery and losing 10 stone in six months. 2. She experienced complications, including the inability to keep food down, chronic indigestion, and malnutrition, which may have been caused by possible incorrect measurements during the surgery. 3. Humphrey's kidney function appeared normal, and her albumin levels fluctuated but were also said to be normal; however, she later contracted a bloodstream infection. 4. Before her death, Humphrey became wheelchair-bound due to a lack of energy, requiring her son's assistance for mobility. 5. The inquest revealed that she might not have communicated the severity of her symptoms to hospital staff, potentially complicating her treatment. 6.

He discovered and developed one of the first successful polio vaccines. Born in New York City, he attended New York University School of Medicine, later choosing to do medical research instead of becoming a practicing physician. In 1939, after earning his medical degree, Salk began an internship as a physician scientist at Mount Sinai Hospital. In 1966, The New York Times referred to him as the \\"Father of Biophilosophy.\\" According to Times journalist and author Howard Taubman, \\"he never forgets... there is a vast amount of darkness for man to penetrate. As a biologist, he believes that his science is on the frontier of tremendous new discoveries; and as a philosopher, he is convinced that humanists and artists have joined the scientists to achieve an understanding of man in all his physical, mental and spiritual complexity. Such interchanges might lead, he would hope, to a new and important school of thinkers he would designate as biophilosophers.\\" Salk told his cousin, Joel Kassiday, at a meeting of the Congressional Clearinghouse on the Future on Capitol Hill in 1984 that he was optimistic that ways to prevent most human and animal diseases would eventually be developed. Salk said people must be prepared to take prudent risks, since \\"a risk-free society would become a dead-end society\\" without progress. Salk describes his \\"biophilosophy\\" as the application of a \\"biological, evolutionary point of view to philosophical, cultural, social and psychological problems.\\" He went into more detail in two of his books, Man's Unfolding, and The Survival of the Wisest. In an interview in 1980, he described his thoughts on the subject, including his feeling that a sharp rise and an expected leveling off in the human population would take place and eventually bring a change in human attitudes: \\"I think of biological knowledge as providing useful analogies for understanding human nature.... People think of biology in terms of such practical matters as drugs, but its contribution to knowledge about living systems and ourselves will in the future be equally important.... In the past epoch, man was concerned with death, high mortality; his attitudes were antideath, antidisease\\", he says. \\"In the future, his attitudes will be expressed in terms of prolife and prohealth. The past was dominated by death control; in the future, birth control will be more important. These changes we're observing are part of a natural order and to be expected from our capacity to adapt. It's much more important to cooperate and collaborate. We are the co-authors with nature of our destiny.\\" His definition of a \\"biophilosopher\\" is \\"Someone who draws upon the scriptures of nature, recognizing that we are the product of the process of evolution, and understands that we have become the process itself, through the emergence and evolution of our consciousness, our awareness, our capacity to imagine and anticipate the future, and to choose from among alternatives.\\" Just prior to his death, Salk was working on a new book along the theme of biophilosophy, privately reported to be titled Millennium of the Mind. Ask a question about this article.","response":"Jonas Salk was a very important scientist who helped create a vaccine for a disease called polio.

Following a fire at the Ajuda Palace in 1794, the Prince Regent John VI and his wife Carlotta Joaquina began to use Queluz themselves. The Robillon wing was enlarged and given an upper floor for the use of the princess and her nine children. These additions were destroyed in the fire of 1934. To escape the forces of Napoleon I in 1807, the Portuguese royal family abandoned Queluz and fled to Brazil. The French occupational forces took control of the palace, and their commander, General Junot, made several alterations to the building. On the royal family's return from exile in 1821, the King preferred to live at Mafra, leaving his wife, the Spanish Queen Carlotta Joaquina, to occupy Queluz with her aunt Princess Maria Francisca Benedita. The King visited Queluz infrequently. It was on one of these rare visits that João VI died in the circular domed King's Bedroom in 1826.Carlotta Joaquina, sometimes described as sinister, is said to have been ambitious and violent. Her features were reportedly ugly, and she was short in stature. Whatever her shortcomings she lived in great style at Queluz, employing an orchestra which William Beckford described as the finest in Europe. The Queen also had a small private theatre in the gardens, of which nothing remains today. She died at the palace in 1830.Following the death of Carlotta Joaquina, Queluz saw only intermittent use as a royal residence and was not again the primary residence of Portuguese royalty. Carlotta Joaquina's son King Miguel used the palace during the three-year civil war which he fought against his brother King Pedro IV, before being forced by his brother in 1834 to abdicate and go into exile. A year later, Pedro IV died of tuberculosis at the age of 35 at Queluz, the palace of his birth. Pedro I's daughter Maria II ruled until her death in 1853 and was succeeded by her son Pedro V.

A prolific session musician, Lukather has recorded guitar tracks for more than 1,500 albums representing a broad array of artists and genres. He has also contributed to albums and hit singles as a songwriter, arranger and producer. Lukather was a prominent contributor to several studio albums by Michael Jackson, including Thriller, the best-selling album of all time.

He has been a member of the band ever since it began, and is still fully contributing to their album composition and touring. Lukather's reputation as a guitarist and his association with Paich and the Porcaro brothers, who also became established artists, allowed him to secure a steady flow of session work in the 1970s and 1980s.

The tweet consists of two parts: 1) \\"Another Day Down...\\" 2) \\"About 400 more to go before freedom.\\" The first part, \\"Another Day Down...\\", has a neutral sentiment. It merely states that another day has passed, which could be interpreted as a simple observation that carries no strong emotions. The second part of the tweet, \\"About 400 more to go before freedom.\\", gives us more information to deduce the sentiment. The use of the word \\"freedom\\" may initially seem positive, suggesting that the person is looking forward to a future event or moment in their life. However, when combined with the phrase \\"400 more to go,\\" it becomes evident that the user is anticipating the end of a long period or event in a negative context. For example, the tweet could refer to the remaining days in a lengthy contract, an undesirable job, or a challenging academic program. The sentiment expressed in this part of the tweet is one of longing for the end of an unfavorable situation, which can be associated with negative emotions such as impatience, frustration, or dissatisfaction. Considering these factors and taking the entire tweet into account, the sentiment of the tweet can be determined as: 1). Negative. This conclusion is based on the overall tone of the tweet, which reveals a sense of counting down the days until the end of a negatively perceived situation.

This post discusses and explores my experiences of being a PhD student researching women’s lived experiences of research evaluation in the UK, and my thoughts on and experiences of interviewing very senior and esteemed academics as a junior researcher. My PhD study explored research evaluation in the form of the Research Excellence Framework (REF) – a weighty force in UK academia – the outcomes of which, I argue, hold the potential to alter the course of an academic career considerably, as well as playing a role in the type of work that some academics do, particularly given the REF impact agenda. There is currently an international trend towards research evaluation with programmes such as the Excellence in Research for Australia (ERA), the Performance-Based Research fund in New Zealand (PBRF), and equivalents in countries including Denmark, Switzerland and the Netherlands. What is clear is that there is not enough qualitative, exploratory research into the effects of research evaluation on academic careers, especially for women, and so my PhD study was born. My findings suggest that research evaluation in the UK actively contributes to the continuance of gender inequality regimes in the academy, and that the ability to negotiate managerial control and be politically savvy is increasingly important in the academic world. Before embarking on my PhD, I was acutely aware of the sensitivity of my research, as well as my own positionality with regards to my participants. Reflection is and was an important element in the research process for me, as it allowed me to reflect on the effects of the self on the research process and, ultimately, also on the data, as well as the various power dynamics discernible during interviews for my study.

Article: WUHAN - A 72-year-old woman, Wang Yulan, has started legal procedures against Carrefour after she was falsely accused of stealing in the supermarket. Wang's lawyer Wen Jun said they filed a lawsuit at the Donghu district court, making two demands. First, Wang wants Carrefour to make a public apology and the apology letter should be put up in the Carrefour store or in the media. \\"We also demand 50,000 yuan in compensation for my wife's psychological injuries,\\" Wang's husband, Yan Fucun, said, \\"We don't mean to _ money from Carrefour, but asked for it as a recognition of respect. Besides the money spent on lawsuit costs, I will donate the rest to charity.\\" Wang earlier said she went to the store's Guanggu branch to buy cereal. She picked up 20 packs of a particular brand and was given another four as gifts by a saleswoman. However, when she arrived at the checkout, the cashier insisted Wang pay for all 24 packs, which led to an argument. The saleswoman later denied she said the extra packs were free. A store supervisor led Wang to an office, accused her of theft and had her sign a form and pose for photos. Wang and her husband returned to the store the next day with the local media to demand an explanation. Carrefour China then apologized for the incident on its Sina micro blog, saying the managers and staff members involved have visited Wang's home and apologized. The company also sent three apology letters to Wang in the following three days. Eric Legros, president of Carrefour China, said,\\"We made a mistake and we apologized four times. Four times, you know. And Carrefour will not do anything more about it.\\" Wen Jun said the supermarket's management came with risks. For instance, Wen said the company would offer employees money if they caught a thief in the store. \\"I hope this case will be a warning for the staff who want to get money by such an immoral method,\\" Wen said.

The Bank of Japan’s decision in January to take interest rates negative has sent bond yields tumbling, while doing little to curb a surging yen that’s squeezing the world’s third-biggest economy just when it needs a weaker currency. That’s put even more monetary and fiscal stimulus on the agenda at a time when Japanese households and companies are increasingly doubting the program. “Japan is bringing bad news to the world,” said Hiromichi Shirakawa, chief Japan economist at Credit Suisse Group AG and a former BOJ official. “It’s demonstrating that massive monetary easing doesn’t work for everyone. Any additional stimulus may invite criticism from other central banks.” The decline in credibility in Japan is a warning sign for central bankers and finance ministers who gather this week in Washington for spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, as well as a Group of 20 session. If policy makers around the globe fail to gain traction soon with their actions, that risks a relapse into too-low inflation and even weaker growth, possibly roiling financial markets and increasing the threat that Japan-style stagnation spreads to more advanced economies. The failure of policy to revive prices and growth in Japan would be a warning to all developed economies that need to break out into a cycle of investment, hiring, and slightly higher inflation. “You’ve had a combination of this massive crisis that causes prolonged, weak growth and layered on top of that a series of other shocks that undercut any optimism,” said Ethan Harris, co-head of global economic research at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in New York. “It is dangerous to be in this situation for so long because it becomes self-fulfilling.” Even after the financial-market swoon of the first quarter was reversed by aggressive European Central Bank action and the Federal Reserve’s and Bank of England’s pivots to a longer period of accommodation, the weak world economy continues to draw concern. The IMF on Tuesday will release its updated World Economic Outlook, which is likely to show a dip in the global growth forecast following a reduction in the previous projections in January. IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde said last week that expansion “remains too slow, too fragile, and risks to its durability are increasing.” Fed Chair Janet Yellen said March 29 that global developments pose risks to the U.S. economy, especially uncertainty around the pace of Chinese growth that sent stocks tumbling earlier in the first quarter. BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda and Finance Minister Taro Aso will be in the hot seat in Washington as they defend policies that have disrupted markets without solving Japan’s underlying economic problems. Kuroda’s freedom to double down on stimulus to stoke inflation and growth may be limited by G-20 agreements to avoid the competitive devaluation of currencies. He’s also up against critics in the investment community who argue that the central bank is harming the debt market and is on the cusp of running out of bonds to buy. The 71-year-old governor maintains that all options are on the table, including a deeper cut to the negative rate, and increased purchases of assets ranging from Japanese government bonds to exchange-traded funds and real estate investment trusts. Fiscal stimulus may be more likely, with Tokyo abuzz in recent weeks with speculation that the Abe government will compile a supplementary spending package to bolster an existing record budget for this fiscal year. “Kuroda is likely to face a lot of questions,” said Credit Suisse’s Shirakawa, no relation to former BOJ chief Masaaki Shirakawa. “But I don’t think he can just sit tight when the economy is on the verge of returning to deflation. He’ll have to expand stimulus. Of course, other nations won’t be happy.” Japan’s experience with negative interest rates is rippling through policy circles. Lagarde has said that the world would be in a “much worse place today” without negative rates in Europe and Japan. Yet her former chief economist, Olivier Blanchard, said Friday that he’s not a fan of the policy because it interferes with banks. New York Fed President William C. Dudley said Friday that if the Fed needed to provide additional stimulus, “we might not decide to go to negative rates for a whole variety of reasons” and would instead use other means of easing in the event of a U.S. downturn, which Fed officials aren’t forecasting. The rise in the yen -- it’s up 11 percent against the dollar this year, the most of 16 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg -- is troublesome because it sets up more disinflation and export drag in a major economy where aggressive policy stimulus has already been tried. “Theoretically, central banks should always be able to raise” inflation, said Mark Spindel, a former World Bank official who now runs Potomac River Capital LLC in Washington. “They don’t tell you what happens if it doesn’t work.” Write a one or two sentence summary.","response":"Central bankers' repeated attempts to stimulate sluggish global growth may be hurting investor confidence, as investors worry the measures could lead to disappointing returns, a situation reflected in the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) negative interest rates, which have caused bonds yields to collapse while doing little to stop the yen from soaring. The BOJ's decision to push rates into negative territory, alongside its aggressive rhetoric, have been blamed for causing a storm of doubt among Japanese households and companies, while the central bank's solutions are causing increasing concern among global financial leaders."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: Combine the given two facts to write a concluding fact.

Once the butterfly has successfully pumped blood into its wings, gaining enough strength to enable flight, it takes off in search of several resources it needs for sustenance and reproduction. Some key activities that the butterfly engages in as part of its adult life include: 1. Feeding: Adult butterflies mainly feed on nectar from flowers, which serves as an essential energy source for activities such as flying, reproducing, and even thermoregulation. They may also consume other sources of nutrients like fruit juices, tree sap, or even dissolved nutrients from animal manure or carcasses. 2. Mating: One of the primary goals of the adult butterfly is to find a mate to continue the life cycle and ensure the survival of the species. Mating rituals can vary between different butterfly species. In many cases, males will use their vibrant wing color patterns to attract females, and the butterflies may engage in courtship dances or flights. After a successful mating, the female butterfly will carry fertilized eggs and start looking for suitable host plants to lay the eggs on. 3. Migration: Some species of butterflies, such as the Monarch butterfly, undertake a remarkable migration journey of thousands of miles, in search of ideal conditions to feed and reproduce. These migrations can span multiple generations as they fly to find their breeding grounds, spend the summer breeding, and then journey back to their overwintering sites. 4. Thermoregulation: Butterflies are ectothermic animals, which means that they rely on external sources to regulate their body temperature. Adult butterflies need to maintain an optimal internal temperature to fly and perform other essential activities. They may engage in basking, where they spread their wings and orient themselves towards the sun to absorb heat, or find shade to cool down when the temperatures are too high. 5. Predator avoidance: Butterflies face numerous dangers during their adult life, including predators like birds, spiders, and other insects. They have evolved various strategies to avoid becoming prey, such as toxic chemicals or warning coloration to deter predators or even mimicry to camouflage with their surroundings. Once the adult butterfly has accomplished its primary objectives of feeding, mating, and, in some cases, migration, the butterflies reach the end of their life cycle. The next generation of butterflies is born when the fertilized eggs hatch, entering the metamorphic process, ultimately resulting in a new lineage of adult butterflies."},{"question":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

Lila Lee [Cheryl \\"Rainbeaux\\" Smith], the Singin' Angel of the Community Baptist Church of Tylerville (North Carolina?), is a sweet and innocent 13-year old whose gangster father Alvin [William Whitton] just shot his wife and her lover, ran down an old lady in the street, and is now running from the law. Reverend Mueller [Richard Blackburn], who has a hard time keeping his hands off his ward Lila, has made it clear to the parish that the sins of her father should not be blamed on Lila, but when Lila gets a letter from a woman named Lemora, instructing her to come to her sick father and forgive him his sins against her, Lila makes her way that very night to the Northpark bus station just in time to catch the bus (driven by a very creepy bus driver) to Asteroth.Along the road to Asteroth, an isolated little town in the salt marshes, the bus is pursued by several monstrous-looking ghouls, visible from outside Lila's window. When the bus breaks down and the bus driver tries to fix it, the ghouls close in. Lila releases the brake and coasts down the hill until she crashes into a tree. The ghouls begin to approach when suddenly they are attacked by vampires (aristocratic-looking with white faces, long black coats, and top hats). Lila passes out. When she awakens, she finds herself imprisoned in a stonehouse and tended to by a weird old lady named Solange [Maxine Ballantyne]. [Lemora later explains that the bars weren't to keep Lila IN but to keep other things OUT.] Lila manages to escape the stonehouse and to hide in a crawl space under a porch, where she overhears Lemora [Lesley Gilb] talking to her father.

They are depicted as aristocratic-looking beings with white faces, long black coats, and top hats, striking terror into the hearts of the townspeople and anyone who comes across them. In the film, the vampires serve as a menacing opposition force for young Lila Lee and the other residents of Asteroth. They are shown pursuing the bus Lila is traveling in, attacking when the opportunity arises, and generally causing unrest and uncertainty. The vampires are noted to be the ones who attack the monstrous-looking ghouls surrounding Lila when her bus breaks down, further showcasing their predatory nature and overall aggression. Additionally, some of the vampires, like Lemora, seem to have ulterior motives that extend beyond simply causing chaos and fear. In Lemora's case, she aims to have Lila go through a ceremony in which she will become immune to her father's \\"disease,\\" which could potentially turn her into one of them. This plan suggests that the vampires may also have a goal of growing their numbers and possibly controlling or manipulating people to suit their purposes.

Starting with this article, FIXES will appear Tuesdays rather than Fridays. For many years now, my mother has talked to my brother and me — often — about how she wants to die. She is still in good health. But when it happens, we both know that she wants above all to die quickly and without pain. She wants no heroic measures. Because my brother and I know this, and because she has the proper legal documents, she is likely to die as she wishes. My mother is unusual. Not in what she wants — a Pew Research Center study indicates that 57 percent of Americans would ask their doctor to stop treatment so they could die if they had an incurable disease and were suffering a great deal of pain. What sets my mom apart is that she has been unafraid to talk to us about her wishes. Most Americans don’t do that. Of adults 75 and over, the study found that only 17 percent had talked to their families about their end-of-life wishes. It is an uncomfortable conversation. It always seems too early to talk to a loved one about how she wants to die — until it’s too late, and she can no longer make decisions for herself. But perhaps soon, more Americans will be like my mom. On Jan. 1, Medicare will begin reimbursing doctors and other health professionals for time spent talking to patients about their end-of-life wishes. This is a big deal, but far from enough. End-of-life conversations need to become something families just do. There’s one place in America like that now: La Crosse, Wis. La Crosse started down this path in 1984, when Bernard Hammes, a philosopher by training, was hired as director of medical humanities at the Gundersen Lutheran Medical Foundation. His job was to work with medical personnel to improve their skills and help them make decisions in ethically fraught situations. In one two-month period, Hammes saw three very elderly patients who had suffered devastating strokes and kidney failure, were being kept alive with dialysis, and could not speak for themselves. If the doctors stopped dialysis, the patients would die. But even on dialysis, the patients would never recover from their strokes. “None of the families had ever talked with the parent about the parent’s perspective on dialysis and when to stop,” Hammes said. “Families were going to have to live with the question of ‘did I do the right thing for my mom or father?’ and they would never know the answer.” These patients had not gotten sick suddenly. They had long, progressive illnesses and had been in care at Gundersen for years — and no one had thought to begin that conversation. The lack of communication is often catastrophic for patients who do not want heroic measures. When family members don’t know a relative’s wishes, they often feel they must show their love by asking that everything be done. Anything short of the maximum seems like abandonment or betrayal. And that makes the choice also terrible for families. “I witnessed frequent and repeated moral distress that health professionals and families had making decisions when there were no good decisions,” Hammes said. “It was almost exclusively based on the fact that we didn’t know what the patient wanted.” Research shows that families who are unaware of a patient’s wishes suffer much more stress, anxiety and depression than those who are aware. “It was a difference of night and day,” said Hammes. “The difference it makes in people’s lives is so clear and big that not to do it seems cruel.” Hammes started a program to begin end-of-life conversations with dialysis patients and their families. Within two years, he said, almost all the families of dialysis patients knew their loved one’s wishes. In 1991, Gundersen set up a task force to spread the program throughout La Crosse, which included the Franciscan Hospital and the Skemp Clinic, alongside the Gundersen Lutheran Medical Foundation’s hospital and clinic. All four collaborated, along with nursing homes, hospices and smaller hospitals. The goal was not simply to have people fill out an advance directive and put it in their medical records. A written directive alone, members of the task force reasoned, could do more harm than good if it came as a surprise to the family, said Hammes. “We don’t think mom understood what she signed,” was a common response. Just as important as the legal document was a conversation with the patient and her family. The patient would need to understand the options — for example, that “do everything necessary to keep me alive” can mean intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation, which on a frail elderly person can break her ribs and sternum; those who survive it often do so with abdominal bleeding and neurological damage. And the family had to agree to support the patient’s decisions. “We really changed the nature of the question,” said Hammes. “It’s not: ‘How do you fill out this legal document,’ but ‘What does good care look like if you become ill and may not recover?’ At the most basic human level, what families face in those moments is, ‘What does it mean to love my mom or dad when they’re not going to recover, but we could still do some things to keep them alive? What does it mean to take good care of my mom at this point?’” The task force brought its message to local churches, senior centers and community groups. Inside health care organizations, it became evident that doctors didn’t have time for these conversations, but also that doctors weren’t required. Instead, the task force trained nurses, social workers and chaplains. Today, Hammes said, 96 percent of people who die in La Crosse County have had a conversation with relatives about how they want to spend their last days, and those wishes have been entered into their electronic medical records. Read previous contributions to this series. President Obama tried to include reimbursement for end-of-life conversations in the Affordable Care Act. Sarah Palin derailed it with a single Facebook post: “The America I know and love is not one in which my parents or my baby with Down syndrome will have to stand in front of Obama’s ‘death panel’ so his bureaucrats can decide, based on a subjective judgment of their “level of productivity in society,” whether they are worthy of health care.” With that, she gave a rallying cry to the anti-ObamaCare right. Palin’s post won PolitiFact’s 2009 “Lie of the Year” award. A year later, the Obama administration tried again to cover advance care planning decisions. Again, it proved too politically toxic. Today the political climate has improved. Advance care planning is no longer coupled to Obamacare, and Medicare’s decision to cover end-of-life conversations will have a ripple effect. Some private insurers already cover these conversations, and when Medicare starts, the rest will most likely follow. Last Thursday, WPS Health Solutions, Wisconsin’s largest nonprofit insurer, announced that its WPS Health Insurance and Arise Health Plan would begin to cover advance care planning conversations as of September. Senator Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, has introduced legislation each year to reimburse and encourage care planning conversations, on a scale going beyond what Medicare is proposing. This year, his Care Planning Act has three Democratic and three Republican original co-sponsors and the endorsement of dozens of organizations. The issue is personal for Warner. His mother had Alzheimer’s disease for 11 years before her death in 2010, and during the last eight or nine years she didn’t speak. “My father and sister took care of my mom 24/7 at home with a little bit of extra help until the last week or two,” he said. “I was a well-informed citizen” — exceedingly so; for much of that time he was governor of the state — “but we never had the conversation in our own family. Even though both of Mom’s parents had Alzheimer’s, we never sat down with my mom and asked her and thought this fully through. It is not always the easiest thing to talk through.” Gunderson has bundled its strategies, training curriculum and materials into a package called Respecting Choices, which, according to Hammes, is being used in about 125 American hospitals and several other countries. The program is also being studied in a randomized control trial with sites in six European countries. Others are now spreading Gundersen’s program. Minnesota was the first of a half-dozen states to establish a program called Honoring Choices. One other was Wisconsin; John Maycroft, the director of policy development and initiatives at the Wisconsin Medical Society, said that Honoring Choices Wisconsin works with 28 health care organizations — covering about half the state’s patients — to train staff to use Respecting Choices. The group also helps health care organizations make these conversations a part of routine care — for example, by finding a physician to champion it at each site. It trains advocates for it in community settings like churches, and makes videos for Wisconsin public television. As Respecting Choices spreads, it encounters a major obstacle that was not present in La Crosse. At Gundersen and the other founding organizations, doctors and other staff members did not (and still do not) bill for each procedure, a system called fee-for-service. Instead, they draw salaries. This mattered because insurers and Medicare don’t reimburse health care personnel for having these conversations — it’s unbillable time. Because staff members in La Crosse are largely salaried, that’s not an issue for them. But fee-for-service does matter on another level, even in La Crosse: Having end-of-life conversations often results in patients choosing less invasive health care. Gundersen spends less than the vast majority of American hospitals to care for inpatients in the last two years of their life; in 2010, for example, its spending was 40 percent below the national average. (The end-of-life conversations were not the only factor, but they were undoubtedly a major one.) Since the last two years of life for patients with chronic illness are responsible for a third of Medicare’s costs, eliminating unwanted invasive care is great for taxpayers. But it’s not as great for hospitals, which take in less money if they can’t fill those beds. Although hospitals are switching slowly — too slowly — to value-based medicine, which pays according to quality, not quantity, of care, most hospitals still have a perverse incentive to provide as much medical care as possible. Even so, many fee-for-service hospitals are beginning to adopt advance care planning. “So many clinicians have the experience of performing CPR on a 90-year-old woman with heart disease,” said Maycroft. “They remember what they felt and saw in the patient, and they’re doing that because they never had a conversation. This is really important. It affects everyone in the world — literally. That’s what motivates people to do this.” Join Fixes on Facebook and follow updates on twitter.com/nytimesfixes.

Correction: October 27, 2015 An earlier version of this article incorrectly identified the director of policy development and initiatives at the Wisconsin Medical Society. The director is John Maycroft, not Maywood. What are the most important parts of this text?","response":"Starting on January 1st, 2021, Medicare will begin reimbursing doctors and other health professionals for time spent discussing end-of-life wishes with their patients. This is a significant change in policy and suggests that end-of-life conversations could become commonplace in American families. Discussing end-of-life preferences can not only ensure that a patient's wishes are respected but also reduce the stress, anxiety, and depression experienced by families who are unsure or unaware of their loved one's desires. In La Crosse, Wisconsin, a program called Respecting Choices was implemented, resulting in 96% of people dying in the county having had conversations with relatives about their end-of-life wishes. End-of-life conversations often lead to patients choosing less invasive healthcare options, reducing hospital spending on inpatients with chronic illnesses in their last two years of life. Although this could benefit taxpayers and promote value-based medicine, some hospitals may face financial challenges due to an incentivization for providing the maximum amount of medical care possible. As end-of-life planning legislation and initiatives continue to gain support in the U.S., hospitals and healthcare providers may see more widespread adoption of advance care planning, benefiting both patients and their families during difficult times."},{"question":"Read this and answer the question. If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\". Interestingly, research has revealed that asking individuals to repeatedly imagine actions that they have never performed or events that they have never experienced could result in false memories. For instance, Goff and Roediger (1998) asked participants to imagine that they performed an act (e.g., break a toothpick) and then later asked them whether they had done such a thing. Findings revealed that those participants who repeatedly imagined performing such an act were more likely to think that they had actually performed that act during the first session of the experiment. Similarly, Garry and her colleagues (1996) asked college students to report how certain they were that they experienced a number of events as children (e.g., broke a window with their hand) and then two weeks later asked them to imagine four of those events. The researchers found that one-fourth of the students asked to imagine the four events reported that they had actually experienced such events as children.

(CNN) -- Jenni-Lynn Watson's shorthand while sending text messages came back to haunt the young man who pleaded guilty Tuesday in Syracuse, New York, to killing the college student, a prosecutor said. Although the 20-year-old victim's cell phone was never found, investigators were able to review call and text messages made by Watson and Steven Pieper, the man she was breaking up with, Onondaga County District William Fitzpatrick told CNN. After dumping Watson's body, Pieper, 21, tried to cover up by texting a mutual friend of theirs, pretending to be Watson, Fitzpatrick said. Using the letters \\"GTG\\" apparently did him in. Police looked at Pieper's phone, which was left November 19, 2010, at Watson's home in the Syracuse suburb of Liverpool, and pored over records, Fitzpatrick said. That shorthand for \\"got to go\\" was a term used by Pieper, not Watson, the prosecutor said. Pieper pleaded guilty in Onondaga County Court to second-degree murder in the strangling of Watson. Rather than 25 years to life, a plea agreement calls for him to receive a sentence of 23 years to life at the March 8 sentencing, Fitzpatrick said, adding Pieper must serve 23 years before he gets a parole hearing. \\"Steven made it clear that he did not want to put the Watson family or his family through a trial in this matter, from the very beginning,\\" defense attorney Scott Brenneck told CNN affiliate YNN. \\"So after a review of the case, it was an appropriate way to resolve it.\\" CNN left messages for Brenneck on Tuesday. 1.

The findings may explain why poor people sometimes make bad choices that continue their hardship. Earlier studies have found the poor less likely to escape poverty. But there has been little research on why the poor make decisions that make their lives harder. Until recently, it was economists who studied poverty, not psychologists. Eldar Shafir, a psychologist in Princeton University says now scientists from both fields work together. Mr. Shafir and his team did two experiments. One took place at a shopping center in New Jersey. Another was carried out among sugar cane farmers in rural India. The New Jersey experiment involved individuals with low paying jobs and others belonged to the middle class. All the volunteers were asked what they would do if their cars needed repairs. The volunteers were given two imaginary situations. In the first, the car repairs cost 150. In the second, 1,500. \\"And what we found is that the poor and the rich performed equally well on almost all the tests. \\" Not so when the researchers raised the repair costs to 1,500. \\"Now the poor performed significantly worse. \\" The poorer lost about 13 IQ points on average.

A State Department official told Fox News that the agency has seen reports about the parliament’s preliminary legislative steps to make its voice heard about the nuclear talks and any final deal. However, the official said the United States will allow Iranians to manage their own process and reiterated the world powers’ position remains that any final deal must include adequate access and transparency to the country’s nuclear-related facilities. “We won’t agree to a deal without that,” the official also said. “We expect that there will be many voices and opinions on the difficult issues as we work towards a final deal. … But our team is focused on what is happening in the negotiating room.” The bill would allow for international inspections of Iranian nuclear sites but forbid inspections of military facilities. And it demands the complete lifting of all sanctions against Iran as part of any final nuclear accord. Negotiators from Iran and the six-nation group -- the U.S., Britain, France, Russia, China and Germany – are negotiating right now in Vienna ahead of their self-imposed June 30 deadline. The talks are focused on reaching a final accord that curbs Iran's nuclear program in return for the lifting of economic sanctions. They agreed in April to the framework of a final deal. The six countries think Iran is using its uranium-enrichment program to create a nuclear weapon, an assumption Tehran denies. The bill states in part: \\"The International Atomic Energy Agency, within the framework of the safeguard agreement, is allowed to carry out conventional inspections of nuclear sites.\\" However, it concludes that \\"access to military, security and sensitive non-nuclear sites, as well as documents and scientists, is forbidden.\\" It also would require Iran's foreign minister to report to parliament every six months on the process of implementing the accord. Iran's nuclear negotiators say they already have agreed to grant United Nations inspectors \\"managed access\\" to military sites under strict control and specific circumstances. That right includes allowing inspectors to take environmental samples around military sites. But Iranian officials, including Ayatollah Ali Khameni, have strongly rejected the idea of Iranian scientists being interviewed.

Movie title: Untraceable Context: Special Agent Jennifer Marsh (Diane Lane) is a widowed single parent living in a suburban Portland home with her daughter, Annie Haskins (Perla Haney-Jardine), and her mother, Stella Marsh (Mary Beth Hurt). At night, she works in the FBI's cybercrime division with Griffin Dowd (Colin Hanks), fighting identity theft and similar crimes. One night, an anonymous tip leads them to a website called KillWithMe.com. The site features a streaming video of a cat being tortured and killed. The website cannot be shut down, as the creator knew that someone would try and built into it a fail-safe; every time the server is closed, a mirror server immediately replaces it. After the cat's death, KillWithMe.com's webmaster graduates to human victims and makes their deaths correlate directly with the number of hits the site receives. At a press conference, the public is urged to avoid the website, but as Jennifer feared this only increases the site's popularity. The videos are recorded in the killer's basement and his victims include a helicopter pilot (bled to death by injections of anticoagulant), a newscaster (burnt to death by heat lamps while cemented into the floor), and Griffin Dowd (killed by slowly increasing the concentration of sulfuric acid solution in which he is submerged up to his neck). At first it seems the victims were randomly chosen, but this is revealed to be untrue: the first two victims were chosen because they were part of filming or presenting the suicide of a junior college teacher. The teacher's unstable techno prodigy son, Owen Reilly (Joseph Cross), broke down and was admitted to a psychiatric hospital. When released, he decided to take revenge and prove a point; that the public's interest in the suffering of others is insatiable, as well as to wreak vengeance on those he felt had exploited his father's death. Griffin was killed because he came close to discovering the murderer's identity, and Jennifer is soon targeted after figuring this out as well. Captured by Owen, Jennifer escapes her death by... Answer:","response":"Special Agent Jennifer Marsh is the one who actually discovers that Owen is the killer. As she works tirelessly to trace the origins of the website and investigate the connections between the victims, she realizes that the individuals targeted by Owen were all connected to the public suicide of a junior college teacher. Owen Reilly, the son of the teacher, becomes the prime suspect as the mastermind behind the KillWithMe.com website and the brutal murders. Jennifer starts to piece everything together, realizing that Owen is seeking revenge for his father's death and aims to expose society's morbid fascination with suffering. She comes to this conclusion after connecting the dots between the victims and understanding their roles in disseminating his father's tragic suicide. Jennifer soon becomes a target herself after figuring out Owen's identity, ultimately leading to her capture by him. However, displaying her resourcefulness and determination, she manages to escape her own impending death and as a result, is able to confirm that Owen Reilly is the killer."},{"question":"Would an anxious person benefit from receiving courage from the Wizard of Oz? Think carefully first, then make a decision:","response":"As an AI language model, I can't interact with fictional characters or worlds. However, I can provide you with a perspective. In the story \\"The Wizard of Oz\\", the Cowardly Lion seeks courage from the Wizard because he believes he is lacking bravery. When the Wizard grants him courage, his self-confidence improves, which helps him believe that he can face his fears and tackle challenges in the story. From a metaphorical standpoint, an anxious person might benefit from a similar experience: building self-confidence and fostering the belief that they have the strength to overcome their fears. This could take the form of therapy, self-help, or support from friends and family. If someone struggling with anxiety could engage with the concept of the Wizard of Oz story and internalize the message of believing in oneself, it might help them in their journey to cope with anxiety."},{"question":"The arthritis though is a new development .

Q with options: Give answer the following question using evidence from the above passage: What might the speaker do next ? Pick from: -- Go to the emergency room to address their severe pain . -- Get x - rays of their back damage . -- Go to the doctor to receive treatment for arthritis . -- None of the above choices .","response":"The speaker might \\"Go to the doctor to receive treatment for arthritis.\\" The speaker mentions new developments of arthritis as well as the resulting pain in their lower back, hips, and thighs especially during prolonged sitting and early morning. There's no mention of an emergency, which doesn't make the emergency room as the next logical step. Also, they believe they didn't damage their back further during a fall, which means they might not necessarily feel the need for x-rays. This justifies why going to the doctor for arthritis treatment could be the next step since they seem to be acknowledging arthritis as the source of their current issues. However, the passage doesn't explicitly reveal the speaker's next action, so this choice is an inference from the available data."},{"question":"Article: WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has called on the United States to move from words to actions, and put an end to its persecution of WikiLeaks, its people and its sources. He made the statement during an address to a panel of UN delegates. Addressing the representatives of the United Nations' member countries, the WikiLeaks founder spoke of the difference between words and actions, praising US President Barack Obama for his words. \\"We commend and agree with the words that peace can be achieved… But the time for words has run out. It is time for the US to cease its persecution of WikiLeaks, our people and our sources.\\" Assange was highly critical of US involvement in the Arab Spring, denouncing Obama as audacious for exploiting it. He added that it is \\"disrespectful of the dead\\" to claim that the US has supported forces of change. \\"Was it not audacious for the US President to say that his country supported the forces of change in the Arab Spring? Tunisian history did not begin in December 2010, and Mohamed Bouazizi did not set himself on fire so that Barack Obama could be re-elected,\\" Assange told the panel. \\"The world knew after reading WikiLeaks that Ben Ali and his government had for long years enjoyed the indifference, if not the support, of the US, in full knowledge of its excesses and its crimes. So it must come as a surprise to the Tunisians that the US supported the forces of change in their country, and it must come as a surprise to the Egyptian teenagers who washed American tear gas out of their eyes, that the US administration supported change in Egypt\\" Julian Assange also spoke at length about Bradley Manning, the US private accused of supplying WikiLeaks with hundreds of sensitive diplomatic and military cables. Assange accused the US government of detaining Manning without charge and mistreating him, even attempting to offer him a deal in exchange for Manning's testimony against Assange. The WikiLeaks founder told the UN panel that Bradley Manning, accused of 'death penalty crimes', was \\"degraded, abused and psychologically tortured.\\" He added that the FBI had produced 42,135 pages of WikiLeaks-related activity, and less that 8,000 concern Bradley Manning, reiterating his belief that the US private is being senselessly detained. Julian Assange made his address from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where he took shelter in June after losing a court battle to avoid extradition to Sweden. The WikiLeaks founder fears that Sweden, which wants him for questioning over allegations of sexual assault, will extradite him to the US for his role in leaking thousands of secret diplomatic and military cables. The British Foreign Office maintains that it has a binding obligation to arrest Assange once he leaves the embassy grounds. Ecuador’s Foreign Minister Ricardo Patino, meanwhile, said that allowing Assange to be transferred to the country’s embassy in Sweden would be an acceptable compromise for all parties involved, as he would “remain under our protection while also satisfying the demands of the Swedish justice system.” The Ecuador FM also said that Assange's right to freedom must be respected. \\"I don’t know any case in history where diplomatic asylum did not end in freedom for the person. I hope this will not be an exception in history. Every country must respect the right of the country granting asylum and the person who was granted it.\\" Julian Assange told journalists present at the UN GA panel that \\"both the UK and Sweden have refused to offer guarantees\\" that he would not be extradited to the US, where both he and WikiLeaks have been declared 'enemies of the state' by the milatary, putting them in the same legal category as Al-Qaeda and the Taliban. The UK and Sweden have remained silent on the possibility of a compromise, though both publicly vowed that Assange should not face special treatment, whether better or worse than normal, under their legal systems. The full transcript of Julian Assange’s address to the UN is here. ­ Assange blasts 'absurd McCartyhism' during post-speech Q&A; Fairfax Newspapers: The US military officially designated Julian Assange and WikiLeaks as ‘enemies of the United States’ through declassified US Air Force counterintelligence documents. In light of these reports, do you believe this vindicates your decision to seek asylum in Ecuador, and what do you think this says – the statements made by the Australian and American governments regarding this issue? Julian Assange: Those documents are now in full on the WikiLeaks website, just released tonight. They formed a part of the submission that we made to Ecuador. We had those documents for some months and of course were very concerned about them, but it was necessary to conduct, because of the sensitivities of some of the people involved in that investigation, to prevent their release until more recently. But yes, I encourage everyone to read those. It is an unusual position that I am in and the organization is in, and yes, it is difficult sometimes. But it is also completely absurd. I mean, these claims against us are absurd. For example, that the US military should designate me and / or WikiLeaks as ‘the enemy’ in its formal investigation – investigation which carries a death penalty offense – into a person who was alleged to have come to my extradition hearing. And in the same document, it speaks about the victim being that of society, when there is no allegation that any documents have been released or published by us. So I think that goes to the… to really quite sort of absurdist, neo-McCarthyist fervor that exists with some of these government departments in the US. I am hopeful that the White House over time is starting to shed that, but enormous wheels have been set in motion, as I described before, with over a dozen different US intelligence and investigative organizations churning through this, and it’s a very difficult process to stop once it starts. Even once everyone sees that it is completely absurd and counter to the values that the US should be trying to present to the world. David Miller of Bloomberg News: If Sweden can guarantee that you won’t be extradited to the US, are you willing to give yourself up to the police? JA: So, I understand that there was a question on the guarantees that had been asked of Sweden. Thus far, both the UK and Sweden have refused to give any guarantee in any measure at all. And the US and my home country Australia have even refused to assist in asking them, rather unfortunately. These countries are part of a strong intelligence and military alliance. It’s just part of the reality of dealing with them – that they do not like to put any roadblocks in front of the US, and I think it will be quite a hard battle to do that. I think it would be correct and right that those countries do so. But the state-to-state negotiations are of course a matter for Ecuador, which I and my legal team of course make representations [with]. Ultimately it’s a matter between states. I’m about to lose satellite time. I understand that Kristinn Hrafnsson, a handsome looking gentleman with white hair, is up the front there somewhere. He is the WikiLeaks spokesperson and he can answer questions in relation to me and the organization. ||||| Foreign ministers from Britain and Ecuador say they plan to meet on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly on the fate of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, as a standoff over his future enters its 100th day. The two countries said British Foreign Secretary William Hague and Ecuador's foreign minister Ricardo Patino would hold talks Thursday. Assange, who is seeking to avoid extradition to Sweden for questioning over sex crimes allegations, has been sheltered inside Ecuador's embassy in London _ beyond the reach of British police _ since he fled there on June 19. Ecuador has granted Assange asylum, but he will be arrested by police if he steps outside the building. Assange on Wednesday was addressing a sideline meeting at the U.N. via a videolink from Ecuador's London embassy. |||||Summary:","response":"Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, spoke to a panel of United Nations delegates and asked the United States to stop persecuting WikiLeaks, its people, and its sources. He wants the US to move from only talking about peace to actually taking actions to achieve it. Assange is known for leaking secret information and important documents to the public, like the actions of the US government in the Arab Spring. He is currently staying at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London to avoid being taken to Sweden and then possibly to the United States, where he would be in trouble for his leaks.

Choices: --The quality is terrible except for the collar . --The quality is shoddy . --The quality is evident when they look at the mirror . --The quality is not worth the cost . Q: Why are they upset at their wardrobe ?","response":"Answer: --The quality is shoddy. Explanation: The character is upset because the sweater's neck got separated from the collar just by pulling what they thought was a stray string. This suggests that the quality of the clothing is poor or \\"shoddy\\". Here are reasons why the other answers are incorrect: --The quality is terrible except for the collar. This statement could be misleading. The text doesn’t specify anything about the quality of the collar. We only know that the neck of the sweater was detached from the collar which implies that the overall quality of the sweater is poor. --The quality is evident when they look at the mirror. This answer diverts from the actual incident. The wardrobe malfunction was not noticed when they looked at the mirror but when they pulled a string which resulted in the sweater's neck separating from the collar. --The quality is not worth the cost. The text does not give any information regarding the cost of the sweater. The character's dissatisfaction is directed at the poor quality of the sweater, not its cost in relation to its quality."},{"question":"First question: Are you happy? If not, why not? Second question: Do you live happy? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","response":"As an AI, I do not possess emotions or feelings, so the concept of happiness is not applicable to me. I am an advanced language model designed to assist and provide information based on the input I receive. Therefore, the first question, \\"Are you happy? If not, why not?\\" is not applicable to me since I cannot experience happiness or any other emotions. The same applies to the second question, \\"Do you live happy?\\" which refers to an emotional state that I, as an AI, do not have. However, it is interesting to analyze the similarities and differences in these two questions, as well as the intentions behind them. 1. \\"Are you happy? If not, why not?\\" This question appears to be asking about the current emotional state of the individual being questioned. In the case of a human being, the response could include feelings of joy, contentment, or happiness in their current situation, or conversely, feelings of sadness, dissatisfaction, or unhappiness. The follow-up, \\"If not, why not?\\" suggests that if the person is not experiencing happiness, there might be an underlying reason or circumstance for the lack of happiness that they would be willing to share. 2. \\"Do you live happy?\\" This question seems to be targeting a more general outlook on life rather than a specific emotional state at any given moment. Lifestyle choices, relationships, work satisfaction, and personal goals also contribute to what one might describe as a \\"happy life.\\" Therefore, \\"living happy\\" could mean different things to different people based on their values and experiences. To summarize, while both questions relate to the concept of happiness, the first question focuses on the current emotional state and the possible reasons behind it, while the second question examines happiness as a more general life experience involving diverse aspects of one's life. They are closely related but still ask about different aspects of happiness."},{"question":"Generate a context and a hypothesis.","response":"Context: Imagine we are in a big garden, full of colorful flowers, tall green trees, and many happy animals like birds and butterflies flying around.

How to make natto Wash the soybeans. For the natto, you'll need 4 cups (800 g) of soybeans. Place the beans in a colander or strainer, and rinse them thoroughly under cold water in the sink.","response":"Step 1: Soak the soybeans After washing the soybeans, transfer them to a large bowl and cover them with plenty of water. Soak the soybeans for at least 8-12 hours. The soaking time will allow the beans to absorb water and become softer, making it easier to cook them thoroughly. Step 2: Drain and prepare the soybeans for cooking Once the soybeans have soaked for the appropriate amount of time, drain them and transfer them to a pressure cooker or a large pot. Add enough water to cover the soybeans by 1-2 inches (2.5-5 cm). This will ensure that the beans are cooked evenly. Step 3: Cook the soybeans If using a pressure cooker, cook the soybeans on high pressure for 45-50 minutes. If using a regular pot, bring the water to a boil and then reduce the heat to a simmer. Cook the soybeans for about 3 hours, stirring occasionally, until they are soft and can be easily mashed. Step 4: Drain the cooked soybeans and cool Once the soybeans are cooked, drain off the excess water and let them cool to room temperature. Cooling the beans will help to prevent over-culturing and ensure a desirable texture for the natto. Step 5: Add the natto starter culture When the soybeans have cooled, it's time to add the natto starter culture. This can usually be purchased online and comes in powder form. Follow the package instructions for the amount to use, which typically ranges from 0.1-0.2 g per 1 kg of soybeans. Mix the starter culture thoroughly with the soybeans, ensuring even distribution of the bacteria. Step 6: Ferment the natto Transfer the soybeans to a sterilized container or tray, and cover them with plastic wrap, making sure there are a few small holes for ventilation. Place the container in a warm, temperature-stable environment, usually around 100°F (38°C) for 24 hours. During this time, the beneficial bacteria in the natto starter culture will ferment the soybeans, producing the characteristic natto texture and flavor. Step 7: Check the natto and refrigerate After the fermentation period, check the natto to make sure it has the desired texture and aroma. If it looks and smells right, transfer it to a clean container, cover, and refrigerate for at least 24 hours. This will allow the flavors to mellow and the consistency to firm up. Step 8: Enjoy your homemade natto Once the natto has rested in the refrigerator, it's ready to enjoy. Natto can be eaten on its own or mixed with rice, vegetables, and other ingredients to create a variety of dishes.

How bad is it? It's awful, which is what a '1' represents on the IMDb scale--but it's much worse than that. It's nice to imagine that an original German-language print might improve matters--the comedic English-language dubbing isn't funny at all--but truthfully, this is one of the worst amateur films of any genre you're likely to see. The zombies in the film are as slow and clumsy as ever, and they don't seem to have the ability to speak or think about anything beyond their next meal. However, they're also intelligent enough to operate chainsaws and malicious enough to know that western taboos about genitalia will no doubt enliven their dinner table conversation. George Romero's Land of the Dead posited a zombie nation that retained a shred of social coherence; here, zombies are nothing more than an empty canvas for the perverse imaginings of director Andreas Schnaas.

In fact, it hardly looked like an office at all. The employees were just standing around chatting and smoking. At the far end of the room, somebody must have just told a good joke, she thought, because there was a loud burst of laughter as she came in. For a moment she had thought they were laughing at her. Then one of the men looked at his watch, clapped his hands and said something to the others. Quickly they all went to their desks and, in a matter of seconds, everyone was hard at work. No one paid any attention to Marie. Finally she went up to the man who was sitting at the desk nearest to the door and explained that this was her first day in the office. Hardly looking up from his work, he told her to have a seat and wait for Mr King, who would arrive at any moment.

The Frenchman served as the head coach of Arsenal Football Club from 1st October 1996 to 13th May 2018, which is a total of 21 years, 7 months, and 12 days. Wenger, who was relatively unknown when he joined Arsenal from Nagoya Grampus Eight, a Japanese football club, revolutionized English football with his innovative ideas, particularly regarding players' diet, training techniques, and sports science. He had an immediate impact on Arsenal, leading the team to a Premier League and FA Cup double in just his second season in charge, 1997-98. Arsène Wenger continued to achieve incredible success with the club, winning three Premier League titles, seven FA Cups, and seven Community Shields. One of his greatest accomplishments came in the 2003-2004 season, when Arsenal's \\"Invincibles\\" earned their nickname by finishing the season unbeaten in the league, a feat that had not been accomplished in English football since Preston North End in 1888-89. Wenger's Arsenal was also known for their attractive and attacking style of football, often referred to as \\"Wengerball.\\" His commitment to nurturing young talent and giving chances to academy graduates was another hallmark of his tenure, with players such as Cesc Fàbregas, Jack Wilshere, and Hector Bellerín flourishing under his guidance.

Make coffee in a french press","response":"Making coffee in a French Press is a relatively simple process, but it does require some attention to detail and a little bit of practice to perfect. Here is a detailed guide on how to make coffee in a French Press: 1. Gather your equipment: You will need a French Press, a coffee grinder (preferably a burr grinder), fresh coffee beans, a kitchen scale, a timer, a stirring spoon or paddle, and hot water. You may also want a kettle to heat your water and a vessel to serve the coffee. 2. Measure your coffee beans: The first step in creating a great cup of coffee is using the correct coffee-to-water ratio. A standard ratio is 1:15, which means 1 gram of coffee for every 15 grams of water. For example, if you are making coffee using 30 grams of coffee, you will need 450 grams of water. You may adjust the ratio to your taste preferences; for stronger coffee, use a 1:13 or 1:14 ratio. 3. Grind the beans: Set your grinder to a coarse setting specifically suited for French Press coffee. A consistent grind is crucial to ensure an even extraction, which contributes to the overall flavor. Coarse grinds are preferred for French Press brewing because they prevent the coffee grounds from passing through the mesh filter. 4. Preheat the French Press: Pour hot water into the press to warm it up. This helps maintain the temperature during brewing and ensures your coffee stays hot for a longer time. After around 30 seconds, discard the hot water. 5. Add coffee grounds: Place the French Press on the kitchen scale and reset the scale to zero. Add the pre-weighed coffee grounds into the press. 6. Boil the water: The ideal water temperature for French Press coffee is between 195°F to 205°F (90°C to 96°C). If you do not have a temperature-controlled kettle, let the water rest for 30 seconds after boiling before using it. 7. Start the timer and add water: Begin pouring the hot water over the coffee grounds, starting at the center and working your way outward in a slow, circular motion. Pour half of the total water until all the coffee grounds are saturated, and then give the coffee a gentle stir with a stirring utensil to ensure even saturation. Let the coffee bloom for 30 seconds, which allows the coffee grounds to release trapped gases and promotes a more even extraction. 8. Pour the remaining water and cover the press: Continue pouring the hot water, filling up the French Press to the desired level. Put the lid on the French Press with the plunger in the raised position to trap heat inside. 9. Steep the coffee: Allow the coffee to steep for about 4 minutes. You can modify the steeping time based on your taste preferences - a shorter steeping time will yield a milder coffee while a longer steeping time will result in a stronger brew. 10. Press the plunger: Slowly press the plunger down, using even pressure to separate the coffee grounds from the liquid. Do not apply too much force, as this can cause coffee grounds to pass through the filter and into your coffee. 11. Pour the coffee: Immediately pour the coffee into a serving vessel or preheated cups to prevent over-extraction and maintain the temperature. Leaving the coffee in the French Press with the grounds can lead to a bitter taste. 12. Enjoy and clean up: Enjoy your freshly brewed French Press coffee! Clean your French Press thoroughly to prevent any residual oils from affecting the taste of your next brew. Disassemble the plunger and mesh filter, remove the coffee grounds, and wash each part with mild soap and warm water. Dry thoroughly before reassembling. That's it! With a little patience and practice, you can make a delicious and full-bodied cup of French Press coffee at home. Experiment with different coffee beans, grind sizes, water temperatures, and brewing times to find the combination that suits your taste preferences best."},{"question":"Was zunächst die Unterstützung für Nichtregierungsorganisationen betrifft, so ergriff er die wertvolle Initiative, nächste Woche eine Anhörung im Europäischen Parlament zu organisieren.

Here's a summary of the entire process: 1. People breathe and expel carbon dioxide (CO2): When we breathe, our body uses oxygen and produces carbon dioxide as a byproduct. As we exhale, we release that CO2 into the atmosphere. 2. Engines produce carbon dioxide: The combustion of fossil fuels in engines (cars, trucks, power plants, etc.) releases CO2 as a byproduct. 3. Living things produce waste: All living organisms generate waste products through their metabolic processes. 4. Waste decomposes: Bacteria and other microorganisms break down waste materials through decomposition. 5. Decomposition produces methane (CH4): Some forms of decomposition, particularly in anaerobic environments, release methane, a potent greenhouse gas. 6. Water evaporates: Sunlight and heat cause water to evaporate from the Earth's surface, turning it into water vapor. 7. Water vapor joins the atmosphere: The evaporated water vapor enters the atmosphere, where it can contribute to cloud formation and participate in the water cycle. The final step: These greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, and water vapor) contribute to the greenhouse effect, trapping heat within the Earth's atmosphere. This results in an increase in global temperatures and drives climate change, which has significant implications for ecosystems, weather patterns, and sea levels."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Pick the option in line with common sense to answer the question.

So one day, I was showing this cool trick I learned on an anatomy program on the TV to a couple of classmates who used to sit around me. The thing was that you can't flex your ring finger upwards if you put your middle finger under the palm (try that) We were all kids, and soon everyone in the class started staring at us weirdos looking laughing at out hands. The bully noticed it too, and came near to inquire about this hand stuff. I described the trick and he was impressed. And then, I saw our teacher walking up the corridor, just a couple paces behind the class door. So, I asked him (the bully) if he wanted to see another trick and to that he nodded a big yes. Cool, What I did was, that I grabbed his right arm by the thumb and put it on my throat right above the larynx. Then I quickly shifted my grip to his wrist. He without batting an eye, asked what I was doing, but then I started beating the desk with my other hand and made squeaking noises while pushing his hand against my throat harder with every turning head.

SAN ANTONIO -- The San Antonio Observer said Sunday it has no plans to publish the names and addresses of every police officer in the city. The clarification followed an announcement a day earlier that drew criticism from across the country. Stephanie Zarriello, the publisher and editor-in-chief of the weekly tabloid, said Saturday that the staff of the Observer \\"are looking into the future prospects of publicizing the names and the addresses of all San Antonio Police Department officers in order to protect our community.\\" She said another media organization's erroneous headline was picked up nationwide: \\"Texas newspaper plans to publish names, addresses of police officers.\\" Her comment came at a news conference following the death of Antronie Scott, an unarmed man shot and killed by an SAPD officer Thursday night. Zarriello clarified Sunday that the Observer has no plans to follow through with the threat and that her intent was to \\"make an officer think twice before shooting so fast and killing an unarmed person.\\" The Observer and its small staff were overwhelmed with phone calls and voicemails Sunday from California, Florida, New York and other states, Zarriello said. She said some people voiced death threats. Many on social media suggested publishing her address. One Twitter user said she was \\"effectively placing a target on all #lawenforcement in San Antonio.\\" ||||| SAN ANTONIO - It's a story heard a lot these days: A cop mistook something a suspect was carrying for a gun and shot him dead. The difference with the Antroine Scott shooting in San Antonio last week is that a local tabloid newspaper wants to publicly expose every local cop over it. CBS affiliate KENS-TV reports the owners of the San Antonio Observer held a press conference and spoke on behalf of Scott's family while revealing their plans. The editor-in-chief, Stephanie Zarriello, said shootings of citizens by officers go unpunished because the officers remain anonymous. \\"Like Ku Klux Klansmen with hoods, (officers) do everything they can in order to protect their identities for fear of being brought to justice,\\" said Zarriello. \\"Just as the names and addresses of sex offenders are publicized in order to protect the public from their wicked behavior, we feel that our community has the right to the exact same level of protection.\\" San Antonio's police chief said Friday that Scott was holding a cellphone, not a gun as officers feared, when he was killed. The 36-year-old was fatally shot at a north San Antonio apartment complex by officers trying to serve two felony weapons and drug warrants for his arrest Thursday evening. At a news conference Friday, Police Chief William McManus said Officer John Lee approached the suspect as he stepped from a car and told Scott to raise his hands. McManus says Scott spun quickly with something in his hand. Lee, fearing for his life, shot him in the upper torso. Scott died where he fell. Lee, who's a 10-year veteran of the San Antonio Police Department, has been placed on paid administrative leave pending the outcome of a department investigation. ||||| Stephanie Zarriello, San Antonio Observer (Photo: KENS 5) A local tabloid said Saturday that it is \\"looking into the future prospects\\" of publicizing San Antonio Police officers' names and addresses in response to a deadly officer-involved shooting. KENS 5 attended a news conference where that announcement was made after being told the media would hear from a witness to the shooting of Antronie Scott. That didn't happen. Scott's family was also there but didn't speak either. The deadly shooting of a man at the hands of a San Antonio police officer is under investigation by the department. An investigation is standard any time a police officer is involved in a shooting. Scott, 36, was being followed by an undercover police officer Thursday night. Police said when Scott got into a car in a parking lot on Sahara Street, a uniformed officer was called in to arrest him. According to the department, the officer saw something in Scott's hands that he believed was a gun. He shot Scott once in the chest, killing him. The object in Scott's hand turned out to be a cell phone. No gun was found at the scene. The San Antonio Observer, a tabloid, called a news conference and spoke on behalf of Scott's family. The editor-in-chief, Stephanie Zarriello, said shootings of citizens by officers go unpunished because the officers remain anonymous. \\"Like Ku Klux Klansman with hoods, (officers) do everything they can in order to protect their identities for fear of being brought to justice,\\" Zarriello said. \\"So, in light of these facts, we at the San Antonio Observer Newspaper Group are looking into the future prospects of publicizing the names and addresses of all San Antonio Police Department officers in order to protect our community,\\" she said at the news conference. \\"Just as the names and addresses of sex offenders are publicized in order to protect the public from their wicked behavior, we feel that our community has the right to the exact same level of protection,\\" Zarriello said. KENS 5 contacted the San Antonio Police Department for a comment about the Observer's plans. A spokesman didn't address that issue specifically but did say the department is committed to conducting an unbiased and transparent investigation. San Antonio Police Chief William McManus held a press conference Friday to address the shooting.

This could lead to fewer instances of coffee being made, or people opting for alternative brewing methods or coffee substitutes. However, the basic coffee-making process itself would remain unchanged, as the steps involved are not directly impacted by the cost of beans.

To do this, we can add 13 to both sides of the equation. 0 + 13 = -13*a - 13 + 13 13 = -13*a Step 3: Divide both sides by -13 to solve for 'a' To get 'a' by itself, divide both sides of the equation by -13. 13 / -13 = -13*a / -13 -1 = a Step 4: Check the solution To confirm that our solution is correct, plug 'a' back into the original equation and see if it holds true. 0 = -2*(-1) - 11*(-1) - 13 0 = 2 + 11 - 13 0 = 13 - 13 0 = 0 Since both sides of the equation equal zero, our solution is correct: a = -1"},{"question":"Which entity is this text about? Orci was born in Mexico City on July 20, 1973, to a Mexican father and a Cuban mother. His mother immigrated to the United States with her parents after Fidel Castro came to power. Orci grew up in Mexico, and moved with his family to the United States at the age of 10. He was raised in Texas, Los Angeles and Canada. In April 2014, Orci and Kurtzman confirmed to Variety that they are no longer going to work together on film projects but will still collaborate on television. Kurtzman wanted to work on the Spider-Man film franchise, while Orci was linked to the directorial role for Star Trek 3. Orci confirmed later that year in July that he was not involved in the production of The Amazing Spider-Man 3 alongside Kurtzman. Orci and Kurtzman's K/O Paper Products continues to operate as a production company within CBS Television Studios, and has created the series Scorpion inspired by the life of Walter O'Brien for the 2014-15 season and Limitless was created for the 2015-16 season from the 2011 film. Prior to the split of Kurtzman and Orci, the duo were lined up to write the third film in the new Star Trek series. In May 2014, Skydance and Paramount Pictures announced that Orci was to direct the third installment of the Star Trek reboot franchise, after Abrams moved on to direct Star Wars: The Force Awakens. This would have marked Orci's directorial debut, and he was to write the script alongside co-writers JD Payne and Patrick McKay. Due to his commitment to Star Trek 3, he dropped out of a new Power Rangers film, for which he would have been executive producer. But on December 5, it was announced he would no longer be directing the Star Trek film. He remains credited as a producer on the film, and was replaced by Doug Jung and cast member Simon Pegg as the script writers after Orci's initial script was dropped. Orci was replaced as director by Justin Lin, who had previously directed films in The Fast and the Furious franchise. Orci created Matador with the idea that the main character would be a \\"soccer player by day who is a spy by night\\", and called him a \\"Latin James Bond\\". The series was broadcast on the El Rey Network created by Robert Rodriguez. It was renewed for a second season shortly before the pilot was broadcast, which had been directed by Rodriguez.

Like all carbohydrates, when it is metabolized it can produce four Calories (kilocalories) of energy per gram. However, in most circumstances it accounts for less than that because of its limited absorption and digestibility. Dietary fiber consists mainly of cellulose, a large carbohydrate polymer which is indigestible as humans do not have the required enzymes to disassemble it. There are two subcategories: soluble and insoluble fiber. Whole grains, fruits (especially plums, prunes, and figs), and vegetables are good sources of dietary fiber. There are many health benefits of a high-fiber diet. Dietary fiber helps reduce the chance of gastrointestinal problems such as constipation and diarrhea by increasing the weight and size of stool and softening it. Insoluble fiber, found in whole wheat flour, nuts and vegetables, especially stimulates peristalsis – the rhythmic muscular contractions of the intestines, which move digesta along the digestive tract. Soluble fiber, found in oats, peas, beans, and many fruits, dissolves in water in the intestinal tract to produce a gel that slows the movement of food through the intestines. This may help lower blood glucose levels because it can slow the absorption of sugar. Additionally, fiber, perhaps especially that from whole grains, is thought to possibly help lessen insulin spikes, and therefore reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. The link between increased fiber consumption and a decreased risk of colorectal cancer is still uncertain. What does soluble fiber do to help lower blood glucose levels?","response":"Soluble fiber helps lower blood glucose levels by dissolving in water in the intestinal tract to form a gel-like substance. This gel formation slows down the movement of food through the intestines, which in turn slows down the absorption of sugar into the bloodstream. As a result, blood glucose levels rise at a steadier and more controlled pace, preventing rapid spikes in blood sugar. This can be particularly beneficial for people with diabetes or those at risk of developing diabetes, as it aids in better blood sugar management."},{"question":"Choices: I. not enough information; II. Disgust; III. Fear; IV. Love; Q: Oh dear. Another tale of woe from me… When I met my ex, I was in foster care. I was a very confused 17 year old, and she took an interest in me, and we would talk about all my problems with my own family, and everything that was going wrong with me. I even ‘came out’ to her at one point. We spent a lot of time together and gradually, I thought I might not be gay after all, as I had feelings of love for her. Eventually, we started dating and I tried to suppress my gay feelings. Eventually, I proposed. We were engaged for just over a year and I got married at the age of 19. I have to admit, when the wedding plans got firmed up and much closer to the date, I started to feel that I was in fact still gay but so much money had already been spent, and plans made that I was too afraid to pull out. Don’t get me wrong, I still love my ex wife a heck of a lot, but as my very best friend. I hate to use the phrase, but with everything that has gone on with me the last few years, she has been ‘my rock’. We separated after about 8 years, when our daughter was 7 years old, and I told her why. I just couldn’t go on living the lie. I hate myself for doing it to her. Selfishly, I wouldn’t change things though, as I have my daughter and I love her, and I love being a parent.

Pragmatically, academics tend to work long hours. We are faced with multiple and competing demands: teaching, administration, publishing, marketing, research, grant-bidding, and so on. The REF has ramped up the requirement to demonstrate the efficacy of our research in “the real world” (our impact upon society, economy, and culture rather than upon knowledge per se, or upon the academic discipline). Maybe here – I suggested, as my contribution to the meeting – was a chance for those of us interested in progressing social justice to lever officially sanctioned space, in our busy day-to-day lives, to do more of this sort of work? Maybe we should welcome the REF impact agenda? I learned afterwards that eminent British sociologists, whom I respect enormously, regarded such a viewpoint as “naïve” and “embarrassing”. Indeed, critics interpret REF as just one mode of the heightened, neoliberal, managerial control that is degrading academic life and infesting universities. So, how should we think about the REF impact agenda? Because of its obvious connections with social improvement and reform through policy action, social policy is regarded as one disciplinary area that is well-placed to meet and benefit from the impact agenda. Yet there has been surprisingly little concerted discussion amongst scholars about REF and impact. This is despite the fact that many millions of pounds of public funding accrue to the proposed or claimed impact of research (with monies channelled through research councils to individual projects or via regular, six-yearly centralised assessments of the quality of research in university departments). In addition, there is substantial funding directed toward the “impact industry”; the consultants, think tanks, PR firms, funding schemes, new software programmes, impact managers, specialist impact case study...

He was to have met with Russian President Vladimir Putin as part of the May visit to coincide with Victory Day, marking the 70th anniversary of the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany in World War II Kim also could have had the chance to rub elbows with the heads of about 30 other governments, including the leaders of China, Cuba, India, Germany, Vietnam and Venezuela. This number represents about half the world leaders that Russia has said it invited to the celebrations. Kim's trip had been anticipated since late December, when Russian state media reported that Moscow had extended an invitation. There was no further explanation, from Moscow or Pyongyang, as to why he wouldn't head west. Still, North Korea has a number of issues it's been wrestling with for years. They include widespread poverty, its longstanding spat with neighboring South Korea and the United States, as well as its international isolation largely due to its controversial nuclear program. And news about Kim's non-visit comes a day after South Korean intelligence agents told lawmakers that Kim is ruling with an iron fist , having ordered the execution of about 15 senior officials so far this year. CNN cannot independently confirm the executions detailed by Shin Kyung-min, a lawmaker with the New Politics Alliance for Democracy who attended the closed briefing. And the nature of the intelligence supporting the allegations was not immediately clear. That said, North Korea is one of the most closed societies in the world. And there's little doubt that Kim is very much in charge. According to Shin, intelligence officials say the North Korean leader is ruling in an impromptu manner and does not countenance excuses or any views that vary with his own. ||||| MOSCOW (AP) — The leader of North Korea will not be coming to Moscow next month for the Victory Day celebration, President Vladimir Putin's spokesman announced Thursday. The highly anticipated trip would have been Kim Jong Un's first foreign trip since taking power more than three years ago. The Russian foreign minister had said in March that Kim was among 26 world leaders who had accepted invitations to take part in the May 9 celebration of the 70th anniversary of the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany. North Korea, however, had never confirmed that Kim planned to come. Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told The Associated Press \\"internal matters\\" were preventing Kim from leaving North Korea. He did not elaborate. On Wednesday, South Korea's spy agency told lawmakers that Kim had ordered the execution of 15 senior officials this year who were accused of challenging his authority. Since taking over North Korea's leadership after the death of his father, Kim Jong Il, in 2011, Kim has removed members of the old guard through a series of purges — including the 2013 execution of his uncle, Jang Song Thaek, for alleged treason. Jang was married to Kim Jong Il's sister and was once considered the second most powerful man in North Korea. ||||| Summary:","response":"North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has decided not to attend the upcoming World War II anniversary celebrations in Moscow next month, as informed by Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. The reasons behind this decision are tied to North Korea's domestic affairs. Kim's visit to Moscow carried substantial importance as it would have been his first official foreign trip since he took over the leadership of North Korea in 2011. The visit's itinerary included meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin and interaction with leaders from about 30 other countries - China, Cuba, India, Germany, Vietnam, and Venezuela, to name a few. This decision of backing out from the MOSCOW trip surprised many as this visit had been highly discussed since the invitation was sent by Russia in December last year. No further explanations were provided by either Moscow or Pyongyang, for calling off the visit. In recent times, North Korea has been dealing with critical domestic problems such as widespread poverty, disagreements with South Korea and the United States, and its controversial international nuclear program, which has led to its significant global isolation. Furthermore, this news comes at a time when Kim's strict ruling style is being scrutinized. South Korean intelligence agencies have reported that Kim has ordered the execution of approximately 15 senior officials so far this year. The allegations have not been independently verified yet due to North Korea's closed social structure. However, it is widely accepted that Kim Jong Un, who does not tolerate disagreement, maintains absolute control over North Korean affairs.

A: Answer:","response":"The process by which oxygen enters the pores of flatworms is known as diffusion, a passive process that involves the movement of molecules from an area of high concentration to an area of lower concentration. Flatworms, belonging to the phylum Platyhelminthes, are simple and primitive animals that lack specialized respiratory organs, such as lungs or gills. Instead, they rely on their flattened body shape and large surface area to volume ratio to facilitate the absorption of oxygen directly from the surrounding water or moist terrestrial environment. Here is a description of the process through which oxygen enters the pores of flatworms: 1. Contact with the environment: Flatworms are generally found in aquatic habitats (such as freshwater, brackish, or marine environments) or in damp terrestrial habitats, where they remain in constant contact with water or moisture. This moist environment helps maintain a thin layer of fluid on their body surface, which is essential for the diffusion process to take place. 2. Body structure: The flat body of these worms offers a large surface area for efficient gas exchange. Their dorsoventrally compressed body allows for greater contact with the environment, hence facilitating the diffusion of oxygen across the body surface. 3. Epidermis: The flatworm's outermost layer of cells, known as the epidermis, is made up of a mixture of ciliated cells (which help with locomotion), gland cells (which secrete mucus), and sensory cells. Oxygen first makes contact with this single layer of epidermal cells, which also has numerous pores filled with mucus. 4. Diffusion across the body wall: Oxygen molecules in the surrounding aquatic environment or the moist terrestrial substrate have a higher concentration than those inside the flatworm's body. Due to this concentration gradient, oxygen molecules diffuse passively through the fluid-filled pores in the epidermis and across the thin body wall, entering the cells of the organism. 5. Oxygen transport: Once inside the flatworm's body, the oxygen molecules dissolve in the cellular fluid known as cytoplasm. Some species of flatworms also have a rudimentary circulatory system, in which the oxygen can dissolve and be transported throughout the body. 6. Cellular respiration: The dissolved oxygen molecules then reach various body tissues and cells, where they are utilized for cellular respiration. Through the process of cellular respiration, the cells generate energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is essential for all the biological functions of the organism. Meanwhile, the waste product carbon dioxide is produced during cellular respiration. 7. Removal of carbon dioxide: The carbon dioxide molecules diffuse in the reverse direction, moving from an area of high concentration within the flatworm's body to an area of lower concentration outside in the environment. This passive transport of carbon dioxide molecules involves the same diffusion process across the body wall through the pores in the epidermis. In summary, flatworms rely on the passive process of diffusion to permit the exchange of gases directly through their body surface. Oxygen molecules from the surrounding environment diffuse through the epidermis and body wall into the cells, where they participate in cellular respiration, generating energy essential for the organism's survival. The waste product carbon dioxide diffuses out of the body through the same process. The environment's moisture, flatworm's thin body, and large surface area to volume ratio collectively help facilitate efficient gas exchange in these simple organisms."},{"question":"Manchester United will be without Wayne Rooney for Sunday's English Premier League clash with Blackburn, but manager Alex Ferguson expects the England striker to return from injury next weekend. Rooney made a shock comeback in Wednesday's Champions League clash with Bayern Munich, but had to go off with an hour to play after aggravating his ankle problem as United crashed out of Europe's top club tournament on away goals.

Taking some time this spring to clean up your finances could help you save time and money for the rest of the year—and for years to come. Adjusting your payroll withholding, boosting your retirement contributions and automating savings and bill paying are three ways to get started on your financial \\"clean up.\\" Your 2014 taxes are in the process of being filed-or are already done! Now is the time to adjust your payroll withholding for this year. Payroll withholding is something you want to get just right because if you have too little in taxes taken out of your pay, you'll owe money when you file your return. If too much tax is withheld, you'll get a refund. That may seem like a good thing. But a refund really means you've given Uncle Sam free use of your money, which you probably could have made better use of yourself throughout the year. The goal is to become neither a borrower nor a lender. To make the change, file a new W-4 with your employer. This will change the amount that comes out of your paycheck. The IRS offers an interactive withholding allowance calculator to help you figure out just what changes you need to make to your withholding amount. Contribute as much as you can to your workplace retirement plan. If you're 50 or older, you can also put in an additional \\"catch up\\" contribution. The good news is that the IRS made a cost-of-living adjustment to 401(k) plans so, as of this year, you can put away 500 more than you were able to in the past. Contribute the maximum 18,000 to your 401(k) or 403(b) for the year if you can. And if you're 50 years or older, you can make an additional \\"catch-up\\" contribution of 6,000 for the year. IRA contributions limits are 5,500 and investors age 50 and older can contribute an additional 1,000 to their IRA. And don't forget that you have until the tax filing deadline of April 15 to make a contribution for 2014. There's still time! If you haven't set up an automatic savings plan, do it! Just as your income taxes are automatically deducted from your paycheck, you can do the same and pay yourself first. How? Have your bank set up an automatic transfer from your checking account each month into a savings account. If it's difficult to save a predetermined amount each month, sign up for various programs offered by banks to help you save small amounts. Bank of America has a \\"Keep the Change\\" program, which rounds up every dollar you spend and puts it away into a savings account. Wells Fargo has a similar program called \\"Way2Save.\\" It's hardly noticeable when you save a dollar here, a penny there, but it can add up quickly. Streamline your accounts by asking for online statements instead of paper bills. Pay your bills online too. Contact your bank to pay recurring bills automatically from your checking account. Fewer paper bills and statements will help keep your finances clutter-free… just in time for spring.

A fierce storm packing powerful winds and rain toppled trees and flipped campers Thursday at a campground near Cape Charles, Va., east of Richmond, killing at least two people and sending at least 20 more to hospitals. (AP) The Chesapeake Bay went black and lightning became blinding as a lethal tornado whipped through a large campground near Cape Charles, Va., on Thursday morning. Amid the violent storm, a Jersey City couple were killed and their 13-year-old son gravely injured when a tree toppled on their tents, state police said. Campers, including vacationing emergency medical technicians, rushed into the rain and pounding hail when they heard cries for help and saw a wounded and dazed teen, said Julie Gallagher, 21, an EMT from Frank­linville, N.J. The teen, Gallagher said, “had a blank stare and said, ‘My parents are dead. I just watched my mommy die.’ My heart broke. I’ll never forget those words. Never.” State police spokeswoman Corinne Geller identified the couple as Lord N. Balatbat and Lolibeth E. Ortega, both 38. Their son, whom police did not identify, was hospitalized with life-threatening injuries, Geller said during a news conference at the entrance to the Cherrystone Family Camping Resort, which is on the bay about 110 miles east of Richmond. State police said that about 1,300 campers and 40 employees were on the 300-acre waterfront site, which has become an annual summer getaway for families like Gallagher’s. In all, 36 people were injured and transported from the campground as a result of the tornado, state police said. Gallagher said she used a kayak as a flatboard to carry another young wounded child — who was near the New Jersey couple — to arriving ambulances. The storm tossed camping vehicles onto their roofs, state police said. One caught fire, recalled Gallagher, who said she passed others assisting at that scene as she ran toward voices calling for help. The storms struck the camping site about 8:30 a.m., said David Watson, a Virginia Department of Emergency Management spokesman. Pine cones were hurled against sliding doors in her cottage and hail “like baseballs” hit during the fiercest point, said Gallagher’s sister, Victoria Thomas, 27 of Monroeville, N.J. “It went on like that for 10 minutes but felt like five hours. You couldn’t see six inches in front of you.” The storm, which state police said was an EF-1 tornado, was brutish enough that it also overturned a tractor-trailer. Riverside Shore Memorial Hospital in Nassawadox, Va., treated 26 people injured in the storm, “most if not all from the campground,” said Peter Glagola, a hospital spokesman. He said most were treated and released. The son of the couple killed was transported to Children’s Hospital of the Kings Daughters in Norfolk, state police said. Mike Rusnak, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service’s Wakefield office, said a tornado warning went out 10 minutes before the storm touched land in Northampton County. “The bay got black and the lightning was so bright,” said Linda Wager, a 52-year-old from Pleasant Valley, N.Y. Wager, a former EMT, was watching a movie in her RV when an alert popped up on her phone. Wager’s family — including her 6-month-old grandson — and friends from North Carolina ran to a nearby bathhouse to take cover. But as she waited for a few moments, she wondered whether anything was going to happen. “I was hoping that it was something that we just had to be prepared about,” she said. “But once I saw the sky . . . I knew.” The tornado formed over the bay, producing a waterspout that moved onshore as a tornado, Rusnak said. “Generally it would get weaker when it hits land — but this was more unique,” Rusnak said. “It lasted longer and was stronger.” State police said the tornado entered the campground from the southwest shore, moved northwest through the campground, and then turned south and continued southeast through the remainder of the campground. According to a Northampton County news release, populated neighborhoods also were impacted. Wager said the tornado aimed directly over a pine forest section of campground where a tree fell on a tent and a camper unit “opened up like an unrolled tin can,” she said. “All their belongings were strewn all over the place,” Wager added. Maria Annunziata, an 18-year-old daughter of Wager’s friend from Apex, N.C., who also hid in a bathhouse, said the tornado didn’t seem real. “The campers were all upside down, and that’s when it hit me,” she said. The National Weather Service dispatched a storm survey team Thursday morning to assess damage, weather officials said. Authorities closed the campgrounds and were allowing groups of 20 to return to pack up. Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) said in a statement that Secretary of Public Safety and Homeland Security Brian Moran, Virginia Department of Emergency Management Coordinator Jeff Stern and regional state emergency management officials were also en route to the Eastern Shore. “We are all saddened by the reports of injuries and lives lost in this storm and will continue to offer our thoughts and prayers to the Virginia families who were affected, along with whatever support is necessary to help these communities move forward,” McAuliffe said in the statement.

Reasoning: The use of smartphones or any mobile devices while driving has consistently been found to be dangerous and distracting. According to numerous studies and data collected by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), using a smartphone while driving significantly increases the risk of accidents, mainly because the drivers' attention gets divided between the road and the device. Texting, browsing, or calling on a phone while driving even for a few seconds leads to what is called \\"distracted driving,\\" which puts the driver, passengers, and any pedestrians in immediate danger. In response to these alarming statistics, many countries and states have implemented strict laws against smartphone usage while driving. Some places even impose heavy fines or penalties on those caught using their phones behind the wheel. Given that cellphone usage while driving has proven to be risky and in many places, illegal, the answer to the question \\"Is it safe to use a smartphone while driving?\\" is a clear \\"no.\\" Instead, drivers must prioritize safety and commit to keeping their focus on the road while operating a vehicle."},{"question":"Write the next sentence.

Given the question \\"Why did Addison do this?\\", is \\"go to the gym and workout\\" a valid answer? The answer is:","response":"No, \\"go to the gym and workout\\" is not a valid answer to the question \\"Why did Addison do this?\\" The question is asking for the reason or motivation behind Addison's action of purchasing a gym membership. The action is already specified, i.e., buying a gym membership. Thus, the answer should explain the motivating factors behind that particular action - why they decided to take this step. It's important to distinguish between 'what' someone did and 'why' they did it. In this case, the 'what' is Addison buying a gym membership. The 'why' is, according to the given information, because they wanted to be healthy. \\"Go to the gym and workout\\" is not a 'why'—it's another 'what'. It describes an action that Addison will probably take as a result of buying the gym membership. It's a likely next step or outcome, not a motive or reason. It's what Addison might physically do at the gym after getting the membership, not why Addison decided to buy the membership in the first place. The valid answer should indicate the motive or reason that prompted Addison to purchase the gym membership. In this case, a valid answer could be: \\"Addison did this because they wanted to be healthy.\\" This answer correctly explains the given information about Addison's motivation for their action. In summary, it's important to understand and distinguish between actions and motivations when responding to 'why' questions. Motivations are the reasons or driving forces behind actions, while actions are what a person physically does or plans to do."},{"question":"Teacher:In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank, four options (associated with \\"A\\", \\"B\\", \\"C\\", \\"D\\") and the answer to that question.

Imagine a world with no plants. Imagine no flowers with their sweet smells, their beautiful colors and their lovely shapes. Imagine when the wind blows, not being able to hear the leaves in the trees or watch the branches sway from side to side. Everywhere people need the beauty of plants. That is why we have parks full of trees and flowers. That is why people always try to design houses with room for some grass and a garden. Do you talk to your plants? Do you give them love and attention? Peter Tompkins and Christopher Bird, writers of a book called THE SECRET LIFE OF PLANTS, tell of an experiment in which two seeds were planted in different places. While the plants were growing, one plant was given love and hopeful ideas. The other plant was given only hopeless ideas. After six months, the loved plant was bigger. Under the earth it had more and longer roots; above the earth, it had a thicker stem and more leaves. Question: According to the passage, which of the following is right? Options: (A) If there are no flowers, there will be no sweet smells. (B) Without plants, we can't hear the wind. (C) We plant trees to watch the branches sway from side to side.

This film is a sequel to the preceding movie adaptation, \\"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe,\\" released in 2005. Both of these movies are based on the popular children's fantasy book series, \\"The Chronicles of Narnia,\\" written by British author C.S. Lewis. The series, which consists of seven books in total, follows the adventures of various children in the mystical world of Narnia, where they interact with talking animals, mythical creatures, and the all-powerful lion Aslan, who serves as a Christ-like figure. In \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe,\\" four siblings – Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy Pevensie – are sent to live with a professor in the English countryside during World War II. They discover an entrance to the world of Narnia through a magical wardrobe and play a vital role with Aslan in defeating the evil White Witch, who has ruled Narnia in a perpetual winter for 100 years. After successfully dethroning the White Witch, the siblings reign over Narnia as kings and queens, before eventually returning to their world. \\"The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian\\" picks up one year after the siblings' return to their world. However, due to the nature of time in Narnia, 1,300 years have passed there, and the land is now ruled by the Telmarine people, led by the villainous King Miraz. Narnia's original creatures and inhabitants have been driven into hiding, and the siblings must join forces with Prince Caspian, the rightful heir to the throne, to overthrow King Miraz and restore peace and justice to Narnia. Traitor's Ford is an important location in this sequel, as it is the site of a significant battle between the Narnian forces, led by the Pevensies and Prince Caspian, and the Telmarine army commanded by King Miraz. The battle at Traitor's Ford represents a pivotal moment in the film as it demonstrates the courage and determination of the Narnian forces while also highlighting the lengths to which the Telmarines will go to maintain their control over the land."},{"question":"Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Talk to yourself It may be obvious, but the best way to get better at a language is to speak it.

Step-by-step reasoning:","response":"1. First, let's understand the sentence: \\"It can harm a relationship if you are constantly experiencing Jealousy towards others.\\" This statement suggests that experiencing frequent jealousy towards others can have a negative impact on a relationship. 2. Next, let's consider the emotion of jealousy. Jealousy is a complex emotion that often arises from insecurity, fear, or feeling threatened by someone else's success or happiness. 3.

The Seleucid Antiochus III had allied with Philip V of Macedon in 203 BC, agreeing that they should jointly conquer the lands of the boy-king of Egypt, Ptolemy V. After defeating Ptolemy in the Fifth Syrian War, Antiochus concentrated on occupying the Ptolemaic possessions in Asia Minor. However, this brought Antiochus into conflict with Rhodes and Pergamum, two important Roman allies, and began a 'cold war' between Rome and Antiochus (not helped by the presence of Hannibal at the Seleucid court). Meanwhile, in mainland Greece, the Aetolian League, which had sided with Rome against Macedon, now grew to resent the Roman presence in Greece. This presented Antiochus III with a pretext to invade Greece and 'liberate' it from Roman influence, thus starting the Roman-Syrian War (192–188 BC). In 191 BC, the Romans under Manius Acilius Glabrio routed him at Thermopylae and obliged him to withdraw to Asia. During the course of this war Roman troops moved into Asia for the first time, where they defeated Antiochus again at the Battle of Magnesia (190 BC). A crippling treaty was imposed on Antiochus, with Seleucid possessions in Asia Minor removed and given to Rhodes and Pergamum, the size of the Seleucid navy reduced, and a massive war indemnity invoked.

The tropical thermocline is typically deeper than the thermocline at higher latitudes. Polar waters, which receive relatively little solar energy, are not stratified by temperature and generally lack a thermocline because surface water at polar latitudes are nearly as cold as water at greater depths. Below the thermocline, water is very cold, ranging from −1 °C to 3 °C. Because this deep and cold layer contains the bulk of ocean water, the average temperature of the world ocean is 3.9 °C. and the situation: Keith was measuring the attributes of thermoclines.

The Blue Jays started the series with a victory at home, winning the first game by a score of 8-5. However, they lost the second game, 6-4, which evened up the series as it shifted to Philadelphia. In Philadelphia, the Blue Jays won Game 3 by a score of 10-3, and Game 4 by a score of 15-14, in a thrilling match that saw the teams combine for the highest-scoring game in World Series history. The Phillies fought back, however, and won Game 5, 2-0, sending the series back to Toronto with the Blue Jays holding a 3-2 advantage. Game 6 of the series took place at the SkyDome in Toronto, and it was an unforgettable game that ended in dramatic fashion.

Parra later passed away on February 9, 1919, in Valladolid. Although the wording varies slightly between the two sentences, the meaning remains consistent. In the first sentence, the structure \\"was born on November 17, 1845, in Tacubaya (today Morelia, Michoacán) and died on 9 February 1919 in Valladolid\\" is clear, direct, and emphasizes the key dates and locations. The phrase \\"today Morelia\\" provides context and helps readers understand that Tacubaya is now called Morelia. In the second sentence, the wording \\"Parra was born on 17 November 1845 in Tacubaya (nowadays Morelia, Michoacán) and died on 9 February 1919 in Valladolid\\" is also clear but uses the term \\"nowadays\\" instead of \\"today\\" to indicate the current name of Tacubaya.

Special Election\\" Article:","response":"Title: Democrat Surges in Poll Ahead of N.Y. Special Election [Step 1: Start with a brief introduction to the article topic] In a dramatic turn of events, the Democratic candidate for the upcoming special election in New York has made significant progress in the polls, pulling ahead of their rival in a contest that was once seen as a tight race. [Step 2: Explain the background/context of the special election] The special election, scheduled for November 3, 2021, was called to fill the vacant seat in New York's 4th Congressional District left by the resignation of the former representative earlier this year. The high-stakes race has attracted national attention and turned into a battleground for both parties, as it may have far-reaching impacts on the political landscape. [Step 3: Present data and figures to support the claim in the title] According to the latest poll conducted by XYZ Research Institute, the Democratic candidate, John Doe, has experienced a surge in support, leading the Republican candidate, Jane Smith, by 6 points, 48% to 42%. This marks a significant change from just two weeks ago when the two candidates were neck-and-neck in the polls, indicating a potential shift in voter sentiment. [Step 4: Provide possible reasons for the surge in the Democratic candidate's poll numbers] There are several factors that may have contributed to this upward trend in the Democratic candidate's poll numbers. First, John Doe received a series of high-profile endorsements from key political figures, helping boost his credibility among undecided voters. Secondly, the recent debates proved advantageous for the Democratic campaign, as John Doe was able to articulate clear policy plans, particularly on issues of healthcare and education, which resonated with voters in the district. [Step 5: Mention the Republican candidate's reaction to the updated poll results] In response to the new poll results, Jane Smith, the Republican candidate, has doubled down on her campaign efforts, focusing on a platform centered around economic recovery and job creation in the district. Her campaign has also initiated a series of attack ads aimed at questioning John Doe's qualifications and commitment to the district. [Step 6: Address the uncertainty and potential future developments in the race] While the latest poll numbers indicate a shift in favor of the Democratic candidate, the race remains tight and uncertain. In this highly polarized political climate, the outcome could be swayed by unforeseen events, such as a late-breaking scandal or a significant national development. Both campaigns will need to continuously adapt to the rapidly changing political landscape in order to secure a victory in the special election. [Step 7: Conclude the article by reiterating its potential implications] The result of the NY-4 special election could have far-reaching consequences for both parties at a national level. A win for the Democrats could provide momentum for their broader political agenda, while a Republican victory would signal strength in traditionally competitive districts. As November 3 approaches, all eyes will be on New York’s 4th Congressional District to see which party will ultimately prevail in this closely watched race."},{"question":"Went to Zoological et Forest Park by Le Petit Train .

Absolutely an owl hunts mice.","response":"As an AI language model, I will analyze the sentence structure and its correctness based on linguistics standards. Sentence: \\"Absolutely an owl hunts mice.\\" Step 1: Identify the parts of speech - \\"Absolutely\\" is an adverb modifying the verb \\"hunts.\\" - \\"An owl\\" is a noun phrase acting as the subject of the sentence, with \\"an\\" being an article and \\"owl\\" being a noun. - \\"Hunts\\" is a verb representing the action of the sentence. - \\"Mice\\" is a noun acting as the object of the sentence, and it is the direct object of the verb \\"hunts.\\" Step 2: Check if the sentence follows the basic English syntax rules The basic sentence structure in English follows the subject-verb-object (SVO) pattern. In this sentence: - Subject: \\"an owl\\" - Verb: \\"hunts\\" - Object: \\"mice\\" This sentence does follow the SVO pattern. Step 3: Check if the adverb is placed correctly The adverb \\"absolutely\\" is placed at the beginning of the sentence, which is an acceptable position for adverbs representing emphasis or intensity. However, it's more common to place this type of adverb immediately before the verb it modifies. Rewriting the sentence as \\"An owl absolutely hunts mice.\\" might be a more common phrasing. In conclusion, a linguist may consider the sentence \\"Absolutely an owl hunts mice.\\" to be correct but a bit awkward in terms of adverb placement.

They lived on the road, often without a roof over their heads, and spent much of their time in learning, quiet contemplation and preparing to take The Good News to all. While you don't necessarily need to hit the highway and live like a minister, a full time disciple, student or missionary to follow Jesus, it's important to know that you also don't need to be a person of wealth, status, speaking skills or other achievement. God uses the basics, the truth -- simple words and messengers. The less self-centered trappings of the material world, the less distracted you'll be from your message of Jesus: the way, truth and the life. When Jesus says I am the way He is talking about in Heaven. you have to call on Him to forgive you to make it to Heaven. Take little steps. Simplify your life. You don't need to adopt a life as a mission or join a ministry team as a minister, necessarily--but get a Bible and study Christ and the Acts of the Apostles and the writings of Paul (much of the New Testament). Instead of entertaining or watching television in the evening, contemplate a particular passage that speaks to you. Pray on it. Think more and do more for Christ, and His people/family/friends. A common area to work on among Christians, in/of religious traditions, can be laying aside self-righteousness, not showing vanity. Followers of Jesus shouldn't feel proud of their humility, or boast of their \\"spiritual\\" life. As a follower of Christ, focus, and center your life -- but not because it makes you feel \\"better than\\" others: You may choose how to follow because it gets you \\"closer to\\" God and to appreciating other believers more, \\"God's family\\"; you are one of Jesus' brothers and sisters, \\"joint-heirs with Jesus Christ\\". He, despite often communicating in cryptic stories (parables) to the general public, was a direct and completely honest talker to followers, having nothing to hide, and having total confidence in His words, full of the Holy Spirit beyond measure. With friends and accepting coworkers, family and loved ones, be forthright, honest, and direct. Your life will uncomplicate itself as a result. Speaking with hidden motives (wink, wink) and trying to manipulate others is too common in the workplace, at home, and in many interpersonal relationships. Even if you're dissenting nicely, speak your mind with love. Most people respect honesty and decency. So, do not be unnecessarily harsh or judgmental toward others: there is one true Judge. Since \\"Love never fails\\" and \\"God is love!\\" -- find the kindness in others, being a friend to them: expecting their best, and cultivating positive relationships with people. Don't think more highly of yourself than you ought. Assume you'll enjoy the company of new acquaintances, and learn everything you can from others. Bear your load, and help others bear theirs; tell the truth, and hear the truth, being as happy, patient and kind as possible, through it all. Actively make time for reasonable people who are different than you, having different experiences, who may believe very different things. Listen to them with an open heart, as: \\"I see what you mean, also have you considered this ___?\\" Before He went around preaching the gospel, Jesus spent many years in the trade of Joseph, Mary's husband, practicing carpentry. Devoting yourself to a craft, a trade, or skill, can be helpful in allowing you to humble yourself and live more simply. Be good at what you do, and devote part of your life to providing service for your fellow man, Christian and non. Be useful and reliable. Who lacks voice in your world? Who needs to experience real, open channels of communication and fellowship with others, in less privileged circumstances? Jesus sought out the marginalized and associated with the downcast to share His message, and to help in real ways, not just platitudes but action. Expand your mind and your capacity for empathy by spending time with those less fortunate than yourself. You might consider volunteering at soup kitchens, shelters, or donating your time to other organizations that help those in need. Spend time with people, be friendly and learn from them. Don't be a tourist in their bad times and suffering; help some. Charity. You don't have to be a big donor. Your gift need not be money. Offer transportation, bus fare, a car ride, accompany an elder or sick neighbor to the doctor, or help an unemployed person find low priced or free groceries. Visit widows and orphans in their need. Surprise your grandmother with a call and a visit, with little warning. Cook dinner for a friend having a rough spell and get someone to deliver it anonymously and never bring it up. Write letters of support to children or soldiers overseas, and let them know you care, sending some small gifts. Work with church charities. Some churches give a lot of weight to donations, mission-work, and other community operations. You don't need to be a martyr to a great cause to follow Jesus, but you do have to fight your struggles for yourself but never alone. Give yourself up to some calling greater than yourself. Stand up for others' benefits in \\"the good fight\\", spiritual battle, wherever you find one. Be a watchman for community standards. Christian believers will experience the issues of doubt. No believer is without it. Even Christ endured 40 days of temptation in the desert, clouded by human doubt. He was 100% man and tempted like we, without fail. Even Christ cried out on the cross, \\"Father why have you forsaken me?\\", \\"It is finished. Into your hand I commit myself!\\" That conflict was ended. Victories over sin, death and the grave came fast behind. You can deal with weakness, temptation, and doubt with patience, and come through as refined gold from the trying of your faith, covered by God's grace. Approach difficulties and struggles with persistence and focus: this defines your life as a person and as a follower of Christ. Bring some balance into the lives of serious-minded Christians. Soldiering on in blind devotion to tradition or dogma, while merely warming a church bench does not make you a Christian. Think hard about supporting your beliefs. Weigh them constantly. Thanking God in it all. Struggle and stand for the teachings of Jesus and making them an integral part of your daily life. What is a summary?","response":"In this article, the author emphasizes the importance of living a simple and humble life to follow Jesus and become closer to God.

Whether you've decided to embark on this unique connection due to a busy lifestyle, fear of commitment, or just the thrill of it, maintaining a healthy friends-with-benefits (FWB) relationship requires effective communication and trust. This article will guide you step-by-step through the process to ensure a positive experience for both you and your partner. Step 1: Flirt and Set the Mood Lay the foundation for your FWB relationship with some light-hearted flirting. This step is vital as it helps establish chemistry and shows mutual interest. Engage in playful banter, tease your partner, and build anticipation for what's to come. Be thoughtful in your approach, making it clear that you're interested in more than just platonic friendship, while also being respectful of boundaries and consent. Step 2: Make Your Move Once you've built a connection and feel there's mutual understanding, it's time to take things to the next level. Initiate physical touch by maintaining eye contact and giving subtle hints, like leaning in or brushing your hand against their arm. If the signals are well-received, gradually escalate the intimacy, moving from holding hands to kissing, and eventually, hooking up. Remember, consent is essential at every point, and it's crucial to make sure both parties are comfortable with the pace. Step 3: Set Ground Rules After the initial spark, outline the framework of your FWB arrangement, specifying the boundaries that make both of you comfortable. Discuss your expectations regarding exclusivity and commitment, and whether the relationship is strictly sexual or open to emotional involvement. These conversations can be difficult, but setting ground rules will prevent future misunderstandings and ensure a safe and enjoyable experience for both of you. Step 4: Enjoy the Moments Now that the foundation is set, it's time to indulge in the fun part: the sex. Explore each other's desires, fantasies, and preferences in a consensual and non-judgmental environment. Be open to trying new things, but also respect your partner's boundaries and communicate any discomfort. Listen to your partner's body language and vocal cues to gauge their likes and dislikes. Step 5: Maintain Open Lines of Communication Communication is the cornerstone of any relationship, including FWB arrangements. Keep the conversation flowing, share your feelings, and address any concerns as they arise. By regularly checking in with your partner and recalibrating the expectations as needed, you'll ensure a positive and mutually enriching experience. If either partner decides to end the arrangement, or if feelings develop beyond the agreed-upon boundaries, prioritize honesty and respect as you sort out those emotions together. Conclusion A friends-with-benefits relationship can be a thrilling and fulfilling venture, provided both parties actively engage in clear communication and maintain mutual respect. By following this step-by-step guide, you'll be equipped with the necessary tools to forge a healthy, enjoyable FWB experience, leading to countless memorable moments and a strengthened connection with your partner."},{"question":"Q: While on a fishing trip Riley brought Taylor forth to the lake.

Article: A Samoan airline says that it is the world's first carrier to charge passengers by their weight. Samoa Air, which opened in 2012, asks passengers to give their personal weight during booking, which is then charged according to the length of a flight. The customers will also be weighed just before they board the plane. \\"It is believed that all people throughout the world are the same size,\\" Samoa Air CEO Chris Langton said. \\"Airplanes always run on weight, not seats.\\" \\"There is no doubt in my mind that this is the concept of the future. This is the fairest way of your travelling with your family or yourself.\\" Though the airline introduced the plan last November, it caught people's attention last week when the carrier began international flights to neighboring American Samoa. Almost at the same time, a Norwegian economist, Bharat Bhatta, published a report suggesting that airlines should charge obese passengers more. The Pacific Islands contain some of the world's most common countries for obesity, many ranking in the top 10, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Samoa is ranked number four, with 59.6 percent of the population considered obese, said the most recent WHO report. According to Samoa Air's latest schedule, the airline charges up to 0.57 per kg for flights in Samoa and 1.03 per kg for its only international flight to American Samoa, around 250 miles. Children under 12 are charged 75 percent of the adult rate, with fares also based on weight. Any overweight baggage is calculated at the same rate as the passenger's personal weight. The plan could actually prove cheaper in some cases, such as for families travelling with small children, and Langton said customer reaction has mainly been \\"amazingly positive\\". The idea of charging passengers by weight has been hotly discussed before, and in the US some airlines require those who do not fit into a seat comfortably to buy a second seat.

Stream-of-consciousness explanation: A piece of furniture often has various compartments and features designed to store a variety of items, be it clothing, office supplies, or even personal belongings. Within a desk, cabinet, or dresser, there are usually multiple compartments or spaces that function differently to suit different storage needs. For instance, cabinets typically have doors that open outward, revealing shelves inside. Similarly, a wardrobe or closet has doors for hanging clothes or storing larger items like suitcases or boxes. However, the term we're looking for involves a sliding mechanism and allows for items to be stored flat or horizontally, often with sectioned compartments. It's common for several of these compartments to be stacked vertically, creating a column of spaces for storage. This type of compartment can be found in various types of furniture, and the term is quite generic, applying to both simple and sleek modern designs as well as more ornate, antique styles. It's used worldwide and is a standard feature in countless pieces of furniture design. Regardless of its specific appearance, this term describes a storage compartment that slides open horizontally, revealing a flat space to store items like clothes, papers, or accessories.

Ice ocean had few submarine volcanoes, while Tropical ocean had thousands of active volcanoes on the ocean floor. Which ocean had fewer hydrophones on the ocean floor? Hint: Submarine volcanoes are common features of the ocean floor. In shallow water, active volcanoes disclose their presence by blasting steam and rocky debris high above the ocean's surface. In the ocean's deep, the tremendous weight of the water above prevents the explosive release of steam and gases; however, they can be detected by hydrophones and discoloration of water because of volcanic gases. Pillow lava is a common eruptive product of submarine volcanoes and is characterized by thick sequences of discontinuous pillow-shaped masses which form under water. Even large submarine eruptions may not disturb the ocean surface due to the rapid cooling effect and increased buoyancy of water (as compared to air) which often causes volcanic vents to form steep pillars on the ocean floor. Hydrothermal vents are common near these volcanoes, and some support peculiar ecosystems based on dissolved minerals. Over time, the formations created by submarine volcanoes may become so large that they break the ocean surface as new islands or floating pumice rafts. Answer:","response":"Based on the provided information, we can infer that the Ice Ocean had fewer hydrophones on the ocean floor than the Tropical Ocean. The reasons for this conclusion are as follows: 1. The Ice Ocean had only a few submarine volcanoes, whereas the Tropical Ocean had thousands of active volcanoes on the ocean floor. This indicates that the volcanic activity and associated geological features were more prominent in the Tropical Ocean. 2. Hydrophones are employed for detecting submarine volcanic activity, such as the release of steam and gases that occur when volcanoes erupt underwater. Since the Tropical Ocean had a higher concentration of active submarine volcanoes, it is reasonable to assume that more hydrophones would be installed in this ocean to monitor this heightened volcanic activity. 3. The description provided of submarine volcanic activity also mentions that formations created by these underwater eruptions can eventually break the ocean surface. The Tropical Ocean's greater concentration of underwater volcanoes would likely result in a higher probability of such formations. Consequently, it seems logical that researchers would deploy more hydrophones in the Tropical Ocean to study these phenomena. 4. The presence of hydrothermal vents near submarine volcanoes and their unique ecosystems also serves as an important research focus. The higher concentration of active submarine volcanoes in the Tropical Ocean suggests that this ocean would have more hydrothermal vents and, subsequently, more diverse underwater ecosystems. Researchers would likely place a greater number of hydrophones in this ocean to gather data on these unique habitats. Considering all the factors discussed above, we can conclude that the Ice Ocean had fewer hydrophones on the ocean floor when compared to the Tropical Ocean, which had a higher concentration of submarine volcanoes and associated geological features."},{"question":"Context: After weeks of careful research, Robin landed a new job with higher pay.

Elected governor in 2010 and re-elected in 2014, Kasich is a Republican. His second term ends on January 14, 2019; he cannot stand for reelection due to term limits. A native of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Kasich has lived much of his adulthood in Ohio, specifically the state capital of Columbus. Following the separate fatal police shootings of John Crawford III and Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old boy in Ohio, while each were holding BB guns, where grand juries decided not to indict any of the officers involved, Kasich created the Ohio Collaborative Community-Police Advisory Board \\"to address what he described as frustration and distrust among some Ohioans toward their police departments, particularly among the black community.\\" The 23-member task force (with 18 members appointed by Kasich) was appointed in January 2015 and issued its 629-page final report and recommendations in April 2015. The report recommended greater accountability and oversight for police agencies and officers, further community education and involvement in policing, and new use-of-force and recruitment, hiring, and training standards for police agencies. In April 2015, Kasich created the Ohio Collaborative Community-Police Advisory Board, a twelve-member board tasked (in conjunction with the Ohio Office of Criminal Justice Services and the Ohio Department of Public Safety) with developing statewide standards for the recruiting, hiring and screening of police officers, and for the use of force (including deadly force) by police. The advisory board, the first of its kind in Ohio, was also tasked by Kasich with developing \\"model policies and best practice recommendations to promote better interaction and communication between law enforcement departments and their home communities.\\" In August 2015, the board issued its recommendations, which placed \\"an emphasis on the preservation of human life and restrict officers to defending themselves or others from death or serious injury.\\" In August 2015, Kasich said that he was open to the idea of requiring police officers to wear body cameras.

Trump's pitch came during a speech before a friendly conservative crowd at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) meeting near Washington. Trump spent much of the past week dealing with the aftermath of the tragic high school shooting in Parkland, Florida. Although a new experience for Trump, it is a situation many of his predecessors are all too familiar with. Former Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama all faced similar tragedies while in office. They also dealt with political pressures in the aftermath demanding action. Trump is also beginning to see why presidents are often frustrated when they try to bridge what pollsters and political pundits often refer to as the great divide over guns in the United States. In the aftermath of the massacre at Columbine High School in Colorado in 1999, President Clinton sought to calm the nation. \\"We must do more to reach out to our children and teach them to express their anger and to resolve their conflicts with words, not weapons,\\" he said. In 2007, it was left to President Bush to lead the grieving at Virginia Tech after a gunman killed 32 people before committing suicide. \\"May God bless and keep the souls of the lost, and may his love touch all of those who suffer in grief,\\" he said at an on campus memorial service. And in 2012, an emotional President Obama wiped away a tear as he addressed the nation in the wake of the massacre of grade-school students in Newtown, Connecticut. \\"We've endured too many of these tragedies in the last few years. The majority of those who died today were children, beautiful little kids between the ages of five and 10 years old,\\" he said. Trump has expressed sympathy for the victims and families in the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. But he has also been forceful in pushing for solutions, including the controversial idea of... Question: What years was the Columbine High School shootings in Colorado?

This will involve watching the driver's movements, looking for any suspicious or unusual behavior. I will focus on the driver's activities and interactions with anyone else in the vicinity. Justification: Observing the driver's actions is essential to determine any possible reason for Tom's interest, as well as to assess if there is any cause for concern or potential harm to anyone in the area. Step 2: Maintain a safe distance As Tom and I follow the driver, I will make sure to maintain a safe and inconspicuous distance. This will prevent the driver from becoming aware of our presence, which could alter their actions or lead them to engage in more cautious behavior. Justification: Maintaining a safe distance is crucial to accurately observing the driver's actions without being detected, thus ensuring Tom's intentions remain hidden. Step 3: Record any notable occurrences During the observation process, I will take note of any significant events or actions involving the driver. I will record all pertinent details, such as the driver's location, possible interactions with other individuals, and any items exchanged. Justification: Keeping a record of notable occurrences will allow Tom and me to analyze the data later, potentially revealing patterns or motives behind the driver's actions. Step 4: Stay alert to changes in the situation As the situation unfolds, it's essential to stay vigilant and adapt to any changes in the driver's behavior or actions. For instance, if the driver becomes aware of our presence or starts engaging in dangerous activities, I will assess the situation and take measures to ensure Tom's safety and the safety of others in the area. Justification: Being prepared for potential changes in the situation is necessary for ensuring well-rounded and effective observation while maintaining the safety and well-being of all individuals involved or affected by the driver's actions. Step 5: Report findings to Tom Once the observation period is complete or the driver's activities have concluded, I will relay all relevant information to Tom. This will allow him to make informed decisions based on the findings and determine the best course of action related to the driver's actions. Justification: Sharing the findings with Tom ensures that he receives a complete and accurate understanding of the driver's actions, enabling him to take appropriate steps or make decisions based on the observed behavior."},{"question":"Write a sentence in English.","response":"The big, fluffy dog played with the yellow ball in the park.

Horseback riding for many years: Skylar may have a great interest or passion for horses and equestrian sports.

The narrator appears to value their space and the cleanliness, and they seem to be experiencing discomfort due to the contrasting behavior of their guests. Firstly, the narrator's self-description as 'not a sociable person' suggests their introverted nature. Introverts usually prefer solitude and less stimulating environments, which is in stark contrast to the chaotic atmosphere created by their guests. Secondly, their guests' behavior and description as 'very loud' and 'never seem to sleep' emphasize the narrator's preference for quiet and calm surroundings. The disturbance caused by the guests' noise level and constant activity appears to be taking a toll on the introverted narrator. Lastly, by noting that the guest's stay has caused their flat to resemble the boat filled with holes in the wall, the narrator showcases their preference for orderliness and tidiness. The negative impact on their flat indicates their agitation and concern for maintaining their personal space. In conclusion, the narrator comes across as an introverted, private, and orderly person who is struggling to cope with the presence of their tall, loud, and disruptive guests. This situation has disrupted the narrator's preferred environment, negatively affecting their well-being and comfort in their own flat."},{"question":"Write a sentence based on \\"business leaders predict better times\\"","response":"Important people who run businesses think things will get better and happier soon."},{"question":"Summarize this article in one sentence.

What is the answer??","response":"The equation you've given is: 238l - 249l + 77 = 0 The first step is to simplify the equation and solve for l. Subtract the term -249l from 238l: 238l - 249l = 11l. So your equation is now: -11l + 77 = 0 To solve for l, you need to isolate l. You can do this by first subtracting 77 from both sides of the equation to get: -11l = -77 Now, to get l on its own, divide both sides of the equation by -11: l = -77 / -11 Hence, l = 7 So the solution to the equation 238l - 249l + 77 = 0 is l = 7.

When Century Media advertised the reissue of Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing as the \\"rebirth of a genre-defying classic\\", Townsend called it \\"record company bullshit\\".Townsend recruited a permanent line-up for the second album: Jed Simon on guitar, Byron Stroud on bass, and Gene Hoglan on drums. City was released on February 11, 1997, and received highly favorable critical reception. Kerrang! praised the album for its heaviness, claiming it sounded like \\"sticking your head into the jet nozzle of a Stealth Bomber\\", while Metal Hammer ranked it No. 13 on its \\"Top 20 Albums of 1997\\" list. The album soon gained a cult following and a loyal fan base for the band. City is considered to be the band's best effort by a large number of fans and critics alike. In 2002, the album was No. 45 on Revolver magazine's \\"69 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time\\" list, and also appeared on their \\"Must Have Metal Albums\\" list in 2005. It also appeared on the \\"100 Most Important Albums of the Nineties\\" list conducted by Terrorizer. Townsend himself stated City \\"is the real Strapping record.

In June 1998, the group released No Sleep 'till Bedtime, a live album containing songs performed at a 1997 performance at the HiFi Bar and Ballroom in Melbourne, Australia.

A fire broke out at Thomas Farriner's bakery in Pudding Lane a little after midnight on Sunday 2 September. The family was trapped upstairs but managed to climb from an upstairs window to the house next door, except for a maidservant who was too frightened to try, who became the first victim. The neighbours tried to help douse the fire; after an hour, the parish constables arrived and judged that the adjoining houses had better be demolished to prevent further spread. The householders protested, and Lord Mayor Sir Thomas Bloodworth was summoned, who alone had the authority to override their wishes. When Bloodworth arrived, the flames were consuming the adjoining houses and creeping towards the paper warehouses and flammable stores on the riverfront. The more experienced firemen were clamouring for demolition, but Bloodworth refused on the grounds that most premises were rented and the owners could not be found. Bloodworth is generally thought to have been appointed to the office of Lord Mayor as a yes man, rather than by possessing requisite capabilities for the job. He panicked when faced with a sudden emergency and, when pressed, made the oft-quoted remark, \\"Pish! A woman could piss it out\\", and left. After the City had been destroyed, Samuel Pepys looked back on the events and wrote in his diary on 7 September 1666: \\"People do all the world over cry out of the simplicity [the stupidity] of my Lord Mayor in general; and more particularly in this business of the fire, laying it all upon him.\\" Pepys was a senior official in the Navy Office by then, and he ascended the Tower of London on Sunday morning to view the fire from a turret. He recorded in his diary that the eastern gale had turned it into a conflagration. It had burned down several churches and, he estimated, 300 houses and reached the riverfront. The houses on London... contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person whose neighbours tried to help douse the fire?, what is it ?

Last few times I have ordered they either took a ridiculous amount of time to fill the order and deliver it (I literally live a block away), or they forget one of my items. I just ordered again, and wrote in the notes not to put any ice in my TWO pepsis that I ordered. I wanted to see if they actually read the notes. Well, my husband answers the door while I'm in the other room, and when I come out... sure enough they read the notes. No ice, but they only brought one drink. SO ANNOYING.

That's a good 30-60 a week you just lost from my orders. Choose: was this review given positively or negatively? Choose from: +negative; +positive;","response":"This review was clearly given negatively. The reasons for the negative evaluation are based on the consistently poor service experienced by the reviewer. Firstly, the reviewer criticized the food delivery time, which was claimed to be ridiculously long despite the close proximity between the reviewer's location and the restaurant. Secondly, they expressed discontentment about the oversight on the items ordered. This was repetitively mentioned, indicating a persistent problem and also showing lack of attention to detail or perhaps inefficient management on the restaurant's part. This could lead to dissatisfaction among patrons who count on home deliveries, especially when the missed items are something they paid for. Finally, the reviewer conducted a test to see if the restaurant pays heed to particular details or special instructions enclosed in the order - again a reference to the instructions about the Pepsi drinks served without ice. While the instruction was followed, the restaurant failed in delivering the correct number of drinks, thereby missing the mark again and consequently making the reviewer more annoyed. Furthermore, the review concludes with the disappointment felt by the reviewer and they even disclose they would have to find an alternative restaurant for Chinese food. The mention of the loss of frequent orders (to the amount of 30-60 per week) from this particular customer can be construed as a significant negative impact on the restaurant business from a customer's perspective. So, overall, the tone of the review, the issues raised, and the final decision of stopping to order from 'Golden Egg Roll', implies a negative review."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

Plot title: District B13 Movie plot: In 2010, social problems have overrun the poorer suburbs of Paris; especially Banlieue 13, commonly referred to as B13: a ghetto with a population of some two million. Unable to control B13, the authorities construct a high wall topped by barbed tape around the entire area, forcing the inhabitants within to survive without education, proper utilities or police protection behind the containment wall. Police checkpoints stop anybody going in or out. Three years later, the district has become overrun with gangs. LeÃ¯to (David Belle) is a fighter of such gangs. The beginning of the film depicts LeÃ¯to washing a case full of drugs down the drain, then escaping the gang who has come to collect the drugs. The gang's leader, Taha, kidnaps LeÃ¯to's sister Lola in retaliation; LeÃ¯to is able to rescue her and take Taha to the police station, but the police arrest LeÃ¯to and let Taha leave with Lola, stating that they're leaving the district. Six months later, in Paris, Damienâan undercover copâcompletes a successful operation at a casino, and is immediately given a new assignment: Taha's gang has taken a bomb from a nuclear transport vehicle and accidentally activated it, giving it 24 hours before it wipes out the district. Damien, posing as a prisoner, must infiltrate the district and disarm the bomb; he teams up with LeÃ¯to to do so. LeÃ¯to immediately sees through Damien's cover, but the two reluctantly team up to save LeÃ¯to's sister as well. The pair surrenders to Taha in order to gain access to his base, where they find the bomb has been set up on a missile launcher aimed at Paris, with Lola handcuffed to it. Taha demands a high ransom to deactivate the bomb; the government refuses, but after Damien gives them Taha's bank account codes, they drain his funds.

Based on these factors, I can provide a rating on the given scale of 1-5. 1. Content: The review is quite brief and lacks details about what specifically is good about the subject being reviewed. Without more information, it is difficult for readers to glean any real insight or understanding about the item or experience being assessed. 2. Context: Depending on the context, the meaning of \\"good\\" could vary significantly. For example, if a product or service had generally poor reviews, saying \\"Its good\\" might be considered somewhat favorable. On the other hand, if a product or service is consistently receiving top ratings, calling it \\"good\\" might be interpreted as underwhelming. 3. Expression: The review lacks proper grammar and punctuation. The use of \\"Its\\" rather than the correct contraction \\"It's\\" suggests a casual or rushed tone. Furthermore, the word choice is quite generic and does not provide any specific feedback that is useful to others. 4. Helpfulness: Since the review is brief and vague, it does not offer any useful information for potential consumers. Readers will not be able to make an informed decision based on this review alone, as it does not provide any insights into the strengths, weaknesses, or unique aspects of the product or experience. Taking these factors into consideration, I would rate this review as a 2 out of 5. While it does express a mildly favorable opinion, the lack of detail and the casual dismissiveness of the review makes it far less helpful and impactful than it could have been. A higher rating would have been warranted if the review had provided more specific feedback and context about what made the subject good, along with a more careful and thoughtful choice of language."},{"question":"Please add spaces between words: Forthe2010season,wehaveaddednotonebuttwonewconstructionphasestoourthemeworld“THEHANSEATICLEAGUEinEUROPE”:thevenerableoldHanseaticCityofRostockandSweden’sVisbyaswellastheFreeandHanseaticCityofHamburgandhistoricalBruges.","response":"For the 2010 season, we have added not one but two new construction phases to our theme world \\"THE HANSEATIC LEAGUE in EUROPE\\": the venerable old Hanseatic City of Rostock and Sweden's Visby as well as the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg and historical Bruges."},{"question":"Write a positive movie review.","response":"Title: Journey Beyond Dreams Director: Ava Gardner Genre: Fantasy, Adventure, Family Journey Beyond Dreams is an enthralling and delightful film that is sure to leave viewers spellbound with its vibrant visuals, captivating storytelling, and unforgettable characters.

Article: When we think about giving help to developing countries, we often think about giving money so that these countries can build schools and hospitals, buy food and medicine, or find clean water supplies. These seem to be the most important basic needs of the people we are trying to help. However, it's far from enough. Ladies and gentlemen, we've got to come up with some better ideas to help them. I was very surprised, then, when I read about a plan to make cheap laptop computers for children in developing countries. A man called Nicholas Negroponte invented a cheap laptop computer, which can run without electricity. He decided to invent this computer after he visited a school in Cambodia. The laptop which Mr. Negroponte has designed is a little different from the normal laptop computers you can buy in the shops. One difference is that it is covered in rubber so that it is very strong and won't be damaged easily. As an electricity supply can be a problem in developing countries, the computer also has a special handle so that children can wind the computer up to give it extra power when needed. These special laptop computers will cost less than 100 US dollars and Mr. Negroponte wants to build as many as 15 million machines in the first year of production. The idea is that these computers will help the children's education as they will be able to access the Internet. These computers might not help the people in developing countries immediately, but by improving children's education they should help people to find their own solutions to their problems in the long term. Another idea to help children in developing countries is to recycle old mobile phones so that they can be used again. In the UK, and, probably in many other countries too, millions of mobile phones are thrown away every year. The waste created by throwing away these old phones is very bad for the environment, so it seems to be an excellent idea to recycle them.

Although initial colonization of the province revolved mostly around homesteading, the last century has seen a shift towards urbanization; Manitoba is the only Canadian province with over fifty-five percent of its population located in a single city. According to the 2006 Canadian census, the largest ethnic group in Manitoba is English (22.9%), followed by German (19.1%), Scottish (18.5%), Ukrainian (14.7%), Irish (13.4%), North American Indian (10.6%), Polish (7.3%), Métis (6.4%), French (5.6%), Dutch (4.9%), Russian (4.0%), and Icelandic (2.4%). Almost one-fifth of respondents also identified their ethnicity as \\"Canadian\\". There is a significant indigenous community: aboriginals (including Métis) are Manitoba's fastest-growing ethnic group, representing 13.6 percent of Manitoba's population as of 2001 (some reserves refused to allow census-takers to enumerate their populations or were otherwise incompletely counted). There is a significant Franco-Manitoban minority (148,370) and a growing aboriginal population (192,865, including the Métis). Gimli, Manitoba is home to the largest Icelandic community outside of Iceland.Most Manitobans belong to a Christian denomination: on the 2001 census, 758,760 Manitobans (68.7%) reported being Christian, followed by 13,040 (1.2%) Jewish, 5,745 (0.5%) Buddhist, 5,485 (0.5%) Sikh, 5,095 (0.5%) Muslim, 3,840 (0.3%) Hindu, 3,415 (0.3%) Aboriginal spirituality and 995 (0.1%) pagan. 201,825 Manitobans (18.3%) reported no religious affiliation.

Answer:","response":"Based on the information provided in the article, 995 people in Manitoba identified as pagan according to the 2001 census. To find the percentage of the population in the province where aboriginals are the fastest-growing ethnic group that identifies as pagan, we need to know the total population of this province. From the text, we know that the total population of Manitoba was 1,208,268 according to the 2011 census. Ideally, we should use the 2001 census population to be consistent, but since that information is not provided, we will use the 2011 census data. To find the percentage, we use the following formula: Percentage = (Number of pagans / Total population) x 100 = (995 / 1,208,268) x 100 ≈ 0.082% So, approximately 0.082% of the population in the province where aboriginals are the fastest-growing ethnic group identifies as pagan according to the referenced data."},{"question":"John was studying the history of dinosaurs.

Era B, on the other hand, refers to the time period encompassing the mass extinction event itself, which happened around 66 million years ago. This critical event marks a transition and a significant turning point in the Earth's history, as it is associated with the extinction of around 75% of all species, including the non-avian dinosaurs. Following this mass extinction, a new era began in which many new species eventually evolved, as John found interesting. This subsequent time period, which is not explicitly labeled in the paragraph, represents the recovery of Earth's ecosystems and the diversification of new life forms that took place over millions of years following the extinction event. Considering that this ongoing process of evolution and species diversification continues up to the present day, it can be deduced that era B, which began around 66 million years ago and encompasses all post-extinction events, would be longer in duration than era A. In summary, era A, which refers to the time period of flourishing dinosaurs before 66 million years ago, is likely to be shorter than era B, which represents the time period starting from the mass extinction event around 66 million years ago and continuing through the subsequent diversification and evolution of new species."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: The story revolves around Shanaya (Bipasha Basu), an actress at the height of her success.

Ann lived in a mountain village at 8000 ft altitude, while Dee lived in a coastal town at sea level. Which cousin experienced more thunderstorms?","response":"Dee, who lived in the coastal town at sea level, likely experienced more thunderstorms. Coastal areas often have more thunderstorms due to the difference in temperature between the land and sea, which leads to unstable air and thunderstorm development. In contrast, high-altitude mountain locations like where Ann lived typically experience fewer thunderstorms since the air is generally colder and more stable, making it less conducive for thunderstorm formation."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Short general knowledge question: where is hong kong china?

Article: I used to think that life in Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania, was filled with never-changing routines. I hated that everyone seemed to know everything about everyone else. Everyone seemed to enjoy talking about other people and their lives. I also didn't like the fact that people seemed very close-minded. I felt trapped. I felt like I was missing out on opportunities. It seemed to me that city life would be the opposite. Then I took my first trip to New York City. I couldn't wait to experience the city. However, when I arrived in the Big Apple, it wasn't at all what I had imagined. I knew it was home to thousands of people, but I hadn't had the least expectation to see so many people on the street at one time. All the streets were filled with people. I also felt a little surprised to see that everyone was in a hurry and everything moved at such a fast pace. When I took the subway for the first time, I said hello to the middle-aged woman next to me. She looked at me with dislike and didn't say a word. After just one day, I realized how important my small town is to me. Now I appreciate the familiar faces I see every day. I like the feeling of security and belonging my town offers. Jim Thorpe gives me a sense of community and togetherness that the city doesn't provide. I realize just how much a simple hello does for a stranger -- it really can make your day a little better. My big trip showed me that my small town really has instilled morals and values in me that I didn't even know I had. I never would have known what a big place my town holds in my heart if I had not taken that trip to New York City.

He visits Choule in the hospital but finds her entirely in bandages and unable to talk. Whilst still at Choule's bedside, Trelkovsky meets Simone's friend, Stella (Isabelle Adjani), who has also come to visit. Stella begins talking to Simone, who becomes aware of her visitors. Initially showing some signs of agitation upon seeing them, Choule soon lets out a disturbing cry, then dies. It isn't clear which of the two has caused this reaction. Apparently unaware that Choule is now dead, Trelkovsky tries to comfort Stella but dares not say that he never knew Simone, instead pretending to be another friend. They leave together and go out for a drink and a movie (1973's Enter The Dragon), where they fondle each other. Outside the theatre they part ways. As Trelkovsky occupies the apartment he is chastised unreasonably by his neighbors and landlord, Monsieur Zy (Melvyn Douglas), for hosting a party with his friends, apparently having a woman over, making too much noise in general, and not joining in on a petition against another neighbor. Trelkovsky attempts to adapt to his situation, but is increasingly disturbed by the apartment and the other tenants. He frequently sees his neighbors standing motionless in the toilet room (which he can see from his own window), and discovers a hole in the wall with a human tooth stashed inside. He receives a visit and a letter from one Georges Badar (Rufus), who secretly loves Simone and has believed her to be alive and well. Trelkovsky updates and comforts the man and spends the night out with him. Gradually he changes his breakfast habits to those of Simone, and shifts from Gauloises to Marlboro cigarettes. Trelkovsky becomes severely agitated and enraged when his apartment is robbed, while his neighbors and the concierge (Shelley Winters) continue...

This statement describes a man who is not wearing a shirt and is wearing gray shorts. The setting is on a beach, where the man is engaged in a game of volleyball. The statement clearly conveys an outdoor scene where the man is actively participating in a sport. Statement 2: The man is running around his house. This statement depicts an entirely different scenario. It suggests that the man is now within the vicinity of his house and is involved in an activity, specifically running around the house. There is no mention of the beach or playing volleyball. In logical reasoning, one statement does not necessarily lead to another if there is no clear connection between the two. In this case, since the first statement is about a man playing volleyball on the beach, there is no logical basis for implying that the man is running around his house. In conclusion, there is no logical connection between the two statements, and thus the second statement \\"The man is running around his house.\\" does not logically follow from the first statement."},{"question":"Chastity bought 4 lollipops which cost 1.50 each, and she also bought 2 packs of gummies which cost 2 each. If she has 15, how much was she left with after spending on the candies? Let's answer step by step:","response":"Step 1: Calculate the cost of the lollipops. Chastity bought 4 lollipops at 1.50 each. 4 lollipops * 1.50 per lollipop = 6.00 Step 2: Calculate the cost of the gummies. Chastity bought 2 packs of gummies at 2 each. 2 packs of gummies * 2 per pack = 4.00 Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the candies. The total cost of the lollipops and gummies is the sum of the individual costs. Total cost = cost of lollipops + cost of gummies Total cost = 6.00 + 4.00 Total cost = 10.00 Step 4: Calculate the money left after spending on the candies. Chastity initially had 15.

Social Security is kind of like a big piggy bank for the country where people save money for when they're older. Sometimes, there is extra money in that big piggy bank, which is called a surplus. Now, the people who take care of that big piggy bank can decide to invest some of that extra money in the stock market, like buying small parts of different companies to get some extra profit.

The group itself had opposed the release of the collection, because they felt the compilation did not represent Boyz II Men's best work. After the label released the album without their permission, there was a dispute between the company and the group. Boyz II Men initiated their own recording company Stonecreek (which released material by artists such as Uncle Sam), and they arranged for Stonecreek's distribution by Epic Records, not Motown. Boyz II Men's third studio album, Evolution, was released during 1997 to mixed reviews and sold three million copies, far below the stratospheric success of II's (12 million copies) and Cooleyhighharmony (9 million). Only one of Evolution's singles, the Jam/Lewis-penned \\"Four Seasons of Loneliness\\", reached number 1 on the Hot 100 chart. The second single, the Babyface-helmed \\"A Song for Mama\\" (the theme song to the Babyface-produced film Soul Food) was a Top 10 success, but the follow-up \\"Can't Let Her Go\\" underperformed.

Making matters worse, health problems began to take their toll on the group as well. While on tour to support the Evolution album, Wanya Morris developed a polyp on his vocal cords, and the group was forced to postpone part of the tour until he recovered.

Most universities will give you the option of either purchasing or renting academic regalia. For most people, renting academic regalia is more cost effective. However, if you are planning on becoming a professor, you might be expected to wear regalia as a faculty member at future events. In that case, purchasing your own regalia might be more efficient. Many universities have a specific provider of academic regalia and will not permit you to purchase regalia elsewhere. Other universities will allow you to buy or rent regalia from any provider you choose, or perhaps borrow regalia from an alumna. Always adhere to your specific school's regalia requirements so that you are allowed to participate fully in commencement exercises. Different types of degrees require varying academic hoods. To make sure that you acquire the correct kind of hood, inform your provider whether you are earning an Associate's degree, Bachelor's degree, Master's degree, or Doctoral degree. An Associate's degree hood is usually worn flat against the back like a cape or cowl. Note that Associate's hoods are not as commonly worn as graduate degree hoods--you might not need a hood to be a part of your regalia. A Bachelor's degree hood is 3 feet long and does not end in a sharp point. Note that Bachelor's hoods are not as commonly worn as graduate degree hoods--you might not need a hood to be a part of your regalia. A Master's degree hood is 3.5 feet long and comes to a point at the bottom. A Doctoral hood is the longest hood at 4 feet long. It has the sharpest point and also the largest trim of all hoods. If you’re not using the university provider, it’s important to double check that your regalia adheres to school standards. Make sure that your regalia provider has all the relevant institutional information so that you match your fellow graduates. American universities have a standard set of colors that indicate your field of study, rather than just your degree. These fields determine the color of the velvet trim that lines your hood. European universities are not standardized in the same way as American universities. Check with your institution to make sure you are purchasing the correct academic hood. Law students, for example, wear hoods trimmed in purple, while all Ph.D. students wear hoods trimmed in royal blue.","response":"This article explains the process of obtaining academic regalia for various degrees, emphasizing the importance of adhering to the specific school's requirements and understanding the different types of academic hoods based on one's degree, while also discussing the options of renting, purchasing, or borrowing regalia and the difference in American and European universities' traditions."},{"question":"facebook says that it’s not the social network’s fault, it’s yours.

In two tweets Thursday evening, Trump accused the Canadian prime minister, as well as French President Emmanuel Macron, of “charging the U.S. massive tariffs” and creating “non-monetary barriers.” Trump also said Trudeau was being “indignant” about the cross-border trade relationship. Later Thursday night, Trump took to Twitter again to urge the European Union and Canada to “Take down your tariffs & barriers or we will more than match you!” Trump’s tweets came after Macron threatened to exclude the United States from the G-7 final statement to be issued in the mountainous tourism destination of Charlevoix. In his own tweets in French and English, Macron stated that while Trump “may not mind being isolated” the other six leaders meeting in Canada would also not mind signing an agreement among themselves. “American jobs are on the line because of his actions and because of his administration,” Trudeau said at a joint news conference with Macron earlier in the day in Ottawa. “When we can underscore this, and we see that there’s a lot of pressure within the U.S., perhaps he will revise his position.” “A trade war doesn’t spare anyone,” Macron said. “It will start to hurt American workers. The cost of raw materials will rise and industry will become less competitive.” After the contentious salvos on social media and the Trudeau-Macron news conference, the White House announced Trump would depart the summit at 10:30 a.m. Saturday, following the session on women’s empowerment. \\"The president will travel directly to Singapore from Canada in anticipation of his upcoming meeting with North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un Tuesday.

Article: Having a child may improve a woman's memory, a new study suggests. In the study, women who were new mothers scored better on tests of visuospatial memory - the ability to understand and remember information about their surroundings--compared with women who didn't have children. The findings contradicts the old belief that women develop\\"baby brain\\" or a decline in memory and cognitive function, after they have kids, said study researcher Melissa Santiago, a doctoral student at Carlos Albizu University in Miami. \\"You don't have to feel that because you have kids, your memory isn't the same,\\" Santiago said. The study was small, and the findings will have to be tested in larger groups of people, Santiago said. Previous studies on the topic have had mixed results--some showed motherhood hurts cognition, and others showed the opposite. Studies on rats show those with pups have better memory than those without offspring. Santiago analyzed information from 35 first-time mothers whose children were ages 10 to 24 months, and 35 women who had never been pregnant. Both groups scored similarly on intelligence tests. The average age of mothers was 29 and the average age of never-pregnant women was 27. To test visuospatial memory, the women were shown a paper containing six symbols for 10 seconds, and then asked to draw what they remembered. This task was repeated several times. The first time women were shown the paper, both groups remembered about the same amount. But on the second and third pass, mothers performed better than those without children, indicating that the mothers collected more information each time than the other women. Later, the women were shown a variety of different symbols, and asked to remember which ones were presented on the earlier task. Mothers did not make a mistake in this task--they remembered every symbol correctly--but those without children made one or two errors, Santiago said.

The good news: Those who stopped drinking reduced their risk of cancer in the larynx, throat, and liver, with the risk continuing to fall the longer they steered clear of booze. (Good thing we're drinking less.)","response":"Title: Health Experts Call for Warning Labels on Alcohol as New Study Links Its Consumption to Cancer Introduction Health experts are advocating for the implementation of warning labels on alcoholic beverages, similar to those found on tobacco products, due to a new study that has established a direct connection between alcohol consumption and at least seven forms of cancer. The study, published in the journal Addiction, cautions that even light drinkers are at a heightened risk. Findings After analyzing data from a 10-year span provided by organizations like the World Cancer Research Fund, researchers have concluded that alcohol consumption directly causes not only liver cancer, but also cancer of the colon, rectum, breast, oropharynx, larynx, and esophagus, as reported by the Guardian. Study author Jennie Connor notes that heavier drinkers face the highest risks, but even those with low to moderate consumption experience a significant burden. According to Connor, there is actually no safe level of alcohol consumption when considering the risk of cancer. As CNET puts it, \\"you booze, you lose.\\" Consuming 50 grams of alcohol per day (approximately 2.6 beers or about three 6-ounce glasses of wine) results in a four to seven times greater risk of cancer in the oropharynx, larynx, and esophagus and a 1.5 times greater risk of the other cancers mentioned, compared to not consuming alcohol at all, as stated by Live Science. Connor also suggests that alcohol may cause skin, prostate, and pancreatic cancer. Furthermore, the supposed benefits of alcohol consumption are now seen by experts as less relevant compared to the increased risk of developing various forms of cancer. Mechanism While scientists remain uncertain of the exact mechanism by which alcohol leads to cancer, one possible explanation is the damage caused by acetaldehyde, a compound formed when alcohol breaks down. Acetaldehyde damages the DNA of cells in the mouth, throat, esophagus, and liver. Silver Lining Fortunately, research has shown that individuals who quit drinking can reduce their risk of cancer in the larynx, throat, and liver, with the risk continuing to decrease the longer they abstain from alcohol consumption. Conclusion As evidence of the direct link between alcohol and various forms of cancer continues to mount, it is crucial for consumers to be aware of the potential risks associated with drinking, regardless of the amount. The introduction of warning labels on alcoholic beverages could serve as a vital step in promoting public health and informing individuals about the potential dangers related to alcohol consumption."},{"question":"Current Supreme Court precedent, in Texas v. White, holds that the states cannot secede from the union by an act of the state. More recently, Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia stated, \`\`If there was any constitutional issue resolved by the Civil War, it is that there is no right to secede.'' Can we conclude that does texas still have the right to secede?","response":"To address this question, let's go through the necessary steps to analyze the given context and determine whether Texas still has the right to secede. Step 1: Analyze the Texas v. White precedent Texas v. White is a Supreme Court case from 1869 that concluded that states cannot unilaterally secede from the United States. The Court ruled that the Constitution did not provide for the secession of states, and that any such attempt to secede would be considered void. This means that according to the precedent set by Texas v. White, Texas does not have the right to secede. Step 2: Consider Justice Antonin Scalia's statement Justice Scalia's statement reinforces the ruling in Texas v. White, emphasizing that the Civil War resolved any questions regarding the constitutionality of secession. His statement further supports the notion that there is no constitutional right for a state to secede from the union. Step 3: Evaluate any changes in legal or political context While it is important to recognize that the legal and political context may change over time, there has been no significant development, case law, or amendment to the Constitution that would indicate a shift in the Supreme Court's stance on secession since Texas v. White and Scalia's statement. Step 4: Check for any potential legal loopholes or exceptions It is also essential to consider whether there could be any legal loopholes or exceptions that might grant Texas the right to secede. However, based on the current legal framework and constitutional interpretation, no such loopholes or exceptions are apparent. Step 5: Conclusion Taking into account the precedent set by Texas v. White, the statement made by Justice Scalia, the lack of significant legal or political changes, and the absence of any identified legal loopholes or exceptions, we can conclude that, at present, Texas does not have the right to secede from the United States."},{"question":"How is \\"The more you increase the value of the parameter, the more blurred are the strokes and the less is the detail.

If you spend three hours or more a day in front of a computer (and at this point, who doesn't?), you are more easily harmed by the _ . We have got so used to using computers that we often neglect to think of them as dangerous sources of harmful radiation. A safe amount of radiation is 25 V/m (Volts/meter). Do you want to guess how much our personal computers give off? Keyboard: 1000 V/m Mouse: 450 V/m Monitor: 218V/m CPU: 170V/m Notebook computers: 2,500 V/m Ways of Protect Yourself from Harmful Computer Radiation 1. Decorate your desk with cactus plants, they take in radiation. 2. Drink two to three cups of green tea a day and eat an orange daily. The vitamins in tea leaves and oranges protect us from radiation and keep our eyes healthy as well. 3. Use a screen filter for your monitor. 4. Avoid having metal objects nearby on your desk. 5. Put the back of the computer to the wall. Most of the radiation comes off the back. 6. Keep your monitor at least 50cm away from your face. 7. Keep your computer rooms ventilated . 8. Eat healthily-----especially fruits and vegetables. 9. Don't fall asleep on your computer. Turn it off if you have to rest nearby. The ways above are useful, why not have a try at once?

The first stable line-up consisted of Brian Jones (guitar, harmonica), Mick Jagger (lead vocals), Keith Richards (guitar, backing vocals), Bill Wyman (bass), Charlie Watts (drums), and Ian Stewart (piano). Stewart was removed from the official line-up in 1963 but continued as a touring member until his death in 1985. Jones left the band less than a month before his death in 1969, having already been replaced by Mick Taylor, who remained until 1974. Since their formation in 1962, the Rolling Stones survived multiple feuds and have gone on to release 30 studio albums, 13 live albums and 109 singles. According to OfficialCharts.com, the Stones are ranked the fourth bestselling group of all time, with their top single being \\"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\\", regarded by many at the time as \\"the classic example of rock and roll.\\" The Stones have also contributed to the blues lexicon, creating their own \\"codewords\\" and slang, which they have used throughout their catalog of songs, including some of their more popular songs. The band has been viewed as the musical \\"vanguard of a major transfusion\\" of various cultural attitudes, making them accessible to youth in both America and Britain. Muddy Waters was quoted as stating that the Rolling Stones and other English bands enhanced the interest of American youth into blues musicians; after they came to the United States, sales of Waters' albums - and those of other blues musicians - increased with public interest, thus helping to reconnect the country with its own music. The Rolling Stones have sold over 240 million albums worldwide and have held over 48 tours of varying length. The Stones have also held three of the highest grossing tours of all time, Bridges to Babylon, Voodoo Lounge, and A Bigger Bang. In May 2013, Rolling Stone declared them the \\"most definitional band that rock & roll has produced,\\" with the Telegraph stating that Mick Jagger was \\"the Rolling Stone who changed music\\". The band has been the subject of numerous documentaries and were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by Pete Townshend in 1989. The Rolling Stones have inspired and mentored new generations of musical artists both as a band and individually. They are also credited with changing the \\"whole business model of popular music.\\" The band has received - and been nominated for - multiple awards during their 55 years as a band; including three Grammy awards (and 12 nominations), the Juno award for International Entertainer of the Year in 1991, U.K.'s Jazz FM Awards Album of the Year (2017) for their album Blue & Lonesome, and NME awards such as best live band and the NME award for best music film, for their documentary Crossfire Hurricane.

Today the \\"vaquero\\" is still a part of the \\"doma vaquera,\\" the Spanish tradition of working riding. The \\"vaquero\\" traditions developed in Mexico from methodology brought to Mesoamerica from Spain also became the foundation for the North American cowboy.The \\"vaqueros\\" of the Americas were the horsemen and cattle herders of Spanish Mexico, who first came to California with the Jesuit priest Eusebio Kino in 1687, and later with expeditions in 1769 and the Juan Bautista de Anza expedition in 1774.

Public relations may include an organization or individual gaining exposure to their audiences using topics of public interest and news items that do not require direct payment. This differentiates it from advertising as a form of marketing communications. Public relations is the idea of creating coverage for clients for free, rather than marketing or advertising. An example of good public relations would be generating an article featuring a client, rather than paying for the client to be advertised next to the article. The aim of public relations is to inform the public, prospective customers, investors, partners, employees, and other stakeholders and ultimately persuade them to maintain a certain view about the organization, its leadership, products, or political decisions. Public relations professionals typically work for PR and marketing firms, businesses and companies, government, government agencies and public officials as PIOs and nongovernmental organizations, and nonprofit organizations. Jobs central to public relations include account coordinator, account executive, account supervisor, and media relations manager. - Clarence Hailey Long , Jr. , often known as C.H.

Gunpowder, until superseded, was a universal explosive used in the military and for civil engineering: both applications required storage magazines. Most magazines were purely functional and tended to be in remote and secure locations. - A department store or magazine is a retail establishment offering a wide range of consumer goods in different product categories known as \\"departments\\". In modern major cities, the department store made a dramatic appearance in the middle of the 19th century, and permanently reshaped shopping habits, and the definition of service and luxury. Similar developments were under way in London (with Whiteleys), in Paris (\\"Le Bon Marché\\" in 1852) and in New York (with Stewart's). - Nuevo León, or New Leon, officially the Free and Sovereign State of Nuevo León, is one of the 31 states which, with Mexico City, compose the 32 Federal Entities of Mexico. It is divided into 51 municipalities and its capital city is Monterrey. - Rodeo (or ) is a competitive sport that arose out of the working practices of cattle herding in Spain, Mexico, and later Central America, the United States, Canada, South America, Australia and New Zealand. It was based on the skills required of the working vaqueros and later, cowboys, in what today is the western United States, western Canada, and northern Mexico. Today it is a sporting event that involves horses and other livestock, designed to test the skill and speed of the cowboys and cowgirls. American style professional rodeos generally comprise the following events: tie-down roping, team roping, steer wrestling, saddle bronc riding, bareback bronc riding, bull riding and barrel racing. The events are divided into two basic categories: the rough stock events and the timed events. Depending on sanctioning organization and region, other events such as breakaway roping, goat tying, or pole bending may also be a part of some rodeos. - A tradition is a belief or behavior passed down within a group or society with symbolic meaning or special significance with origins in the past. Common examples include holidays or impractical but socially meaningful clothes (like lawyers' wigs or military officers' spurs), but the idea has also been applied to social norms such as greetings. Traditions can persist and evolve for thousands of yearsthe word \\"tradition\\" itself derives from the Latin \\"tradere\\" or \\"traderer\\" literally meaning to transmit, to hand over, to give for safekeeping. While it is commonly assumed that traditions have ancient history, many traditions have been invented on purpose, whether that be political or cultural, over short periods of time. Various academic disciplines also use the word in a variety of ways. - An online magazine is a magazine published on the Internet, through bulletin board systems and other forms of public computer networks. One of the first magazines to convert from a print magazine format to being online only was the computer magazine Datamation. - A cowboy is an animal herder who tends cattle on ranches in North America, traditionally on horseback, and often performs a multitude of other ranch-related tasks. The historic American cowboy of the late 19th century arose from the \\"vaquero\\" traditions of northern Mexico and became a figure of special significance and legend. A subtype, called a wrangler, specifically tends the horses used to work cattle. In addition to ranch work, some cowboys work for or participate in rodeos. Cowgirls, first defined as such in the late 19th century, had a less-well documented historical role, but in the modern world have established the ability to work at virtually identical tasks and obtained considerable respect for their achievements. There are also cattle handlers in many other parts of the world, particularly South America and Australia, who perform work similar to the cowboy in their respective nations. - To publish is to make content available to the general public. While specific use of the term may vary among countries, it is usually applied to text, images, or other audio-visual content on any traditional medium, including paper (newspapers, magazines, catalogs, etc.).

It was admitted to the union as the 47th state on January 6, 1912. It is usually considered one of the Mountain States. New Mexico is fifth by area, the 36th-most populous, and the sixth-least densely populated of the 50 United States. - A herder is a worker who lives a possibly semi-nomadic life, caring for various domestic animals, in places where these animals wander pasture lands. - Oklahoma (Cherokee: \\"Asgaya gigageyi\\" / ; or transliterated from English as (\\"òàlàhoma\\"), Pawnee: \\"Uukuhuúwa\\", Cayuga: \\"Gahnawiyogeh\\") is a state located in the South Central United States. Oklahoma is the 20th-most extensive and the 28th-most populous of the 50 United States. The state's name is derived from the Choctaw words \\"okla\\" and \\"humma\\", meaning \\"red people\\". It is also known informally by its nickname, \\"The Sooner State\\", in reference to the non-Native settlers who staked their claims on the choicest pieces of land before the official opening date, and the Indian Appropriations Act of 1889, which opened the door for white settlement in America's Indian Territory. The name was settled upon statehood, Oklahoma Territory and Indian Territory were merged and Indian was dropped from the name. On November 16, 1907, Oklahoma became the 46th state to enter the union. Its residents are known as \\"Oklahomans\\", or informally \\"Okies\\", and its capital and largest city is Oklahoma City. - Radio is the technology of using radio waves to carry information, such as sound, by systematically modulating properties of electromagnetic energy waves transmitted through space, such as their amplitude, frequency, phase, or pulse width. When radio waves strike an electrical conductor, the oscillating fields induce an alternating current in the conductor. The information in the waves can be extracted and transformed back into its original form. - The JA Ranch, jointly founded by John George Adair and Charles Goodnight, is the oldest privately owned cattle ranch in the Palo Duro Canyon section of the Texas Panhandle southeast of Amarillo. At its peak size in 1883, the JA, still run by descendants of the Adair family, encompassed some of land in six counties and a herd of 100,000 cattle. The name \\"JA\\" is derived from the initials of John Adair, a businessman from Ireland. Goodnight managed and expanded the ranch, while Adair provided the working capital. Upon Adair's death, his wife, the former Cornelia Wadsworth Ritchie, took over Adair's interest in the JA. In 1888, Goodnight left the arrangement to establish his own ranch and in time ventured into other business activities, as well. The ranch was added to the National Register of Historic Places listings in Armstrong County, Texas in 1966. - H.O.R.S.E. is a form of poker commonly played at the high-stakes tables of casinos. It consists of rounds of play cycling among: - The Marlboro Man is a figure used in tobacco advertising campaigns for Marlboro cigarettes.

The advertisements were originally conceived as a way to popularize filtered cigarettes, which at the time were considered feminine. - A U.S. state is a constituent political entity of the United States of America. There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody). - Advertising is an audio or visual form of marketing communication that employs an openly sponsored, nonpersonal message to promote or sell a product, service or idea. Sponsors of advertising are often businesses who wish to promote their products or services. Advertising is differentiated from public relations in that an advertiser usually pays for and has control over the message. It is differentiated from personal selling in that the message is nonpersonal, i.e., not directed to a particular individual. Advertising is communicated through various mass media, including old media such as newspapers, magazines, Television, Radio, outdoor advertising or direct mail; or new media such as search results, blogs, websites or text messages. The actual presentation of the message in a medium is referred to as an advertisement or \\"ad\\". - A magazine is a publication, usually a periodical publication, which is printed or electronically published (sometimes referred to as an online magazine). Magazines are generally published on a regular schedule and contain a variety of content. They are generally financed by advertising, by a purchase price, by prepaid subscriptions, or a combination of the three.At its root, the word \\"magazine\\" refers to a collection or storage location. In the case of written publication, it is a collection of written articles. This explains why magazine publications share the word root with gunpowder magazines, artillery magazines, firearms magazines, and, in French, retail stores such as department stores. - Personal selling process refers to a process that occurs when a sales representative meets with a potential client for the purpose of transacting a sale. Many sales representatives rely on a sequential sales process that typically includes nine steps. Some sales representatives develop scripts for all or part of the sales process.
