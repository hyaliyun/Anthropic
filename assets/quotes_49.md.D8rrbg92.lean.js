(CNN) -- Among the 35,000 runners lining up at this Sunday's London Marathon, there'll be the usual pre-race nerves, waves of excitement, and focus on the task ahead. This year, there will also be silence. Six days after Boston's Marathon was rocked by the bombing which killed three people and injured more than 180, the world will be turning its gaze to London's premier race. It will be unlike any other race in its 32-year history, as thousands of competitors and spectators observe a 30-second silence ahead of the starting gun, in remembrance of Boston's casualties. Haunting images of bloodied victims scrambling down smoldering streets, past upturned stands which just moments earlier had been filled with cheering family and friends, will no doubt loom large in the minds of Londoners this weekend. \\"We've no reason to think people are any less safe than they were before the terrible events in","response":"Well, little one, this story is about a big running race called the London Marathon. A sad thing happened at another race called the Boston Marathon, where some people got hurt because of a bombing. So, during the London Marathon, all the runners and people watching decided to be quiet for 30 seconds before the race started. This was their way of showing respect for the people who got hurt in Boston and remembering them.

Sega's financial troubles led to several major structural changes at the company in the early 2000s, with development division United Game Artists being absorbed by Sonic Team in 2003, and Sonic Team USA eventually becoming Sega Studios USA in 2004. - Sonic Crackers , also sometimes referred to as Sonic Stadium ( due to the ROM header containing the title Sonic Studium ( sic ) ) , is an early Sonic the Hedgehog prototype video game for the Sega Genesis . While it was never officially released in the form of a Sonic the Hedgehog game , the concepts , engine , and various other materials in the prototype were subsequently implemented in the Sega 32X game Knuckles ' Chaotix in 1995 , and the prototype itself is widely circulated on the internet . - A 16-bit register can store 2 different values. The signed range of integer values that can be stored in 16 bits is -32,768 (-1 × 2) through 32,767 (2 - 1); the unsigned range is 0 through 65,535 (2 - 1). Since 2 is 65,536, a processor with 16-bit memory addresses can directly access 64 KiB of byte-addressable memory. - A Platform game (or platformer) is a video game which involves guiding an avatar to jump between suspended platforms and/or over obstacles to advance the game. The player controls the jumps to avoid letting the avatar fall from platforms or miss necessary jumps. The most common unifying element of games of this genre is the jump button, but now there are other alternative like swiping in touchscreen. \\"Jumping\\", in this genre, may include swinging from extendable arms, as in \\"Ristar\\" or \\"Bionic Commando\\", or bouncing from springboards or trampolines, as in \\"Alpha Waves\\". These mechanics, even in the context of other genres, are commonly called \\"platforming\\", a verbification of \\"platform\\". Games where jumping is automated completely, such as 3D games in \\"The Legend of Zelda\\" series, fall outside of the genre. - The is a third-generation home video game console that was manufactured by Sega. It was originally released in 1985 as the Sega Mark III in Japan. After being redesigned prior to its North American launch, the console was renamed Master System and released in 1986 in North America, 1987 in Europe, and 1989 in Brazil. The redesigned Master System was also released in Japan in 1987. Both the Mark III and the original Master System models could play with both cartridges (or \\"Mega Cartridges\\", as they were officially called) and the credit card-sized Sega Cards, which retailed at lower prices than cartridges but had lower storage capacity; the Master System II and later models did not have the card slot. The Master System also featured accessories such as a light gun and 3D glasses which were designed to work with a range of specially coded games. - Australasia, a region of Oceania, comprises Australia, New Zealand, the island of New Guinea, and neighbouring islands in the Pacific Ocean. Charles de Brosses coined the term (as French \\"Australasie\\") in \\"Histoire des navigations aux terres australes\\" (1756). He derived it from the Latin for \\"south of Asia\\" and differentiated the area from Polynesia (to the east) and the southeast Pacific (Magellanica). The bulk of Australasia sits on the Indo-Australian Plate, together with India. - A video game is an electronic game that involves human or animal interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word \\"video\\" in \\"video game\\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images.

Sport fishermen keep tension on their lines to prevent hooked fish from releasing. A molecular version of this angler's trick, operating at kinetochores, ensures accuracy during mitosis: the mitotic spindle attaches randomly to chromosomes and then correctly bioriented attachments are stabilized due to the tension exerted on them by opposing microtubules. Incorrect attachments, which lack tension, are unstable and release quickly, allowing another chance for biorientation. Stabilization of molecular interactions by tension also occurs in other physiological contexts, such as cell adhesion, motility, hemostasis, and tissue morphogenesis. Here, we review models for the stabilization of kinetochore attachments with an eye toward emerging models for other force-activated systems.

This answer is incorrect because camouflage makeup does not consist of masks. Instead, it is a special type of makeup designed to blend in with your natural skin tone and cover vitiligo patches. 2. This answer is also incorrect, as camouflage make-up is not a type of mask. Rather, it is a cosmetic product that is formulated specifically to cover skin discolorations. 4. This answer is not relevant to the question, as it discusses clothing options rather than makeup techniques for covering vitiligo patches. Skim camouflage make-up is the appropriate choice for effectively concealing vitiligo and giving a natural appearance."},{"question":"Given the question: Did Arne Sucksdorff and Seth Grahame-Smith work in the same industry?

For their study,he and his colleagues randomly divide 565 preschoolers into two groups.In one group,parents recorded notes about kids' normal TV viewing,without receiving any guidelines to reduce or change those habits.In the other group,researchers made visits and calls and sent monthly newsletters encouraging parents to replace violent TV with educational programming.After six and 12 months,parents reported their kid's angry,aggressive or anxious behaviors on a questionnaire.At both time points,children in the TV intervention program had slightly fewer problems than those in the comparison group.Boys in lowincome families seemed to benefit most from the change in programming,the researchers found. \\"The point is,this is something that is as effective as other things we do to try to guide behavior in children,and it's fairly simple,\\" Christakis said. Another study published in Pediatrics found the more TV kids and teens watched,the more likely they were to have a crime or other problems in society.Children may imitate violence they see--or more time in front of the TV could simply mean less communication with peers and families,and worse performance in school.

By improving your eating habits, you will decrease your body fat and fatigue, while gaining muscle and endurance. Not eating right could be what is holding you back from breaking your 800m record. Eat a variety of wholesome foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean meats. This will improve your body composition. Increase protein and the right amount of carbohydrates, as these will provide your body with the nutrients to build muscle and to give your body energy. If you’re training for 30-45 minutes, shoot for about 3 grams (0.11 oz) of carbs on training days. If you’re training for 46-60 minutes, shoot for about 5 grams (0.18 oz) of carbs on training days. Avoid processed high-sugar and high-sodium foods. These will hinder your body from running efficiently. Eat the right pre and post-workout carbohydrate-rich snacks. These should be consumed an hour before working out and within 30 minutes after a workout. Bananas, protein shakes and non-caffeinated energy bars are ideal. Your body needs about two liters on an average day to stay properly hydrated.On days when running, you need to drink extra water to compensate for your output and prevent yourself from slowing down. Don’t just chug extra water though; listen to your body and drink when thirsty. Pre and post-workout hydration is vital. An hour before you start your run, try to drink about 16 ounces (450 g) of water. Drink the same amount of water after running. Look for signs of dehydration. Feeling thirsty or experiencing dry mouth, headaches, light-headedness, lack of urination and constipation are all the body's ways of letting you know that you are dehydrated. If you begin to experience any of these symptoms, it's best to increase your water intake. By stretching properly, you can improve your stride and your stride length (increasing your speed). Stretching before and after your workout will also help to prevent injury. Muscles to stretch include your leg muscles (hamstrings, quadriceps and adductors) and your lower body (hip flexors and glutes). Try to add two or three longer stretch routines a week to your workout schedule. Do some yoga to help you with your flexibility. You won’t be able to run a faster 800m in one day. Just like training for a marathon, the best way to achieve your goals is to set a schedule. By following a training plan you can perform at a peak performance, even when running a shorter distance. Set an end date and work backward. Even with an 800m run, pick a date that you want to accomplish this run with your best time ever. Do one or two quality and intense workouts a week. These include running hills or tempo runs. Pick rest days where you can do some other sort of moderate exercise like yoga to stay limber. Ensure that you get enough sleep before the race.","response":"This article emphasizes the importance of proper nutrition, hydration, stretching, and following a training plan to improve your 800m record by enhancing muscle strength, endurance, and body composition."},{"question":"Add punctuation to the following sentence: Measuring more than 1 000 decitex less than 10 metric number 5307 10 90","response":"Measuring more than 1,000 decitex, less than 10 metric number, 5307 10 90.

Options: - wisconsin - countryside - fields - front yard - backyard The answer is \\"front yard\\" because Answer:","response":"The answer \\"front yard\\" is appropriate because a large personal apple tree can typically be found in a residential area within the homeowner's property boundaries. Apple trees are not only grown for their fruits but also for their ornamental value. In this case, the front yard could be an ideal location for a homeowner to plant and showcase a beautiful apple tree. However, it is important to note that all the options provided can potentially be correct answers, depending on the context and preferences of the tree owner. Here's why: 1. Wisconsin: Apple trees can thrive in Wisconsin, as the state has a suitable climate for growing various apple varieties. Hence, a large personal apple tree might be found in Wisconsin. 2. Countryside: Countryside areas provide ample space for planting and growing large trees. A person living in the countryside might have a spacious yard or nearby fields where they could plant an apple tree. 3. Fields: If someone owns a field or land, they might choose to plant an apple tree there. Fields often have the advantage of open space and sunlight, which are essential for apple trees to grow. 4. Backyard: Similar to the front yard, a backyard is another common location for planting a large personal apple tree. Some homeowners may prefer to grow their apple tree in the backyard for privacy or to take advantage of better growing conditions, such as sunlight and soil quality. In conclusion, while planting an apple tree in the front yard is a plausible answer due to the prominence and ornamental value of the tree, other options like Wisconsin, countryside, fields, and backyard can also be accurate, as they all provide suitable environments for growing apple trees. The final choice depends on the preferences, circumstances, and location of the tree owner."},{"question":"Answer the following question: What would be the ★-rating of this review (★ being the lowest and ★★★★★ being the highest)? \\"Doesn't connect\\" Answer:","response":"★"},{"question":"I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.

He arrived in the United States two years later. His father, a cabinet maker, had moved to New York City shortly before Bobby's birth and sent for his family in 1925. Thomson grew up on Staten Island in New York City and signed with the New York Giants for a 100 bonus right out of Curtis High School in 1942. Thomson became a celebrity for his walk-off home run off Brooklyn Dodgers pitcher Ralph Branca to win the 1951 National League pennant. The home run, nicknamed the \\"Shot Heard 'Round the World\\", was dramatic as, until 1969, league pennants were only decided by playoff when the teams involved finished the regular season in a tie. Prior to 1951 playoffs had only been necessary in 1946 (NL) and 1948 (AL). Although in mid-August the Giants were 13 1/2 games behind the league-leading Dodgers, they won 37 of their final 44 games to tie Brooklyn on the final day of the regular season, forcing a three-game playoff. The Giants won the first game 3-1 as a result of a two-run home run by Thomson (off Branca). Brooklyn's Clem Labine shut out the Giants in the second game, 10-0. The decisive contest, played on October 3 at the Polo Grounds, was the first major sporting event televised coast-to-coast in the United States. The Dodgers took a 4-1 lead into the bottom of the ninth inning; but Giants shortstop Alvin Dark singled, advanced to third on a single by Don Mueller, and scored on a double by Whitey Lockman. With Lockman on second and pinch-runner Clint Hartung at third, Thomson's walk-off home run turned looming defeat into a 5-4 victory. The moment was immortalized by Giants play-by-play announcer Russ Hodges's excited multiple repetitions: \\"The Giants win the pennant! The Giants win the pennant!\\" Waiting in the on-deck circle to hit behind Thomson was rookie Willie Mays. The Giants' season ended, however, at the 1951 World Series; the Yankees swept the last three games to win the best-of-seven series, 4 games to 2. Thomson batted .238 in the Series with no home runs. The bat from the \\"Shot Heard 'Round the World\\" is in the collection of the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York. The uniform worn by Thomson on that day is apparently a part of a large private collection owned by Dan Scheinman, a member of the San Francisco Giants ownership group. What was Bobby Thomson's role in this?","response":"Bobby Thomson was a baseball player who played an important part in helping the New York Giants win a big game.

(Jacquelyn Martin/AP) As he jetted to Paris last Friday, President Trump received a congratulatory phone call aboard Air Force One. British Prime Minister Theresa May was calling to celebrate the Republican Party’s wins in the midterm elections — never mind that Democrats seized control of the House — but her appeal to the American president’s vanity was met with an ornery outburst. Trump berated May for Britain not doing enough, in his assessment, to contain Iran. He questioned her over Brexit and complained about the trade deals he sees as unfair with European countries. May has endured Trump’s churlish temper before, but still her aides were shaken by his especially foul mood, according to U.S. and European officials briefed on the conversation. For Trump, that testy call set the tone for five days of fury — evident in Trump’s splenetic tweets and described in interviews with 14 senior administration officials, outside Trump confidants and foreign diplomats, many of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue. “He was frustrated with the trip. And he’s itching to make some changes,” said one senior White House official. “This is a week where things could get really dicey.” During his 43-hour stay in Paris, Trump brooded over the Florida recounts and sulked over key races being called for Democrats in the midterm elections that he had claimed as a “big victory.” He erupted at his staff over media coverage of his decision to skip a ceremony honoring the military sacrifice of World War I. The president also was angry and resentful over French President Emmanuel Macron’s public rebuke of rising nationalism, which Trump considered a personal attack. And that was after his difficult meeting with Macron, where officials said little progress was made as Trump again brought up his frustrations over trade and Iran. “He’s just a bull carrying his own china shop with him when­ever he travels the world,” presidential historian Douglas Brinkley said. People react in front of a large inflatable blimp depicting President Trump in Republique Square in Paris on Nov. 11, 2018. (Vadim Ghirda/AP) Meanwhile, Trump was plotting a shake-up in his administration. He told advisers over the weekend that he had decided to remove Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and that he also was seriously considering replacing White House chief of staff John F. Kelly, who scrambled early this week to try to save Nielsen’s job. The senior White House official, who speaks to the president regularly, said Trump has been grousing lately about getting rid of Kelly. “But he’s done this three or four times before,” this person said. “Nothing is ever real until he sends the tweet.” [In Paris, a relatively understated Trump finds he’s still the center of the world’s attention — and outrage] During Sunday’s flight to Washington from Paris, aides filed into the president’s private cabin to lobby against the leading contender to replace Kelly, Nick Ayers, who is Vice President Pence’s chief of staff. These aides told Trump that appointing Ayers would lower staff morale and perhaps trigger an exodus. But the president has continued to praise Ayers, who also enjoys the support of Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, according to multiple White House officials. First lady Melania Trump shared her husband’s irritation and impatience with some of the staff. On Tuesday, amid reports that the president had decided to oust deputy national security adviser Mira R. Ricardel over tensions between her and other administration officials, the first lady’s office issued an extraordinary statement to reporters calling for her firing. “It is the position of the Office of the First Lady that she no longer deserves the honor of serving in this White House,” said Stephanie Grisham, the first lady’s spokeswoman. Melania Trump said in an October interview with ABC News that the president had people working for him whom she did not trust and that she has let her husband know. “Some people, they don’t work there anymore,” the first lady said. White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly has been trying to save the job of Kirstjen Nielsen, the secretary of homeland security. (Kevin Lamarque/Reuters) In her role as No. 2 to national security adviser John Bolton, Ricardel berated colleagues in meetings, yelled at military aides and White House professional staff, argued with Melania Trump regarding her recent trip to Africa and spread rumors about Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, according to three current and two former White House officials. Kelly has sought for months to oust Ricardel, calling her a problematic hire in the West Wing, and Mattis has told advisers that he wants her out as well, the officials said. A National Security Council spokesman did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday. Grisham’s statement was remarkable because it is so unusual for a first lady or her East Wing staff to weigh in on personnel matters elsewhere in the White House, particularly in the realm of national security. Last week, the tumult began even before Trump took off for Paris. After directing Attorney General Jeff Sessions to resign, controversy swirled around acting attorney general Matthew G. Whitaker’s qualifications for the job, business entanglements and previous public opposition to the Russia investigation. [‘When you lose that power’: How John Kelly faded as White House disciplinarian] As Trump walked out of the White House residence to board the Marine One helicopter on Friday morning, he paused to answer questions from the press corps and snapped when CNN correspondent Abby Phillip asked whether he wanted Whitaker to rein in special counsel Robert S. Mueller III. “What a stupid question that is,” Trump said. “What a stupid question. But I watch you a lot. You ask a lot of stupid questions.” Later, aboard Air Force One, Trump again lost his cool, this time during his phone call with May. He berated the British prime minister on Iran, trade and Brexit, among other topics. The White House did not announce that the call took place nor did it provide an official readout, but U.S. and European officials said in interviews that Trump’s mood was sour and his conversation with May was acrimonious. On his flight there and throughout the weekend, Trump was preoccupied by political developments back in the United States. He watched TV with rapt attention as late-counting votes resulted in the Senate race in Arizona and a number of House contests to slip out of Republican hands, and as recounts got underway in Florida’s Senate and gubernatorial races. He also complained about the lack of congressional funding for his promised wall at the U.S.-Mexico border. Trump sent political aides in Washington scrambling to prepare detailed briefings for him on the still-to-be-called races. He aired baseless allegations of voter irregularities on Twitter — writing from the plane that elections attorney Marc Elias was the Democrats’ “best Election stealing lawyer” but that he would send “much better lawyers to expose the FRAUD!” Still, the president told aides he felt disconnected from the action in his suite at the U.S. ambassador’s residence in Paris — even as he consumed countless hours of television news on the trip. “Trump needs adulation, so heading into the midterms, holding these rallies, he was cheered and it became narcissistic fuel to his engine,” Brinkley said. “After the midterm, it’s the sober dawn of the morning.” Rain pours on President Trump and his lectern with the presidential seal during the commemoration ceremony for Armistice Day at the Suresnes American Cemetery and Memorial in Paris on Nov. 11, 2018. (Carlos Barria/Reuters) Trump was awake Saturday well before dawn, if he got much sleep at all, tweeting at 4:52 a.m. Paris time a two-part defense of Whitaker as “highly thought of” and “outstanding.” Later in the day, he scuttled plans to attend a ceremony honoring the military sacrifice of World War I at an American cemetery outside the French capital, citing bad weather. Trump was told that morning by Deputy White House Chief of Staff Zachary D. Fuentes that the Secret Service had concerns about flying Marine One through the rain and fog from Paris to the cemetery 50 miles away, and that a motorcade could be lengthy and snarl traffic in the area, according to one senior White House official. Trump chose not to make the trip, and Kelly, a retired Marine Corps general, and Marine Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, attended in his stead. But Trump quickly grew infuriated by a torrent of tweets and media coverage suggesting that the president was afraid of the rain and did not respect veterans. [Critics pile on after Trump cancels visit to U.S. military cemetery outside Paris, citing weather] Former secretary of state John F. Kerry, a decorated Navy veteran of the Vietnam War, tweeted: “President @realDonaldTrump a no-show because of raindrops? Those veterans the president didn’t bother to honor fought in the rain, in the mud, in the snow — & many died in trenches for the cause of freedom. Rain didn’t stop them & it shouldn’t have stopped an American president.” Trump told aides he thought he looked “terrible” and blamed his chief of staff’s office, and Fuentes in particular, for not counseling him that skipping the cemetery visit would be a public-relations nightmare. Trump was still litigating the episode on Tuesday, when he tweeted from the White House that he suggested driving to the cemetery and “Secret Service said NO, too far from airport & big Paris shutdown.” On Sunday, he got angry at Macron for his remarks at a ceremony honoring the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I. The French president denounced rising nationalism around the world and called it a “betrayal of patriotism,” with two of the world’s leading nationalists — Trump and Russian President Vladi­mir Putin — in attendance. Trump told advisers he considered Macron’s comment a personal insult, and it came on the heels of a disagreement between the two leaders over Macron’s call for a “true European army.” At their bilateral meeting on Saturday, Trump appeared subdued and almost sullen. Once he was back home in Washington, Trump unloaded on his French counterpart, likening Macron’s call for a European army to Germany’s military expansion in World War I and World War II. Trump tweeted Tuesday morning, “How did that work out for France? They were starting to learn German in Paris before the U.S. came along. Pay for NATO or not!” Trump also lashed out over trade agreements — “Not fair, must change!” he tweeted — that he argued make it easy for the United States to sell French wines but difficult for France to sell American wines. And then he attacked Macron for his unpopularity in France — while providing a bit of sloganeering advice. “The problem is that Emmanuel suffers from a very low Approval Rating in France, 26%, and an unemployment rate of almost 10%,” Trump wrote on Twitter. “He was just trying to get onto another subject. By the way, there is no country more Nationalist than France, very proud people-and rightfully so!.. MAKE FRANCE GREAT AGAIN!” Jacqueline Alemany and Felicia Sonmez contributed to this report. ||||| White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly and Kirstjen Nielsen, secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, who are close allies, “seem to be on their way out,” the official said, noting recent leaks on the subject. The official cautioned, however, that personnel decisions are never final until Trump himself tweets out the news — often just after the former reality TV star who’s famous for saying “You’re fired!” has directed Kelly to so inform the individual. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","response":"The article outlines a turbulent period in President Donald Trump's administration during the week of his visit to Paris for the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I. It describes several instances of the president losing his temper, including a phone call with British Prime Minister Theresa May in which he berated her for Britain's handling of Iran, Brexit and trade deals with Europe. During his Paris visit, Trump brooded over the Florida recounts and the Democrats' victories in the midterm elections which he deemed a \\"big victory\\" for Republicans. He was also enraged over French President Emmanuel Macron's criticism of rising nationalism which he took as a personal insult. The friction continued within his administration as well, with Trump contemplating replacing Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and White House chief of staff John F. Kelly. This was met with concerns from Aide staff on lowering staff morale and triggering an exodus. First Lady, Melania Trump, also made waves by publicly calling for the firing of White House deputy national security adviser Mira R. Ricardel over Clashes with other administration officials. Furthermore, the president courted controversy with his decision to skip a ceremony honoring the military sacrifice of World War I, eliciting criticisms that he did not respect veterans.

A prologue explains the role of the bounty hunter. A wanted criminal named Burch tries to ambush bounty hunter Jim Kipp, but Kipp gets the better of him. Kipp takes Burch's corpse into town to collect the reward. A representative of the Pinkerton Detective Agency asks Kipp to hunt a trio of fugitives. Three masked men committed a robbery and fled with 100,000. Kipp, who has the reputation that he will do anything for money, is offered a huge reward if he can capture the culprits dead or alive. Kipp rides into the town of Twin Forks, and uses an alias. He seeks information about one fugitive's wounds from Dr. Spencer, who is wary of revealing too much. Kipp is immediately attracted to the doctor's daughter, Julie. A limping man named Bill Rachin, who works at the hotel, draws Kipp's suspicion. So does George Williams, a card dealer. Williams' wife, Alice, flirts with Kipp and tries to coax information out of him. Kipp does not reveal the purpose for his visit. Vance Edwards identifies Kipp and his reputation as a bounty hunter. Edwards mistakenly believes Kipp is seeking him for another crime. The townspeople become anxious as the truth about Kipp becomes known. Led by the postmaster, Danvers, they offer Kipp a bribe to leave town.

Randy has some money in his piggy bank. He spends 2 dollars every time he goes to the store. He makes 4 trips to the store every month. If he had 104 dollars left in his piggy bank after a year, how much money, in dollars, did he have at first?","response":"Step 1: Determine the total amount of money, in dollars, Randy spends on store trips every month. Since Randy spends 2 dollars every time he goes to the store and makes 4 trips to the store every month, we can calculate his total monthly spending on store trips: Total monthly spending = 2 dollars/trip * 4 trips = 8 dollars/month. Step 2: Determine the total amount of money, in dollars, Randy spends on store trips for the whole year. There are 12 months in a year. To find out how much Randy spends on store trips for the whole year, we can multiply his total monthly spending by the number of months in a year: Total annual spending = 8 dollars/month * 12 months = 96 dollars. Step 3: Determine the initial amount of money, in dollars, Randy had in his piggy bank. Since after a year, Randy has 104 dollars left in his piggy bank, this means he had more money at first, and the amount he had at first is equal to his total annual spending added to the remaining balance in his piggy bank: Initial amount = Total annual spending + Remaining balance = 96 dollars + 104 dollars = 200 dollars. So, Randy had 200 in his piggy bank at the beginning."},{"question":"Ainsi, le taux de participation aux élections est faible, soit que les citoyens expriment ainsi leur déception, soit qu’ils démontrent leur nonchalance.

Detroit techno is an offshoot of Chicago house music which developed in the early and mid-1980s. One of the earliest hits was \\"Big Fun\\" by Inner City. Detroit techno developed as the DJ The Electrifying Mojo did his radio program, which fused eclectic sounds into the signature Detroit techno sound. This sound, also influenced by European electronica (Kraftwerk, Art of Noise), Japanese synthpop (Yellow Magic Orchestra), early B-boy (breakdancing) Hip-Hop (Man Parrish, Soul Sonic Force) and Italo disco (Doctor's Cat, Ris, Klein M.B.O.), was further pioneered by Juan Atkins, Derrick May, and Kevin Saunderson, known as the Belleville Three. Derrick May a.k.a. \\"MAYDAY\\" and Thomas Barnett released \\"Nude Photo\\" in 1987 on May's label \\"Transmat Records\\", which helped start the Detroit techno music scene. This record was played on Chicago's Hot Mix 5 Radio DJ mix show and in Chicago clubs. A year later, Transmat released \\"Strings of Life\\". Transmat Records also released such as 1988's \\"Wiggin\\". As well, Derrick May had releases on Kool Kat Records and many remixes for underground and mainstream recording artists.

OPT: [A]. yes [B]. it is not possible to tell [C]. no","response":"C. No It is not accurate to conclude that \\"Many states do not want to reduce NOx emissions because it will adversely affect their economies,\\" just because the EPA's requirement to reduce NOx emissions was upheld by the Court of Appeals. There are numerous reasons why this statement doesn't provide a comprehensive understanding of the situation. 1. Diverse state opinions: States have their own environmental policies and views on how to handle air pollution and emissions. While some states might prioritize their economies and resist emission reduction measures, others might place a higher value on environmental conservation, even while acknowledging potential economic impacts. Thus, it is an oversimplification to generalize the opinion of many states. 2. Collaboration between states: Environmental issues, such as emissions and pollution, often extend beyond state borders, necessitating interstate cooperation. States might work together to find ways to reduce emissions without jeopardizing their economies or may be willing to comply with oversight, such as EPA requirements, because they recognize the long-term benefits these measures provide. 3. Legal reasons: The Court of Appeals' decision to uphold the EPA's requirement is a legal ruling and is not necessarily reflective of the general opinion of the affected states. It only implies that the EPA's actions were within its authority under the law, but it doesn't necessarily reflect the desires or intentions of each individual state. 4. Economic considerations: The statement assumes that reducing NOx emissions will always adversely affect state economies. However, this may not be the case. Some states might focus on transitioning to cleaner energy sources, which could have long-term economic benefits over time, such as job creation and improvements to public health. 5. Public sentiment: Citizens' opinions within states can also influence emission reduction efforts. People might demand cleaner air and pressure their governments to implement policies that reduce pollution, even if it has a short-term economic impact. Political leaders may be more concerned with public health and support environmental measures despite potential economic challenges. In conclusion, while it is possible that some states might be opposed to reducing NOx emissions due to economic concerns, it is not accurate to generalize this viewpoint for many states based on the Court of Appeals' ruling alone. Factors such as legal reasoning, collaborative efforts, public opinion, and long-term benefits of environmental protection measures should also be considered to gain a better understanding of state responses to EPA emissions reduction requirements."},{"question":"Given the question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the full name of the person that Chrisye refused access to?, using the article: Chrisye's tenor voice and performance on Badai Pasti Berlalu led Amin Widjaja of Musica Studios to ask him to sign with Musica; Widjaja had been scouting him since the release of Guruh Gipsy. Chrisye agreed on condition that he be allowed creative freedom, to which Widjaja reluctantly agreed. In May 1978 Chrisye began work on his first album with Musica, Sabda Alam (Nature's Order), incorporating several songs by other artists and some written by himself, including the title song. He recorded it after locking himself in the studio with the sound engineer and arranger; despite Amin's wanting to monitor their progress, Chrisye refused to allow him access. The album, greatly influenced by Badai Pasti Berlalu and drawing on the double tracking technique pioneered by the Beatles (in which the vocals are recorded twice to achieve fuller sound), was released in August that year. Heavily promoted in a campaign during which Chrisye was interviewed on the national television station TVRI and on radio, the album eventually sold 400,000 copies.The following year Chrisye recorded Percik Pesona (Stain of Enchantment) with Jockie. Produced after Amin's death, the album featured songs written by Chrisye's close friend Junaidi Salat, as well as Jockie and Guruh. The album's title was chosen by vote; the titular song was not released as a single. Percik Pesona, released in August 1979, was a critical and commercial failure. After discussing the issue with other artists, Chrisye blamed the album's failure on its similarity to Badai Pasti Berlalu. As a result, following a period of contemplation, he began branching out into different genres. That same year he was on the panel of the Prambors Teenage Songwriting Competition, held on 5 May.After deciding that romantic pop songs influenced by easy listening would suit him best, Chrisye began recording his next album, Puspa Indah (Beautiful Flower).

The Incredible String Band (sometimes abbreviated as ISB) were a psychedelic folk band formed by Clive Palmer, Robin Williamson and Mike Heron in Scotland in 1966. The band built a considerable following, especially in the British counterculture, notably with their albums The 5000 Spirits or the Layers of the Onion, The Hangman's Beautiful Daughter, and Wee Tam and the Big Huge. They became pioneers in psychedelic folk and, through integrating a wide variety of traditional music forms and instruments, in the development of world music. Following Palmer's early departure, Williamson and Heron performed as a duo, later augmented by other musicians. After that the group lasted another four years, although there was a gradual decline in their status and commercial success after 1970. Joe Boyd, whose skillful handling of the band had contributed much to their international success, stopped managing them and returned to the US. The group left Elektra Records and signed with Island, for whom they recorded five albums. The first was a soundtrack to the \\"Be Glad...\\" film, and this was followed by the eclectic Liquid Acrobat as Regards the Air, regarded as their best album for some time. The band continued to tour and record. Rose Simpson left in 1971 and was replaced by Malcolm Le Maistre, formerly of the Stone Monkey troupe. Mike Heron took time out to record a well-received solo album, Smiling Men with Bad Reputations, which, in contrast to the ISB's self-contained productions, featured a host of session guests, among them Pete Townshend, Ronnie Lane, Keith Moon, John Cale and Richard Thompson. The following year, Licorice left, and was replaced by Gerard Dott, an Edinburgh jazz musician and friend of both Heron and Williamson who had contributed to Smiling Men. Williamson also recorded a solo album, Myrrh, which featured some of his most extraordinary vocal performances. The group's changing lineup, adding Stan Schnier (aka \\"Stan Lee\\") on bass, Jack Ingram on drums, and Graham Forbes on electric guitar reflected moves toward a more conventional amplified rock group. Their final albums for Island were received disappointingly, and the label dropped them in 1974.

This action is generally not perceived as ethical or honest and can imply a level of deceit or secretiveness, which supports the choice of feeling like a sly person. Option A (\\"a thief\\") is partially accurate, as Addison did steal Remy's idea without giving proper credit, but it may not encompass the overall perception of cunning or slyness that this action represents, as it focuses only on the theft aspect. Option C (\\"like a good friend\\") is not applicable in this context, as friends are supposed to be supportive and honest; taking credit for someone else's idea is neither supportive nor honest. Therefore, in this scenario, the most appropriate answer for how Addison would feel is B (\\"like a sly person\\")."},{"question":"(CNN) -- As President Obama's second-term Cabinet starts to take shape, we can see some of the outlines of what the White House hopes to do in the next four years. The major theme is that Obama is prepared to defend his turf, tooth and nail. This is a Cabinet whose strength is defense rather than offense. Gone are the hopes of bipartisanship. Now it's time to really engage the partisan battle. Obama won't be pushing for many watershed changes in the next four years, but he is not going to make it easy for Republicans to make any deep inroads into what he has accomplished. During the last two weeks, the president rolled out his nominations on national security -- Sen. John Kerry for secretary of state, Sen. Chuck Hagel for secretary of defense, and John Brennan to direct the CIA. He then nominated his chief of staff, Jack Lew, to be secretary of the treasury. We must be careful not to infer too much from presidential appointments, since these people ultimately serve the interests of the president rather than vice versa -- but still, the identities of the members of the new Cabinet provide important hints. This is a team with experience and deep roots in Washington. It is clear that Obama, sobered after four brutal years of fighting with Republicans in Congress, realizes that he needs leaders who have clout in Congress. On national security, this is a team with deep experience that can protect the existing policies the administration has adopted.

Tito, a \\"coyote\\" (a person who helps smuggle people across the border) spends his days as a snake catcher but at night, helps smuggle immigrants across the border. After winning a fight in a local mechanic's garage, Hector tries to get another fight but the entertainment is interrupted by Tito who scolds both Hector and the owner due to the fact that Tito could get into more trouble for illegal gambling fights as if smuggling illegals across the border isn't enough. Corralled, Hector goes to change but is followed in by another illegal; Maria. It soon becomes known that they grew up together as kids and it also becomes apparent that Hector dislikes her (mostly because of her sarcastic teasing). Tito hands Hector medicine for his mother and the three head back to the farm where they all work. After settling all of the immigrants in, Maria goes into her own suite with Hector and makes herself at home despite Hector being less than welcoming. Hector then goes to his mother Rosa to give her the medicine but it becomes apparent that she is getting worse.

And, increasingly, patients are heading to the doctor armed with reams of data gathered from their devices. \\"They're essentially asking us to digest the data and offer advice about how to avoid cardiovascular disease,\\" says cardiologist Euan Ashley, associate professor of medicine at the Stanford University Medical Center and Stanford Hospital and Clinics in northern California. And, being somewhat near Silicon Valley, he says he gets a lot of tech-savvy patients bringing fitness-tracker data to appointments. The problem, he says, is that he just didn't know how reliable that data was. So, he and colleagues decided to study seven of the most popular devices and compare their accuracy to the gold-standard tests that doctor's use. They looked at two metrics: heart rate and calories burned. For heart rate, the fitness trackers were compared to findings from an electro-cardiogram, or EKG. It turned out the devices were \\"surprisingly accurate\\", says Ashley. \\"Most devices most of the time were 'off' by only about 5 percent.\\" However, when it came to measuring how many calories a person burned, the findings were way off, says Ashley, showing a degree of inaccuracy that ranged from 20 percent to 93 percent, meaning 93 percent of the time the worst-performing device was wrong. Researchers compared the findings of the wrist devices to a sophisticated system of calculating metabolism which measures oxygen and carbon dioxide in people's breath. \\"This is a very well-designed and well-done study,\\" says Dr. Tim Church, a professor of preventative medicine at Pennington Biomedical Research Center at Louisiana State University who was not involved in the study. Church routinely consults with companies about how to introduce wellness strategies into the workplace. Being wrong 93 percent of the time means the findings from the fitness tracker are more \\"fiction than fact,\\" he says, which can actually undermine a healthy diet. \\"It's just human nature. People are checking these inaccurate counts and they think they've earned a muffin or earned some ice cream and they're sabotaging their weight-loss program.\\" Church points to a study last year which found participants in a weight-loss program who also wore fitness trackers actually lost less weight than participants who didn't wear the trackers. \\"It's an instance of no information is probably better than having bad information,\\" he says. The Stanford study was published in the Journal of Personalized Medicine. It was relatively small, with 29 men and 31 women. In addition to the primary results, there were some other interesting findings. In certain groups of people — for example, those with darker skin, higher BMIs and men — the error made by devices was actually greater than for Caucasian women with a more healthy weight. Enlarge this image toggle caption Paul Sakuma/Courtesy of Stanford University School of Medicine Paul Sakuma/Courtesy of Stanford University School of Medicine \\"So, for those for whom it might matter the most, who are trying to lose weight, the error was actually greater,\\" says Ashley, who doesn't know why this may be the case. He speculates that it could be that companies use a fairly narrow group of people for testing the equations they use to measure heart rate and calories burned. The study didn't look at how well devices count steps or monitor sleep or stress. The take-home message, says Ashley, is to not rely on the devices to measure total calories burned. Instead focus on eating what we know is a healthy diet, which is low in sugar and high in fiber, and to \\"eat not until you're full but until you're no longer hungry.\\" And, of course, people should exercise, he says, adding, \\"we have no more important intervention than exercise for the prevention of any number of diseases.\\" Makers of two devices, Fitbit and PulseOn say they remain confident in the performance of the trackers both in measuring heart rate and calories burned. In a statement, PulseOn questioned the study's methodology, saying that the high errors for calorie measurements \\"suggest that the authors may not have properly set all the user parameters on the device.\\" Mark Gorelick, the chief science officer at the device-maker Mio Global, says, \\"we agree that more accurate calorie estimation is important for the industry as a whole, since most individuals are monitoring calorie deficits for weight loss.\\" The other device makers did not immediately respond to requests for comment. ||||| Abstract http://precision.stanford.edu/ The ability to measure physical activity through wrist-worn devices provides an opportunity for cardiovascular medicine. However, the accuracy of commercial devices is largely unknown. The aim of this work is to assess the accuracy of seven commercially available wrist-worn devices in estimating heart rate (HR) and energy expenditure (EE) and to propose a wearable sensor evaluation framework. We evaluated the Apple Watch, Basis Peak, Fitbit Surge, Microsoft Band, Mio Alpha 2, PulseOn, and Samsung Gear S2. Participants wore devices while being simultaneously assessed with continuous telemetry and indirect calorimetry while sitting, walking, running, and cycling. Sixty volunteers (29 male, 31 female, age 38 ± 11 years) of diverse age, height, weight, skin tone, and fitness level were selected. Error in HR and EE was computed for each subject/device/activity combination. Devices reported the lowest error for cycling and the highest for walking. Device error was higher for males, greater body mass index, darker skin tone, and walking. Six of the devices achieved a median error for HR below 5% during cycling. No device achieved an error in EE below 20 percent. The Apple Watch achieved the lowest overall error in both HR and EE, while the Samsung Gear S2 reported the highest. In conclusion, most wrist-worn devices adequately measure HR in laboratory-based activities, but poorly estimate EE, suggesting caution in the use of EE measurements as part of health improvement programs. We propose reference standards for the validation of consumer health devices ().

The study compared the effectiveness of seven popular fitness trackers in relation to electrocardiogram results. It found that most devices were accurate within about 5%. However, the devices were far less accurate at estimating calories burned. The worst-performing device was inaccurate in this regard 93% of the time. It is thought that people overestimate the effect of exercise on calorie burning and may not make sufficiently healthy food choices as a result. The devices tested did not cover the entire market."},{"question":"Sentence 1: This is nothing to rush into just to burn powder. Sentence 2: Burning powder is bad because it costs so much money.

Which group included people that had tuberculosis? Hint: Many respiratory diseases are caused by pathogens. A pathogen is an organism that causes disease in another organism. Certain bacteria, viruses, and fungi are pathogens of the respiratory system. The common cold and flu are caused by viruses. The influenza virus that causes the flu is pictured below ( Figure below ). Tuberculosis, whooping cough, and acute bronchitis are caused by bacteria. The pathogens that cause colds, flu, and TB can be passed from person to person by coughing, sneezing, and spitting. Illnesses caused by bacteria can be treated with antibiotics. Those caused by viruses cannot. Answer:","response":"Based on the given information, group two included people that had tuberculosis. The reason for this is that tuberculosis, along with whooping cough and acute bronchitis, are caused by bacteria. Respiratory diseases caused by bacteria were the focus of group two, whereas group one consisted of people with respiratory diseases caused by viruses, such as the common cold and flu. Pathogens, which include certain bacteria, viruses, and fungi, are organisms that cause disease in other organisms, particularly affecting the respiratory system in this context. Various pathogens can cause respiratory infections, many of which can be spread from person to person through actions like coughing, sneezing, and spitting. The critical distinction to remember when identifying which group included people with tuberculosis is understanding the difference between bacterial-caused and viral-caused respiratory diseases. While bacterial respiratory infections, like tuberculosis, can be treated with antibiotics, this is not the case for diseases caused by viruses. Thus, the treatment methods for the two groups would also differ based on the nature of the pathogens causing the diseases in each group. In conclusion, people with tuberculosis were a part of group two, which focused on respiratory diseases caused by bacteria."},{"question":"\\"i set the table for four , and at the last minute , my mom had me add a place setting , which could only mean one of two things . the first option was that my dad had brought someone home with him from work . the second was that one of noah 's friends had tagged along after school . i spent a single moment devoutly praying that it was the first _ ...\\" What is the word in the blank space (_)?

A chess prodigy, he is considered by many as one of the greatest players of all time, widely renowned for his exceptional endgame skill and speed of play. Born in Havana, he beat Cuban champion Juan Corzo in a match two days before his thirteenth birthday on 17 November 1901. Context: Capablanca's skill in rapid chess lent itself to simultaneous exhibitions, and his increasing reputation in these events led to a US-wide tour in 1909. Playing 602 games in 27 cities, he scored 96.4% - a much higher percentage than, for example, Geza Maroczy's 88% and Frank Marshall's 86% in 1906. This performance gained him sponsorship for an exhibition match that year against Marshall, the US champion, who had won the 1904 Cambridge Springs tournament ahead of World Champion Emanuel Lasker and Dawid Janowski, and whom Chessmetrics ranks as one of the world's top three players at his peak. Capablanca beat Marshall by 15-8 (8 wins, 1 loss, 14 draws) - a margin comparable to what Emanuel Lasker achieved against Marshall (8 wins, no losses, 7 draws) in winning his 1907 World Championship match. After the match, Capablanca said that he had never opened a book on chess openings. Following this match, Chessmetrics rates Capablanca the world's third strongest player for most of the period from 1909 through 1912. Capablanca won six games and drew one in the 1910 New York State Championship. Both Capablanca and Charles Jaffe won their four games in the knock-out preliminaries and met in a match to decide the winner, who would be the first to win two games. The first game was drawn and Capablanca won the second and third game. After another gruelling series of simultaneous exhibitions, Capablanca placed second, with 9 1/2 out of 12, in the 1911 National Tournament at New York, half a point behind Marshall, and half a point ahead of Charles Jaffe and Oscar Chajes. Marshall, invited to play in a tournament at San Sebastian, Spain, in 1911, insisted that Capablanca also be allowed to play. According to David Hooper and Ken Whyld, San Sebastian 1911 was \\"one of the strongest five tournaments held up to that time\\", as all the world's leading players competed except the World Champion, Lasker. At the beginning of the tournament, Ossip Bernstein and Aron Nimzowitsch objected to Capablanca's participation because he had not fulfilled the entry condition of winning at least third prize in two master tournaments. Capablanca won brilliantly against Bernstein in the very first round, more simply against Nimzowitsch, and astounded the chess world by taking first place, with a score of six wins, one loss and seven draws, ahead of Akiba Rubinstein, Milan Vidmar, Marshall, Carl Schlechter and Siegbert Tarrasch, et al. His loss, against Rubinstein, was one of the most brilliant achievements of the latter's career. Some European critics grumbled that Capablanca's style was rather cautious, though he conceded fewer draws than any of the next six finishers in the event. Capablanca was now recognized as a serious contender for the world championship. Question: What was the first tournament he played in?. Whats the answer?","response":"The first tournament Jose Raul Capablanca played in was the match against Cuban champion Juan Corzo on 17 November 1901, two days before his thirteenth birthday."},{"question":"a fuel tanker carrying supplies for arctic communities has run aground in the northwest passage but no diesel is leaking , the canadian coast guard said thursday .

And when you reckon the sun's acting like that over you there isn't a right lot you can do about it, beyond burying yourself away like a mole in the soil. That's what I've been doing more or less in the score or so years that have gone by since. But however tight I shut them curtains to stop that damn sun lighting me up, it still don't stop the inside of my head from pounding out the truth. No way it's ever going to stop harassing me neither, not unless the deaf and dumb lass was to happen right back on my doorstep and give me the chance to tell her that it wasn't never meant to work out this way. The deaf and dumb lass went by the name of Mitzi Barker. Her being deaf and dumb, she was the kind of lass you went up the lane with if you didn't want no-one shouting their gob off about it after. Funny but it's the small things I recall best about her, like the way her hair reeked of bonfires and how that little old checkered dress of hers rode right up her thigh with no help from me. After we'd finished our business we'd head over the trout farm and I'd hunker down and poach us up a couple of rainbows for our tea. That Mitzi Barker, she was thin as an ear of barley and I always figured a good nosh-up was the least I could do for her troubles. According to the above context, answer the following question. At the end of the story, what happened to Mitzi barker? Available choices: (A). not enough information. (B). she went away. (C). she died. (D). they broke up.

Das Verständnis und Zusammenwirken von Bürgern und Entscheidungsträgern ist ein entscheidender Faktor für das Funktionieren einer Demokratie. Um diese Lücke zu überwinden, müssen mehrere Aspekte berücksichtigt werden. Dies beinhaltet die Verbesserung der Kommunikationskanäle, die Förderung der politischen Bildung und Partizipation sowie die Schaffung von Transparenz und Verantwortlichkeit bei der Entscheidungsfindung. Zunächst sollte auf die Verbesserung der Kommunikationskanäle geachtet werden, um eine zielgerichtete und effektive Kommunikation zwischen Bürgern und Entscheidungsträgern zu gewährleisten. Dies kann durch digitale Plattformen wie soziale Medien und Online-Bürgerforen erreicht werden. Diese ermöglichen einen direkteren und leichteren Zugang zu politischen Entscheidungen, wodurch Bürger besser informiert sind und leichter Feedback an Entscheidungsträger geben können. Ein weiterer wichtiger Schritt zur Überbrückung der Kluft besteht darin, die politische Bildung zu fördern und die Bürger zur aktiven Teilnahme an politischen Prozessen zu ermutigen. Dies kann durch Schulungsprogramme, Workshops sowie öffentliche Diskussionen und Debatten erreicht werden, die Menschen befähigen, sich kritisch und konstruktiv an politischen Entscheidungen zu beteiligen. Politische Bildung sollte auch auf die Bedeutung und den Wert des Engagements für den Gemeinwohl und die Förderung des demokratischen Zusammenlebens abzielen. Darüber hinaus ist es entscheidend, dass Entscheidungsträger Transparenz bei ihrem Handeln und ihrer Entscheidungsfindung sicherstellen und im Interesse ihrer Wähler handeln. Um dies zu erreichen, sollten Entscheidungsträger offenlegen, auf welchen Informationen und Daten ihre Entscheidungen basieren, und Bürger über die Ergebnisse ihrer Politikmaßnahmen informieren. Außerdem sollten Entscheidungsträger Rechenschaft über ihre Entscheidungen und ihr Handeln ablegen und für ihre Taten zur Verantwortung gezogen werden. Zu diesem Zweck könnten Instrumente wie öffentliche Anhörungen und Untersuchungsausschüsse eingerichtet werden, die sicherstellen, dass Entscheidungsträger für ihre Handlungen und Entscheidungen zur Verantwortung gezogen werden können. Durch die Umsetzung dieser Maßnahmen können wir hoffentlich dazu beitragen, das Vertrauen in politische Institutionen zu stärken und das Verständnis zwischen Bürgern und Entscheidungsträgern zu verbessern.

Greg Lindstrom | Flathead Beacon Updated: June 29, 9 p.m. A West Glacier man was killed by a grizzly bear Wednesday afternoon while riding his mountain bike on a forested trail in the Halfmoon Lakes area south of Glacier National Park. Flathead County Sheriff Chuck Curry identified the victim as Brad Treat, 38, of West Glacier. Treat grew up in the Flathead Valley and graduated from Flathead High School, where he was a standout distance runner, in 1996. Authorities have closed the area around Halfmoon Lakes as the investigation continues. As of 8:30 p.m., the bear that attacked Treat had not been found. Treat and another man were mountain biking on U.S. Forest Service land near Halfmoon Lakes on Wednesday, according to Curry. The initial investigation suggests the two bikers surprised the bear around 2 p.m. and Treat was taken off his bike by the animal. The second rider was able to escape uninjured and summon help. Treat was pronounced dead at the scene. The Flathead County Sheriff’s Office, the Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks’ Wildlife Human Attack Response Team and the U.S. Forest Service are investigating the incident. Staff at the nearby West Glacier KOA along Halfmoon Flats off U.S. 2 said the campground guests have all been briefed of the incident. Treat worked as a law enforcement officer for the Forest Service. “Brad was an integral member of our area law enforcement team and a friend to us all. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family tonight,” Curry said. Growing up in the valley, Treat developed into one of Montana’s best distance runners and helped form the long-distance dynasty at Flathead High School in the mid-90s. Along with his all-state accomplishments and tireless dedication, Treat’s kind-hearted demeanor left a lasting mark on the Brave program for years to come, according to his former coach, Paul Jorgensen. “He’s one of the nicest kids I’ve coached,” Jorgensen, who has coached Flathead runners for nearly 40 years, said Wednesday night after learning of Treat’s death. “One thing that really impressed me about him, we were running at the Missoula Invitational (cross country meet) and he was the top runner. He finished first and then he turned around and congratulated every kid that finished. That really impressed me. I told my kids that story off and on over the years and then my kids started doing that, too. Brad’s the one who started that. That’s the kind of kid he was.” With Treat as one of its all-state distance runners, Flathead won a cross country state championship in 1994 and track state championships in 1995 and 1996. Treat’s 1996 time of 9:14.30 in the 3,200-meter race was the fastest in Montana history by a prep runner until it was broken three years later. He won individual state championships in the 1,600 and 3,200 as a senior. “He was a really good runner but he was also a kind-hearted person who cared about people,” Jorgensen said. Jorgensen said Treat’s death is a tragic loss for the entire Flathead Valley, the running community and the Flathead High School community. The death is the first fatal grizzly attack in Northwest Montana since 2001, when an elk hunter was killed on the Blackfoot Clearwater Game Range near Ovando. Grizzly bear attacks are rare in the Glacier region but not unheard of. Since Glacier National Park was created in 1910, there have been 10 fatal grizzly attacks in the national park, the most recent in May 1998 when a 26-year-old man was killed hiking in the Upper Two Medicine Valley. Northwest Montana is home to the largest grizzly bear population in the lower 48 states with approximately 1,000 bears living in the region. There have been six fatal grizzly bear attacks since 2010 in the Yellowstone region of Montana, Wyoming and Idaho. This story will be updated when more information becomes available.

Victim of bear attack near West Glacier has been identified The attack on the pair of bicyclists took place about a mile up the trail leading to Half Moon Lake, according to Flathead County Undersheriff Dave Lieb Wildlife officials and law enforcement officers are continuing to search for a bear or bears that attacked and killed a 38 year old West Glacier resident on his bicycle on Wednesday near the town of West Glacier. The attack on the pair of bicyclists took place about a mile up the trail leading to Half Moon Lake, and according to Flathead County Undersheriff Dave Lieb, it was a very sudden attack. The victim has been identified at Brad Treat of West Glacier, a career law enforcement officer with the Flathead National Forest. It appears that Treat and his companion surprised the bear on the trail which may have led to the attack. A press release from Flathead County Sheriff Chuck Curry says that Treat was \\"taken off his bike\\" by the bear, and was pronounced dead on the scene. The second rider was able to escape the area to get help and was not injured or involved in the attack. Authorities are asking visitors and area residents to stay out of the area until the bear in question is captured. Initially, authorities believed it was a grizzly bear that attacked, but now are not certain whether it was a grizzly or a black bear. Undersheriff Lieb said, \\"At this point and time the Forest Service is closing the entire area, from Desert Mountain to Coram, over to West Glacier, so that area is closed until further notice.\\" The incident is being investigated by the Wildlife Human Attack Response Team of the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife, and Parks; the U.S Forest Service; and the Flathead County Sheriff's Office.

(AP) — A grizzly bear attacked and killed a 38-year-old mountain biker as he was riding along a trail just outside Glacier National Park, Montana authorities said. Brad Treat and another rider were in the Halfmoon Lakes area of the Flathead National Forest Wednesday when they apparently surprised the bear, Flathead County Sheriff Chuck Curry said. The bear knocked Treat off his bike, and the second rider left to look for help, Curry said. Authorities found Treat's body at the scene, but not the bear. Wildlife and law-enforcement officials were searching for the grizzly Wednesday evening. Treat was a law-enforcement officer with the U.S. Forest Service. \\"Brad was an integral member of our area law enforcement team and a friend to us all,\\" Curry said. Treat grew up in nearby Kalispell, where was a standout distance runner in high school, his former coach, Paul Jorgenson, told the Flathead Beacon newspaper. \\"He was a really good runner but he was also a kind-hearted person who cared about people,\\" Jorgenson told the Beacon. The second rider, who was not identified, was not injured. Authorities have closed the area, which is about 3 miles away from Glacier's west entrance, for public safety. Grizzlies in the Lower 48 states have been designated a threatened species since the 1970s, but their numbers are increasing and so are conflicts between humans and bears. The grizzlies in the Glacier area among about 1,000 bears in the Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem, which also includes the Bob Marshall Wilderness south of the park. At least 700 more grizzlies live in and around Yellowstone National Park, which is roughly 360 miles south of Glacier. Six people have been fatally mauled by bears in the Northern Rockies since 2010, but those deaths were mainly in the Yellowstone area. Glacier officials say there are usually one or two non-lethal encounters between bears and humans each year inside the park. Before Wednesday, there had been 10 bear-related human deaths in Glacier since the park was created in 1910. The last was in 1998, when three bears killed and partially ate a park vendor employee while he was hiking. In the most well-known Glacier attacks, bears killed two people in different parts of the park in a single night in 1967.

In applying statistics to, e.g., a scientific, industrial, or social problem, it is conventional to begin with a statistical population or a statistical model process to be studied. Populations can be diverse topics such as \\"all people living in a country\\" or \\"every atom composing a crystal\\". Statistics deals with all aspects of data including the planning of data collection in terms of the design of surveys and experiments. - An experiment is a procedure carried out to support, refute, or validate a hypothesis. Experiments provide insight into cause-and-effect by demonstrating what outcome occurs when a particular factor is manipulated. Experiments vary greatly in goal and scale, but always rely on repeatable procedure and logical analysis of the results. There also exists natural experimental studies. - Analysis is the process of breaking a complex topic or substance into smaller parts in order to gain a better understanding of it. The technique has been applied in the study of mathematics and logic since before Aristotle (384322 B.C.), though \\"analysis\\" as a formal concept is a relatively recent development. - In statistics , a generalized additive model ( GAM ) is a generalized linear model in which the linear predictor depends linearly on unknown smooth functions of some predictor variables , and interest focuses on inference about these smooth functions . GAMs were originally developed by Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani to blend properties of generalized linear models with additive models . The model relates a univariate response variable , Y , to some predictor variables , xi. An exponential family distribution is specified for Y ( for example normal , binomial or Poisson distributions ) along with a link function g ( for example the identity or log functions ) relating the expected value of Y to the predictor variables via a structure such as g ( operatorname ( E ) ( Y ) ) = beta_0 + f_1 ( x_1 ) + f_2 ( x_2 ) + cdots + f_m ( x_m ) . , ! The functions fi ( xi ) may be functions with a specified parametric form ( for example a polynomial , or a coefficient depending on the levels of a factor variable ) or may be specified non-parametrically , or semi-parametrically , simply as ' smooth functions ' , to be estimated by non-parametric means . So a typical GAM might use a scatterplot smoothing function , such as a locally weighted mean , for f1 ( x1 ) , and then use a factor model for f2 ( x2 ) . This flexibility to allow non-parametric fits with relaxed assumptions on the actual relationship between response and predictor , provides the potential for better fits to data than purely parametric models , but arguably with some loss of interpretability . - In statistics, a population is a set of similar items or events which is of interest for some question or experiment. A statistical population can be a group of actually existing objects (e.g. the set of all stars within the Milky Way galaxy) or a hypothetical and potentially infinite group of objects conceived as a generalization from experience (e.g. the set of all possible hands in a game of poker). A common aim of statistical analysis is to produce information about some chosen population. - Debt, AIDS, Trade, Africa (DATA) was a multinational non-government organization founded in January 2002 in London by U2's Bono along with Bobby Shriver and activists from the Jubilee 2000 Drop the Debt campaign. - A statistical model is a class of mathematical model, which embodies a set of assumptions concerning the generation of some sample data, and similar data from a larger population. A statistical model represents, often in considerably idealized form, the data-generating process. - In statistics, multicollinearity (also collinearity) is a phenomenon in which two or more predictor variables in a multiple regression model are highly correlated, meaning that one can be linearly predicted from the others with a substantial degree of accuracy. In this situation the coefficient estimates of the multiple regression may change erratically in response to small changes in the model or the data. Multicollinearity does not reduce the predictive power or reliability of the model as a whole, at least within the sample data set; it only affects calculations regarding individual predictors. That is, a multiple regression model with correlated predictors can indicate how well the entire bundle of predictors predicts the outcome variable, but it may not give valid results about any individual predictor, or about which predictors are redundant with respect to others. - The curse of dimensionality refers to various phenomena that arise when analyzing and organizing data in high-dimensional spaces (often with hundreds or thousands of dimensions) that do not occur in low-dimensional settings such as the three-dimensional physical space of everyday experience. The expression was coined by Richard E. Bellman when considering problems in dynamic optimization. - Nonparametric regression is a category of regression analysis in which the predictor does not take a predetermined form but is constructed according to information derived from the data. Nonparametric regression requires larger sample sizes than regression based on parametric models because the data must supply the model structure as well as the model estimates. - Model selection is the task of selecting a statistical model from a set of candidate models, given data. In the simplest cases, a pre-existing set of data is considered. However, the task can also involve the design of experiments such that the data collected is well-suited to the problem of model selection. Given candidate models of similar predictive or explanatory power, the simplest model is most likely to be the best choice. - A statistic (singular) or sample statistic is a single measure of some attribute of a sample (e.g., its arithmetic mean value). It is calculated by applying a function (statistical algorithm) to the values of the items of the sample, which are known together as a set of data. - In statistics and machine learning, one of the most common tasks is to fit a \\"model\\" to a set of training data, so as to be able to make reliable predictions on general untrained data. In overfitting, a statistical model describes random error or noise instead of the underlying relationship. Overfitting occurs when a model is excessively complex, such as having too many parameters relative to the number of observations. A model that has been overfit has poor predictive performance, as it overreacts to minor fluctuations in the training data. - In statistics, an additive model (AM) is a nonparametric regression method. It was suggested by Jerome H. Friedman and Werner Stuetzle (1981) and is an essential part of the ACE algorithm. The \\"AM\\" uses a one-dimensional smoother to build a restricted class of nonparametric regression models. Because of this, it is less affected by the curse of dimensionality than e.g. a \\"p\\"-dimensional smoother. Furthermore, the \\"AM\\" is more flexible than a standard linear model, while being more interpretable than a general regression surface at the cost of approximation errors. Problems with \\"AM\\" include model selection, overfitting, and multicollinearity. - In statistics, the generalized linear model (GLM) is a flexible generalization of ordinary linear regression that allows for response variables that have error distribution models other than a normal distribution. The GLM generalizes linear regression by allowing the linear model to be related to the response variable via a \\"link function\\" and by allowing the magnitude of the variance of each measurement to be a function of its predicted value.

Most fainting spells occur when you are standing, and recognizing warning signs will help you prepare yourself if you do indeed faint. In addition, awareness can also help to prevent a fainting episode and will help you stay safe if you do faint. Common symptoms include yawning, a sudden sweat, nausea (sickness), fast and deep breathing, confusion, lightheadedness, blurred vision or spots in front of your eyes, and ringing in your ears. The symptoms of fainting can come on very quickly and with little warning. If you experience the above symptoms it is a good idea to conduct 'antigravity' measures, which when done immediately upon feeling symptoms, can help you avoid a fainting episode. Medical experts suggest that you lie or sit down and place your head between your knees. These positions will help restore blood flow to the brain and can prevent a fainting episode. If standing, you can also cross your legs and tightening your abdominal muscles. This is effective if you are in a crowded place and you are unable to lie down immediately. By preparing, you can ensure that you are in a safe and secure place when you faint. Try telling someone near you what is happening and ask for assistance, try lying down, or try bracing yourself against a wall to prepare. If you find yourself on stairs or other precarious surroundings, sit down and hold on to a railing immediately. If you do faint, blood flow will resume to your brain naturally and you should regain consciousness in two minutes or less. It is normal to feel weak and confused for 20 to 30 minutes after fainting. Remain calm when you regain consciousness. Also, take some time to lay on your back to allow blood flow back to the brain. You should also hydrate yourself with water. Summary:","response":"Fainting happens when our brain doesn't get enough blood, and we might feel some signs before it happens. These signs can be yawning, sweating, feeling sick, breathing fast, feeling confused or lightheaded, having blurry vision, or hearing ringing in our ears. If you feel any of these, try to sit or lie down to help blood flow better, or tell someone nearby. If you do faint, it's normal to feel weak and confused for a little bit after you wake up. Try to stay calm, lay down, and drink some water."},{"question":"The singer, who appeared only on the band's first album, Jefferson Airplane Takes Off, died last Thursday - the same day as guitarist Paul Kantner. \\"One sweet lady has passed on,\\" wrote the rock group's co-founder Marty Balin on his Facebook page. \\"I imagine that she and Paul woke up in heaven and said, 'Hey, what are you doing here? Let's start a band!'\\" No cause of death was given for the singer, but former band mate Jack Casady said she had been receiving hospice care. Born in Seattle and raised in Portland, folk singer Signe Toly boarded Jefferson Airplane in 1965 at Balin's invitation. She sang lead vocals on the songs Chauffeur Blues and Let's Get Together - a Chet Powers-penned track that later became a hit for the Youngbloods. On the sleeve notes for the band's debut album, she was described as \\"a former folk singer\\", whose \\"high, strong voice gives an unusual quality to the ensemble\\"> But she quit the line-up after giving birth to her first child, having decided life on the road with a newborn was untenable. But she stuck with Jefferson Airplane as they searched for a replacement, giving her last performance on 15 October, 1966. A night later, her successor, Grace Slick, of Great Society, made her debut. \\"Signe was one of the strongest people I have ever met,\\" guitarist Jorma Kaukonen wrote on his blog. \\"She was our den mother in the early days of the Airplaneâ€¦ a voice of reason on more occasions than oneâ€¦ an important member of our dysfunctional little family. \\"I always looked forward to seeing her when we played the Aladdin in Portland. \\"She never complained and was always a joy.\\" \\"I had been in touch with Signe this past week as she had moved from her home to hospice care,\\" bassist Casady added on Facebook. \\"She was a real sweetheart with a terrific contralto voice coming from a solid folk background. \\"Listen to how she made the three-part harmonies of JA Takes Off (first album) sound so thick... her wonderful tone between Paul's and Marty's. \\"A sad dayâ€¦ for those of us still here.\\" This article was about:","response":"The article was about the death of Signe Toly, the original lead singer for the band Jefferson Airplane.

What are the places to visit in Israel? What's the one must visit place in Israel?","response":"No, these two questions do not have the same meaning. They are asking for different types of information related to visiting places in Israel. Let's break down each question to understand their meanings better. Question 1: \\"What are the places to visit in Israel?\\" This question is asking for a list of various places that one can visit or a compilation of tourist attractions in Israel. It implies that the person asking the question wants to know about multiple interesting spots, historical sites, cultural experiences, or natural wonders in the country. By asking this question, the person is expecting a diverse and comprehensive list of options. In responding to this question, one would provide an extensive list of possible places to visit, such as Jerusalem's Old City, Tel Aviv, the Dead Sea, Masada, the Baha'i Gardens in Haifa, the Sea of Galilee, Eilat, the Negev Desert, Caesarea, and many others. Question 2: \\"What's the one must-visit place in Israel?\\" This question, on the other hand, is seeking a singular recommendation for a place in Israel that is considered a must-see or a top highlight. By asking for \\"the one must-visit place,\\" the person is looking for the most iconic, significant, or standout attraction in the country. They are not asking for an extensive list, but rather want to know the single most essential location that someone should not miss when traveling to Israel. In responding to this question, one would need to weigh the importance, significance, and uniqueness of various locations or attractions in Israel and choose the one that carries the most weight. This could vary depending on individual perspectives and preferences. Possible answers might include the Western Wall (Kotel) in Jerusalem, the Dead Sea, or Tel Aviv, depending on which site the respondent believes carries the greatest significance or importance. In summary, while both questions are related to visiting places in Israel, they are asking for different types of information. The first question seeks a wide-ranging list of attractions and the second question wants a single, essential recommendation."},{"question":"Write a title: My column is dedicated to training and education issues for IT professionals but how much do we think about training for end users, particularly educating users to be security-aware?","response":"Title: \\"Learning Together: Teaching Computer Safety to IT Experts and Everyday Users\\""},{"question":"Does the following review have a positive or negative opinion of the movie? a very well-meaning movie , and it Available options: (i) negative; (ii) positive;","response":"The review has a positive opinion of the movie."},{"question":"Solve -55*k - 53*k + 141*k = 47*k - 1582 for k.

During the 1930s, the Navy contracted a 1.5 million dredging of Pearl Harbor to allow larger battleships and the fleet's carriers to enter it. Work began in May 1940 resulting in 13,000,000 cubic yards (9,900,000 m3) of material dredged from the opening of Pearl Harbor to build a channel to Ford Island as well as to create a turning channel around the island. Material was also dredged to deepen the West Loch, East Loch, and Middle Loch for the mooring of battleships. With dredged material used as land fill, the island's size was increased from 334 acres (135 ha) to 441 acres (178 ha).The Navy replaced its PK, F5L, and H16 aircraft with newer models (see table below). In 1933 VP-8F arrived on station, and in 1935 the army bombers had become too large to be maintained and stored at Luke Field. Construction began on a new Army airfield, Hickam Army Airfield, named after pioneer U.S. Army Air Corps pilot Lieutenant Colonel Horace Meek Hickam. From 1936 to 1940 Pan American flew its Clipper service into Ford Island, using it as a refueling stop between the United States and Asia. The Navy built a 25,000 boathouse, spent 579,565 on a new crew barracks and built a firehouse, water-supply and lighting systems. In June 1936 the Navy lengthened the island's landing field by 400 feet (120 m), to 3,000 feet (910 m). In March 1937 Amelia Earhart, on her second visit to Luke Field, crashed her Lockheed Electra on takeoff. In 1939, after three years of construction, Hickam Field opened. The Army transferred its operations there, leaving Luke Field under Navy control. The latter was renamed Naval Air Station Ford Island, and became the headquarters of Patrol Wing 2; its former namesake was re-honored with a new base, Luke Air Force Base in Arizona. A September 8, 1939, presidential emergency proclamation spurred the rapid construction of new facilities to prepare the island for additional operations. This included additional barracks, a new assembly and repair hangar, an administration building, a dispensary, a control...

Let's solve this math problem step by step. We have this equation: 103*y + 1694 = 224*y. To find y, we need to make y all alone on one side of the equation. We can do this by putting all the \\"y\\" terms on one side and the numbers on the other side. Let's first move the y terms around. We can do this by taking 103*y away from both sides of the equation. Here's what we get: 103*y - 103*y + 1694 = 224*y - 103*y. Since 103*y - 103*y equals 0, we don't need to write that part anymore, so we get: 1694 = 224*y - 103*y. Now, let's combine the y terms on the right side: 1694 = 121 * y. Now that we have the y terms all together, we can make y all alone by dividing both sides by the number with y: 1694 / 121 = y. When we do the division, we find that: y = 14. So, y equals 14.

Article: The creative projects of World Food Program (WFP) focused on preventing hunger from taking hold in the future and breaking the cycle of hunger. Here are some of the ways in which we work to prevent hunger in the future: School Meals As well as directly addressing hunger, School Meals projects encourage families to keep their children in school and help them build better futures. If children aren't hungry they will concentrate on their lessons. With a solid education growing children have a better chance of finding their own way out of hunger. These projects benefit girls especially. For more information: www.wfp.org/schools meals. Food for Assets WFP's Food for Assets projects provide the hungry with food to lay the foundation for a better tomorrow. When poor farmers no longer have to worry about the next meal, they have the time and energy to build irrigation systems that can increase production. Similarly, Food for Training projects allow the poor to devote time to learning skills that will sustain them economically in the future. For more information: www.wfp.org/food-assets. HIV/AIDS WFP uses its food rations to reduce the blow of HIV and AIDS. The agency distributes its rations to people living with HIV and AIDS, so they can keep providing for their families for longer and have time to transfer vital knowledge and skills to the growing number of AIDS children--the next generation of food providers in developing countries. For more information: www.wfp.org/hiv-aids. Purchase for Progress WFP buys large amounts of food in developing countries. It has this purchasing power and uses it to help poor farmers contact reliable markets where they can get competitive prices for their produce. With secure markets, farmers will be encouraged to produce more and innovate .The knock-on effect is producing more food for everyone. For more information: www.wfp.ofp/purchase-progress. Question: AIDS children can benefit from food rations in that _ . Answer: A:","response":"AIDS children can benefit from food rations in several ways. Firstly, when the World Food Program (WFP) provides food rations to people living with HIV and AIDS, it enables them to maintain their health and strength, allowing them to continue providing for their families. This support can prolong the time these individuals have to transfer vital knowledge and skills to the growing number of AIDS children, who represent the next generation of food providers in developing countries. Secondly, food rations can help mitigate the impact of HIV and AIDS on affected families, who may struggle to meet their daily nutritional needs due to illness or the loss of income-earning members. By supporting these families with food rations, the WFP helps ensure that AIDS children have access to adequate nutrition, which is critical for their growth, development, and overall well-being. Additionally, access to food rations can encourage families to keep their AIDS-affected children in school, as they won't have to worry about the next meal. Proper education is essential for breaking the cycle of poverty and hunger, and ensuring that these children have the tools they need to build a better future for themselves and their communities. By addressing the root causes and consequences of hunger through food rations, the WFP can greatly improve the quality of life and long-term prospects of AIDS children and their families in developing countries."},{"question":"Q: Read the following article and answer the question.

Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","response":"To accomplish the goal of treating foot blisters, following these steps makes more sense: 1. Clean the area: Wash your hands to avoid introducing any bacteria, and then gently clean the affected area with soap and water or an antiseptic wipe. This is essential to prevent infection. 2. Disinfect a needle: To safely drain a blister, you will need a sterilized needle. You can sterilize a needle at home by using rubbing alcohol or by holding it in an open flame (such as from a lighter or match) for a few seconds, and then letting it cool. 3. Drain the blister: Gently puncture the blister with the sterilized needle near its edge. Apply light pressure to the blister, allowing the fluid to drain out. This will relieve the pressure and help the healing process. Avoid tearing or removing the skin covering the blister, as it serves as a natural barrier against infection. 4. Apply antibiotic ointment: After draining the blister, apply a small amount of antibiotic ointment (such as Neosporin) to prevent infection. This step further ensures the healing process goes smoothly. 5. Cover the blister: Use a sterile, non-stick bandage or gauze pad to cover the blister. This helps protect it from further irritation and potential infection. Make sure to change the bandage daily or if it gets wet or dirty. 6. Avoid further irritation: If possible, wear open-toed shoes or footwear that doesn't cause friction on the affected area. You can also use padding or cushioning (such as moleskin or blister pads) around the blister to protect it from further irritation. 7. Monitor the healing process: Keep an eye on the blister as it heals. If you notice any signs of infection, such as increased redness, pus, or worsening pain and swelling, seek medical attention promptly. By following these steps, you can correctly and efficiently treat a foot blister, reducing the risk of infection and promoting faster healing."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given a short passage that conveys stereotype or anti-stereotype about a specific target.

Now, imagine we have 55 apples in one group and 15 apples in another group, and we don't know how many groups of apples we have (that's \\"q\\" - the number of groups). We also have 280 oranges. The total number of apples in the first group (55 * q) is equal to the total number of apples in the second group (15 * q) plus the 280 oranges. Our task is to find out how many groups of apples (q) we have. First, we will subtract the 15 apples from the 55 apples group. To make it easier to understand: imagine removing the second group of apples from the first group. We do this by subtracting 15*q from both sides of the equation: 55 * q - 15 * q = 15 * q - 15 * q + 280 Now, we can simplify it by calculating how many apples are left in the first group: 40 * q = 280 Next, we want to find out how many groups of apples (q) we have. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 40: (40 * q) / 40 = 280 / 40 This simplifies to: q = 7 So, we found that we have 7 groups of apples (q)."},{"question":"Translate the following sentence to Romanian: Lastly, for the future, we propose in this report to double the amount of research funding in order to create this European research area, with the help of the European Research Council.","response":"In order to translate this sentence to Romanian, I'll divide it into segments and translate each segment individually, maintaining the proper grammar and structure of the sentence in Romanian.

Most gas molecules in the atmosphere are pulled close to Earth’s surface by gravity. As a result, air pressure decreases quickly at lower altitudes and then more slowly at higher altitudes. This is illustrated in Figure below . Air pressure is greatest at sea level, where the depth of the atmosphere is greatest. At higher altitudes, the pressure is less because the depth of the atmosphere is less. For example, on top of Mount Everest, the tallest mountain on Earth, air pressure is only about one-third of the pressure at sea level. At such high altitudes, low air pressure makes it hard to breathe and is dangerous to human health. Now, I have a new situation: Molly has just moved to a new city for a job she was just hired for. She used to live in a city up in the mountains named Midgar. She liked living there due to the hikes she could go on and seeing the beautiful nature of the hills and mountains. The town she lives in now, Treno, is closer to sea level and is mostly flat plains and farm land. It's a change of scenery, and she hopes she starts to enjoy it more. Answer this question please: Which city has an atmosphere with less depth? A:","response":"A: Midgar has an atmosphere with less depth. This is because Midgar is located in the mountains, which means it is at a higher altitude. At higher altitudes, the air pressure is less due to the lesser depth of the atmosphere. In contrast, Treno is closer to sea level and has a deeper atmospheric layer, resulting in greater air pressure."},{"question":"Given the following reasoning and answer, what was the question?

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less water is absorbed by the plant happens, how will it affect LESS sugar and oxygen being produced. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","response":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of less water being absorbed by the plant can have a direct effect on the process of photosynthesis, which will consequently result in less sugar and oxygen being produced. When a plant absorbs less water, it can directly impact the process of photosynthesis in the following ways: 1. Water is an essential component in the photosynthesis process as it provides the hydrogen atoms needed for the formation of glucose (sugar). With less water absorbed, the plant will have limited hydrogen atoms for glucose formation, thus reducing the production of sugar. 2. In order to conserve water, plants may close their stomata in response to reduced water absorption. This will also limit the intake of carbon dioxide from the air, which is a primary reactant in photosynthesis. As a result, less carbon dioxide will be available for the production of sugars and oxygen, leading to a decrease in their overall production. 3. Less water in the plant can also result in reduced turgor pressure within the plant cells, affecting the overall structural integrity of the leaves and their ability to efficiently capture sunlight for photosynthesis. In turn, this will affect the production of sugars and oxygen. In conclusion, the perturbation of less water being absorbed by the plant will have a direct effect on the photosynthesis process.

She then spots a White Rabbit in a waistcoat passing by, exclaiming that he is \\"late for a very important date\\". Alice gives chase, following him into a large, furnished rabbit hole. She falls down into a vertical passage, and sees the Rabbit disappear into a room and leave through a tiny door. She tries to follow him but is too big to fit through the door, whose talking knob advises her to alter her size by drinking from a bottle marked âDrink Meâ, which appears on a table. The contents cause her to shrink rapidly. Unfortunately, the door is locked and the key is on the table, out of reach. A box of cookies appears before Alice, and she tries one marked âEat Meâ, and grows so large that her head hits the ceiling. Upset, she weeps large tears which flood the room. She drinks the last of the contents in the bottle and shrinks again, easily floating through the door's keyhole and into Wonderland inside the bottle.

Arrogant Matthew Duggan tells police he deserves better cell because he is 'better than anyone else here' By. David Baker. PUBLISHED:. 13:14 EST, 9 March 2012. |. UPDATED:. 13:18 EST, 9 March 2012. Appalling: Wealthy estate agent Matthew Duggan has been jailed for six years after a court heard the brutal rape was broadcast on the victim's mobile phone which accidentally dialled 999 during the attack. An estate agent who boasted that he was better than anyone else raped a young woman unaware that his brutal attack was heard by emergency services via the screaming victim’s mobile phone. Matthew Duggan from Sunbury-Upon-Thames, Middlesex, beat the 19-year-old girl black and blue before forcing her to perform oral sex on him and trying to have sex with her. But what neither he nor his bruised and bloodied victim realised was. that her mobile had somehow dialled 999 - meaning her cries for. help and his angry threats were heard by control operators manning an. emergency switchboard. The 20-year-old Duggan was jailed for six years after being. found guilty of rape and attempted rape by a jury, following an eight day. trial at Guildford Crown Court. He was also ordered to be put on the sex offenders register indefinitely. The court even heard how the arrogant defendant told police when he was arrested: 'I should be put in a more luxurious cell because I’m better than anyone else here'. The chillling remark was kept from the jury at Duggan’s trial but was read out by the Judge, Recorder Jeremy Carter-Manning, at today’s sentencing hearing. Jailing the defendant the Judge told him: 'You have an inappropriate opinion of your status and an inappropriate attitude towards women'. The Judge added: 'Your behaviour that evening was absolutely appalling and very serious indeed'. He also said there were unusual features to the case which made it of particular concern but that it was only Duggan’s comparative youth that had saved him from a much longer sentence. The Judge added: 'Bizarrely, and for some. reason that we don’t know, a mobile phone at the scene recorded and. transmitted to the emergency services details of what was a very. harrowing incident'. Jailed: Duggan was sentenced to six years in jail at Guildford Crown Court today for rape. The brutal attack was inadvertently heard by police operators after the victim's phone accidentally called 999. A recording of the incident was played to the jury, in which the terrified girl was heard begging for mercy as the defendant yelled: 'Open your legs. You’re getting raped.' Today’s hearing was told by defence counsel, Mr. Jon Swain, that his client came from a respectable supportive family and was highly thought of at work. But the events outlined in court showed a different and darker side to the defendant’s character. During the horrific ordeal the victim was stripped of her clothes and Duggan himself fled the scene naked after a local dog walker and friends arrived on the scene in a meadow at Chertsey, Surrey. The girl was rushed battered and bleeding to St. Peter’s Hospital, Chertsey, by ambulance. In her evidence, the girl told police: 'He was trying it on. I said no and that’s what made him really angry. 'I was telling him no. He punched me and blood was coming down my face. I had no clothes on. 'All I can remember was him forcing me to perform oral sex. 'The shock made it a blur. I couldn’t believe it.' Ruby Selva, prosecuting told the. court: 'The victim had 33 separate injuries on her body and dried blood. on her face. She also had a chipped tooth.' But. despite the damning weight of evidence against him, the defendant. denied the charges, saying: 'Any sexual contact between us was. consensual.' Arrogant: Estate agent Duggan told police when he was arrested that he 'should be put in a more luxurious cell because I'm better than anyone else here' Duggan admitted beating the girl up and even offered to plead guilty to assault causing actual bodily harm in an unsuccessful plea bargain. In his defence he claimed he had lost his temper and become consumed with 'hatred' after the victim had performed a 'vile' and painful sex act upon him while they were kissing and cuddling in some grass near the Meads, Chertsey, after meeting up following a night on the town. 'I felt violated. I wanted to cause her maximum pain.' he said. But the prosecution rejected Duggan’s version of events and insisted that the real reason for the defendant’s dramatic loss of control was because the girl had rejected his advances. He was arrested the in the early morning, the day after the attack, on July 24 last year after he had helped himself to some clothes from a boat on the River Thames. He answered 'no comment' to police questions and a GP called to examine him in the police cells, Dr Paul Brigg, said he was astonished at how relaxed and care-free the defendant seemed even after having been accused of such serious offences. 'He was flippant and jokey and didn’t seem to be taking the proceedings very seriously. I found it quite extraordinary,' said Dr. Brigg. The court heard that the girl, from Surrey, had met Duggan when she had gone out drinking with her mates. Ms Selva said that several members of the group had gone to the Meads but the defendant and the girl became separated from the others. She said Duggan suddenly turned violent when the she rejected his advances. 'During the ensuing attack, he repeatedly hit her and threatened her,' said Ms Selva. But unknown to the defendant or the victim, the girl’s mobile had somehow called 999 and was on during the incident. 'It recorded some of the attack. The call was harrowing and horrific in its content. 'Throughout the incident, the complainant was fighting, crying and begging the defendant to leave her alone,' she said. Ms Selva said the phone recording was a key piece of evidence. She added: 'It captures his brutality and his crimes. 'The injuries which the victim was found to have sustained were wholly consistent with force being used.' Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","response":"This case that occurred in 2012 involves a wealthy estate agent, Matthew Duggan, who was found guilty and sentenced to six years in prison for the brutal rape and attempted rape of a 19-year-old girl. The horrific attack was accidentally broadcast to emergency services when the victim's mobile phone dialed 999 during the incident, allowing police operators to hear the victim's pleas and the defendant's angry threats. The events unfolded in Sunbury-Upon-Thames, Middlesex. The assault included verbal threats, initial attempts of forced sex, beating, and then forced oral sex on Duggan. Following his arrest, Duggan showcased his arrogance by demanding luxury treatment in a cell, claiming his superiority over other detainees. The remark, while not shared with the jurors, was mentioned by the Judge, Recorder Jeremy Carter-Manning, during Duggan's sentencing. Carter-Manning emphasized Duggan's inappropriate opinions of himself and his ill attitude towards women, labelling Duggan's acts as absolutely appalling. In court, despite a recording and 33 separate injuries on the victim's body, along with dried blood on her face, Duggan contested the charges, claiming any sexual contact was consensual. He admitted to beating the girl and considered pleading guilty to causing actual bodily harm but did not alter his denial about the sexual assault. His main defense was based on the accusation that he'd lost his temper after the victim performed a 'vile' and painful sex act on him. The prosecution rejected this synopsis, insisting on the defendant's loss of control being rooted in the victim's rejection of his advances. On the morning after the attack, Duggan was found with clothes stolen from a boat along the River Thames. In his interactions with the police and medical personnel, Duggan seemed relaxed and dismissive, demonstrating no seriousness about the accusations brought against him. The victim, in her testimony, recounted her horrifying experience, the pain and shock, and Duggan's violent reaction to her rejecting his advances. Despite her traumatic experience, the victim held strong and spoke against her assaulter, and her mobile phone's accidental call to emergency services served as a vital piece of evidence, documenting Duggan's heinous crime. His 6-year sentence and indefinite registration as a sex offender serves as a chilling reminder of the violence he enacted, showcasing a stark contrast from his previous life as a respected estate agent from a supportive family."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Article: Life-long learning is the concept that \\"It's never too soon or too late for learning.\\" -- a philosophy that has taken root in a larger number of different organizations. Life-long learning is an attitude -- learners believe that one can and should be open to new ideas, decisions, skills or behaviors. Life-long learning throws the well-known rule \\"You can't teach an old dog new tricks\\" out of the door. Life-long learning provides the general public with learning opportunities at all ages and in different ways: at work, at home and through leisure activities, not just through formal channels such as school and higher education. Life-long education is often achieved through distance learning or e-learning, continuing education, home schooling, etc. It also includes training programs for those who want to improve their qualifications, bring their skills up to date or retrain for a new line of work. In later life, especially in retirement, continued learning takes various forms, crossing traditional academic limits. One of the reasons why life-long education has become so important is the rapid progress of modern science and technology. Although the period of primary, secondary and university education is increased, the knowledge and skills gained there are usually not _ for a professional career spanning three or four decades. Question: What is the main idea behind life-long education? Yes or no, is the answer \\"To allow people to have chances to receive education throughout their life.\\"? Answer:","response":"The main idea behind life-long education is to promote the idea that learning can and should continue throughout one's life, as opposed to being limited to formal education settings like schools and universities.

Comedy of intrigue is a genre that includes what comedy by William Shakespeare that is thought to have been written in 1598?","response":"Yes, I can answer this complex question that requires reasoning about the input. The comedy of intrigue, a genre which involves disguises, mistaken identities, and intricate plots, features a play by William Shakespeare that is believed to have been written in 1598. This play is \\"Much Ado About Nothing.\\" \\"Much Ado About Nothing\\" is a classic example of a comedy of intrigue because it skillfully weaves together various subplots, misunderstandings, and deceptions. The play revolves around two pairs of lovers – Hero and Claudio, and Beatrice and Benedick – who are brought together by means of cunning plans, trickery, and carefully orchestrated ruses. The main plot of \\"Much Ado About Nothing\\" focuses on the imminent wedding of Hero, the daughter of Leonato, and Claudio, a nobleman serving under Don Pedro, the prince of Aragon. However, the couple's path to marital bliss becomes complicated when Don John, Don Pedro's envious half-brother, devises a plan to defame Hero by making Claudio mistakenly believe that she has been unfaithful. He does this by having his associate, Borachio, engage in a staged amorous scene with Margaret, Hero's gentlewoman, in a location visible to Claudio and Don Pedro, leading them to conclude that Hero is disloyal. As a result, a heartbroken Claudio publicly denounces Hero on their wedding day. Parallel to this, another subplot unfolds involving Beatrice, Hero's cousin, and Benedick, a close friend of Claudio and Don Pedro. Despite their initial animosity and constant verbal sparring, several characters in the play, including Don Pedro, conspire to make each of them believe that the other is secretly in love with them. This ruse eventually leads Beatrice and Benedick to recognize their true feelings for one another and declare their love openly. As the play progresses, the truth about Don John's scheme is eventually unveiled, largely through the comedic efforts of the bumbling, yet surprisingly competent constable Dogberry and his team of night watchmen. They accidentally overhear the conversation between Don John's co-conspirators, Borachio and Conrad, which reveals Don John's malicious deception. Consequently, Claudio's wrongful accusation is proven false, and he and Hero reconcile and proceed with their wedding plans. The story concludes with a double wedding, as Beatrice and Benedick also decide to get married, signifying the triumph of love and good intentions over deceit and villainy. Overall, \\"Much Ado About Nothing,\\" with its intricate plot, mistaken identities, and deceptions, is a prime example of a comedy of intrigue written by William Shakespeare around 1598. It remains one of his most popular and frequently performed plays, continuing to captivate audiences with its brilliant blend of wit, humor, and romance."},{"question":"Write an article based on this summary: Don’t spread gossip.

Every time we share good things, like kindness and love, the ball gets even brighter and happier. But, if we share mean things, like gossip, the ball loses its light and starts to get sadder and duller. So, in a big big world where everyone carries their own balls of light, wouldn't you want to keep your ball happy and bright? Now, when someone tries to share gossip with you, think about it like this. This person is passing you a dark, sad ball. Would you want to keep that? No, right? So, you can tell that person how you really feel. You might say something like, \\"I don't think it's nice to talk about someone like this.\\" Always remember, sharing bright, happy things makes the world a lovelier place. Sometimes, people will tell you things in secret. They might say things like, \\"I'm telling you this, but don't tell anyone else.\\" When they do that, they're giving you their light ball to keep safe. It's your job to make sure it stays happy and bright, and doesn't get turned into a dark, sad ball by becoming gossip. What if someone is mean to you, though? What if they try to turn your happy ball into a sad one? Well, then, you can think of yourself as a superhero with a shield. This shield keeps your ball safe from mean words or actions. It's important to stay calm and kind, even if other people are not being kind. Sometimes, people might ask you questions that feel too personal, or that feel like they're not really their business. That's when you can say, \\"I don't think it's nice to ask that.\\" Remember, it's okay not to answer everything. Learning to say no is part of being a good ball keeper. Lastly, changing up your routine can be fun. It's like switching paths on a walk or choosing a new game to play. This keeps life exciting and new, and might even lead to finding new bright, happy balls!

Broad shallow seas advanced across central North America (the Western Interior Seaway) and Europe, then receded late in the period, leaving thick marine deposits sandwiched between coal beds. At the peak of the Cretaceous transgression, one-third of Earth's present land area was submerged. The Cretaceous is justly famous for its chalk; indeed, more chalk formed in the Cretaceous than in any other period in the Phanerozoic. Mid-ocean ridge activity—or rather, the circulation of seawater through the enlarged ridges—enriched the oceans in calcium; this made the oceans more saturated, as well as increased the bioavailability of the element for calcareous nanoplankton. These widespread carbonates and other sedimentary deposits make the Cretaceous rock record especially fine. Famous formations from North America include the rich marine fossils of Kansas's Smoky Hill Chalk Member and the terrestrial fauna of the late Cretaceous Hell Creek Formation. Other important Cretaceous exposures occur in Europe and China. In the area that is now India, massive lava beds called the Deccan Traps were laid down in the very late Cretaceous and early Paleocene.\\"? Answer:","response":"Question: Based on the passage, what factors contributed to the unique characteristics of the Cretaceous period, including the formation of chalk and the deposition of sedimentary layers? Provide specific examples of noteworthy formations and exposures that resulted from these factors. Answer: The Cretaceous period is characterized by unique factors that contributed to the formation of chalk and deposition of sedimentary layers. The narrowing of the Tethys Sea to the north of Africa, along with advancing and then receding shallow seas across central North America and Europe, led to the creation of thick marine deposits sandwiched between coal beds. The Cretaceous period is also famous for its chalk formation, more so than any other period in the Phanerozoic. One of the primary reasons for the increased formation of chalk during this time was the activity of mid-ocean ridges. The circulation of seawater through these enlarged ridges enriched the oceans in calcium, resulting in increased saturation of calcium and its bioavailability for calcareous nanoplankton. This subsequently led to the widespread carbonates and other sedimentary deposits, making the Cretaceous rock record particularly exceptional. Some of the most famous formations from this period in North America include the rich marine fossils found in Kansas's Smoky Hill Chalk Member and the terrestrial fauna of the late Cretaceous Hell Creek Formation. Additionally, important Cretaceous exposures have also been discovered in Europe and China. In the region now known as India, massive lava beds called the Deccan Traps were laid down during the very late Cretaceous and early Paleocene, further signifying the unique geological activity during the Cretaceous period."},{"question":"Here are some concepts: adjoin, bedroom, room What is a sentence about these concepts?","response":"Adjoining the spacious main bedroom, which features an extensive walk-in closet and sleek minimalist design elements, one can discover a quiet, cozy room tailored for relaxation and private conversations, providing a harmonious balance between personal retreat and engaging social space within the modern family home."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Su Can (Vincent Zhao) is a general who leads a military force to save a prince from a large fortress of enemies in the mountains.

Translate to German","response":"To accomplish this task, I will use my inherent language translation capabilities to convert the English text into German. Step 1: Identify the English Sentence The sentence here is: \\"This arrangement shall apply exclusively to voluntary set-aside\\". Step 2: Translate the Sentence to German In German, it translates to: \\"Diese Vereinbarung gilt ausschließlich für freiwilliges Beiseitelegen\\". The logic behind is to interpret the context and intended meaning of each word in the sentence, and then find the appropriate German equivalent of that word, while maintaining the same meaning and context in the overall sentence. In essence, it involves mapping of words, phrases and syntax from one language to another. For instance, - This arrangement > Diese Vereinbarung - shall apply > gilt - exclusively to > ausschließlich für - voluntary set-aside > freiwilliges Beiseitelegen Conclusion: The English sentence \\"This arrangement shall apply exclusively to voluntary set-aside\\" translates to \\"Diese Vereinbarung gilt ausschließlich für freiwilliges Beiseitelegen\\" in German."},{"question":"Question 1: How should I approach guy I like? Question 2: How do I approach a guy? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","response":"First, let's analyze both questions: Question 1: How should I approach the guy I like? This question is specific to the person that the asker has feelings for. Question 2: How do I approach a guy? This question is more general and could apply to any guy, not necessarily someone the asker has feelings for. Although both questions are about approaching a guy, the context and the goal are different. However, the general principles of approaching someone may still apply to both situations. So, the answer to these two questions might not be exactly the same, but they could have overlapping advice and steps. Here are some tips for each situation. Answer to Question 1: How should I approach the guy I like? Step 1: Observe his interests and hobbies. This will give you a common ground to start a conversation. Step 2: Try to become friends first. Building a strong friendship can be a foundation for a romantic relationship. Step 3: Show genuine interest in his life and thoughts. This will help you connect on a deeper level and show that you are genuinely interested in what he has to say. Step 4: Look for mutual friends and social settings to interact. Having mutual friends and spending time together in a group can help create a relaxed environment for getting to know each other better. Step 5: Be yourself and be confident. Confidence is attractive, and being honest and authentic is essential to building a solid connection. Answer to Question 2: How do I approach a guy? Step 1: Start with a friendly greeting or casual conversation. This can break the ice and make the interaction feel less intimidating. Step 2: Find a common ground for conversation. Discuss shared interests or hobbies to keep the conversation flowing naturally. Step 3: Be a good listener and ask open-ended questions. This will show that you're engaged in the conversation and encourage the guy to share more about himself. Step 4: Be approachable and relaxed. Displaying a positive and approachable demeanor will make the interaction more comfortable for both of you. Step 5: Be respectful and considerate. Regardless of the context, it's essential to treat the person with respect and kindness. In conclusion, the answers to the two questions have similarities in basic communication skills and building a connection; however, the context and goals differ, leading to slight differences in the approach."},{"question":"Does \\"machinery\\" mean the same thing in these two sentences? The complex machinery of negotiation. The machinery of command labored and brought forth an order.","response":"The phrase \\"machinery\\" in both sentences carries similar yet subtly different connotations depending on the context it is used. The core concept behind both is the same; machinery in this sense is a metaphorical usage denoting systems or processes, rather than the literal meaning of physical equipment with moving parts. It signifies a complex and established procedure consisting of many parts, much like a machine. 1) \\"The complex machinery of negotiation.\\" In this context, \\"machinery\\" is used to describe the intricate process of negotiation. It can include a wide variety of elements such as the strategic planning involved, the discussions that take place, the methods used for problem-solving, the tactics employed for persuading or influencing others, and the steps necessary for reaching a favorable solution or agreement. The word \\"complex\\" infers that this process is not straightforward or simple; it involves various moving parts that are all interconnected, just like the inner workings of a mechanical machine. There is a 'mechanics' to the way negotiations work, a certain 'giv-and-take', strategic movements, subtle manipulations, and these are presented metaphorically as the machinery of negotiation. 2) \\"The machinery of command labored and brought forth an order.\\" Here, \\"machinery\\" has been employed to personify the process through which a command is issued. This process might involve decision making at various levels, discussions among superiors, strategic deliberation, compliance with regulations or protocols, drafting the command, and finally, executing or issuing it. The phrase \\"labored and brought forth an order\\" suggests this process is not immediate or easy, it required effort and work, similar to a machine being laboriously operated to produce a certain output — in this case, an order. So, whilst \\"machinery\\" is used metaphorically to represent a system or process in both sentences, the process it is referring to is different based on the context: the first being the system of negotiation and the second being the system through which command operates. It shows the versatility of the word 'machinery' in terms of adapting to various contexts to express the idea of a systematic and orderly process with many sub-components."},{"question":"Question: Facts: - clubs: shargh pas tehran taj - position: goalkeeper -lrb- retired -rrb- - nationalcaps: 2 - years: 1958 -- 1959 1964 -- 1970 1970 -- 1972 - nationalyears: 1962-1969 - youthclubs: shargh - nationalgoals: 0 - ntupdate: 27 may 2013 - youthyears: 1958 -- 1959 - birth date: 31 december 1940 - fullname: faramarz zelli - name: faramarz zelli - nationalteam: iran - birth place: iran Based on these bullet points, write a short biography describing the life of faramarz zelli .

It now seems that a new fitness title is released every other month. While their sheer numbers certainly prove that this genre of game has become big business, no game of this type has yet presented a credible challenge to the Wii Fit franchise's dominance of this market. The only title that has come anywhere near close is EA Sports Active which was released earlier this year and has since sold nearly two million units. Now, with the festive season upon us, and the promise of an ever expanding girth brought on by parties, dinners and calorie-rich Christmas pudding, EA has released a sequel in the form of EA Sports Active More Workouts. If the title seems unimaginative, take heart in the fact that at least this fitness game does exactly what it says on the box. EA Sports Active More Workouts doesn't really offer an experience that differs all that much from its predecessor. Rather, it builds on the solid foundations of EA Sports Active, while expanding its content to include larger workout challenges, stretching and cool-down periods and exercises that target more areas of the body. The overall formula here is the same as before; players use the Wii Remote and Nunchuck in conjunction with a resistance strap and a leg band to perform exercises that are aimed at toning muscles and burning fat. At the time of this writing, EA Sports Active More Workouts is only available as a stand-alone entity; newcomers to the franchise will have to fork over around £15 for the game's accessories, which are currently sold separately. It's unclear at this time whether it will ever be sold as a bundle, but the cost of EA Sports Active: More Workouts and the EA Sports Active accessory pack add up to the same cost as the first game anyway. Veterans, for their part, will save a little bit of cash and will be able to import their fitness profile from EA Sports Active over to their new game. Aside from a couple of tweaks, the experience of exercising is the same as before. Players tuck the Nunchuck into the pocket of the leg-strap in order to perform exercises below the waist (such as lunges) and most of the longer cardio exercises. The Wii Remote and Nunchuck are used for upper body exercises, both on their own (for cardio boxing or squash) and with the resistance strap for toning exercises (bicep curls, lateral raises and so forth). There is the option to use a balance board, although owning one isn't essential to play the game. Each exercise is introduced with a brief video in which the player is shown what to do and also what position to stand in. Players can set the difficulty of their exercises as well as set goals for burning calories or hours spent working out. All throughout the workouts, the players will be encouraged by a virtual trainer whose gender they can pick from the start, and whose psychotically cheerful demeanour will eventually cause them to fantasise about hurling a brick through their television's screen. With the core experience basically untouched, EA Sports Active More Workouts differs from it predecessor by the depth of new content and a handful of cosmetic changes. Owners of the first game will notice a couple of tweaks right from the loading screen; the soundtrack is a little more sedate and all of the scenery has changed. The avatars now mirror the player's activities in an island paradise which not only looks better than the slightly bland track and field environment from the first game, it also offers some new activities. Another big change is that the first game's 30-day challenge has been replaced by a new 6-week challenge, presumably to increase the possibility that exercising in the living room will become more of a long-term commitment. Once again, the challenge also encourages players to fill in details about their daily diet and activities to help build up a more accurate trajectory of their progress. However, all set workouts now have warm up and cool down periods, which corrects a potentially harmful omission from the first game – especially for players who habitually worked out on the hardest settings. The new game offers around 35 new exercises in total; some are evolutions of exercises in EA Sports Active (such as cardio boxing with moving targets) and some are only available with the balance board (such as step-ups). There are also a lot of brand new exercises which use the peripherals in new and interesting ways and allow players to target areas of muscles on their bodies. Probably the most noticeable collection of new exercises – which were conspicuous by their absence in the first game – are those that target stomach muscles such as crunches and (horrendous) leg raises. There are also a large selection of exercises which take advantage of the game's tropical paradise setting such as water skiing, paddle surfing and obstacle courses involving flotation devices. Unfortunately EA Sports Active More Workouts carries over a couple of gameplay drawbacks from the original title. The Nunchuck and Wii sometimes takes longer to register one leg than the other during lunge exercises. The journal entries are improved somewhat, but they're still too just general to offer any worthwhile nutritional advice and the workouts have too much of a heavy reliance on calorie counting. As far as the peripherals are concerned, the fabric leg-strap is still a solid piece of kit, but the resistance strap is fairly useless as a toning implement. It's a shame that the new game doesn't offer a better peripheral that could actually help build muscle on the upper part of the body – especially when the rest of the game seems to offer a more well-rounded exercising experience than its predecessor. The only other problem the game has is that it may seem like a bit of a cash-grab to anyone who bought the first instalment in the series; asking full price for what could be offered as DLC (at a substantially lower cost) on either Xbox Live or PSN may cause a little consternation. Then again, maybe not. The arrival of EA Sports Active More Workouts barely six months after its predecessor hasn't caused fans of the original to start a boycott, after all - which if anything proves fitness games just don't have the same hold over players as zombie shooters. Niggles aside, it's a huge improvement on EA Sports Active. While EA hasn't tinkered too much with the foundations of the franchise, the tweaks, tucks and additional content make EA Sports Active More Workouts feel like a far more effective fitness package than its predecessor. For players who want to work up a sweat in front of their consoles it's one of the best titles available. What are the most important parts of this text?","response":"The review highlights EA Sports Active More Workouts as a sequel to the successful home exercise game EA Sports Active on the Nintendo Wii. The game offers a similar experience to its predecessor but with expanded content, improved workout challenges, stretching and cool-down exercises, and a focus on muscle toning and fat burning. The game has a 6-week challenge instead of the previous 30-day challenge, and features warm-up and cool-down periods as well. The introduction of 35 new exercises focused on areas such as stomach muscles and innovative peripheral usage is another addition. Despite some drawbacks and potential improvements with peripherals and gameplay, the game is considered a significant improvement over the previous iteration and a worthwhile fitness game for the Wii."},{"question":"Objective: When should I pick my tomato plants off the vine? Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning?","response":"To determine when you should pick your tomato plants off the vine and compare the solutions in terms of naive physics reasoning, I will outline the crucial factors and reasoning behind each solution: Solution 1: Picking tomatoes when they are fully ripened and have their full color Steps and justification: 1. Observe the color of the tomatoes: Tomatoes will usually have a consistent, vibrant color (typically red, but other colors can indicate ripeness in different varieties) when they are ripe. Picking them at this stage ensures that they have reached their peak flavor. 2. Check for firmness with gentle pressure: Ripe tomatoes should have a slight yield when gentle pressure is applied. This indicates they have reached their optimal taste and texture. 3. Some tomatoes may ripen at different rates: It's natural for some tomatoes to ripen before others. Picking ripe tomatoes as they reach this stage ensures that each tomato is harvested at its peak. Solution 2: Picking tomatoes when they are slightly underripe and allowing them to ripen off the vine Steps and justification: 1. Look for tomatoes that have started to change color but have not fully ripened: Tomatoes that have begun the ripening process but are still slightly underripe can continue to ripen off the vine. This can help in harvesting tomatoes in batches and reduce the chance of overripe or rotten tomatoes on the vine. 2. Pick the tomatoes and place them somewhere with consistent room temperature: Storing the tomatoes in a warm, dry environment will allow them to continue their ripening process. Keeping them away from direct sunlight can help to prevent uneven ripening. 3. Check on the tomatoes regularly: Monitor the ripening process by checking for changes in color, texture, and scent. Once the tomatoes reach the desired level of ripeness, they can be consumed or stored in a cooler environment to slow down any further ripening. Comparing these two solutions in terms of naive physics reasoning: Solution 1 focuses on picking tomatoes at the peak of their ripeness, which can lead to a better taste and texture when consumed immediately. This is a straightforward approach that is easy to understand and apply. Solution 2, on the other hand, allows for more flexibility in the harvesting process by picking tomatoes in batches. This can help prevent overripe or rotten tomatoes on the vine, and allow for a more consistent harvest over time. This method involves a slightly more complex understanding of the ripening process and how environmental factors affect it. Based on these analyses, if you prioritize taste and consuming tomatoes immediately, Solution 1 may be more favorable. However, if you are looking for more flexibility in the harvesting process and wish to reduce waste from overripe or rotten tomatoes, Solution 2 may be a better choice. Both can work effectively depending on your preferences and garden management style."},{"question":"Berliner played for his countrys Olympiad team at 10th Chess Olympiad, drawing his only game on the second reserve board.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","response":"In the scenario where the earth's plates are stable, it would lead to fewer and weaker earthquakes. To understand how it affects the process mentioned and identify the supposed perturbation, let's break down each step of the process: 1. Energy builds up in the crust of the earth: In a stable plate scenario, the tectonic plates would interact with each other much less. As a result, the accumulation of energy within the earth's crust would be less significant. The energy build-up might still occur, but at a reduced level compared to an unstable scenario. 2. The energy causes the fault lines give way: Fault lines form where tectonic plates meet and grind against each other. In a stable plate scenario, the reduced energy build-up decreases the stress on these fault lines, making them less likely to give way. 3. The earth's plates move: When the plates are stable, their movement would be at a much slower pace or might not occur at all. This minimizes strain along fault lines that could trigger earthquakes. 4. The energy radiates outward from the fault in all directions: If there are fewer fault lines giving way and less energy released, the energy that radiates outward will be much lower. Meaning, the overall energy transmitted during stable conditions would result in weaker earthquakes. 5. The seismic waves shake the earth as they move through it: As the released energy is lower during stable conditions, the seismic waves generated during an earthquake would also be less intense. This ultimately results in weaker shaking. Considering these factors, the supposed perturbation in the given scenario is indirectly impacting the steps of the process. The stability of the plates does not completely halt the energy build-up, movement of plates, or energy radiation. However, it significantly reduces the stress in the fault lines, leading to weaker and fewer earthquakes. The entire chain reaction of processes is affected by the initial decrease in energy build-up, making the perturbation indirect rather than directly impacting a specific step."},{"question":"Teacher:Given a sentence in English language, translate the sentence to Somali language keeping the meaning of the original sentence intact Teacher: Now, understand the problem?

The libretto was prepared by Giacomo Rossi from a scenario provided by Aaron Hill, and the work was first performed at the Queen's Theatre in London's Haymarket on 24 February 1711. The story of love, war and redemption, set at the time of the First Crusade, is loosely based on Torquato Tasso's epic poem Gerusalemme liberata (\\"Jerusalem Delivered\\"), and its staging involved many original and vivid effects. It was a great success with the public, despite negative reactions from literary critics hostile to the contemporary trend towards Italian entertainment in English theatres. Handel composed Rinaldo quickly, borrowing and adapting music from operas and other works that he had composed during a long stay in Italy in the years 1706–10, during which he established a considerable reputation. In the years following the premiere, he made numerous amendments to the score. Rinaldo is regarded by critics as one of Handel's greatest operas. Of its individual numbers, the soprano aria \\"Lascia ch'io pianga\\" has become a particular favourite, and is a popular concert piece. Handel went on to dominate opera in England for several decades. Rinaldo was revived in London regularly up to 1717, and in a revised version in 1731; of all Handel's operas, Rinaldo was the most frequently performed during his lifetime. After 1731, however, the opera was not staged for more than 200 years. Renewed interest in baroque opera during the 20th century led to the first modern professional production in Handel's birthplace, Halle, Germany, in 1954. The opera was mounted sporadically over the following thirty years; after a successful run at New York's Metropolitan Opera in 1984, performances and recordings of the work have become more frequent worldwide. Rinaldo was the first Handel Opera to have found its way to the Metropolitan. The opera's tercentenary in 2011 brought a modernized..., what would be the answer ?

True birds first appeared during the Cretaceous period, around 100 million years ago. DNA-based evidence finds that birds diversified dramatically around the time of the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event that killed off all other dinosaurs. Birds in South America survived this event and then migrated to other parts of the world via multiple land bridges while diversifying during periods of global cooling. Primitive bird-like dinosaurs that lie outside class Aves proper, in the broader group Avialae, have been found dating back to the mid-Jurassic period. Many of these early \\"stem-birds\\", such as Archaeopteryx, were not yet capable of fully powered flight, and many retained primitive characteristics like toothy jaws in place of beaks, and long bony tails.\\" Answer: Answer:","response":"Archaeopteryx is part of the Avialae group, which is a clade within the larger Coelurosauria group of theropod dinosaurs. The Avialae group encompasses both the ancient stem-birds, which were bird-like dinosaurs, and the more recent class Aves, which includes all modern birds. The fossil record suggests that Avialae originated in the late Jurassic period, around 160 million years ago. Archaeopteryx, one of the earliest and most iconic members of this group, has been dated to approximately 150 million years ago. As described in the context provided, Archaeopteryx and other early stem-birds are characterized by a unique combination of both dinosaur-like and bird-like features, signifying their transitional nature between non-avian theropods and modern birds. Some of these primitive characteristics include toothy jaws, long bony tails, and partially developed wings that may not have supported fully powered flight. The evolution of the Avialae group, and eventually the emergence of true birds (class Aves), is intertwined with various evolutionary pressures and external events, such as the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event around 66 million years ago, which wiped out all non-avian dinosaurs. Existing birds in South America were able to survive this mass extinction, and subsequently diversified and migrated to different areas of the world through land bridges and global cooling events. This diversity and adaptability led to the more than 10,000 species of birds we have today, all belonging to the class Aves within the Avialae group. Decision-makers increasingly integrate the important findings from studying ancient species like Archaeopteryx into our understanding of the evolutionary relationships between dinosaurs and birds, as well as the broader history of life on Earth."},{"question":"In this task you will be given a passage and a yes/no question based on the passage.

Do you want to improve your communication with a family member or friend who is deaf? Do you want to be able to communicate with deaf people in general? Would you like to advance in your career by being able to communicate in ASL? Do you want to be a Sign Language interpreter? Sign language is not just a random collection of gestures but a full-blown language in its own right, complete with its own grammatical rules. Each country or region has its own sign language, as different from each other as English is from Spanish. Each version of sign language is somewhat linked to the spoken language in its region. For example, American sign language does share similarities with English, even though it is its own language. The advantages of knowing sign language in addition to a spoken language are many. Communication becomes possible on many levels with the deaf community, with other people either hearing or not in any of the above situations, as well as many more. While other languages take years to learn, American Sign Language can be taught in a much shorter time period. It is one of the easiest languages to learn because most of the signs were developed to mimic the actual word or phrase it is representing. Even the alphabet signs look like the letters of the English alphabet. American Sign Language, or ASL, is the third most used language in the United States. Used by the deaf community, interpreters, and friends and family of the deaf. There are a lot of sites on the internet that not only shows you the sign with video, but will help you practice reading signs as well. Teaching even hearing babies sign language seems to be the fashion in recent years and for good reason. Communicating in sign language is fun and natural as babies naturally use body gestures in early communication. Teaching baby sign language actually appears to enhance the learning of verbal skills and brain development of the children involved.

Translation: Amazingly, the weather during the given time was perfect, contrary to the forecasts or conditions present before and after the event. Such a fortunate turn of weather is appreciated, as the chances of experiencing such a scenario are rare. In this instance, one would express gratitude to whoever or whatever is believed to have played a role in this favorable outcome, although it most likely occurred by simple chance or coincidence. Despite the fact that precise weather predictions are hard to make, due to the complex and constantly changing state of the atmosphere, meteorologists put significant effort and resources into providing the most accurate forecasts possible. Even advanced computer models can only simulate a limited range of potential outcomes, given the huge number of variables that exert an influence on the weather's steady or erratic course. As a result, although many weather forecasts are fairly accurate, there are still unexpected events that can occur, much like the ideal weather experienced during that specific time. Consequently, this could be seen as a pleasant surprise or a stroke of luck, particularly if the ideal weather conditions took place during an event where favorable weather was important or essential. People might attribute this to fate, or to the power of positive thinking or even prayers that might influence the outcome. This underlines the human tendency to look for a reason or cause behind any exceptional occurrence, especially when it leads to a positive outcome. In conclusion, this statement captures the appreciation for a fortunate weather event and alludes to both the unpredictability of the weather and the human tendency to attribute it to an external force beyond our control. Regardless of the origin of this favorable weather, those experiencing it are undoubtedly grateful for the serendipitous situation and the perfect conditions that prevailed, against all odds."},{"question":"Translate the following.

I can't lay claim to much in the way of literary knowledge, but I do know that Proust's 'Remembrance of Things Past' was prompted by his biting into a pastry and feeling a sense of overwhelming pleasure with no recognizable cause. In my case, I was instantly transported back to the grandmother's kitchen as she and my mother grated potatoes in order to make 'poutine râpée', also known as 'poutines'. People will immediately flash to the Quebecker ethnic food known by the same name. However, in spite of all the Franco-culinary posturing, this is really only French Fries with gravy and, oh yeah, can I have some cheese curds on that? One etymological source indicates that 'poutine' really means 'mess'. If you come from my part of the country, the Quebecker poutine is just another entry in the long list of dishes that will cause you to keel over from a myocardial infarction while shoveling a foot of snow out of the driveway shortly after you've retired; sometimes before. Nope, poutines as I know them are a different creature entirely. They seem to be more of an Acadian thing and none of my friends had even heard of them, much less eaten a single one. Because of the work involved, my mother only made poutines for special times: Christmas, say or Easter. My mother would borrow this grater that was about two feet long and she and my grandmother would set to work. Generally, they started off with an enormous paper sack of potatoes, about 25 pounds or so (We used to buy potatoes by the cartload and store them in a wooden bin in the basement. Because we were cheap labour, the kids would be sent down to retrieve a few for the family meal. It was creepy to descend into the dank cellar, feel our way through the dim obstacle course formed by my grandfather's thousands of tools and bits of wood and locate the bin. After a time in storage, the eyes on potatoes began to sprout pale tendrils and it didn't take much imagination to visualize all kinds... According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

To the dev: using the ahnk crashes my game and forces a new game. Please fix.\\" Answer:","response":"To determine the rating of this review, let's break it down step by step: 1. The reviewer has a love/hate relationship with the game, which suggests conflicting feelings. 2. The reviewer admits to being not good at rogue-like games and has difficulty progressing, which may influence their opinion. 3. Despite this difficulty, the reviewer highly recommends the game to others, suggesting that they still find it enjoyable and worth trying. 4. The reviewer addresses a specific issue they have encountered with the game (the Ahnk), which indicates some dissatisfaction. Based on these aspects, the review seems to have both positive and negative elements. Considering that the reviewer recommends others to download the game, the review leans more towards a positive rating. Taking all these factors into account, I would give this review a ★★★½ rating. The positive recommendation and the overall enjoyment of the game carry significant weight in the rating. However, the frustration with the rogue-like genre and the specific issue with the Ahnk prevent the review from reaching a higher rating of ★★★★ or ★★★★★."},{"question":"Consider the question. The temple has been mentioned in the Puranas including the Kashi Khanda (section) of Skanda Purana. The original Vishwanath temple was destroyed by the army of Qutb-ud-din Aibak in 1194 CE, when he defeated the Raja of Kannauj as a commander of Mohammad Ghori. The temple was rebuilt by a Gujarati merchant during the reign of Delhi's Sultan Iltutmish (1211-1266 CE). It was demolished again during the rule of either Hussain Shah Sharqi (1447-1458) or Sikandar Lodhi (1489-1517). Raja Man Singh built the temple during Mughal emperor Akbar's rule, but orthodox Hindus boycotted it as he had let the Mughals marry within his family. Raja Todar Mal further re-built the temple with Akbar's funding at its original site in 1585. Answer this question based on the passage: who build kashi vishwanath temple in 16 century?

Determine the builder of the temple during this period: From the same statement mentioned above, we know that it was Raja Todar Mal who re-built the temple. Since 1585 falls within the 16th century (1501-1600 CE), Raja Todar Mal is the person who built the Kashi Vishwanath temple in the 16th century."},{"question":"I heard that Lee had caught Carson in a lie, so Carson tried to provide Lee with an explanation. And I was wondering What will Carson want to do next? Answer:","response":"Carson, having been caught in a lie by Lee, would likely want to take a few steps to address the situation and repair any damage done to their relationship or reputation. While it is not possible to predict an individual's actions with certainty, some common next steps might include: 1. Apologizing: Carson will want to start with a sincere apology, demonstrating remorse for lying and acknowledging the negative impact it has had on Lee and their relationship. 2. Explaining: Carson has already tried providing Lee with an explanation, but it's essential to ensure that the explanation is honest, clear, and addresses the reasons for the lie. This might involve admitting any fears or insecurities that led to the deception and discussing alternatives to lying that could be used in the future. 3. Taking responsibility: Carson should take full responsibility for the lie and avoid deflecting blame onto external circumstances or other individuals. This shows maturity and understanding of the gravity of the situation. 4. Making amends: If the lie has caused tangible harm to Lee or others, Carson should attempt to make amends in some way. This could involve correcting any misinformation spread by the lie or offering support to those affected. 5. Rebuilding trust: Trust is often damaged when lies are uncovered, so Carson will need to work on rebuilding trust with Lee. This involves being consistently honest and transparent in their interactions moving forward. 6. Reflecting on the situation: Carson should take some time to reflect on the reasons behind the lie and learn from this experience. This might involve seeking personal growth through self-improvement techniques, therapy, or focusing on better communication skills. 7. Giving space: Finally, depending on the severity of the lie and Lee's reaction, Carson might need to give Lee some space and time to process the situation before attempting to repair the relationship fully. Carson's strategy will likely involve some combination of these steps, with their specific actions adapted based on the details of the situation, their personal values, and the preferences of the individuals involved."},{"question":"If He awoke from a dream of monsters tearing him apart and eating him as he screamed and watched., can we conclude that \\"He had such a pleasant dream he wanted to go back to bed. \\"?","response":"To determine if we can conclude, \\"He had such a pleasant dream he wanted to go back to bed,\\" let's go through the steps. Step 1: Analyze the initial statement The statement says that he awoke from a dream of monsters tearing him apart and eating him as he screamed and watched.

It called for an immediate end to these attacks and stressed the importance of respecting international humanitarian law. The report also documented multiple incidents of civilian executions and kidnappings by the Islamic State, highlighting the brutal nature of their tactics in the region. U.N. investigators urged for increased efforts to protect civilians and provide humanitarian assistance to those affected by the ongoing conflict. Moreover, they emphasized the need to address the root causes of radicalization and extremism in order to prevent the further growth of terrorist organizations like the Islamic State. The international community, led by the United Nations, has a crucial role to play in facilitating peace talks and supporting regional efforts to counter terrorism. Furthermore, the report encourages world powers to increase cooperation and intelligence-sharing, in order to identify and apprehend those responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity. In conclusion, the most logical way to complete this passage is by emphasizing that the protection of civilians and holding perpetrators accountable for their actions are paramount. Strategizing a multifaceted approach that addresses the root causes of extremism and promotes international cooperation is essential to resolve the crisis in northeast Syria."},{"question":"The geologic record of the Proterozoic (2,500 to 541 million years ago) is more complete than that for the preceding Archean. In contrast to the deep-water deposits of the Archean, the Proterozoic features many strata that were laid down in extensive shallow epicontinental seas; furthermore, many of these rocks are less metamorphosed than Archean-age ones, and plenty are unaltered. Study of these rocks show that the eon featured massive, rapid continental accretion (unique to the Proterozoic), supercontinent cycles, and wholly modern orogenic activity. Roughly 750 million years ago, the earliest-known supercontinent Rodinia, began to break apart. The continents later recombined to form Pannotia, 600–540 Ma. If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What type of continental behavior was a unique to the Archean period?","response":"While it may not be possible to definitively attribute a unique type of continental behavior solely to the Archean period, there are certain characteristics observed in this eon that distinguish it from later periods, such as the Proterozoic. The Archean eon, lasting from around 4,000 to 2,500 million years ago, is marked by specific geological and tectonic conditions that differ from those in the later Proterozoic. Some of these characteristics include: 1. The formation of the first stable continental crust: During the Archean eon, the Earth's crust started to differentiate into continental and oceanic plates. This period saw the formation of the first stable continental crust, composed of felsic rocks such as granite and tonalite. This contrasts with the Proterozoic, which experienced rapid continental growth. 2. Reduced tectonic activity: Archean continental behavior is marked by less intense tectonic activity compared to the Proterozoic. The plate tectonics during the Archean eon were likely slower and less dynamic than those in the Proterozoic era, which featured more rapid continental accretion and the assembly and breakup of supercontinents like Rodinia and Pannotia. 3. Smaller protocontinents and proto-plates: During the Archean eon, smaller protocontinents or microplates formed from the crystallization of lighter materials from Earth’s magma oceans. These protocontinents eventually merged to form larger continental masses, setting the stage for the more extensive continents and tectonic interactions observed in the Proterozoic and the following Phanerozoic eons. 4. Greenstone belts: Another unique feature of Archean continental behavior is the presence of greenstone belts, which are sequences of volcanic and sedimentary rocks that are mainly found in Archean terrains. These formations result from volcanic activity in ancient oceanic crusts and sedimentation events. Greenstone belts are typically surrounded by granitoid rocks, indicating the interaction between the early continental crust and the oceanic crust, which is distinct from the shallower epicontinental seas in the Proterozoic. Therefore, while no singular type of continental behavior is exclusively unique to the Archean period, a combination of factors, such as the formation of the first stable continental crust, slower tectonic activities, smaller protocontinents, and the presence of greenstone belts, distinguish it from the Proterozoic and later geologic periods."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: Given a sentence in English language, translate the sentence to Somali language keeping the meaning of the original sentence intact Q: English sentence: 17 He shall also set his face to enter with the strength of his whole kingdom, and upright ones with him; thus shall he do: and he shall give him the daughter of women, corrupting her: but she shall not stand on his side, neither be for him.

Options: - orchestra - school band - music store - opera house - home reasoning:","response":"The best option to get a bass clarinet to take home would be a music store. Reasoning: - Orchestra: An orchestra is a group of musicians who perform together. While a bass clarinet might be used in an orchestra, it is generally not a place where you can acquire an instrument to take home, as the instruments used are property of the musicians or the orchestra. - School band: A school band is a group of students who play music together for school events and competitions. While bass clarinets might be present in a school band, these instruments would typically be used by the band members and owned by the school itself. They are unlikely to be available for individuals to take home unless the school loans the instrument to one of their students who is a band member. - Music store: This is the most appropriate option. A music store sells a variety of musical instruments, including bass clarinets. They offer new and sometimes used instruments for purchase or rent. Purchasing or renting a bass clarinet from a music store allows you to take the instrument home and use it as needed. - Opera house: An opera house is a venue where operas, ballets, and other performances are held. Bass clarinets may be used in some of these performances, but like an orchestra, the instruments are property of the musicians or the opera house and are not available for taking home. - Home: It's unlikely that you would find a bass clarinet lying around at home unless you already own one or know someone who does. Even so, it wouldn't be a regular source for acquiring a bass clarinet. In conclusion, the best option for getting a bass clarinet to take home is a music store, where you can find a wide selection of instruments for purchase or rent based on your preferences and budget."},{"question":"Given the question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What was The Hurricane's sentence at the time of conviction?

In which country is 'A Midsummer Night's Dream' set?","response":"'A Midsummer Night's Dream' is set in Athens, Greece, and its surrounding woods, which includes the enchanted forest where most of the play's action takes place. As one of William Shakespeare's most popular and widely performed comedies, the play is a complex and entertaining exploration of love, desire, and the wondrous whims of the natural world. Its setting in ancient Greece reflects the rich history and deeply rooted traditions of the classical world while allowing Shakespeare to create a magical, mythical atmosphere replete with fairies, gods, and fantastical creatures. The use of Athens and the nearby forest as the primary setting for 'A Midsummer Night's Dream' provides the ideal backdrop for the thematic interplay between reason and imagination, order and chaos. It allows for the juxtaposition between the world of Athenian nobility and the inhabitants of the forest, particularly the fairies under the rule of Oberon and Titania. Athens, the capital city of ancient Greece, has always been associated with knowledge, wisdom, and civilization, serving as the center of Greek culture, philosophy, and the arts. In the play, the Duke of Athens, Theseus, and his fiancée, the Amazon Queen Hippolyta, are preparing for their upcoming nuptials, while the young lovers Hermia, Lysander, Demetrius, and Helena navigate their complex romantic entanglements. The rigid social hierarchy and strict rules governing courtship and marriage in Athens provide the impetus for a series of comic misunderstandings and plot twists that drive the action in the enchanted forest. Within the sheltering forest, the supernatural aspects of the play come to the fore. The forest is depicted as a mysterious, magical space, separate from the ordered, regulated world of Athens. Governed by the unpredictable whims of Oberon, king of the fairies, and his queen, Titania, it serves as the site of their quarrels and their meddling in the love lives of the mortals who have ventured into their domain. This enchanted landscape is home to the mischievous Puck, the fairy character responsible for many of the play's confusions and comic developments, as well as various other fairy creatures who populate the forest. In 'A Midsummer Night's Dream,' Shakespeare effectively uses the contrasting settings of Athens and the enchanted forest to explore themes such as love, illusion, the supernatural, and the transformative power of nature. The choice of ancient Greece, with its rich cultural and mythological heritage, serves as the perfect backdrop for this captivating, humorous, and thought-provoking play."},{"question":"Can you tell me the answer to when does the next season of bobs burgers start??","response":"Sure, little buddy!

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose a person eats more happens, how will it affect less glucagon in liver. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","response":"When a person eats more than they need, the likelihood of having less glucagon in the liver might be indirectly impacted due to the overall balance of hormones and nutrients in the body. Here's an explanation of the possible effects: 1. Excess Food Intake: When a person consumes excessive amounts of food, especially high-carbohydrate and high-sugar meals, the body experiences an increase in blood sugar levels. 2. Insulin Release: As blood sugar levels rise, the pancreas produces more insulin to help cells absorb the extra glucose in the bloodstream. 3. Decreased Glucagon Levels: Glucagon and insulin have an inverse relationship. Higher levels of insulin can lead to reduced glucagon production and release. Therefore, as insulin production increases in response to excessive food intake, glucagon levels might decrease. 4. Decreased Glucagon-to-Glucose Conversion: With reduced glucagon being released from the pancreas, the liver might have a lower amount of glucagon available to convert into glucose. This could potentially reduce the liver's ability to raise blood sugar levels quickly during times of low blood sugar. 5. Possible Indirect Effect on Blood Sugar Regulation: The perturbation in glucagon levels due to excessive eating can indirectly affect the blood sugar regulation process. When glucagon levels are lower, the body may not be able to release glucose into the bloodstream as efficiently during times of need. This could lead to imbalances in blood sugar levels and the overall blood sugar regulation process. To summarize, eating more than necessary may indirectly impact the amount of glucagon in the liver and the body's blood sugar regulatory process. Consuming excessive amounts of food can cause a rise in insulin levels, which can lead to a decrease in glucagon production. This in turn may affect the liver's ability to release glucose in response to low blood sugar situations, potentially leading to imbalances in blood sugar levels."},{"question":"To Kill a Mockingbird As children coming of age, Scout and Jem face hard realities and learn from them.

Some touchdown runs are remembered for their impressive distance, while others gain notoriety for their improbable nature. In this article, we will delve into the history of the National Football League (NFL) to answer a question that has surely crossed the minds of many football fans: How many yards longer was the longest touchdown run than the shortest? Step 1: Identifying the longest touchdown run in NFL history The longest touchdown run in NFL history took place on November 15, 1983. Tony Dorsett, a running back for the Dallas Cowboys, made this impressive play against the Minnesota Vikings. Dorsett managed to dash an incredible 99 yards, covering the entire length of the field from scrimmage line to the end zone. This feat remains unmatched, putting Dorsett’s 99-yard run at the pinnacle of NFL history. Step 2: Identifying the shortest touchdown run in NFL history On the opposite end of the spectrum, we have the shortest touchdown runs. As the end zone begins at the 1-yard line, any plays starting from this point can result in a 1-yard touchdown run. Multiple occurrences of 1-yard touchdown runs have been recorded throughout NFL history, with various running backs and quarterbacks achieving the feat. These short runs may not cover much ground, but they are still exciting, hard-fought plays that contribute to the overall score. Step 3: Finding the difference between the longest and shortest touchdown runs Having identified the longest and shortest touchdown runs in NFL history, calculating the difference in yardage is now quite straightforward. With Tony Dorsett's record-setting run covering 99 yards and the shortest touchdown runs registering at 1 yard, we simply subtract the shortest yardage from the longest: 99 yards (longest) - 1 yard (shortest) = 98 yards Conclusion: The difference in yardage between the longest and shortest touchdown runs in NFL history is a staggering 98 yards. The exceptional skill, agility, and determination required for Tony Dorsett's 99-yard run will long be remembered, just as the grit and power needed for shorter 1-yard touchdowns contribute to the rich tapestry of NFL history. No matter the distance, both types of touchdown runs showcase the amazing athletic abilities of professional football players, who continue to captivate fans across the nation and around the world."},{"question":"Q:Information: - Berkshire (or , abbreviated Berks) is a county in south east England, west of London. It was recognised as the Royal County of Berkshire because of the presence of Windsor Castle by the Queen in 1957 and letters patent issued in 1974. Berkshire is a county of historic origin and is a home county, a ceremonial county and a non-metropolitan county without a county council. Berkshire County Council was the main county governance from 1889 to 1998 except for the separately administered County Borough of Reading. - Gentry (from Old French \\"genterie\\", from \\"gentil\\", \\"high-born, noble\\") are \\"well-born, genteel and well-bred people\\" of high social class, especially in the past. \\"Gentry\\", in its widest connotation, refers to people of good social position connected to landed estates (see manorialism), upper levels of the clergy, and \\"gentle\\" families of long descent who never obtained the official right to bear a coat of arms. - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight. - The River Thames is a river that flows through southern England. At , it is the longest river entirely in England and the second longest in the United Kingdom, after the River Severn. It also flows through Oxford (where it is called Isis), Reading, Henley-on-Thames and Windsor. The lower reaches of the river are called the Tideway, derived from its long tidal reach up to Teddington Lock. It rises at Thames Head in Gloucestershire, and flows into the North Sea via the Thames Estuary. The Thames drains the whole of Greater London. - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly. - Maidenhead is a large town and unparished area in the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead, in Berkshire, England. It lies south of the River Thames, but at Maidenhead, the river runs north-south and so the town is in fact on its west bank. The town has a population in 2011 of 67,404. Its urban area (including the adjoining suburban villages of Bray, Holyport, Pinkneys Green, Taplow (Buckinghamshire) Cox Green, White Waltham and Woodlands Park) has a population of just under 90,000. The mainline railway station was set to be the terminus of the Crossrail line until the announcement was made that Reading was to be the new terminus. - A great hall is the main room of a royal palace, nobleman's castle or a large manor house or hall house in the Middle Ages, and continued to be built in the country houses of the 16th and early 17th centuries, although by then the family used the great chamber for eating and relaxing. At that time the word \\"great\\" simply meant big, and had not acquired its modern connotations of excellence. In the medieval period the room would simply have been referred to as the \\"hall\\", unless the building also had a secondary hall, but the term \\"great hall\\" has been predominant for surviving rooms of this type for several centuries, to distinguish them from the different type of hall found in post-medieval houses. Great halls were found especially in France, England and Scotland, but similar rooms were also found in some other European countries. - Letters patent (always in the plural) are a type of legal instrument in the form of a published written order issued by a monarch, president, or other head of state, generally granting an office, right, monopoly, title, or status to a person or corporation. Letters patent can be used for the creation of corporations or government offices, or for the granting of city status or a coat of arms. Letters patent are issued for the appointment of representatives of the Crown, such as governors and governors-general of Commonwealth realms, as well as appointing a Royal Commission. In the United Kingdom they are also issued for the creation of peers of the realm. A particular form of letters patent has evolved into the modern patent (referred to as a utility patent or design patent in United States patent law) granting exclusive rights in an invention (or a design in the case of a design patent). In this case it is essential that the written grant should be in the form of a public document so other inventors can consult it to avoid infringement and also to understand how to \\"practice\\" the invention, i.e., put it into practical use. - The manorial courts were the lowest courts of law in England during the feudal period. They had a civil jurisdiction limited both in subject matter and geography. They dealt with matters over which the lord of the manor had jurisdiction, primarily torts, local contracts and land tenure, and their powers only extended to those who lived within the lands of the manor: the demesne and such lands as the lord had enfeoffed to others, and to those who held land therein. Historians have divided manorial courts into those that were primarily seignorial based on feudal responsibilities and those based on separate delegation of authority from the monarch. There were three types of manorial court: the court of the honour; the court baron; and the court customary, also known as the halmote court. - In England, an unparished area is an area that is not covered by a civil parish (a small administrative division of local government, not to be confused with an ecclesiastical parish). Most urbanised districts of England are either entirely or partly unparished. Many towns and some cities in otherwise rural districts are also unparished areas and therefore no longer have a town council or city council. Some cities and towns which are unparished areas in larger districts (i.e. not districts of themselves) have charter trustees to maintain a historic charter, such as city status (an example being in Bath) or simply the mayoralty of a town. - In England, a civil parish is a territorial designation which is the lowest tier of local government below districts and counties, or their combined form, the unitary authority. It is an administrative parish, in contrast to an ecclesiastical parish. - Holyport (pronounced \\"Hollyport\\") is a village in the civil parish of Bray (where at the 2011 Census the population was included), about 2 miles south of Maidenhead in the English county of Berkshire. - Ockwells Manor is a timber - framed 15th century manor house in the civil parish of Cox Green , adjoining Maidenhead , in the English county of Berkshire .

The central section and a large portion of the line, between in central London and in the south-east, are due to open in December 2018; at that time the service will be named the Elizabeth line. The western section beyond Paddington, to in Berkshire and Heathrow Airport, is due to enter operation in December 2019, completing the new east-west route across Greater London. Part of the eastern section, between and in Essex, was transferred to a precursor service called TfL Rail in 2015; this section will be connected to the central route through central London to Paddington in May 2019. - Taplow is a village and civil parish in the South Bucks district of Buckinghamshire, England. It sits on the left bank of the River Thames, facing Maidenhead in the neighbouring county of Berkshire, and is roughly west of Burnham and west of Charing Cross in London. - A manor house was historically the main residence of the lord of the manor. The house formed the administrative centre of a manor in the European feudal system; within its great hall were held the lord's manorial courts, communal meals with manorial tenants and great banquets. The term is today loosely applied to various country houses, frequently dating from the late medieval era, which formerly housed the gentry. - Windsor Castle is a royal residence at Windsor in the English county of Berkshire. It is notable for its long association with the English and later British royal family and for its architecture. The original castle was built in the 11th century after the Norman invasion of England by William the Conqueror. Since the time of Henry I, it has been used by the reigning monarch and is the longest-occupied palace in Europe. The castle's lavish early 19th-century State Apartments were described by the art historian Hugh Roberts as \\"a superb and unrivalled sequence of rooms widely regarded as the finest and most complete expression of later Georgian taste\\". Inside the castle walls is the 15th-century St George's Chapel, considered by the historian John Martin Robinson to be \\"one of the supreme achievements of English Perpendicular Gothic\\" design. - Buckinghamshire (or ), abbreviated Bucks, is a county in South East England which borders Greater London to the south east, Berkshire to the south, Oxfordshire to the west, Northamptonshire to the north, Bedfordshire to the north east and Hertfordshire to the east. - A parish is a church territorial unit constituting a division within a diocese. A parish is under the pastoral care and clerical jurisdiction of a parish priest, who might be assisted by one or more curates, and who operates from a parish church. Historically, a parish often covered the same geographical area as a manor (its association with the parish church remaining paramount). - A non-metropolitan county, or colloquially, shire county, is a county-level entity in England that is not a metropolitan county. The counties typically have populations of 300,000 to 1.4 million. The term \\"shire county\\" is, however, an unofficial usage. Many of the non-metropolitan counties bear historic names and most end in the suffix \\"-shire\\" such as Wiltshire or Staffordshire. Of the remainder, some counties had the -shire ending and have lost it over time; such as Devon and Somerset. \\"Shire county\\" is, strictly, a dual-language tautology since the French-derived \\"county\\" means the same as the older Anglo-Saxon word \\"shire\\". - Pinkneys Green is a village within the north-western bounds of the town of Maidenhead in the English county of Berkshire.

On 10 March 1914, the suffragette Mary Richardson walked into the National Gallery and attacked Velázquez's canvas with a meat cleaver. Her action was ostensibly provoked by the arrest of fellow suffragette Emmeline Pankhurst the previous day, although there had been earlier warnings of a planned suffragette attack on the collection. Richardson left seven slashes on the painting, particularly causing damage to the area between the figure's shoulders. However, all were successfully repaired by the National Gallery's chief restorer Helmut Ruhemann.Richardson was sentenced to six months' imprisonment, the maximum allowed for destruction of an artwork. In a statement to the Women's Social and Political Union shortly afterwards, Richardson explained, \\"I have tried to destroy the picture of the most beautiful woman in mythological history as a protest against the Government for destroying Mrs. Pankhurst, who is the most beautiful character in modern history.\\" She added in a 1952 interview that she didn't like \\"the way men visitors gaped at it all day long\\".The feminist writer Lynda Nead observed, \\"The incident has come to symbolize a particular perception of feminist attitudes towards the female nude; in a sense, it has come to represent a specific stereotypical image of feminism more generally.\\" Contemporary reports of the incident reveal that the picture was not widely seen as mere artwork. Journalists tended to assess the attack in terms of a murder (Richardson was nicknamed \\"Slasher Mary\\"), and used words that conjured wounds inflicted on an actual female body, rather than on a pictorial representation of a female body.

When I read the plot outline - an award winning playwright (Michael Caine) decides to murder one of his former pupils (Christopher Reeve) and steel his script for his own success - I was excited. I like thrillers, Michael Caine's a good actor, Sidney Lumet's a good director and Ira Levin's work is generally good. I won't spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it yet, but all I'd say is there are LOADS of twists and turns. So many its kind of hard to explain the film's plot line in detail, without giving it away.

Write an article based on these highlights.","response":"Title: Understanding BP's Decision to Pause Dividends for the Year Hey kids, have you ever saved up your candy or your favorite toys? Just like you, big companies also save up something called \\"dividends\\". Dividends are like pieces of the pie of a company's profits that they share with people who own bits of the company, known as 'investors'. A company named BP, which drills for oil like a giant straw sucking up juice from an orange, has decided to not give out these pieces of the pie for the rest of the year. Instead, they are putting this share of the pie in a special savings box, kind of like a piggy bank, called an 'escrow fund'. Why are they doing this? Well, little one, they had an accident. Imagine you tipped over a jar of your mom's best jam and it got all over the floor. Even after you clean up, there could still be sticky spots everywhere and maybe even a stain on the rug. Plus, you have to replace the jam. This accident is like BP's 'oil leak'. A smart lady, Dorothy Brown, told us that it's really hard to know how much BP will need to clean up their mess. It's like trying to guess how many sticky spots there are and how much it will cost to get a new rug and jam. One more thing Dorothy Brown mentioned, most of the pie pieces (or dividends) usually go to people who have a lot of toys (high income). Isn't it a bit unfair? It's like if you always shared your candy with the kid who already has a lot. Lastly, remember playing a tricky game where sometimes you lose? That's called 'assuming risk'. People who gave their money to BP knew that oil drilling is a tricky game and sometimes accidents happen. Just like sometimes you can win a game, and sometimes you might lose. So, that's why BP decided to stop giving out pieces of pie for a while. They still need to clean their sticky mess and everybody who played the game with them knew that such accidents might happen. There you have it kiddo, sometimes adult things aren't so different from what you do and understand every day. Remember, whether it's toys, candy, or oil, it's always crucial to clean up after our messes."},{"question":"Premise: \\"This is a child sitting on a merry-go-round.\\" Based on this premise, can we conclude that the hypothesis \\"Thje child is ready to rride the merry-go-round.\\" is true?

He was the Ambassador to 1975, but back home in 1898, in New Jerusalem, Utah, they all thought he was Ambassador to France. When he disappeared, Mama and I came back through the triple-bolted door that led from our apt in 1975 to our horsebarn in 1898. We returned to the dusty streets of New Jerusalem, and I had to keep on reminding myself that I was supposed to have been in France, and 'polly-voo' for my chums, and tell whoppers about the Eiffel Tower and the fancy bread and the snails and frogs we'd eaten. I was born in New Jerusalem, and raised there till I was ten. Then, one summer's day, my Pa sat me on his knee and told me we'd be going away for a while, that he had a new job. 'But what about the store?' I said, scandalised. My Pa's wonderful store, the only General Store in town not run by the Saints, was my second home. I'd spent my whole life crawling and then walking on the dusty wooden floors, checking stock and unpacking crates with waybills from exotic places like Salt Lake City and even San Francisco. Pa looked uncomfortable. 'Mr Johnstone is buying it.' My mouth dropped. James H Johnstone was as dandified a city-slicker as you'd ever hope to meet. He'd blown into town on the weekly Zephyr Speedball, and skinny Tommy Benson had hauled his three huge steamer trunks to the cowboy hotel. He'd tipped Tommy two dollars, in Wells-Fargo notes, and later, in the empty lot behind the smithy, all the kids in New Jerusalem had gathered 'round Tommy to goggle at the small fortune in queer, never-seen bills. 'Pa, no!' I said, without thinking. I knew that if my chums ordered their fathers around like that, they'd get a whipping, but my Pa almost never whipped me. What is probably true about father? - not enough information - he is very angry - He is very kind - he is very funny","response":"Based on the information provided, it is most likely true that the father is very kind.

There is some evidence that myopia is inherited. If one or both of your parents need glasses, there is an increased chance that you will too. Individuals who spend a lot of time reading, working or playing at a computer, or doing other close visual work may also be more likely to develop nearsightedness. Because the eye continues to grow during childhood, myopia typically progresses until about age 20. However, nearsightedness may also develop in adults due to visual stress or health conditions such as diabetes. A common sign of nearsightedness is difficulty seeing distant objects like a movie screen or the TV, or the whiteboard or chalkboard in school. Now, I have a new situation: Michael and his brother Brandon grew up in the same house together. They however devoloped completely different hobbies. Michael liked to go outside and play sports.

Forensic anthropologists are also instrumental to the investigation and documentation of genocide and mass graves. Along with forensic pathologists, forensic dentists, and homicide investigators, forensic anthropologists commonly testify in court as expert witnesses. Using physical markers present on a skeleton, a forensic anthropologist can potentially determine a victim's age, sex, stature, and ancestry. In addition to identifying physical characteristics of the individual, forensic anthropologists can use skeletal abnormalities to potentially determine cause of death, past trauma such as broken bones or medical procedures, as well as diseases such as bone cancer. - The American Academy of Forensic Sciences (AAFS) is a society for forensics professionals, founded in 1948.

The answer is:","response":"The formation of ice crystals within the cloud. Step-by-step reasoning: 1. The formation of ice crystals within the cloud: This is the missing first step. When the temperature inside a cloud decreases and reaches the freezing point, it leads to the formation of ice crystals. This is important for the next steps in the process. 2. Ice inside the cloud bumping around and causing electrostatic charges: As the ice particles within the cloud collide with one another, they generate electrostatic charges. This sets the stage for the later steps involving the build-up of positive and negative charges. 3. The cloud becomes a thundercloud: The presence of these electrostatic charges within the cloud transforms it into a thundercloud. This is important because it signifies that the buildup of charges has reached a point where lightning may occur. 4. Electrostatic energy builds and forms a strong negative charge: The continued collisions of ice particles and the separation of charges within the cloud create a strong negative charge at the base of the thundercloud. 5. Positive energy is attracted to the negative energy in the cloud: As the negative charge at the base of the cloud increases, it attracts and pulls positive charges, typically found on the ground below the cloud. This sets up the conditions for a lightning strike. 6. The positive energy gathers on the ground: The positive charges accumulate on the ground or other objects below the cloud in response to the negative charge in the cloud. 7.

Translate to English","response":"Like many pieces of information, they are like washing machine instructions. The translation above reflects the given statement in English. The original statement in Finnish highlights the idea that many pieces of information or instructions in life can be likened to washing machine instructions. This comparison likely aims to convey that, similar to how washing machine instructions provide guidance for using the appliance correctly and efficiently, other pieces of information serve similar purposes. Various instructions, guidelines and pieces of information that we come across daily in life can provide clarity and understanding in different situations. Just as washing machine instructions ensure the correct use of the appliance and avoid potential mishaps, other sets of instructions can help guide us in managing situations or tasks effectively. For example, instructional guides or manuals often accompany devices we purchase, such as smartphones, computers, kitchen appliances, or vehicles. These guides contain essential information on the proper use, maintenance, and troubleshooting of the device. When we follow the instructions carefully, we can prolong the device's lifespan and ensure optimum performance. Similarly, guidelines for various professions, activities, or processes ensure that tasks are accomplished systematically and safely. In medical and healthcare settings, strict protocols guide professionals through diagnosis, treatment, and patient care processes to guarantee the optimal recovery and well-being of individuals. In educational institutions, standardized curriculums and teaching methodologies are employed to help students develop their potential and obtain the necessary knowledge and skills for success in their future endeavors. Moreover, informational texts, articles, or studies can expand our understanding of different subjects, cultures, or phenomena. By exploring these sources, we can improve our ability to make informed decisions and establish a more well-rounded perspective on various issues. In conclusion, many of the instructions and pieces of information we encounter daily, much like washing machine instructions, serve to make our lives more manageable, efficient, and successful. They provide us with the knowledge and guidance needed to navigate various situations, use devices effectively, and grow both personally and professionally."},{"question":"Write a negative movie review.","response":"Title: A Cinematic Catastrophe - \\"Chaos Unraveled\\" To classify \\"Chaos Unraveled\\" as a disappointment would be a generous understatement. Instead, this film is nothing short of a cinematic catastrophe. Directed by the haphazard Mark Stephens, \\"Chaos Unraveled\\" seeks to convey the tale of an enigmatic stranger who holds the key to saving the world; however, it falls flat on multiple levels. From its hackneyed plot to its cringeworthy acting, this movie has very little to offer even to the most dedicated cinephiles. The first and foremost critical aspect to address is the film's plot, which is convoluted, clichéd, and predictable. Lacking any semblance of a fresh or innovative idea, \\"Chaos Unraveled\\" relies heavily on previously established formulas, rehashing them to the point of annoyance. The promised suspense turns into sheer boredom as the story drags on with no promise of resolution. Additionally, the film's pacing is abysmal, with a multitude of subplots that don't contribute effectively to the overarching narrative and add more frustration rather than excitement. The ending, which should be the climax of the entire film, further compounds this frustration by leaving an abundance of loose ends and a glaring lack of resolution. Alongside the disastrous storyline, the performances of the actors merely serve to cement this movie's place amongst the worst of cinema. Despite boasting a cast with potential, the horrendous dialogues and misguided direction by Stephens ensured that each character became a caricature rather than a well-developed individual. The delivery of their lines often feels fiercely disingenuous, making it impossible for viewers to be invested in the protagonists' plights. It is even sadder when the few competent performances get lost in this chaotic mess, buried beneath its shallow characterization and lack of the necessary depth. Furthermore, the cinematography and visual effects are amateurishly executed, detracting greatly from the overall experience. One cannot help but wonder how the budget was allocated, as it certainly isn't reflected in the quality of the visuals. The low budget look of the film may have been forgivable if the content itself were compelling; alas, no such luck here. As if this weren't enough, the original score by novice composer Tom Dawson does little to enhance the film. Rather than accentuate the emotions or actions of the characters, the music remains inconsequential and largely forgettable, rarely matching the on-screen intensity. In conclusion, \\"Chaos Unraveled\\" is a monumental disappointment, lacking any substance or entertainment value. Its significant shortcomings in plot development, character portrayal, visual effects, and music all contribute to a dismal viewing experience. Rather than spending your precious time and money on this film, it would be wise to explore the multitude of alternative cinematic experiences that the world has to offer.

He plans to steal 2 million from the money-counting room of a racetrack during a featured race. He assembles a team consisting of a corrupt cop (Ted de Corsia), a betting window teller (Elisha Cook Jr.) to gain access to the backroom, a sharpshooter (Timothy Carey) to shoot the favorite horse during the race to distract the crowd, a wrestler (Kola Kwariani) to provide another distraction by provoking a fight at the track bar, and a track bartender (Joe Sawyer). George Peatty, the teller, tells his wife Sherry (Marie Windsor) about the impending robbery. Sherry is bitter at George for not delivering on the promises of wealth he once made her, so George hopes telling her about the robbery will placate and impress her. Sherry does not believe him at first but, after learning that the robbery is real, enlists her lover Val Cannon (Vince Edwards) to steal the money from George and his associates. The heist is successful, although the sharpshooter is shot and killed by the police. The conspirators gather at the apartment where they are to meet Johnny and divide the money. Before Johnny arrives, Val appears and holds them up. A shootout ensues and a badly wounded George is the sole survivor. He goes home and shoots Sherry before dying.

The Victory Tour of 1984 headlined the Jacksons and showcased Jackson's new solo material to more than two million Americans. It was the last tour he did with his brothers. Following controversy over the concert's ticket sales, Jackson donated his share of the proceeds, an estimated 3 to 5 million, to charity. His charitable work continued with the release of \\"We Are the World\\" (1985), co-written with Lionel Richie, which raised money for the poor in the US and Africa. It earned 63 million, and became one of the best-selling singles of all time, with 20 million copies sold. It won four Grammys for 1985, including Song of the Year for Jackson and Richie as its writers. The project's creators received two special American Music Awards honors: one for the creation of the song and another for the USA for Africa idea. Jackson, Jones, and promoter Ken Kragan received special awards for their roles in the song's creation.Jackson collaborated with Paul McCartney in the early 1980s, and learned that McCartney was making 40 million a year from owning the rights to other artists' songs.

Arab history in the United States goes back to the late 1800's when large numbers of Arab immigrants first began making their journey to a land known simply as\\"Amreeka\\". Historians generally describe Arab immigration to America in two waves.The first wave took place between 1860 and 1924.The first wave consisted of Lebanese and Syrian,and some Egyptian immigrants.These new immigrants,who were mostly Christian,came to America in search of better opportunities.Even the doomed Titanic,which set sail for America in 1912,had close to a hundred Arab passengers aboard.The majority of Arab-Americans today are descendents of the first wave of immigrants;they are the third or more generation Americans. The second wave of immigrants followed after World War II,caused by political unrest in the Middle East.This second wave of immigrants consists of mainly Arab Muslims and continues to this day. Arab-Americans make up 3 million of the population in the United States,according to demographers.And quite different from popular belief,64 percent of them are American-born.Eighty-two percent of Arab-Americans are US citizens. Arab-Americans are beyond the national average in both education and income.Education is important among Arab-Americans;82 percent have high school diplomas,36 percent have bachelor's degrees or higher,and 15 percent have graduate degrees.The-median average income among Arab-Americans is 39 580,which is higher than the US average.

No, you should not panic. Here’s why. It’s another poll freakout day, apparently: The new New York Times/CBS poll finds that Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are now tied among registered voters nationally, at 40-40, with the email story taking an obvious toll on Clinton’s numbers. The key findings: Mrs. Clinton’s six-percentage-point lead over the presumptive Republican nominee, Donald J. Trump, in a CBS News poll last month has evaporated. The two candidates are now tied in a general election matchup, the new poll indicates, with each receiving the support of 40 percent of voters…. Just 28 percent of voters said they had a positive view of Mrs. Clinton, compared with 33 percent last month. Asked if her email practices were illegal, 46 percent of voters said yes, compared with 23 percent who said using a private server was improper but not illegal. Twenty-four percent said she did nothing wrong. Those are awful numbers. But as even some conservatives (who oppose Trump) quickly pointed out on twitter, the real story here is that even if Clinton is sinking, Trump is not rising. As John Podhoretz noted, the Times poll confirms that “Hillary is deflating,” but “Trump isn’t gaining.” Or as conservative Iowa radio host Steve Deace put it, Clinton is dropping because of the FBI findings, but Trump’s numbers are “still dreadful as always.” As polling analyst Will Jordan noted, until Trump breaks out of the high 30s and (extremely) low 40s, there’s no clear grounds for Dems to panic. I’ve drawn up a chart to make the point, using Huffpollster’s national polling averages: Beyond the fact that Clinton still holds a lead after getting hit by sustained awful coverage, note that Trump has not hit 43 percent since last winter, and has not hit 42 percent since the spring. He remains at around 40 percent right now. Meanwhile, Clinton has fluctuated, hitting highs of 48 percent and 47 percent several times. She’s sliding now, but as Deace noted, that may reflect current negative information about her now bombarding voters. It could reverse again, just as it has in the past. This basic difference isn’t just evident in the national polls. Mark Murray and the First Read Crew took a hard look at the multiple state polls released yesterday (which also prompted a freak-out), and concluded that while Trump is closing the gap, there is also this crucial point: These polls — which mostly show Clinton either ahead or tied in these battlegrounds — were all taken during or after Clinton’s roughest week of the general election, with FBI Director James Comey’s rebuke over her emails. So you could view these battleground numbers as a floor for Clinton, while Trump is still unable to break 40% in many of these states. This core dynamic is central to how Democrats view this race. They have undertaken a concerted effort to drive up Trump’s negatives with the explicit goal of preventing him from expanding his appeal. That’s why the pro-Clinton Super PAC, Priorities USA, has been pumping many millions of dollars of ads into the battleground states, ads that use Trump’s own words and antics to sow deep doubts about his temperament and fitness to be president. The goal is to prevent Trump, whose campaign is all about winning blue collar whites in the industrial Midwest, from making inroads among college educated whites, which would limit the potential of Trump’s strategy of courting white backlash. (This may also drive up turnout and Clinton’s vote share among nonwhite voters, which would make the white-backlash strategy even tougher to pull off.) Polls suggest Trump may end up being the first GOP nominee in decades to lose among college educated whites — see Ron Brownstein’s terrific analysis on this point — and Democrats are targeting suburban and Republican women in particular to try to make this happen. Speaking at the site of Abraham Lincoln's \\"House Divided\\" speech, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton urged Americans to try to see through the eyes of police officers, African-Americans and Latinos, and Donald Trump supporters. Here is her full speech. (Reuters) As Paul Begala, a senior adviser to Priorities USA, put it to me in an interview: “Trump wants to build a wall. I want to build a ceiling.” Now, it is of course very possible that Trump will begin to rise, or that Clinton will continue falling. Things could change once Team Trump starts spending big on ads and Team Clinton’s ad barrage no longer goes unanswered. But the point is that, even if it is true that Clinton is sliding, there is still no evidence that Trump can expand his appeal in the manner he needs to. And that’s why senior Democratic pollsters are not terribly alarmed and believe we can’t really have a clear sense of where this race is going until the conventions have passed. We will learn whether Trump really can consolidate moderate Republicans who may be struggling to come to terms with him, and grow. Meanwhile, the efforts to keep that ceiling firmly affixed in place are continuing today, with a new Clinton ad campaign. But that brings us to our next item. * NEW HILLARY AD RIPS TRUMP WITH HIS OWN WORDS: Hillary Clinton is out with a tough new ad showing puzzled little children watching footage of Trump boasting about violence at his own rallies, cursing, and mocking a disabled reporter. It then shows Clinton saying that our children will look back on the choices we make now: “We need to make sure that they can be proud of us.” The ad, which will run in eight battleground states, is a reminder that Dems believe the most lethal weapon against Trump is his own words. This one looks aimed at suburban and Republican women, a key swing constituency. * LIST OF GUEST SPEAKERS SUGGESTS THRILLING GOP CONVENTION: Jeremy Peters obtains a list of speakers set to appear at the GOP convention. Among them: Former football star Tim Tebow, Rudy Giuliani, Newt Gingrich, Senator Tom Cotton, Rep. Marsha Blackburn, Scott Walker, a whole bunch of Trumps, and last but decidedly not least, Senator Joni Ernst. Special bonus preview that will have millions of Americans grinding their teeth with anticipation and excitement: The convention will feature presentations on Benghazi and, as the Times puts it, “former President Bill Clinton’s sexual misconduct.” * MANY GOP SENATORS SKIPPING CONVENTION: The Associated Press rounds up all the GOP Senators who are skipping the festivities in Cleveland, and comments: The level of rank-and-file congressional defections from this year’s Republican convention is unusually high. Perhaps that’s unsurprising, given the GOP establishment’s well-documented discomfort with the man who stands on the cusp of becoming their presidential standard-bearer. But in the halls of the Capitol this week, some senators seemed to visibly squirm when asked about their convention plans. This suggests that the GOP convention could have less success in consolidating GOP voters than the Democratic convention will at unifying Dem voters. * QUOTE OF THE DAY, GOP-CONVENTION-AS-HOSTAGE-CRISIS EDITION: Speaking of Republicans skipping the convention, here’s GOP strategist Rick Wilson: “Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, Michelle Obama, Elizabeth Warren — they’re all going to be out there swinging for the fences. But the Republicans, it’ll be like a hostage video of people forced on stage.” That contrast really could end up influencing voter perceptions of the two candidates, too. * GOP GEARS UP TO ATTACK CLINTON VEEP PICK: NBC News’s Alex Seitz-Wald gets an early look at how Republicans plan to attack Clinton’s running mate. Here’s the short version: Tim Kaine (career politician and lightweight); Labor Secretary Tom Perez (supports progressive labor policies that would be “bad for business”; Sherrod Brown (raging liberal and extreme partisan). And, of course, the attack line on Elizabeth Warren: She’s a raging liberal and supposedly lied about her Native American heritage. Because that worked so well when she ran for the Senate in the first place. * AMERICANS HATE CLINTON AND TRUMP: A new Associated Press poll finds: Eighty-one percent of Americans say they would feel afraid following the election of one of the two polarizing politicians….Fifty-seven percent have an unfavorable view of Clinton, compared to 37 percent who have a favorable view. Sixty-three percent have a negative view of Trump, compared to the 31 percent who think well of him. This should be an enjoyable four months. * POLL FACTOID OF THE DAY, TRUMP-IS-A-UNITER EDITION: Mark Murray flags this amazing finding: That’s the percentage of African-American voters who picked Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton in the battleground states of Ohio and Pennsylvania, according to the latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist polls. That awesome white backlash strategy is working! Summary:","response":"A new New York Times/CBS poll shows that Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are now tied among registered voters nationally, both with 40% each. However, pundits are arguing that although Clinton is sinking in the polls, Trump is not rising either, so there's no reason for Democrats to panic.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which brother studied more nonliving components of the habitat? Hint: Ecology is the study of ecosystems. An ecosystem consists of all the living and nonliving components of the habitat. Whereas nutrients and certain elements are recycled through ecosystems, energy moves in just one direction. Many interactions among species within an ecosystem are centered around the flow of energy. The formation of ecosystems, from new land to current habitats, is usually based on the pioneer species, and these species are able to live in an area due to the nonliving factors, such as the climate, the soil and the amount of rainfall, of that area. The populations within an ecosystem also determine the stability of the system. Recent tremendous increases in the human population have raised many important ecological issues.

Answer the above question based on the context below: In 1692, the Neapolitan painter Luca Giordano became one of the few allowed to view paintings held in Philip IV's private apartments, and was greatly impressed by Las Meninas. Giordano described the work as the \\"theology of painting\\", and was inspired to paint A Homage to Velázquez (National Gallery, London). By the early 18th century his oeuvre was gaining international recognition, and later in the century British collectors ventured to Spain in search of acquisitions. Since the popularity of Italian art was then at its height among British connoisseurs, they concentrated on paintings that showed obvious Italian influence, largely ignoring others such as Las Meninas.An almost immediate influence can be seen in the two portraits by Mazo of subjects depicted in Las Meninas, which in some ways reverse the motif of that painting. Ten years later, in 1666, Mazo painted Infanta Margaret Theresa, who was then 15 and just about to leave Madrid to marry the Holy Roman Emperor. In the background are figures in two further receding doorways, one of which was the new King Charles (Margaret Theresa's brother), and another the dwarf Maribarbola. A Mazo portrait of the widowed Queen Mariana again shows, through a doorway in the Alcázar, the young king with dwarfs, possibly including Maribarbola, and attendants who offer him a drink. Mazo's painting of The Family of the Artist also shows a composition similar to that of Las Meninas. Francisco Goya etched a print of Las Meninas in 1778, and later used Velázquez's painting as the model for his Charles IV of Spain and His Family. As in Las Meninas, the royal family in Goya's work is apparently visiting the artist's studio. In both paintings the artist is shown working on a canvas, of which only the rear is visible. Goya, however, replaces the atmospheric and warm perspective of Las Meninas with what Pierre Gassier calls a sense of \\"imminent suffocation\\".

Input: SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the \`\`Financial Accounting Standards Board Act''. SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS. As used in this Act-- (1) FASB.--The term \`\`FASB'' means the Financial Accounting Standards Board. (2) Federal regulatory program.--The term \`\`Federal regulatory program'' means a program enacted under the authority of the Commerce Clause of the Constitution and providing for the regulation of the interstate or foreign commerce of the United States, or the use of the means or instrumentalities of such commerce. (3) Person.--The term \`\`person'' includes corporations, companies, associations, firms, partnerships, societies, and joint stock companies, as well as individuals, but does not include an agency or instrumentality of Federal, State, or local government. SEC. 3. STANDARDS AUTHORITATIVE. The standards of financial accounting and reporting promulgated by the FASB shall be authoritative for the purpose of determining compliance with generally accepted accounting principles by any person under any Federal regulatory program. SEC. 4. DUTY OF FASB. The duty of the FASB shall be to establish and improve, after independent and impartial deliberation, standards of financial accounting and reporting for any person. To accomplish its duty, the FASB shall act to-- (1) improve the usefulness to present and potential investors, creditors, and other users, of financial reporting made by firms in interstate commerce focusing on the primary characteristics of relevance and reliability; (2) keep standards current to reflect changes in methods of doing business and changes in the economic environment; (3) consider promptly any significant areas of deficiency in financial reporting that might be improved through the standard-setting process; (4) promote the international convergence of accounting standards concurrent with improving the quality of financial reporting; and (5) improve the common understanding of the nature and purposes of information contained in financial reports. SEC. 5. REQUIREMENTS FOR ESTABLISHMENT OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS. (a) General Principles.--In promulgating and revising standards of financial accounting and reporting, the FASB shall follow the following principles: (1) Financial reporting should provide information that is useful to present and potential investors and creditors and other users in making rational investment, credit, and similar decisions. The information should be comprehensible to those who have a reasonable understanding of business and economic activities and are willing to study the information with reasonable diligence. (2) Financial reporting should provide information to help present and potential investors and creditors and other users in assessing the amounts, timing, and uncertainty of prospective cash receipts from dividends or interest and the proceeds from the sale, redemption, or maturity of the securities or loans. (3) Financial reporting should provide information about the economic resources of an enterprise, the claims to those resources (obligations of the enterprise to transfer resources to other entities and owners' equity), and the effects of transactions, events, and circumstances that change resources and claims to those resources. (b) Operating Objectives.--The FASB shall promote the following objectives in the conduct of its activities: (1) To be objective in its decision making and to ensure, insofar as possible, the neutrality of information resulting from its standards. To be neutral, information must report economic activity as faithfully as possible without coloring the image it communicates for the purpose of influencing behavior in any particular direction. (2) To weigh carefully the views of its constituents in developing concepts and standards. However, the ultimate determinant of concepts and standards must be the FASB's judgment, based on research, public input, and careful deliberation about the usefulness of the resulting information. (3) To bring about needed changes in ways that minimize disruption to the continuity of reporting practice, including establishment of reasonable effective dates and transition provisions when new standards are introduced. Change should be evolutionary to the extent that it can be accommodated by the need for relevance, reliability, comparability, and consistency.

Both sentences describe someone's sister going to a concert for the purpose of watching a performance. Step 3: Identify subjects and actions. In both sentences, the sister is the subject and going to a concert is the action. The main difference between the sentences is the performer: an idol in Sentence A and a cat in Sentence B. Step 4: Evaluate the performers. - In Sentence A, the performer is an \\"idol,\\" which commonly refers to a popular human figure or celebrity, especially in music. This is a reasonable situation, as people frequently attend concerts to watch their favorite musicians perform. - In Sentence B, the performer is a \\"cat.\\" This is unlikely in reality, as cats cannot sing or perform in the same way that humans do. Step 5: Compare both sentences. By evaluating the performers in both sentences, we can determine that Sentence A represents a plausible situation, while Sentence B contradicts common sense.

What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","response":"The first step of the process is heating the saltwater mixture. This process is essential in separating the salt from the water by taking advantage of their different physical properties, specifically their boiling points. Water has a boiling point of 100°C (212°F) under normal atmospheric pressure, whereas salt has a much higher boiling point, around 801°C (1,474°F). By heating the saltwater mixture, the water will turn into vapor while the salt remains in its solid state due to their distinct boiling points. This step is carried out by heating the saltwater mixture in a container until the water reaches its boiling point and begins to evaporate. The heat source can be a stove, a heating plate, or even sunlight when using a solar still. This process should be done at a controlled heat so as not to overheat the mixture, which could potentially cause splattering or structural damage to the container. As the water evaporates, it leaves the salt behind in the container in the form of solid crystals. It is essential to constantly monitor the evaporation process to ensure that the salt does not contaminate the evaporated water. This is achieved through an appropriate barrier or setup allowing the water vapor to travel away from the salt residue. Once the water evaporates and separates from the salt, it must be condensed back into its liquid form through a cooling process. This step usually involves directing the water vapor to a cold surface, such as a glass or metal lid, where it will cool down and transform into liquid. The condensation process is crucial as it purifies the water, making it free from the salt contaminants. After the water has condensed and formed droplets on the cold surface, it is then collected in a separate container. This newly collected water is now free from salt and other impurities that are left behind during the heating and evaporation process. The entire process of heating, evaporating, condensing, and collecting water is repeated multiple times to remove any remaining traces of salt or other impurities. This ensures that the final product is clean and pure water, making it suitable for drinking, irrigation, and various other uses. In summary, the first step of the process of removing salt from water is heating the saltwater mixture. This step enables the separation of salt from water by exploiting their different boiling points, ultimately resulting in the evaporation of the water, leaving the salt behind in solid form. The entire process must be repeated several times to ensure complete removal of salt from the water, providing purified water for multiple applications."},{"question":"The average body length is 50 centimeters , but the maximum length is 25 centimetres .

Question: What is provided at Eli Whitney's old factory now? Context: The city struck fortune in the late 18th century with the inventions and industrial activity of Eli Whitney, a Yale graduate who remained in New Haven to develop the cotton gin and establish a gun-manufacturing factory in the northern part of the city near the Hamden town line.

Though he lay there helpless, still she found him an awesome figure, like a fallen cathedral tower. Only two other men are as tall, she thought. Amalric and Orlando. She felt a pang of guilt. How could she be thinking about the troubadour here where her royal master lay slowly dying? She fixed her eyes on Louis, and on the ivory and wood crucifix that rose and fell on his chest with his labored breathing. Nicolette felt as if she, too, could hardly breathe. Across the crowded room a fire roared in a huge stone-lined fireplace. The air was stifling. She resented all that made it so, down to the woolen draperies and wall hangings and the thick carpets that sealed in the heat. But she knew that this northern chateau, Pontoise-les-Noyons, a day's ride from Paris, had had to be built to withstand cold, its walls thick and its windows tiny ? so totally unlike the bright, airy Languedoc manor she had grown up in. Sweat trickled down her brow and stung her eyes. Her breath was coming in little gasps. She felt as if she would faint if she couldn't go outside soon. Dozens of people, the King's family and courtiers, had packed themselves uselessly into the room, making it even more suffocating. Their whispers, like the buzzing of mosquitoes, irritated Nicolette. Almost all of them, she was sure, worried more about their own welfare than about the King's. And even Louis's wife and mother, though they grieved for him, were too distracted to do much to alleviate his suffering. She saw the King's lips quiver, and quickly she bent close to him. Any last words could be terribly important. \\"Jerusalem,\\" he mumbled. \\"Towers - golden. Gates of pearl. Crystal waters.\\" Then he panted heavily. \\"Hush, sire,\\" she whispered. \\"Rest easy.\\" Nicolette bent close to the King: Pick the correct answer from the following options: - not enough information - When she saw the King's lips quiver - To press a wet cloth to the King's brow - When she felt guilt Answer:","response":"When she saw the King's lips quiver"},{"question":"Japanese actress Rinko Kikuchi walks Anjali Rao through the streets of Tokyo.

Hmmm, my chain of thoughts:","response":"Marco Polo and Christopher Columbus did not travel together. The reason lies in the timeline of their lives and expeditions. Marco Polo (1254-1324): He was a Venetian merchant, explorer, and writer, who famously traveled to Asia along the Silk Road. His journey began in 1271 and ended in 1295. His travels were documented in the book \\"Il Milione\\" (The Travels of Marco Polo), which provided Europeans with a glimpse of the cultures, customs, and geographical wonders of the East, notably China, and inspired many to explore the world. Christopher Columbus (1451-1506): He was an Italian explorer, navigator, and colonialist who completed four voyages across the Atlantic Ocean, initiating contact between Europeans and the Americas. His first voyage took place in 1492, almost 170 years after Marco Polo's death, with the support of the Spanish monarchs Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile. His journeys marked the beginning of European exploration and colonization of the American continents. In summary, Marco Polo and Christopher Columbus lived during different periods and undertook their famous expeditions independently. However, it is worth mentioning that the writings of Marco Polo's travels influenced Columbus, and he even carried a copy of Marco Polo's book during his voyages to help guide him in his exploration. So, while they did not travel together, Marco Polo's work had a significant impact on Columbus's journeys."},{"question":"Are these paraphrases?

Christensen, said in a statement. The agency’s budget for custody operations in the current fiscal year is 2.05 billion, officials said, and as of Saturday, ICE was holding 30,773 people in its detention system. Immigration officials said Tuesday that they had no plans to release substantially more detainees this week, though they warned that more releases were still possible depending on the outcome of budget negotiations. Advertisement Continue reading the main story They refused to specify exactly how many detainees were released, or where the releases took place. But immigrants’ advocates around the country have reported that detainees were freed in several places, including Hudson County, N.J.; Polk County, Tex.; Broward County, Fla.; New Orleans; and from centers in Alabama, Arizona, Georgia and New York. Advertisement Continue reading the main story While immigration officials occasionally free detainees on supervised release, immigration advocates said that the surge of recent releases — so many in such a short span of time — was extraordinary. Video Under supervised release, defendants in immigration cases have to adhere to a strict reporting schedule that might include attending appointments at a regional immigration office as well as wearing electronic monitoring bracelets, officials said. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Advocacy groups, citing the cost of detaining immigrants, have for years argued that the federal government should make greater use of less expensive alternatives to detention for low-risk defendants being held on administrative charges. One such group, the National Immigration Forum, estimated last year that it cost from 122 to 164 a day to hold a detainee in the federal immigration system. In contrast, the organization said, alternative forms of detention could cost from 30 cents to 14 a day per immigrant.

Among those released in the past week was Anthony Orlando Williams, 52, a Jamaican immigrant who spent nearly three years in a detention center in Georgia. “I’m good, man,” he said. “I’m free.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Williams, in a telephone interview from Stone Mountain, Ga., said he became an illegal immigrant when he overstayed a visa in 1991. He was detained in 2010 by a sheriff’s deputy in Gwinnett County, Ga., when it was discovered that he had violated probation for a conviction in 2005 of simple assault, simple battery and child abuse, charges that sprung from a domestic dispute with his wife at the time. He was transferred to ICE custody and has been fighting a deportation order with the help of Families for Freedom, an immigrant support group in New York.

That figure was up from the year before, in which 93 percent attended their final court hearings, said the group, citing statistics provided by B.I., a private contractor that provides monitoring and supervision services to ICE.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story But Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama, a senior member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is also holding immigration hearings, said the releases “lessened the chances” that legislators might reach a bipartisan accord on comprehensive immigration reform. “It is clear the administration is using the sequester as a convenient excuse to bow to political pressure from the amnesty groups,” he said. “With this new action, the administration has further demonstrated that it has no commitment to enforcing the law and cannot be trusted to deliver on any future promises of enforcement.” Other Republicans, however, shrugged off the releases, saying they expected that the administration would use the excuse of sequestration to take attention-grabbing action and that they were prepared for more in the coming days. ||||| A week before mandatory budget cuts go into effect across the government, the Department of Homeland Security has started releasing illegal immigrants being held in immigration jails across the country, Immigration and Customs Enforcement said Tuesday. Gillian Christensen, an ICE spokeswoman, said ICE has reviewed \\"several hundred cases\\" of immigrants being held in jails around the country and released them in the last week. They have been \\"placed on an appropriate, more cost-effective form of supervised release,\\" she said. Christensen said the agency's \\"priority for detention remains on serious criminal offenders and other individuals who pose a significant threat to public safety.\\" She did not say how released immigrants were selected or what jails they were released from. Tuesday's announcement of jail releases is the first tangible impact of the looming budget cuts for DHS. The Obama administration has been issuing dire warnings about the impact of the sequestration and DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano told reporters at the White House Monday that across-the-board cuts would impact the department's core operations, including border security and airport screening operations. She also warned that DHS might not be able to afford to keep the 34,000 immigration jail beds mandated by Congress. On average last week, there were 30,773 people being held in ICE jails. \\"I don't think we can maintain the same level of security at all places around the country with sequester as without sequester,\\" said Napolitano, adding that the impact would be \\"\`like a rolling ball. It will keep growing.\\" According to the National Immigration Forum, it costs the government about 164 a day to keep an illegal immigrant facing deportation jailed. In a report on immigration detention costs last year the advocacy group said costs for supervised release can range from about 30 cents to 14 a day. Republicans lawmakers decried the releases Tuesday. \\"It's abhorrent that President (Barack) Obama is releasing criminals into our communities to promote his political agenda on sequestration,\\" House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte. \\"By releasing criminal immigrants onto the streets, the Administration is needlessly endangering American lives. It also undermines our efforts to come together with the Administration and reform our nation's immigration laws.\\" The administration asked for about 1.96 billion for immigration jail operations in the last budget. It amounts to about 5.4 million a day, according to the National Immigration Forum's report. Christensen said Tuesday that released immigrants will still face deportation proceedings. ||||| The Obama administration announced Tuesday that it had released hundreds of illegal immigrants held in detention facilities, saying it could no longer afford to house them because of across-the-board cuts that are set to start taking effect Friday. Federal authorities said that the detainees continue to face immigration charges, that they are being monitored and that violent offenders will not be let go. The unusual action came as much of Washington plotted strategy for managing the deep cuts, known as sequestration, and for winning the political battle over them. President Obama flew to Newport News to highlight the effect the reductions would have on the defense industry, saying they would harm a facility that builds nuclear submarines. Other top administration officials joined in, with Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. bluntly declaring in a speech, “The American people are going to be less safe.” Politically, the president seemed to be trying to cause a split between Republican lawmakers who are set against raising taxes as part of a compromise to avoid the spending cuts and those who are open to the idea. You’ve heard the word “sequester” mentioned by politicians a lot lately. The Washington Post’s Ed O’Keefe explains what the term means, and why it matters. (The Washington Post) Obama heralded Rep. Scott Rigell (R-Va.) for endorsing an overhaul of the tax code that raises new revenue, bringing him to Newport News on Air Force One. He also met later in the day with Republican Sens. Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.) and John McCain (Ariz.), who have signaled that they would be open to more taxes as part of a broader compromise that also overhauled entitlements. But GOP leaders showed no such interest Tuesday. House Speaker John A. Boehner (Ohio) lashed out at Obama, saying he was exploiting members of the armed services to achieve political aims. “I don’t think the president’s focused on trying to find a solution to the sequester,” he said at a news conference. “The president has been traveling all over the country and today [is] going down to Newport News in order to use our military men and women as a prop in yet another campaign rally to support his tax hikes.” With the sequester all but certain to begin Friday, Republicans and Democrats were positioning for a longer brawl that would last until at least late March, when a stopgap measure that funds the government expires. The administration has acknowledged that the full brunt of the sequester wouldn’t be felt until near then, and both sides are looking to that battle to determine whether the cuts remain — and whether the government shuts down. Senate Democrats are planning to advance a proposal before Friday that would halt much of the across-the-board reductions through the end of the year and replace them with a combination of other cuts and tax increases, including a new minimum tax rate for those making more than 5 million a year. It is not expected to get the 60 votes necessary to overcome a Republican filibuster. Republicans are divided about their strategy. Senate Republicans had planned to push for a bill that would preserve the 85 billion in cuts for this fiscal year but give the administration greater flexibility in how to manage them. But McCain, Graham and other GOP senators say they oppose handing over the appropriations power, usually the domain of Congress, to the White House, and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) said Tuesday that Republicans are still plotting their legislative strategy. In any case, Democrats are expected to reject any GOP proposal that would leave the scale of the cuts intact. Obama seems intent on capitalizing on divisions within the GOP. In Newport News, he said more Republicans need to follow in the footsteps of Rigell and McCain. “I’ve got to give Scott Rigell credit. He is one of your Republican congressmen who’s with us here today — and that’s not always healthy for a Republican, being with me,” Obama said. “But the reason he’s doing it is because he knows it’s important to you. And he’s asked his colleagues in the House to consider closing tax loopholes instead of letting these automatic cuts go through.” Rigell told reporters on Air Force One that although the country needs to cut spending, “I also believe that revenue has to come up a bit, first by growing the economy, but also by tax reform, which also includes eliminating lobbyist-inspired, lobbyist-written loopholes.” Republican leaders seemed uninterested, though, and announced that their first big bill of the year would be an overhaul of the tax code that would not raise the overall tax burden. In exchange for scaling back tax breaks, Republicans plan to lower rates. “I’m not interested in new revenue at this point,” House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp (R-Mich.) said Tuesday. With its decision to release detainees in immigration facilities, the Obama administration sought to make clear the impact of the sequester. The move drew heavy GOP criticism. “The last thing you would do to meet a budget cut of this size would be to voluntarily undertake actions that undermine the rule of law and endanger the public safety,” said Sen. Jeff Sessions (Ala.). House Speaker John A. Boehner (Ohio) said in an interview on CBS, “I, frankly, think this is outrageous.” Historically, many illegal immigrants released from federal detention centers while in deportation proceedings do not show up for subsequent court appearances, joining the ranks of what the Immigration and Customs Enforcement calls absconders or “fugitive aliens.” The agency has estimated that detention costs 122 per bed per day. It has been under pressure by immigration advocacy and civil rights groups to rely on cheaper detention alternatives for those in deportation proceedings who do not pose a security threat. More cost-effective alternatives include electronic ankle-bracelet monitoring, telephone monitoring and community-based monitoring programs. In a news briefing Monday before the releases were announced, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano indicated that sequestration would affect detention policy. “I’m supposed to have 34,000 detention beds for immigration,” she said. “How do I pay for those?” William Branigin, Sari Horwitz, Paul Kane, Lori Montgomery and Tara Bahrampour contributed to this report. ||||| Write a summary.","response":"The Department of Homeland Security has released several hundred illegal immigrants from detention centers in response to the possibility of automatic government-wide budget cuts, known as sequestration.

Such events are typically held either to protest the suffering of some marginalized group of people, or in memory of the dead. In the latter case, the event is often called a candlelight memorial. A large candlelight vigil will usually have invited speakers with a public address system and may be covered by local or national media.

Bringing a candle to a candlelight vigil is essential as it is a symbolic element of the event. The candles are the focal point of such gatherings, and their soft glow enhances the solemn and peaceful atmosphere, often evoking a sense of unity among the attendees. It is generally a good idea to bring your own candle to ensure you can participate fully in the vigil. You may choose a traditional wax candle or opt for a safer battery-operated LED candle, which can be particularly helpful in windy conditions or when there are concerns about open flames. Some organizers may also provide candles at the event if you do not have one; however, it is best to bring your own to be prepared. At the vigil, the candles are typically lit during a specific moment or as part of a coordinated action. This moment could follow a moment of silence, a prayer, or a relevant speech about the cause or event being commemorated. In addition to the candles, participants at a candlelight vigil may also bring signs or banners expressing support, showing solidarity, or making calls for action related to the event's purpose.

In the lawsuit, filed in Dallas County Court in Texas, Lahren claims that Beck and others associated with TheBlaze engaged in a “smear” campaign by “chastising her political views and opinions in a clear attempt to embarrass, humiliate, and undermine” her “reach to her audience on social media and elsewhere.” She claims that after the March 17 appearance on “The View,” she was informed that she was suspended and was “in shock” for the employment sanction “for freely expressing her opinions, which certainly reconcile with what is the law of the land in the United States i.e., a woman’s constitutional right to choose” and were “in no way consistent” with her obligations under her employment agreement. But several days later, according to her lawsuit, she got another call from human resources that her employment contract was terminated although she would continue to be paid. Her agreement runs through Sept. 30, according to the lawsuit.

Distilled to its essence, Defendants wrongly insisted, with no legal support, that Plaintiff ‘go dark’ on social media.” The suit claims that employees of TheBlaze even stretched yellow caution tape on the door to her office and dressing room. TheBlaze issued a statement to the media saying that “it is puzzling that an employee who remains under contract (and is still being paid) has sued us for being fired, especially when we continue to comply fully with the terms of our agreement with her.” But in her lawsuit, Lahren claims that TheBlaze’s legal counsel tried to “put the genie back in the proverbial bottle” by taking the position after-the-fact that she was only suspended and that Beck “had the right to manipulate” her by blocking access to her Facebook followers and listeners. Lahren is seeking a declaration that she was wrongfully terminated without cause, that her contract was breached, and that she is not bound by the pact and can seek other employment with a competitor. She also claims that a non-disclosure agreement is not valid because it was signed after she was employed and without any new consideration. She also is seeking a temporary restraining order and injunction prohibiting any effort by TheBlaze and Beck to block her freedom speech, including from giving political commentary or commenting on the lawsuit, or from accessing social media. ||||| Tomi Lahren, the outspoken conservative commentator, is suing her former boss and workplace, Glenn Beck and The Blaze, alleging wrongful termination. The suit, filed in Texas Friday, alleges that Beck and The Blaze got rid of Lahren and her nightly talk show due to her making pro-choice comments on \\"The View\\" last month. \\"I can't sit here and be a hypocrite and say I'm for limited government but I think the government should decide what women do with their bodies,\\" she said on the broadcast. Lahren, who is a vocal supporter of President Donald Trump and arguably one the most notable names at The Blaze other than Beck himself, was suspended -- along with her show -- for a week following those comments. According to the suit, Lahren then received a call from The Blaze that \\"her employment was terminated\\" and \\"she would have no more shows.\\" Related: Tomi Lahren's show pulled for a week after abortion comments \\"She is very disappointed that she is having to pursue ligation,\\" Lahren's lawyer, Brian Lauten, told CNN. \\"The fact of the matter is that she was wrongfully terminated.

The number of US call centers is expected to decline through 2008, with Canada getting many of the jobs the US will lose, a research firm said Friday.","response":"This statement is about the decline of the number of U.S. call centers through 2008, and Canada receiving many of the jobs that the U.S. will lose during that period. In order to discuss this statement, let's break it down into steps: 1. Identify the main subject: The main subject of the statement is the U.S. call centers and the expected changes in their numbers. Additionally, Canada's role in receiving the lost jobs is a secondary subject of focus. 2. Analyze the information provided: The statement tells us that the number of U.S. call centers is expected to decline through 2008. This implies that there is a trend of call centers either closing down or relocating to other countries. 3. Consider the implications: With the decline in the number of U.S. call centers, job losses are a potential consequence. This could have an impact on U.S. employment rates, as well as on the overall operation and growth of the call center industry. 4. Examine the role of Canada: The statement also mentions that Canada is expected to receive many of the jobs the U.S. will lose. This implies that call center jobs are being relocated to Canada, where companies may find more favorable conditions for their operations. Factors that could contribute to this trend include lower operating costs, skilled workforce availability, and cultural proximity to the U.S. market. 5. Discuss the source: The statement attributes this information to a research firm. Thus, this prediction is based on the analysis and research conducted by industry experts, making it a credible and important piece of information to consider. In conclusion, the statement is about the anticipated decline in the number of U.S. call centers through 2008 and the transfer of jobs to Canada. This implies that the call center industry in the U.S. could shrink, with Canada benefiting from the relocation of jobs. The prediction is based on research and analysis conducted by experts in the field."},{"question":"Provide the parts-of-speech tag of a word present in a sentence specified within curly braces ( '{{ ... }}' ).

Regarding whether it's worth investing in the \\"Haeundae\\" movie proposal, there are several factors to consider: 1. Genre and target audience: The movie combines elements of drama, romance, and disaster genres. It seems to target a wide range of audience, including fans of the involved actors, people interested in the South Korean culture, and those who enjoy disaster movies. You should consider whether this mix of genres and target audience aligns with your investment interests. 2. Production team: It is important to research the film's director, producers, and the production company behind it, as their previous work and box-office success can give you an idea of what to expect in terms of quality and financial return. Look for a team with a strong record in related genres to increase the likelihood of a successful project. 3. Cast: The talent attached to the project can play a significant role in the movie's success, especially in pulling in audiences. Research the actors involved and their past performances, both in terms of acting ability and box-office draws. 4. Distribution and marketing plans: The way a movie is distributed and marketed can make a huge difference in its financial success.

Cultural and political relevance: Since the movie is set in South Korea and revolves around a natural disaster (tsunami), it may generate interest in the local audience and those affected by or interested in the issue. The connection to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake might also attract international attention,, as it was a significant global event. The political situation between North and South Korea could both positively or negatively affect the film's reception worldwide, thus adding a level of uncertainty to the investment. 7. Script and storyline: Analyze the provided plot to determine if it is engaging, unique, and well-structured. A strong story foundation can contribute to a film's overall success.

Question: What caused the defeat that occurred in Kunowice, Poland? Context: The year 1759 saw several Prussian defeats. At the Battle of Kay, or Paltzig, the Russian Count Saltykov with 47,000 Russians defeated 26,000 Prussians commanded by General Carl Heinrich von Wedel. Though the Hanoverians defeated an army of 60,000 French at Minden, Austrian general Daun forced the surrender of an entire Prussian corps of 13,000 in the Battle of Maxen. Frederick himself lost half his army in the Battle of Kunersdorf (now Kunowice Poland), the worst defeat in his military career and one that drove him to the brink of abdication and thoughts of suicide. The disaster resulted partly from his misjudgment of the Russians, who had already demonstrated their strength at Zorndorf and at Gross-Jägersdorf (now Motornoye, Russia), and partly from good cooperation between the Russian and Austrian forces.

The proposed Istanbul Canal would run for more than 45 kilometers, or about 28 miles, from the Black Sea through Turkey's largest city and commercial capital, to the Marmara Sea -- roughly parallel to the Bosphorus Strait, the natural body of water that already bisects Istanbul. The Panama Canal is 77 kilometers (roughly 48 miles) in length, while the Suez Canal in Egypt is more than 190 kilometers (118 miles) long. Erdogan said one of the goals of the proposed canal would be to reduce the huge amount of international cargo ships that regularly traverse the congested Bosphorus. \\"One of the most important reasons for this project will be to reduce Bosphorus traffic and minimize threats,\\" Erdogan said, in comments published on the prime minister's official web-site. More than a 100 ships a day sail up and down the Bosphorus. Many of them carry dangerous cargos of crude oil and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). The fast currents and narrow bends in the historic channel have led to several accidents on the banks of Turkey's most populous city. The deadliest incident took place in 1979, when a Romanian oil tanker exploded after colliding with another vessel, killing dozens of people and leaking tons of oil into the sea. In his speech Wednesday, Erdogan conceded that critics in the Turkish media had referred to his plan as a \\"crazy project.\\" \\"With this project, there will be two seas running through Istanbul,\\" he said, adding that the canal would result in the creation of a man-made island and another peninsula. The prime minister said the proposed canal would be 145 meters (475 feet) wide and 25 meters (82 feet) deep. But he stopped short of announcing the exact route of the proposed waterway.

The outcome of the votes is uncertain. One measure is more hard-line, while the other represents a compromise between the Republican Party’s conservative and moderate wings. The compromise bill includes a provision requiring children and their parents to be detained together if they cross the border illegally. It would also provide 25 billion in funding for Trump’s much-promised border wall, change the existing visa lottery into a merit-based system and provide a path to citizenship for the young undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children. Republicans hold a majority in both houses of Congress. Party leaders, including President Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan, have lobbied lawmakers this week in hopes of securing their support for the legislation. “We can enforce our immigration laws without breaking families apart,” Ryan said Wednesday before Trump announced he would sign an executive order to end breaking up families. The president’s policy retreat followed a withering attack by Republican and Democratic officials who characterized the family separations as inhumane. The actions left parents with little or no information about where their children were being taken or when or how they would be reunited. “It’s about keeping families together while at the same time making sure that we have a very powerful, very strong border,” Trump said as he signed the document just before departing the White House for a political rally in the state of Minnesota. Later, at the political rally, the president defended his position saying the executive order he signed hours earlier would not weaken his border strategy: “The border is going to be just as tough as it’s been” despite...

Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","response":"The two questions you asked, \\"What's the most interesting joke?\\" and \\"What is the best joke you know?\\" may have some overlap, but they are not inquiring about the exact same information. Let's analyze the differences and similarities between these two questions. 1. What's the most interesting joke? This question seeks to find a joke that is considered the most interesting, which can be subjective. The term \\"interesting\\" can vary from person to person—it could mean thought-provoking, unique, or engaging. An interesting joke might not necessarily be the funniest, but it would typically generate discussion or create a memorable experience due to its content or delivery. One example of an interesting joke is the classic paradoxical joke, \\"Why is the raven like a writing desk?\\" This famous query was coined by Lewis Carroll in \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" and has no definitive answer, though it has been the subject of much speculation and debate. 2. What is the best joke you know? On the other hand, the question \\"What is the best joke you know?\\" seeks to find a joke deemed the \\"best\\"—which is also subjective. The term \\"best\\" could refer to the funniest, most well-known, or universally appreciated. Again, what is considered the best joke might differ from person to person, depending on factors like individual humor preferences, cultural context, and personal experiences. An example of a widely regarded best joke is the classic one-liner: \\"Why did the chicken cross the road? To get to the other side.\\" This simple but timeless joke has been enjoyed by many generations due to its easy-to-understand humor and adaptability. Similarities: Both questions are seeking a joke or type of humor. Additionally, the answers to both questions are subjective, as humor preferences will differ from one person to another. Differences: The first question is specifically requesting a joke that is considered interesting, which may refer to thought-provoking, unique, or engaging content. In comparison, the second question seeks the best joke, which can imply various criteria like funniest, most memorable, or universally appealing. In summary, while both questions inquire about a joke, they focus on different aspects of humor. The first question is geared more towards thought-provoking or fascinating content, while the second question is concerned with finding a joke that is generally considered the best according to various, subjective criteria."},{"question":"George Lucas is well-known as the director of Star Wars and other science fiction films.is the reasoning for what question and answer pair?","response":"Question: Who is the famous director behind the Star Wars franchise and other science fiction films?

They do this by converting electrical signals into vibrations or sound waves that can be heard by the human ear. Inside a speaker, there is a diaphragm (usually made of paper, plastic, or metal) that vibrates when it receives an electrical signal. This vibration generates sound waves, which then travel through the air to reach our ears. Option 2 is incorrect because speakers do not have any function related to colors. Magnifying colors is typically the job of devices like TVs and projectors, which use various technologies to display a wide range of colors. Speakers, on the other hand, are solely focused on producing and amplifying audio."},{"question":"Denny asked: Given the sentence \\"Man people in america revolution era outfits enter a trailer.\\" can we conclude that \\"People wearing outfits enter a trailer.\\"?

The product was tested at the Saarbrucken Institute for New Materials. It is worth mentioning that the invention is transparent and non-poisonous. The liquid glass can protect any type of surface from damages caused by water, UV radiation, dirt, heat, and bacterial infections. Besides, it is flexible and breathable, which means that the liquid glass can be applied on plants and seeds as well. Researchers found that the spray greatly increases the resistance of plants to bacteria-caused diseases. The trials also showed that the sprayed seeds grew faster. Depending on the type of surface that is to be covered, researchers can add water or ethanol to the spray. Scientists say that _ . The spray produces a coating that is just 100nm thick. Trials by food processing plants in Germany have concluded that foods covered with the glass can store longer than those stored in normal condition. According to Neil McClelland, UK project manager with Nanopool, due to its capabilities, the spray-on liquid glass can become one of the most useful inventions around the world, ending up being used by a lot of industries that will cover their products. At present, the invention is being used by a train company and a hotel chain in the UK, as well as a hamburger chain in Germany that are carrying out tests of the liquid glass for various uses. The spray-on liquid glass was also tested in a Lancashire hospital, where it showed \\"very promising\\" results, being used to cover medical equipment and bandages. The invention could be also used on clothing, because it cannot be seen by the naked eye, thus clothes could become stain resistant. Due to its unique characteristics, the liquid glass can be used to cover bathrooms, sinks and many other surfaces in the home. According to the researchers, the spay-on glass can last for a year.

The Void has an army of anti-matter that he uses to try and destroy the forces of the Core. An endless battle rages at the edge of our solar system, between the VOID and the Core's forces. Quantum Quest centers on the story of Dave, a young photon, who is forced out of the Sun on a journey of discovery. He must get to the Cassini Space Craft and save it from the forces of the Void, only Dave does not know exactly what he must do or even where the Cassini Space craft is or what it is. The forces of the Void must destroy Cassini before it sends its great discoveries back to Earth, and with the death of Dave's friend, the Ranger, Dave is the only thing that stands between them and victory. My question: What takes place in atomic world? Answer:","response":"In the atomic world of the movie plot \\"Quantum Quest: A Cassini Space Odyssey,\\" the forces of the Core and the forces of the Void engage in a battle for the fate of the universe. The Core, a kind being that lives inside all stars, creates protons, photons, and neutrinos as its children to bring life, light, and knowledge to the universe. In contrast, the Void represents the nothingness that existed before the Big Bang and aims to destroy everything in the universe using an army of anti-matter. The story primarily revolves around Dave, a young photon, who embarks on a journey of discovery after being forced out of the Sun. Dave's mission is to save the Cassini Space Craft from the forces of the Void. However, he is initially unsure about what exactly he needs to do, where the spacecraft is, or even what it is. The Void's forces are focused on destroying the Cassini Space Craft before it can transmit its significant discoveries back to Earth. The plot emphasizes the importance of Dave's role as the last line of defense in preventing the forces of the Void from achieving their goal."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Given the background: The epidermis also contains melanocytes , which are cells that produce melanin. Melanin is the brownish pigment that gives skin much of its color. Everyone has about the same number of melanocytes, but the melanocytes of people with darker skin produce more melanin. The amount of melanin produced is determined by heredity and exposure to UV light, which increases melanin output. Exposure to UV light also stimulates the skin to produce vitamin D . Because melanin blocks UV light from penetrating the skin, people with darker skin may be at greater risk of vitamin D deficiency. and the situation: Robin and Samantha are both bodybuilders preparing for a competition. Both of them are trying to change their skin complexion to help their appearances at the competition. Robin begins exposing her skin to high amounts of UV light several days a week. Samantha decides not to use any UV light and instead just uses lotion to help her skin. Answer the following question: Who will produce lower amounts of melanin? Answer:","response":"Samantha will produce lower amounts of melanin in comparison to Robin. In the given background information, it is stated that exposure to UV light stimulates melanocyte cells to produce more melanin. Since Robin is exposing her skin to high amounts of UV light several days a week, her melanocytes will produce more melanin, resulting in a darker complexion. On the other hand, Samantha is not using any UV light and only relying on lotion to help her skin. As a result, her melanocyte cells will not be stimulated by UV light to produce more melanin, leading to lower melanin production and lighter skin complexion in comparison to Robin."},{"question":"Denny asked: Given the sentence \\"The guy in red on a dirt bike is getting photographed.\\" is it true that \\"A man is photographed while riding a dirtbike.\\"?. Le: OK, so how can I answer with some explanation?","response":"To determine if the statement \\"A man is photographed while riding a dirtbike\\" is true based on the sentence \\"The guy in red on a dirt bike is getting photographed,\\" we can break down and compare the key components of each statement. 1.

They despair when they watch their beloved spend much money on extra baggage charge. Nearly half of these women admitted to lying about the weight of their case to their partner before leaving for the airport, in fear of being made to unload some unnecessary items. But it's a fact that women pack more than they need. On average, a woman needs around 57 items in suitcase for a two-week holiday, yet most women pack nearer to 150 items, ranging from skirts, tops, underwear and high heels. In addition, women pack more sun cream, make-up and hair appliances than they were likely to need. They all take up space in the suitcase, only a third of them will see the light of day once at the holiday place. 79 percent of women admitted to taking extra items with them, with the reason for this being \\"just in case\\". Women plan their holiday wardrobe months in advance. Packing enough clothes and other items to last a month is not enough for some women. They'd take a chance to shop for new items while holidaying abroad. So they'll return with even more luggage in their cases. Professor Karen Pine said: \\"Women are tempted to take familiar items with them on holiday, often everything except the kitchen sink. Some people find traveling stressful, particularly when they're unsure about the home comforts available at their holiday place. They over-pack to help cope with those feelings of stress and reduce the uncertainty.\\" This will come as no surprise to some men, who are used to trying to squeeze their partner's luggage into the boot of the car with their own, smaller case. On the other hand, men pack very lightly, with only an average of 40 items for a two-week holiday. How does a man feel about his wife packing too much?

Samuel rarely wore their seat belt in the car but Benjamin always wore their seat belt.","response":"Despite repeated instances of encouraging Samuel to prioritize safety, Benjamin found it increasingly difficult to understand why their friend seemed to disregard the importance of wearing a seat belt, even though numerous accident statistics and public safety campaigns have consistently highlighted the life-saving potential of such a seemingly insignificant action. Not only did this thoughtless behavior worry Benjamin, it also made them feel responsible for trying to convince Samuel to reconsider their approach to road safety. Consequently, Benjamin contemplated various strategies to help Samuel understand the criticality of wearing a seat belt, such as sharing personal anecdotes, presenting them with relevant data, and even staging an intervention with the help of their mutual friends. Recognizing their obligation as a responsible driver and a concerned friend, Benjamin ensured that they always emphasized the importance of in-car safety measures for everyone, including double-checking that all passengers had buckled their seat belts before commencing any journey. They hoped that their unwavering diligence would serve as a positive influence on Samuel, eventually leading them to adopt these excellent practices and understand the difference between seemingly small, yet consequential habits. Moreover, no matter how many times Samuel dismissed their concerns, Benjamin continued to care for them deeply, knowing that the best thing they could do was to maintain their patience and persist in their efforts to change Samuel’s perspective regarding road safety. After all, friendships are built on a foundation of trust, understanding, and a genuine sense of responsibility for one another's well-being. And this endeavor was a testimony to the kind of friendship Benjamin wished to nurture and uphold with Samuel, for they believed in not merely looking out for their own interests but also being a guardian of their friends’ safety and security. As the days turned into weeks, and the weeks into months, Benjamin’s persistent effort started to yield subtle, yet noticeable results. Samuel began to demonstrate moments of hesitation when reaching for the seat belt, and occasionally they even wore it voluntarily without requiring a reminder. While this may have seemed like a minor triumph, to Benjamin, this transformation indicated that their compassion, dedication, and unwavering commitment to their friend's wellbeing had begun to leave a lasting impression on Samuel, inching them closer to adopting a safer approach to life, both on and off the road."},{"question":"Q: Is this product review positive?

Every year, without fail, I feel a little bit depressed on the First of March. I absolutely love summer. I love the hot weather, the skimpy clothes, the summer fruits and the party seasons. I only have good memories of summer - Christmas time, six weeks holidays when in school then three months off whilst at uni. In my eyes, there is not one bad thing about summer. That is why I hate the First of March. Yes, it is still hot. Yes, my summer fruits are still in season and I can still wear my skimpy clothes, but, in my mind, it means that winter is near. The weather is only going to get colder and my favourite time of the year is official over. In an attempt to lift my end of Summer blues I decided to give myself a bright, cheerful manicure. The colour I choose was a luscious purple cream from butter LONDON called Molly-Coddled. It was just about opaque after one coat, just ever so slightly streaky. Two coats, completely opaque and streak free. If you haven't previously heard of butter LONDON, it is a nail polish brand with a massive range of high fashion colours and it's products are formulated without the use of the harmful ingredients like Formaldehyde, Toluene, DBP or Parabens. butter LONDON was the first company to sell 3 Free nail lacquer in the United States. Formaldehyde is one of the biggest nasties that I make a real effort to avoid. I did my PhD in Forensics and spent a lot of time watching autopsies. Once the body parts have been harvested, they are stored in Formaldehyde to be preserved. The Formaldehyde alters the proteins in the tissue to stop them breaking down - fine for the dead, not something I want to use whilst I am alive. It is nasty, nasty stuff.

You can directly copy and paste a span from the story or the question while answering the given question. Background Paragraph: Rural development is the process of improving the quality of life and economic well-being of people living in rural areas, often relatively isolated and sparsely populated areas.[1] Rural development has traditionally centered on the exploitation of land-intensive natural resources such as agriculture and forestry. However, changes in global production networks and increased urbanization have changed the character of rural areas. Increasingly tourism, niche manufacturers, and recreation have replaced resource extraction and agriculture as dominant economic drivers.[2] The need for rural communities to approach development from a wider perspective has created more focus on a broad range of development goals rather than merely creating incentive for agricultural or resource based businesses. Education, entrepreneurship, physical infrastructure, and social infrastructure all play an important role in developing rural regions.[3] Rural development is also characterized by its emphasis on locally produced economic development strategies.[4] In contrast to urban regions, which have many similarities, rural areas are highly distinctive from one another. For this reason there are a large variety of rural development approaches used globally.[5] Rural development is a comprehensive term. It essentially focuses on action for the development of areas outside the mainstream urban economic system. we should think of what type of rural development is needed because modernization of village leads to urbanization and village environment disappears. Story: Two rural communities from Jones county took different approaches on rural development as a means of adapting to increasing urbanization. Kent village remained traditionally centered on the exploitation of land-intensive natural resources such as agriculture and forestry. The villagers of Long Grove on the other hand took a wider perspective and created more focus on a broad range of development goals rather than merely creating incentive for agricultural or resource based businesses. Education, entrepreneurship, physical infrastructure, and social infrastructure all played an important role in developing Long Grove village. Question: Which villagers have a better quality of life as a consequence of their rural development strategy? A:","response":"The villagers of Long Grove have a better quality of life as a consequence of their rural development strategy."},{"question":"Given the following context: The film opens with an English schoolteacher, Gwen Mayfield, packing up her belongings at a mission school in colonial Africa. The local witch doctors have led a rebellion, and they reach the school before she is able to escape—the shaman wearing a body mask. Gwen screams, and the scene dissolves to the opening credits. The next scene is back home in England, where Gwen meets with the apparently Reverend Alan Bax for a job interview. We discover that Gwen suffered a nervous breakdown from whatever she experienced at the hand of the rebels when the school was attacked. Alan is impressed by Gwen and hires her to be the new head teacher at the small private school he and his sister, well-known journalist Stephanie Bax, run for the local children in the village of Heddaby. Upon moving into the teacher's cottage, Gwen asks her maid, Valerie Creek, where she might find the rectory. Valerie is confused—she knows there is no rectory—until Gwen explains she would like to thank Mr. Bax. \\"Oh, you mean the Baxes' house!\\" she says, and shows her the way after tea.

Article: First aid is emergency care for a victim of sudden illness or injury until more skillful medical treatment is available. It may save a life or improve certain vital signs including pulse, temperature, a clear airway, and breathing. In minor emergencies, first aid may prevent a victim's condition from turning worse and provide relief from pain. First aid must be done as quickly as possible. In the case of the seriously injured, a few minutes can make the difference between complete recovery and loss of life. First-aid measures depend upon a victim's needs and the provider's level of knowledge and skill. Knowing what not to do in an emergency is as important as knowing what to do. Improperly moving a person with a neck injury, for example, can lead to permanent spinal injury and paralysis . Despite the variety of injuries possible, several principles of first aid apply to all emergencies. The first step is to call for professional medical help. The victim, if conscious, should be reassured that medical aid has been requested, and asked for permission to provide any first aid. Next, assess the scene, asking other people or the injured person's family or friends about details of the injury or illness, any care that may have already been given, and pre-existing conditions such as diabetes or heart trouble. The victim should be checked for a medical card that describes special medical conditions. Unless the accident scene becomes unsafe or the victim may suffer further injury, do not move the victim. First aid requires rapid assessment of victims to determine whether life-threatening conditions exist. One method for evaluating a victim's condition is known by the acronym ABC, which stands for: A---Airway: is it open and clear? B---Breathing: is the person breathing? Look, listen, and feel for breathing. C---Circulation: is there a pulse? Is the person bleeding extremely? Check skin color and temperature for additional indications of circulation problems.

C: relieving a victim from pain D: helping a person avoid sudden illness or injury A:","response":"D: helping a person avoid sudden illness or injury"},{"question":"Zagłówki [zaˈɡwufki] is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Zelów within Bełchatów County Łódź Voivodeship in central Poland.

The dull, workaday life at the Navy weather station base on Gow Island in the South Pacific is interrupted by that very same C-47 transport aircraft. On a routine approach for refueling, the transport experiences unusual trouble and suddenly crash lands on the island's single airstrip, destroying its control tower and the island's only two-way radio. The stricken aircraft also blocks the runway, preventing its further use. Lieutenant Charles Brown (Eisley) is in command of Gow's weather station. He, Navy nurse Nora Hall (Van Doren), and biologist Arthur Beecham (Walter Sande) reach the wreck only to find that seven scientists and crew aboard the cargo aircraft when it left Antarctica are now mysteriously missing. The only one found aboard is the transport's pilot, who is traumatized and in a state of shock, unable to speak. Unloading the prehistoric cargo from the crashed C-47, Dr. Beecham recommends planting the trees to ensure their survival in the island's tropical conditions. Somewhat later, Gow Island's bird population becomes disturbed by something unknown. At the same time, the weather station's scientists try to figure out a connection between this event and a corrosive residue that begins turning up at various island locations. It slowly becomes clear that the planted prehistoric trees have quickly grown into acid-secreting, carnivorous monsters that move about Gow Island at night, at will. They reproduce fast and eventually cut off the island with their growing numbers and nocturnal assaults on Gow's native islanders. Brown has to hold together his dwindling Navy personnel and the coterie of scientists and civilians while figuing out a way to stop this prehistoric menace. The Navy personnel's only available weapons prove largely ineffective against...

Question: When did the first mammals come to be? Context: The early synapsid mammalian ancestors were sphenacodont pelycosaurs, a group that produced the non-mammalian Dimetrodon. At the end of the Carboniferous period, this group diverged from the sauropsid line that led to today's reptiles and birds. The line following the stem group Sphenacodontia split-off several diverse groups of non-mammalian synapsids—sometimes referred to as mammal-like reptiles—before giving rise to the proto-mammals (Therapsida) in the early Mesozoic era. The modern mammalian orders arose in the Paleogene and Neogene periods of the Cenozoic era, after the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs 66 million years ago.","response":"The first mammals came to be in the early Mesozoic era, when the proto-mammals (Therapsida) evolved from non-mammalian synapsids.

He was named after Ray Charles, his mother's favorite singer. The family moved to Washington, D.C., when he was three, and they settled permanently in Palmer Park, Maryland when he was ten. His father worked as a supermarket night manager and his mother was a nurse. When Leonard decided to turn professional, Janks Morton introduced him to Mike Trainer, a friend of his who was an attorney. Trainer talked 24 of his friends and clients into underwriting Leonard's career with an investment of 21,000 to be repaid within four years at 8% interest. Trainer then made Leonard the sole stockholder in Sugar Ray Leonard, Inc. Angelo Dundee, Muhammad Ali's trainer, was brought in to be Leonard's trainer and manager. Many of the people being considered wanted absolute control and a cut somewhere near the manager's traditional 33%. Dundee had a different proposition. Although he would prescribe the training procedures, he would leave the day-to-day work to Dave Jacobs and Janks Morton. He would also choose Leonard's opponents. For his services, Dundee would get 15% of Leonard's purse. Leonard made his professional debut on February 5, 1977 before a crowd of 10,270 at the Civic Center in Baltimore. He was paid 40,044 for the fight. His opponent was Luis \\"The Bull\\" Vega, whom he defeated by a six-round unanimous decision. After the fight, Leonard paid back his 21,000 loan to the investors. In his fourteenth professional fight, Leonard fought his first world-ranked opponent, Floyd Mayweather, who was ranked seventeenth. The fight took place on September 9, 1978. Leonard won by a tenth-round knockout. A month later, Leonard defeated his old amateur nemesis Randy Shields by a ten-round unanimous decision. On August 12, 1979, Leonard knocked out Pete Ranzany in four rounds to win the NABF Welterweight Championship. The following month, he made his first title defense against Andy Price. Many felt that Price would give Leonard a tough fight, but Leonard took him out in the first round, advancing his record to 25-0 with 16 knockouts. Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","response":"So, in this article, it talks about a man named Leonard, who is a very good boxer. His friends and a lawyer named Mike Trainer helped him start his boxing career by giving him money. They made a special company just for him. Then, they brought in a famous trainer called Angelo Dundee to train Leonard and help him to pick his opponents in the boxing ring. Leonard had a great start and was able to pay back the money his friends gave him. He continued to win more boxing matches and even became the champion in his weight group. Sometimes people thought he might have a tough time in fights, but Leonard proved them wrong by winning quickly."},{"question":"Write the next sentence in the following story.

The child of Natalie was better at math than the child of Rebecca, as a result of Select from: A). Natalie being a math teacher.. B). Rebecca being a math teacher..","response":"A). Natalie being a math teacher... While every child is unique and possesses an individual set of talents and capabilities, it's hard to ignore the influence that a parent's profession can have on their child's interests and abilities. In this particular situation, it is apparent that Natalie’s profession as a math teacher had a significant impact on her child's aptitude for the subject. As a math teacher, Natalie had a profound understanding of mathematical concepts, principles, and techniques. Her daily life revolved around numbers, equations, calculations, and problem-solving. When she became a mother, she naturally integrated this knowledge and passion for math into her parenting. Thus, her child was exposed to the wonders of mathematics at a very young age, not as a formal subject, but as an integral part of day-to-day life. Playtime at Natalie's house included board games that highlighted the application of math, like Monopoly, chess, or Sudoku. As the child grew older, Natalie helped them see the relevance of math in everything from baking (measuring ingredients) to gardening (calculation of seed planting and water usage) to their personal finances (managing their weekly allowance). Moreover, being a teacher, Natalie had an inherent understanding of the education system and its learning techniques. She knew about common places where students faltered, the most effective methods to explain difficult concepts, and the teaching strategies that encouraged a love for the subject. Because she was resourceful and patient, Natalie turned homework sessions into fun learning experiences, transforming equations and theorems from intimidating to enjoyable and instilling in her child a fascination for the subject. In comparison, Rebecca, whose profession was not directly linked to mathematics, may not have been able to provide her child with the same level and depth of exposure to the subject. It isn't a testament to her capability or intelligence, but a simple matter of specialization and professional background. Even though Rebecca might be skilled in her domain, her proficiency in teaching mathematical concepts might not be on par with Natalie’s. Naturally, the child of Natalie had an advantage when it came to mathematical proficiency. This early exposure and continuous reinforcement of mathematical concepts led to a faster grasp of the subject, more practice, and subsequently, better performance. In conclusion, a parent’s profession can heavily influence the academic performance or interests of a child. Natalie, being a math teacher, was able to spend quality time with her child, instilling in them an appreciation and understanding of mathematics. Her innate teaching skills, combined with her comprehensive knowledge of the subject, played a significant role in her child's mathematical competence. Remember, while these circumstances provided the child with a distinctive advantage, each child has their unique strengths. Rebecca's profession might have endowed her child with a different set of skills and interests. After all, the beauty of humanity lies in our diversity and individual motivations."},{"question":"Generate a short movie review that has \\"(2).\\" sentiment (Choose your answer from: (1). negative; (2). positive;).","response":"The movie \\"Happy Forest Friends\\" is really, really good and fun!

As a saying that has been passed down through generations, its exact origin is not easy to pinpoint to a specific person, tribe, or time period, but it generally reflects a well-established concept in African culture. This proverb highlights the collective responsibility and involvement of the entire community in the growth and nurturing of children. The central idea behind the saying is that raising a child is not solely the responsibility of the biological parents, but a collective effort involving various members of the community, such as extended family, friends, neighbors, and society in general. The proverb emphasizes the values of cooperation, collaboration, and interdependence within these communities. In many African societies, the shared responsibility for raising children is deeply ingrained and practiced in daily life. Every member of the community is seen as a potential mentor, guide, and caregiver for the younger generation. The proverb \\"It takes a village to raise a child\\" has gained global recognition and relevance due to its universal message. It has been popularized worldwide through speeches, articles, and books by various notable figures, such as former US First Lady Hillary Clinton, who wrote a book titled, \\"It Takes a Village: And Other Lessons Children Teach Us\\" in 1996. In her book, Clinton elaborates on the concept of a comprehensive approach to raising children, emphasizing the importance of creating a supportive and enriching environment for their growth, education, and overall development. The widespread acceptance of this African proverb outside the continent has led to its usage in various social, educational, and advocacy programs worldwide that emphasize the importance of community engagement and collective effort in nurturing children. It also inspires parents and caregivers to involve multiple support systems and role models in a child's life, acknowledging that raising a well-rounded individual is the shared responsibility of the entire community. Despite its African roots, the ideology behind \\"It takes a village to raise a child\\" resonates with multiple cultures and societies across the world. The phrase serves as a powerful metaphor to highlight the critical role communities play in providing the social, emotional, and physical support that children require for their holistic development. As a universally acknowledged notion, it serves as a reminder that the collective efforts of society are not only essential but also incredibly influential in shaping our future generations."},{"question":"How is \\"This is not about one person, it is not about two or three people; it is about the whole college and we should be aware of that.\\" said in Finnish?","response":"In Finnish, the phrase \\"This is not about one person, it is not about two or three people; it is about the whole college and we should be aware of that.\\" can be translated as: \\"Tämä ei ole yhdestä ihmisestä, ei kahdesta tai kolmesta ihmisestä; tämä on koko oppilaitoksen asia, ja meidän tulisi olla tietoisia siitä.\\" Let me break down the translation for you: 1.

Article: Mars Was Not Always Bitterly Cold Scientists at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) have reported evidence that Mars was warmer and wetter long ago than it is today. The Caltech scientists say they have directly _ the temperature of Mars four billion years ago. At least, they established the surface temperature on part of the planet at that time. The researchers say it is the first such evidence to be discovered and presented. The Caltech scientists say carbonate minerals formed on Mars at about eighteen degrees Celsius. They reached the finding after studying a meteorite that had its beginnings near the Martian surface. Today, the average temperature on Mars is sixty-three degrees below zero Celsius. The finding was reported on the website of the National Academy of Sciences. Caltech Assistant Professor Woody Fischer helped to prepare the report. He says eighteen degrees Celsius is not especially cold or hot. He says this makes the finding extremely interesting. Knowing the temperature can give scientists an idea of the climate on Mars long ago. It can also help them decide whether the planet had liquid water. Spacecraft orbiting Mars have shown what appear to be rivers, lakebeds and mineral deposits. These pictures suggest that, at one time, water did flow there. Mars Rover vehicles and other spacecraft have confirmed the information. Caltech Geology Professor John Eiler was another writer of the report. He says knowing the temperature of Mars from long ago provides valuable information. It shows that early in the planet's history, at least part of Mars could support a climate like that of Earth. The meteorite the scientists examined is one of the oldest known rocks in the world. It is called the Allan Hills meteorite. Its name came from the place in Antarctica where it was found in 1984. The meteorite is believed to have blown loose from the Mars' surface when another space rock struck its \\"home.\\" Question: How did Allan Hills meteorite get its name? - From its original place on Mars. - From where it was found on the earth. - From the name of the scientist who found it. - From the name of the aircraft that discovered it Answer:","response":"The Allan Hills meteorite got its name from where it was found on Earth, specifically from the place in Antarctica where it was discovered in 1984."},{"question":"I have been the brunt of cruelty from a doctor a number of times but I will relate one that has always stayed with me since I was a child. I was approximately 8 years and it happened to be summer. Baseball was a true love and my brothers and friends played daily. In the summer, all we wore were cut off jeans and nothing else. I had stepped on a rusty nail and it became infected. Time for a Tetanus shot! This was a typical occurrence for us during the summer. There was only one doctor within a one hundred square mile area and his name was Doctor Brandenbury. He was a very unpleasant, elderly man that my brothers and I did not care for since he was just a mean, old bastard. So I am shuffled off to his office and of course after hearing what had a occurred and examining my foot agreed I needed the Tetanus shot. I make a very innocent request as he is about to give me the shot. Since I knew the shot would stiffen my arm and essentially cause pain I would take it in my left arm so my throwing arm would not be affected. I tried to request this from the doctor but he did not wish to hear anything from me. He said \\"I don't give a fuck what arm you get it in.\\" He grabbed me roughly by the right arm and used the needle like a dart and just slammed it into my arm. I had never had a problem with shots before but that REALLY hurt. I started crying.

The band has gone through a number of personnel changes but has remained centered on Dylan. After releasing their eponymous debut album in 1992, the Wallflowers released what would become their best-known and highest-selling album, Bringing Down the Horse in 1996, which featured songs such as \\"One Headlight\\" and \\"6th Avenue Heartache\\". They went on to release an additional three albums before going on a seven-year hiatus, beginning in 2006. In July 2004, the Wallflowers returned to the studio to record their fifth album, Rebel, Sweetheart. This time the band decided to record in Atlanta, Georgia, which is where their producer for this album, Brendan O'Brien, is based. O'Brien also contributed on guitar. Fred Eltringham joined the Wallflowers as their new drummer. Jakob Dylan wrote the songs, of which keyboardist Rami Jaffee has said: \\"What I did notice is that kind of upbeat song with some pretty scary lyrics.\\" Dylan painted the album's cover art himself. On October 14, 2004, the Warren Zevon tribute album Enjoy Every Sandwich: The Songs of Warren Zevon was released, on which the Wallflowers covered Zevon's 1978 song \\"Lawyers, Guns and Money.\\" In promotion of the album, the Wallflowers performed \\"Lawyers, Guns and Money\\" on the Late Show with David Letterman with Zevon's son, Jordan, on October 12, 2004. On October 31, 2004, the Wallflowers were flown via military transport plane to the USS John C. Stennis aircraft carrier in the middle of the Pacific Ocean to perform for the returning troops. Rebel, Sweetheart was released on May 24, 2005, and was met with positive reviews. Despite widespread critical acclaim, Rebel, Sweetheart performed relatively poorly commercially, peaking at No. 40 on the Billboard 200. However, the first single from the album, \\"The Beautiful Side of Somewhere\\", hit No. 5 on AAA radio. The second single was \\"God Says Nothing Back\\". This was the first Wallflowers album to be released on DualDisc. On one side was the album, and on the other was a DVD that included exclusive performances and arrangements of some of the band's songs, as well as an interview with comedian Jon Lovitz. In promotion of the album, the Wallflowers did concerts for the Oxygen Custom Concert Series and PBS Soundstage. Around the time of the album's release, the band set out on what would be their last tour for two years. They were joined by Stuart Mathis on lead guitar. After 2005, the Wallflowers ended their relationship with Interscope Records. What did they try next","response":"After the release of their fifth album, Rebel, Sweetheart, in 2005 and the end of their relationship with Interscope Records, the Wallflowers went through a period of transition. For the first time in their career, they found themselves operating independently. This circumstance led them to explore new opportunities and ventures in the music industry. Following their 2005 tour and subsequent departure from Interscope Records, the Wallflowers took a hiatus from recording and touring as a band. During this time, individual members pursued different projects to further develop their skills and gain new experiences outside of the band's framework. Jakob Dylan, the band's frontman and main songwriter, took the opportunity to work on his solo career. In 2008, he released his first solo album, Seeing Things, under Columbia Records. The album saw Dylan exploring a more acoustic and folk-influenced sound, showcasing his versatility as a musician. He followed that with another solo album in 2010, titled Women and Country, which garnered positive reviews from critics. Meanwhile, other members of the Wallflowers also engaged in various side projects. Rami Jaffee, the band's keyboardist, became a sought-after session musician, working with music legends such as Foo Fighters and Stone Sour. Drummer Fred Eltringham and guitarist Stuart Mathis also collaborated with other artists, expanding their musical horizons. Despite the individual successes, the Wallflowers couldn't resist the pull of reuniting as a band. They ended their seven-year hiatus in 2012 and released their sixth studio album, Glad All Over, under Columbia Records. The album featured guest appearances from artists like Mick Jones of The Clash and saw the band experiment with new sounds and styles. In the years that followed, the Wallflowers continued to tour and perform together, proving that their resilient spirit and determination to evolve had successfully guided them through the industry's challenges. Their willingness to take risks and adapt to new circumstances allowed them to forge ahead and establish a lasting legacy in the world of rock music."},{"question":"If I tell you that Lochs are bigger and deeper than ponds, and ask you the question \\"what is larger than ponds?\\", is the correct answer \\"rivers\\"? Options: [A]. Yes; [B]. No;","response":"[B]. No; While it is true that lochs are larger and deeper than ponds, the correct answer for the question \\"what is larger than ponds?\\" is not \\"rivers.\\" A misconception may occur because lochs as a type of lakes can be considered larger than ponds, but rivers are not inherently larger than ponds. Ponds and rivers are both bodies of water, but they differ in size, form, and characteristics. A pond is a small, shallow body of standing water, usually with a surface area less than ten acres. Ponds form in depressions within landscapes, and they often have slow water movement or are entirely still. Due to their small size and shallow depth, ponds often have a uniform temperature throughout. They also can be temporary or permanent, depending on the local climate and environmental conditions. Rivers, on the other hand, are larger, moving bodies of water that flow from high to low elevation. Rivers usually start as small streams and can grow in size as they are fed by tributaries along their course. They can vary significantly in size, with some rivers being only a few feet wide and others spanning several miles in width. Rivers have a more substantial water volume and generally create deeper and more extensive channels than ponds. However, it would be incorrect to assume that rivers are always larger than ponds. There are some small rivers and large ponds, with the latter having a larger surface area or volume of water compared to the former. Also, rivers and ponds are distinct types of water bodies that serve different purposes within ecosystems and human activity. Instead, an appropriate answer for \\"what is larger than ponds?\\" would be \\"lakes\\" or \\"lochs,\\" depending on the region. Lakes and lochs are standing, freshwater bodies that are larger and deeper than ponds. They can vary significantly in size, from just an acre to thousands of square miles. Lakes and lochs form in basins or valleys and are often the result of tectonic or glacial activity. These larger bodies of water can have more considerable ecological, recreational, and economic value due to their size and depth, providing habitat to various aquatic species and opportunities for human use."},{"question":"James didn't know what to do.

First we are swept into a massive action sequence with a Klingon being chased by some Suliban (who are the main enemy in the first season of the show). From there the televised movie takes us on a journey that seldom gets as good as it is, with some of the best character development, story and action/visual effects ever seen in such a short amount of time. The opening-credits is a debatable subject among the minority of Enterprise fans, whom some believe that the song is out of place. What they fail to realise is the lyrics themselves. If one listens to the actual song, instead of the theme, then they will begin to piece the parts of the puzzle together. And eventually as the series progresses further and further, and we learn more about our valiant captain and his crew, will the song actually become meaningful. Overall Diane Warren's theme is beautifully orchestrated and is sung just as well by opera singer Russell Watson. What makes any television show watchable and worth watching time and time again is its characters and the way they become structured and layered. Enterprise is (in my opinion) one of the most well cast shows since The Next Generation. Choosing Scott Bakula, as Captain Jonathan Archer was the best decision since Gene himself cast Patrick Stewart as Jean-Luc Picard. As the captain always leads the show, Bakula adds a subtlety to his role and brings a huge smile to the faces of anyone with blood pumping in their veins. He simply is (both actor wise and character wise) a superb human being and his charm, wit, and compassion are overwhelming to watch. As for the other cast members, a favourite of mine is John Billingsley who plays Dr. Phlox. It's also nice to see a non-human playing a role, and the decision to give the captain a dog, named 'Porthos' was a well-received idea. Throughout the show character development was brilliant, it was fast, well timed and almost perfect. I say almost because sadly Travis Mayweather's character played by the Briton Anthony Montgomery is a little weak at the end of the first season. He does have some things to say here and there, but remains in the hands of the producers to make him more important. Jolene Blalock is wonderful as the sometimes harsh but equally loveable Subcommander T'Pol. Dominic Keating as Lieutenant Malcolm Reed plays a strong role and is convincing as the armoury officer. Connor Trinneer plays Commander Charles \\"Trip\\" Tucker who always adds charm and comedic style to his character and finally Linda Park as Ensign Hoshi Sato, who often plays a weaker character but thankfully quickly becomes interesting. All of these characters make up Enterprise, and all bring a quality that Star Trek hasn't seen in a long time. Each person makes this show worth watching. Smiles and feel-good senses are guaranteed right from the first time we see them all together on the bridge of the starship Enterprise NX-01. The ship itself, the NX-01 is somewhat questionable in design. The series is set 150 years from now and 100 years before Captain Kirk. So why then does the ship appear to be similar in design to mid 24th century ships, namely the Akira class starship? Continuity has been an issue in Enterprise, but thankfully Rick [Berman] and Brannon [Braga] offer suitable explanations for each and everyone of them. Continuity is only a problem if you are forever scrutinising shows and are obsessed with the tiniest of details. If you see the show with and open mind, then you'll have no problems, but there is an urge to know 'why' all the time. So what did Berman and Braga offer to the Star Trek fan-base with the issue of the deign of the ship itself? According to them the NX-01 is how it is because of the incident in First Contact. When Zefram Cochrane saw the Enterprise-E through his telescope and from speaking with the away team lead by Commander Riker, it changed the ideas in his head. That's a good enough explanation for me.lets move on. Of course its not as easy for some fans to accept that sort of answer, some go as far as to refuse to see the show until they get a reasonable answer. Come on guys grow up.When George Lucas destroyed the Star Wars saga with the launch of his profit making new trilogy, fans couldn't do anything, only watch and sap it all up anyway. And then they learned that, well maybe its not that bad after all. If you can't accept a quality show for what it is, not what it should be in your mind, then go elsewhere. Or try becoming a producer on the show and then see what you can do. The sets on Enterprise remind me very much of the Defiant from Deep Space Nine. They often appear cold and have an eerie look of modern structure to them and they cry out that they belong to the military. Perhaps that why the crew of the USS Enterprise (aka flagship of the American fleet) like it so much. They are striking sets, and represent the show perfectly. Rick Berman 'the overlord of the empire' as John Logan so accurately put it and his counterpart Brannon Braga has hit the nail on the head exactly where they should have, and in all the right places. Whether that be technicalities, visuals, sound, editing or score. Enterprise is a fine demonstration to just how good televised science fiction can ultimately be, when in the hands of geniuses.

The early Austrian attack surprised the French; Napoleon himself was still in Paris when he heard about the invasion. He arrived at Donauwörth on the 17th to find the Grande Armée in a dangerous position, with its two wings separated by 75 miles (121 km) and joined together by a thin cordon of Bavarian troops. Charles pressed the left wing of the French army and hurled his men towards the III Corps of Marshal Davout. In response, Napoleon came up with a plan to cut off the Austrians in the celebrated Landshut Maneuver. He realigned the axis of his army and marched his soldiers towards the town of Eckmühl. The French scored a convincing win in the resulting Battle of Eckmühl, forcing Charles to withdraw his forces over the Danube and into Bohemia. On 13 May, Vienna fell for the second time in four years, although the war continued since most of the Austrian army had survived the initial engagements in Southern Germany.\\". Can you tell me what it is? Answer:","response":"The region where the Austrian and French armies confronted each other was primarily in Southern Germany and parts of Austria during the early stages of the War of the Fifth Coalition in 1809. The conflict began when Austrian forces crossed the Inn River and invaded Bavaria on April 10. Napoleon's Grande Armée, which was initially caught off guard due to the surprise attack, had its two wings separated by 75 miles and only connected by a thin cordon of Bavarian troops. Austrian forces, led by Archduke Charles, targeted the left wing of the French army, specifically Marshal Davout's III Corps. In response to this threat, Napoleon, who had recently arrived at Donauwörth, devised the Landshut Maneuver, which aimed to cut off the Austrians and change the axis of his army. This strategic move led French forces to march towards the town of Eckmühl, where they scored a critical victory against the Austrian army in the Battle of Eckmühl. Following this defeat, Charles had to withdraw his forces across the Danube and into Bohemia. Eventually, on May 13, the French captured Vienna for the second time in four years. However, the war continued as a considerable portion of the Austrian army had survived the initial confrontations in Southern Germany. In summary, the region where the Austrian and French armies confronted each other during the War of the Fifth Coalition was primarily in Southern Germany and parts of Austria, specifically in the territories of Bavaria and along the Danube River."},{"question":"Translate \\"Belgrade analysts think that Serbia's participation in peacekeeping missions is useful for its reputation.\\" to Turkish?","response":"To translate the sentence \\"Belgrade analysts think that Serbia's participation in peacekeeping missions is useful for its reputation.\\" to Turkish, I should carefully translate each part of it while maintaining the structure and meaning. 1. \\"Belgrade analysts think\\": This segment would translate to \\"Belgrat analistleri düşünüyor ki\\" 2. \\"Serbia's participation in peacekeeping missions\\": This translates to \\"Sırbistan'ın barışı koruma görevleri\\" or more accurately \\"Sırbistan'ın barışı koruma görevlerine katılımı\\" 3. \\"is useful for its reputation.\\": This translates to \\"itibarı için yararlıdır.\\" Combine all parts and the whole sentence is: \\"Belgrat analistleri düşünüyor ki, Sırbistan'ın barışı koruma görevlerine katılımı itibarı için yararlıdır.\\" Note that in Turkish, expressions and sentence structures can be very different compared to English.

The people in Mexico have always loved eating spicy, tasty foods, and salsa is a perfect example! They created salsa to add extra flavor and spice to their meals. Because this yummy sauce was first made in Mexico and is mainly used in Mexican cuisine, we call it a Mexican dish. Question 3: Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? No, these two questions are not paraphrases of each other. The first question asks for a recipe for a specific type of salsa, while the second question asks why salsa is considered a Mexican dish.

The school received an astonishing number of applications (four for each spot), which meant that many kids spent their days playing computer games and that many parents wanted time for themselves. To be accepted, young candidates had to demonstrate their social and psychological maturity and computer instincts, evaluated according to a patented method developed by Mr. Jedynak. The parents, on the other hand, had to pass an exam in using a joystick and provide a proof of income of at least 7000 zloty per month for a young family member.

It has a distinct four-season continental climate with warm to hot summers and cold snowy winters. - A lyricist or lyrist is a person who writes lyricswords for songsas opposed to a composer, who writes the song's melody. - Dance-pop is a pop and dance subgenre that originated in the early 1980s. It is generally up-tempo music intended for nightclubs with the intention of being danceable but also suitable for contemporary hit radio. Developing from a combination of electronic dance music and pop music, with influences of disco music, post-disco, new wave, synthpop, electropop and house, it is generally characterised by strong beats with easy, uncomplicated song structures which are generally more similar to pop music than the more free-form dance genre, with an emphasis on melody as well as catchy tunes.

In this instance, the word \\"alternative\\" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream rock music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, \\"alternative\\" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk). - Canada (French: ) is a country in the northern half of North America. Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering , making it the world's second-largest country by total area and the fourth-largest country by land area. Canada's border with the United States is the world's longest land border. The majority of the country has a cold or severely cold winter climate, but southerly areas are warm in summer. Canada is sparsely populated, the majority of its land territory being dominated by forest and tundra and the Rocky Mountains. About four-fifths of the country's population of 36 million people is urbanized and live near the southern border. Its capital is Ottawa, its largest city is Toronto; other major urban areas include Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Quebec City, Winnipeg and Hamilton. - Jagged Little Pill is the third studio album and international debut album by Canadian singer Alanis Morissette, first released on June 13, 1995, through Maverick Records. Morissette had released two successful albums in Canada, after which she left MCA Records Canada and was introduced to manager Scott Welch. Morissette began work on her next album after moving from her hometown, Ottawa, to Toronto; she did not make much progress until she traveled to Los Angeles, where she met Glen Ballard. Morissette and Ballard had an instant connection, and began co-writing and experimenting with sounds. - FOREST (short for \\"Freedom Organisation for the Right to Enjoy Smoking Tobacco\\") is a United Kingdom political pressure group which campaigns against tobacco control activity. - A songwriter is an individual who writes the lyrics, melodies and chord progressions for songs, typically for a popular music genre such as rock or country music. A songwriter can also be called a composer, although the latter term tends to be used mainly for individuals from the classical music genre. The pressure from the music industry to produce popular hits means that songwriting is often an activity for which the tasks are distributed between a number of people. For example, a songwriter who excels at writing lyrics might be paired with a songwriter with a gift for creating original melodies. Pop songs may be written by group members from the band or by staff writers songwriters directly employed by music publishers. Some songwriters serve as their own music publishers, while others have outside publishers. - A Grammy Award (originally called Gramophone Award), or Grammy, is an honor awarded by The Recording Academy to recognize outstanding achievement in the mainly English-language music industry.

Options: - closed container - art room - sticky - desk drawer - cabinet Hmmm, let me think.","response":"The best option for keeping glue usable is in a closed container. Let me explain why: - A closed container provides an airtight seal, preventing the glue from drying out and maintaining its adhesive properties. - An art room may expose the glue to air, dust, or varying temperatures, which could affect its shelf life and performance. - \\"Sticky\\" is not a location, but rather a property of glue itself. - A desk drawer or cabinet may seem like decent storage options; however, they do not provide an airtight seal that would protect glue from drying out. Therefore, a closed container is the ideal location to keep glue usable, as it offers the best protection against environmental factors that could adversely affect the glue."},{"question":"Given the question: If the rarity of a species increases harm to population exponentially, then if a species is rare, harm to it's population increases or decreases?

Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - Nebraska is a state that lies in both the Great Plains and the Midwestern United States. The state is bordered by South Dakota to the north, Iowa to the east and Missouri to the southeast, both across the Missouri River, Kansas to the south, Colorado to the southwest and Wyoming to the west. Its area is just over 77,220 sq mi (200,000 km) with almost 1.9 million people. Its state capital is Lincoln. Its largest city is Omaha, which is on the Missouri River. - A tributary or affluent is a stream or river that flows into a larger stream or main stem (or parent) river or a lake. A tributary does not flow directly into a sea or ocean. Tributaries and the main stem river drain the surrounding drainage basin of its surface water and groundwater, leading the water out into an ocean. - The Platte River is a major river in the state of Nebraska and is about long. Measured to its farthest source via its tributary the North Platte River, it flows for over . The Platte River is a tributary of the Missouri River, which itself is a tributary of the Mississippi River which flows to the Gulf of Mexico. The Platte over most of its length is a muddy, broad, shallow, meandering stream with a swampy bottom and many islandsa braided stream. These characteristics made it too difficult for canoe travel, and it was never used as a major navigation route by European-American trappers or explorers. - Papillion Creek is a 15.5 - mile - long ( 24.9 km ) tributary of the Missouri River in Nebraska . Its watershed lies in Washington , Douglas and Sarpy counties , including parts of the city of Omaha . The main branch of Papillion Creek is known as Big Papillion Creek . Some of the tributaries include Little Papillion Creek , Thomas Creek , Cole Creek , Northwest Branch of West Papillion Creek , West Papillion Creek and South Papillion Creek . Papillion Creek empties into the Missouri River south of Bellevue and just north of the mouth of the Platte River . Locals often refer to the creek as the \`\` Papio Creek '' . Within its watershed lie Glenn Cunningham Lake , Standing Bear Lake , Zorinsky Lake and Wehrspann Lake at the Chalco Hills Recreation Area , which were created by the Army Corps of Engineers in the aftermath of extensive flooding in 1964 and 1965 . - Groundwater (or ground water) is the water present beneath Earth's surface in soil pore spaces and in the fractures of rock formations. A unit of rock or an unconsolidated deposit is called an aquifer when it can yield a usable quantity of water. The depth at which soil pore spaces or fractures and voids in rock become completely saturated with water is called the water table. Groundwater is recharged from, and eventually flows to, the surface naturally; natural discharge often occurs at springs and seeps, and can form oases or wetlands. Groundwater is also often withdrawn for agricultural, municipal, and industrial use by constructing and operating extraction wells. The study of the distribution and movement of groundwater is hydrogeology, also called groundwater hydrology. - The Gulf of Mexico is an ocean basin largely surrounded by the North American continent. It is bounded on the northeast, north and northwest by the Gulf Coast of the United States, on the southwest and south by Mexico, and on the southeast by Cuba. The U.S. states of Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas border the Gulf on the north, which are often referred to as the \\"Third Coast\\" in comparison with the U.S. Atlantic and Pacific coasts, or sometimes the \\"south coast\\", in juxtaposition to the Great Lakes region being the \\"north coast.\\" One of the gulf's seven main areas is the Gulf of Mexico basin. - \\"Main Stem\\" is 1942 instrumental by Duke Ellington and His Famous Orchestra. Although recorded in 1942, the single would not be released until 1944 where it was Duke Ellington's last of four number one's on the Harlem Hit Parade. \\"Main Stem\\" also peaked at number twenty on the pop chart. - Montana is a state in the Western region of the United States. The state's name is derived from the Spanish word (mountain). Montana has several nicknames, although none official, including \\"Big Sky Country\\" and \\"The Treasure State\\", and slogans that include \\"Land of the Shining Mountains\\" and more recently \\"The Last Best Place\\". Montana has a border with three Canadian provinces: British Columbia, Alberta, and Saskatchewan, the only state to do so. It also borders North Dakota and South Dakota to the east, Wyoming to the south, and Idaho to the west and southwest. Montana is ranked 4th in size, but 44th in population and 48th in population density of the 50 United States. The western third of Montana contains numerous mountain ranges. Smaller island ranges are found throughout the state. In total, 77 named ranges are part of the Rocky Mountains. The eastern half of Montana is characterized by western prairie terrain and badlands. - Missouri (see pronunciations) is a state in the Midwestern region of the United States, achieving statehood in 1821. With over six million residents, it is the eighteenth most populous state and host to the mean center of United States population. The largest urban areas are St. Louis, Kansas City, Springfield, and Columbia. The capitol is in Jefferson City on the Missouri River. The state is the twenty-first most extensive by area and is geographically diverse. The Northern Plains were once covered by glaciers, then tallgrass prairie, and now the deep soils yield great agricultural productivity. In the South are the Ozarks, a forested highland, providing timber, minerals, and recreation. The Mississippi River forms the eastern border of the state, eventually flowing into the swampy Missouri Bootheel. - The Midwestern United States, also referred to as the American Midwest or simply the Midwest, is one of the four geographic regions defined by the United States Census Bureau, occupying the northern central part of the United States of America. It was officially named the North Central region by the Census Bureau until 1984. - The Great Plains is the broad expanse of flat land (a plain), much of it covered in prairie, steppe and grassland, that lies west of the Mississippi River tallgrass prairie states and east of the Rocky Mountains in the United States and Canada. This area covers parts, but not all, of the states of Colorado, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, and Wyoming, Minnesota, Iowa and the Canadian provinces of Alberta, Manitoba and Saskatchewan. The region is known for supporting extensive cattle ranching and dry farming. - The North Platte River is a major tributary of the Platte River and is approximately long counting its many curves. It travels about distance. Its course lies in the U.S. states of Colorado, Wyoming, and Nebraska. - A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, sea, lake or another river. In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague. - A lake is an area of variable size filled with water, localized in a basin, that is surrounded by land, apart from any river or other outlet that serves to feed or drain the lake. Lakes lie on land and are not part of the ocean, and therefore are distinct from lagoons, and are also larger and deeper than ponds, though there are no official or scientific definitions. Lakes can be contrasted with rivers or streams, which are usually flowing. Most lakes are fed and drained by rivers and streams. - The Missouri River is the longest river in North America. Rising in the Rocky Mountains of western Montana, the Missouri flows east and south for before entering the Mississippi River north of St. Louis, Missouri. The river takes drainage from a sparsely populated, semi-arid watershed of more than half a million square miles (1,300,000 km), which includes parts of ten U.S. states and two Canadian provinces. When combined with the lower Mississippi River, it forms the world's fourth longest river system. - South Dakota is a state located in the Midwestern region of the United States. It is named after the Lakota and Dakota Sioux Native American tribes, who compose a significant portion of the population and historically dominated the entire territory. South Dakota is the 17th most expansive, but the 5th least populous and the 5th least densely populated of the 50 United States. Once the southern portion of the Dakota Territory, South Dakota became a state on November 2, 1889, simultaneously with North Dakota. Pierre is the state capital and Sioux Falls, with a population of about 171,000, is South Dakota's largest city. - The Mississippi River is the chief river of the largest drainage system on the North American continent. Flowing entirely in the United States (although its drainage basin reaches into Canada), it rises in northern Minnesota and meanders slowly southwards for to the Mississippi River Delta at the Gulf of Mexico. With its many tributaries, the Mississippi's watershed drains all or parts of 31 U.S. states and 2 Canadian provinces between the Rocky and Appalachian Mountains. The Mississippi ranks as the fourth longest and fifteenth largest river in the world by discharge. The river either borders or passes through the states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana. - Colorado is a state in the United States encompassing most of the Southern Rocky Mountains as well as the northeastern portion of the Colorado Plateau and the western edge of the Great Plains. Colorado is part of the Western United States, the Southwestern United States, and the Mountain States. Colorado is the 8th most extensive and the 22nd most populous of the 50 United States. The United States Census Bureau estimates that the population of Colorado was 5,456,574 on July 1, 2015, an increase of 8.50% since the 2010 United States Census. - The Rocky Mountains, commonly known as the Rockies, are a major mountain range in western North America. The Rocky Mountains stretch more than from the northernmost part of British Columbia, in western Canada, to New Mexico, in the southwestern United States. Within the North American Cordillera, the Rockies are somewhat distinct from the Pacific Coast Ranges and the Cascade Range and Sierra Nevada which all lie further to the west. - Kansas is a U.S. state located in the Midwestern United States. Its capital is Topeka and its largest city is Wichita. Kansas is named after the Kansa Native American tribe, which inhabited the area. The tribe's name (natively \\"\\") is often said to mean \\"people of the wind\\" or \\"people of the south wind\\", although this was probably not the term's original meaning. For thousands of years, what is now Kansas was home to numerous and diverse Native American tribes. Tribes in the eastern part of the state generally lived in villages along the river valleys. Tribes in the western part of the state were semi-nomadic and hunted large herds of bison. - A stream is a body of water with a current, confined within a bed and banks. Depending on its location or certain characteristics, a stream may be referred to as a \\"bayou\\", \\"beck\\", \\"branch\\", \\"brook\\", \\"burn\\", \\"creek\\", \\"crick\\", \\"ghyll\\", \\"gill\\", \\"kill\\", \\"lick\\", \\"mill race\\", \\"race\\", \\"rill\\", \\"river\\", \\"rivulet\\", \\"run\\", \\"runnel\\", \\"streamage\\", \\"syke\\", or \\"wash\\". - A drainage basin or catchment basin is an extent or an area of land where all surface water from rain, melting snow, or ice converges to a single point at a lower elevation, usually the exit of the basin, where the waters join another body of water, such as a river, lake, reservoir, estuary, wetland, sea, or ocean. Thus if a tributary stream joins a brook that in turn joins a small river which is a tributary of a larger river, there is a series of successively larger (and lower elevation) drainage basins. For instance, the Missouri and Ohio rivers are within their own drainage basins and also within the drainage basin of the Mississippi River. - Wyoming is a state in the mountain region of the western United States. The state is the tenth largest by area, the least populous and the second least densely populated state in the country. Wyoming is bordered on the north by Montana, on the east by South Dakota and Nebraska, on the south by Colorado, on the southwest by Utah, and on the west by Idaho. Cheyenne is the capital and the most populous city in Wyoming, with a population estimate of 63,335 in 2015. The state population was estimated at 586,107 in 2015, which is less than the population of 31 of the largest U.S. cities.

Three of the victims are connected to the university's famed football program. NBC's Thanh Truong reports. Updated at 3:05 p.m. ET: Three people were killed and three others wounded in a shooting during a party at an apartment complex near Auburn University, Alabama authorities said Sunday. Among the dead were two Auburn students who had been on the football team. A manhunt was underway Sunday for suspected gunman, identified by police as Desmonte Leonard, 22, of Montgomery, Ala. The dead were Edward Christian, 20, a football player who was out this season due to injuries; Ladarious Phillips, 20, a former football player; and Demario Pitts, 20, of Auburn. The shooting happened late Saturday night at the University Heights apartments, a large complex near campus where many of Auburn University's students and athletes live. Leonard is suspected of pulling a gun after a fight broke out, shooting six before fleeing, Auburn Police Chief Tommy Dawson said at a news conference on Sunday. When police arrived, Christian was found dead on the sidewalk. Phillips and Pitts were transported to the hospital, where they later died. Among the three wounded is John Robertson, 20, who is fighting for his life after being shot in the head, Dawson said at a news conference on Sunday afternoon. Xavier Moss, 19, was released from the hospital and Eric Mack, 20, was being treated for non-life-threatening injuries. David Goldman / AP Mourners walk out of a housing complex Sunday at the scene of an overnight shooting in Auburn, Ala. Police believe Leonard drove away from the scene in a white Chevrolet Caprice, which was later found abandoned. \\"I don't believe it was targeted. It was a fight and someone got carried away,\\" Dawson said of the shooting. \\"I don't like the word random when it comes to shootings, but it was a fight that obviously got out of hand.\\" Asked about connections to the football team, Dawson said, \\"The only connection to the football team is that they are the victims of a brutal shooting. Sometimes the young men get a bad rap, I feel, but they're the victims today.\\" \\"This is a sad, sad day for everyone associated with the entire Auburn family. I am devastated by the passing of three young men, including two that I personally knew in Ed Christian and Ladarious Phillips and my heart goes out to their families,\\" Auburn coach Coach Gene Chizik said in a statement. \\"My thoughts and prayers are with their families and all of the victims involved in this tragic incident. Nobody should ever have to endure such unimaginable grief, and we will love and support the victims' families during this terribly difficult time. We have a lot of people on our football team that are hurting right now and we're going to do everything we can to help them get through this.\\" AP Photo/Auburn Police Division This undated photo provided by the Auburn Police Division shows Desmonte Leonard, 22, of Montgomery, Ala., the suspect wanted for fatally shooting three people, including two former Auburn University football players, and wounding another three people during a party at an apartment complex near the school.

Christian and Phillips were former football players. Demario Pitts, 20, of Auburn, also died. Mack, the wounded player, is a junior offensive lineman from St. Matthews, S.C. He played in five games last season. Chizik said Mack was expected to make a full recovery. Christian was an offensive lineman who was out last season while dealing with a back injury. Phillips was a backup fullback. Chizik said in April that Phillips had decided to give up football. \\"We're deeply saddened about last night's tragic events that impacted the Auburn community and the Auburn family.

The building was swathed in yellow police tape. It appeared that the shooting happened in an archway near the apartment complex information center, near the edge of the parking lot. Five uniformed officers guarded the area, which was sealed off with crime scene tape, and a handful of crime scene investigators were at work. After daybreak Sunday, several uniformed officers stood near a disaster relief trailer parked at the building's entrance, which appeared to be a sort of command center. Some bystanders milled about, looking on at the scene. An Auburn police dispatcher contacted by The Associated Press said early Sunday she had no immediate information. Police did not immediately return repeated telephone messages seeking comment. Auburn University campus police said they had no information and referred calls to city police. Vasha Hunt, a photographer with the Opelika-Auburn News, was at the apartment complex hours earlier and told the AP by telephone before dawn that authorities had set up a white tent there where there was a lot of activity. He said police kept a number of bystanders back for hours away from the scene. Hunt said at least some of those who initially gathered outside appeared to be residents waiting for permission to enter their apartments. ___ Associated Press writers Bob Johnson and John Zenor contributed to this report. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","response":"Three people were killed and three others injured during a shooting at a party near Auburn University in Alabama.

The cease-and-desist notice accuses Mr Bannon of defaming the president in speaking to author Michael Wolff. Wolff's forthcoming tell-all book makes several startling claims, and questions Mr Trump's fitness for office. The president responded by saying Mr Bannon had \\"lost his mind\\" after losing his White House position. His lawyers said Mr Bannon had broken his employment agreement by speaking to Wolff about Mr Trump, his family and the campaign, \\"disclosing confidential information\\" and \\"making disparaging statements and in some cases outright defamatory statements\\". On his radio show on Wednesday, Mr Bannon responded to the president's criticism by saying he was a \\"great man\\". \\"You know, I support him day in and day out,\\" he said on the show produced by right-wing Breitbart News, which he heads. The book is reportedly based on more than 200 interviews. On Thursday, the Hollywood Reporter published Wolff's behind-the-scenes account. He concluded that everyone he had spoken to was in agreement in their view on Mr Trump: \\"They all - 100 percent - came to believe he was incapable of functioning in his job\\". What's in the book?

Mr Blair told the BBC Today programme the story was \\"complete fabrication, from beginning to end\\". He said he had discussed the Middle East peace process with Mr Kushner but denied angling for work. Who is Michael Wolff? The 64-year-old writer is a former columnist for New York magazine and Vanity Fair. Image copyright Alamy Image caption Michael Wolff has written a number of books about the media According to New York magazine, which first published the extracts, Wolff was able to exploit the Trump administration's political inexperience to gain an unusual amount of insight. Wolff said he was able to take up \\"something like a semi-permanent seat on a couch in the West Wing\\" following the president's inauguration. However, some of the book's excerpts have already been criticised and questioned. The Washington Post said Wolff was a \\"provocateur and media polemicist\\", and that his reporting had been questioned before.

A spokesperson for Melania Trump said the First Lady had encouraged her husband's presidential bid. \\"She was confident he would win and was very happy when he did,\\" she said on Wednesday. What's being said in Bannon's defence? Aside from the radio comment, Mr Bannon has not spoken publicly about the book, the president's comments or the legal action. However, in an interview with BBC Newsnight, Raheem Kassam - UK editor of Breitbart News - said the Wolff interviews could have been taken out of context. He also said Mr Bannon was well-placed to comment on the Russia controversy, having served in the US Navy. \\"He understands what the geopolitical threat is...\\" said Mr Kassam. \\"So when he remarks that these people shouldn't probably have been in Trump Tower taking meetings with senior campaign staff without lawyers in the room, I would say that is a fair thing to say.\\" An inevitable break-up Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington Donald Trump swept to the presidency in part on the back of Steve Bannon and his Breitbart conservative media empire. Now we will see how he fares when he is at war with them. The president's blistering reply to Mr Bannon's comments appears to indicate that the bridge between the politician and his ideological spirit guide has been reduced to cinders. But how will Mr Trump's legion of supporters react? It is never wise to underestimate their dedication to the man himself, above all else. No matter the outcome of this coming battle, this has to be viewed as a devastating failure for Mr Bannon personally. After spending years advocating for an anti-establishment conservative populism, he finally had a seat in the halls of power. He said in early 2017 that his goal was nothing short of the \\"deconstruction of the administrative state\\". Now he is on the outside again, besieged by long-time antagonists and former allies. His president recently signed a tax bill embraced by corporate interests. His first post-2016 foray into elective politics, the Alabama Senate race, ended in humiliating defeat. Perhaps, given all this, the Bannon-Trump feud was as inevitable as it is certain to be vicious. ||||| What is a summary?","response":"Former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon has reiterated his support for President Donald Trump after the president criticized Bannon for his comments in a forthcoming book by journalist Michael Wolff.

Bowie's songs and stagecraft brought a new dimension to popular music in the early 1970s, strongly influencing both its immediate forms and its subsequent development. Bowie was a pioneer of glam rock, according to music historians Schinder and Schwartz, who credited Marc Bolan and Bowie with creating the genre.

Many economists make the case that this understates the magnitude of growth, as many of the goods and services consumed at the end of the 20th century, such as improved medicine (causing world life expectancy to increase by more than two decades) and communications technologies, were not available at any price at its beginning. However, the gulf between the world's rich and poor grew wider, and the majority of the global population remained in the poor side of the divide.\\" Answer: The answer to this question is:","response":"One significant advantage in the 20th century regarding products was the rapid development and advancements in technology, which led to a dramatic increase in the availability, affordability, and variety of goods and services. This improvement profoundly impacted various aspects of life, such as economics, healthcare, and communication. These changes were mainly driven by factors such as industrialization, globalization, and innovation, contributing to unprecedented growth in the world's per-capita gross domestic product (GDP). Firstly, advancements and improvements in manufacturing and production processes during the 20th century facilitated the mass production of goods. The widespread implementation of assembly lines, automation, and efficient supply chain management reduced the production time and cost of various products, making them more accessible and affordable for a larger number of consumers. This increase in affordability boosted demand for goods and services, fostering greater economic growth and overall prosperity. Secondly, the 20th century witnessed tremendous progress in healthcare and medicine that led to the development of new treatments, vaccines, and diagnostic techniques. This progress contributed to increased life expectancy across the globe, as more people could access and benefit from improved healthcare products and services. For example, the development of antibiotics such as penicillin revolutionized the treatment of bacterial infections, which drastically reduced mortality rates worldwide. Thirdly, the invention and rapid expansion of communication technologies during the 20th century played a significant role in the proliferation of products. Devices such as telephones, radios, televisions, and computers, along with the establishment of global communication networks, enabled the rapid exchange of information, ideas, and innovations. This process spurred the diffusion of new products, technologies, and services across the globe, allowing consumers to access products that were previously inaccessible or unknown to them. Moreover, a significant advantage of the 20th century was the rise of globalization, which facilitated the cross-border flow of goods, services, and capital. The dismantling of trade barriers, the expansion of international trade agreements, and the liberalization of financial markets allowed products to reach markets that were previously inaccessible. As a result, companies could significantly expand their customer base, while consumers gained access to a greater variety of goods and services at competitive prices. However, despite these tremendous advantages, the 20th century also witnessed a widening gap between the rich and the poor. Rapid technological advancements and globalization benefitted certain segments of the population more than others, resulting in unequal access to the benefits of economic growth and development. The majority of the global population remained on the poorer side of the divide, struggling with issues related to poverty, lack of access to essential resources, and inadequate living conditions. In conclusion, the 20th century brought about several advantages concerning products and services, including mass production, advancements in healthcare and medicine, improved communication technologies, and the rise of globalization. These factors contributed to the proliferation of goods and services, faster economic growth, and improved living standards. However, the advantages were not always evenly distributed, leading to a growing disparity between the rich and the poor, which remains a challenge that needs to be addressed to optimize the advantages of technology and global development for all citizens."},{"question":"Write the next sentence. Beth's put her art in a gallery instead of a museum because the Available options: (a). gallery thought her art wasn't classy.; (b). museum thought her art wasn't classy.; Answer:","response":"(b). museum thought her art wasn't classy. Beth's decision to showcase her art in a gallery rather than a museum was a difficult yet necessary choice, primarily driven by the museum's perception of her art as not quite fitting their criteria of \\"classiness.\\" Despite the potential prestige and exposure offered by the museum, Beth ultimately recognized the importance of honoring her artistic vision and finding a space where her work would be appreciated for its authentic expression, unique approach, and thought-provoking concepts. The museum's dismissal of her art based on a somewhat arbitrary standard of classiness highlighted a broader issue within the art world, where established institutions often dictate the value and worthiness of an artist's work based on traditional norms and expectations. This can create barriers for artists who explore unconventional, experimental, or controversial themes and mediums, limiting the diversity and richness of artistic expression on display within museums. On the other hand, galleries often provide a more inclusive and accessible platform for artists from a wide range of backgrounds, experiences, and styles. As such, Beth felt more confident that her work would not only find a receptive audience within the gallery space, but also that her art would be treated with respect and appreciation by those responsible for curating and promoting it. This was particularly important for Beth, as her art served as a deeply personal and distinctive reflection of her own lived experiences, emotions, and perspectives. In opting for the gallery setting, Beth demonstrated both the resilience and defiance necessary for an artist to stay true to the essence of their work, even in the face of criticism from established institutions. By doing so, she also contributed to a growing movement within the contemporary art world that challenges the dominance of an elite few and seeks to create more opportunities for a broader range of artists and creative voices. Over time, the gallery where Beth decided to showcase her art began to garner increased attention and acclaim, in part because of its commitment to showcasing innovative, thought-provoking, and underrepresented artists. By standing firm in her convictions and refusing to compromise on her vision, Beth not only furthered her own career but also played an essential role in fostering a more diverse, vibrant, and authentic artistic community. Moreover, as word spread about the gallery's commitment to presenting an eclectic array of artistic voices, others were inspired to create their own spaces dedicated to furthering artistic freedom and expression. This, in turn, helped to break down barriers and create a more inclusive and dynamic art world that prioritized the innate creativity and power of artists over restrictive notions of classiness. In conclusion, Beth's decision to exhibit her artwork in a gallery rather than a museum stemmed from the museum's judgment of her art as not meeting their standards of classiness. By choosing the gallery route, Beth rejected the limitations imposed by the traditional art world, paving the way for her own success and contributing to a broader cultural shift towards greater openness, diversity, and creativity in the realm of artistic expression."},{"question":"Johnnie had a set of small volumes of English verse, extensively annotated by his own hand, which Stoddard had brought to her early in their acquaintance, leaving it with her more as a gift than as a loan. She kept these little books after all the others had gone back. She had read and reread them--cullings from Chaucer, from Spenser, from the Elizabethan lyrists, the border balladry, fierce, tender, oh, so human--till she knew pages of them by heart, and their vocabulary influenced her own, their imagery tinged all her leisure thoughts. It seemed to her, whenever she debated returning them, that she could not bear it. She would get them out and sit with one of them open in her hands, not reading, but staring at the pages with unseeing eyes, passing her fingers over it, as one strokes a beloved hand, or turning through each book only to find the pencilled words in the margins. She would be giving up part of herself when she took these back. Yet it had to be done, and one miserable morning she made them all into a neat package, intending to carry them to the mill and place them on Stoddard's desk thus early, when nobody would be in the office. Then the children came in; Deanie was half sick; and in the distress of getting the ailing child comfortably into her own bed, Johnnie forgot the books. Taking them in at noon, she met Stoddard himself. Question: \\"Why did Johnnie not want to return the books in the afternoon?\\" Answer: \\"She didn't want to see Stoddard\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","response":"The answer is partially correct but does not capture the entire reason behind Johnnie's hesitation in returning the books in the afternoon. The primary reason behind Johnnie not wanting to return the books was her emotional attachment to them. She had read and reread these books many times and developed a strong attachment to the content as well as the annotations made by Stoddard. The books had become a part of her, influencing her vocabulary and thought process. Giving them up would feel like losing a part of herself, which made it difficult for her to return them. Moreover, the intention of returning the books in the morning when nobody was in the office signifies her desire to avoid facing Stoddard, which adds to her apprehension. This could be due to the emotional connection she had developed because of the books and how their shared love for the literary works had brought them closer. Hence, a more accurate and detailed answer to the question would be: \\"Johnnie did not want to return the books in the afternoon because of her strong emotional attachment to them and the fear of losing a part of herself by giving them up.

What is a sentence that would be (on a scale from 0 to 5) a 3 out of 5 in terms of textual similarity to the above sentence?","response":"Saudi Arabia functions as an absolute monarchy, with a government-appointed advisory council providing consultation. Explanation of the steps: 1. Retaining the core meaning: I maintained the central topic of the absolute monarchy in Saudi Arabia and the existence of a consultative council. 2. Changing sentence structure: I rephrased the sentence to have a different structure, beginning with the function of Saudi Arabia rather than identifying it as an absolute monarchy directly. 3. Adjust wording: I used different words for some elements, such as \\"functions as\\" instead of \\"is\\" and \\"advisory\\" instead of \\"consultative.\\" 4. Tweaking information: I used \\"providing consultation\\" to convey a sense of the council's role, similar to the original, without stating that it is appointed by the government explicitly. 5. Combining elements: I combined the elements to form a sentence that can be rated as a 3 out of 5 in terms of textual similarity, maintaining information accuracy while making it less explicitly similar to the original."},{"question":"Ask a question about Near East.","response":"What were the major influences and events in the Near East that led to the development of early civilizations? The Near East, often considered as the cradle of civilization, is a geographical region that spans across modern-day countries such as Egypt, Jordan, Israel, Lebanon, Iraq, Iran, Turkey, and parts of the Arabian Peninsula. As arguably the birthplace of human civilization, the Near East has been subject to various influences and events which have shaped its cultural, political, and social development over millennia. 1. Agricultural Revolution: One of the most significant events in the history of the Near East was the emergence of agriculture. Around 10,000 BCE, humans in this region began cultivating grains and domesticating animals, allowing them to shift from a hunter-gatherer lifestyle to a settled and centralized agricultural one. This revolutionary shift, known as the Neolithic Revolution or Agricultural Revolution, allowed the human population to increase substantially, foster the development of complex societies, and create permanent settlements with hierarchical structures. 2. The first cities and urbanization: As populations grew, early villages transformed into cities, giving rise to the earliest forms of urbanization. The city of Çatal Hüyük in modern-day Turkey, dating around 7500 BCE, is a prime example of such a settlement. Eventually, other cities, such as Uruk and Ur in Mesopotamia, arose as trade hubs and religious centers, setting the stage for the development of advanced civilizations. 3. Emergence of writing systems: The invention of writing systems around 3400 BCE, particularly the cuneiform in Mesopotamia and the hieroglyphics in Egypt, allowed for the recording of history, literature, laws, and commercial transactions. The development of writing systems was crucial for administrative, religious, and economic management within these ancient civilizations, and this technological advancement ultimately led to the formation of cohesive political entities. 4. The rise of empires: As societies became larger and more complex, political and economic power consolidated, giving rise to some of the world's first empires. The Akkadian Empire, the first empire in recorded history, dominated the Near East around 2300 BCE. Subsequent empires, such as the Babylonian, Assyrian, and Persian empires, expanded further to exert significant influence over the region. 5. Trade and cultural exchange: The Near East's strategic location at the crossroads of Europe, Asia, and Africa enabled it to become an important trade hub, fostering cultural exchanges and the spread of ideas among different civilizations. Trade routes, such as the Silk Road and the Incense Route, connected the Near East with other regions, exposing its people to various religions, artistic styles, technological innovations, and intellectual developments. These exchanges spurred progress and allowed civilizations in the Near East to flourish. 6. Abrahamic religions and the rise of monotheism: The Near East is the birthplace of the world's three major monotheistic religions - Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. The region has been the stage for many critical religious events, such as the Exodus of the Israelites from Egypt, the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, and the revelation of the Islamic faith to the Prophet Muhammad. These religious developments created cultural, political, and social diversities throughout the region, leading to the formation of distinct societies and influencing the course of history in the Near East. In conclusion, the development of early civilizations in the Near East can be attributed to several key factors, such as the Agricultural Revolution, urbanization, the invention of writing systems, the rise of empires, trade and cultural exchange, and the emergence of major monotheistic religions. The region's strategic location and rich history have made it a melting pot of diverse cultures, religions, and political developments that have left a lasting impact on human history and continue to shape the modern world."},{"question":"Gonna run sum quick erans and then Joi and i are off to Charlotte Select your answer from the options.

Noah researched the climate of Antarctica, while Frank researched the climate changes of Madagascar and the Southern tip of Africa. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which researcher observed a large amount of surface warming? Hint: Some of Antarctica has been warming up; particularly strong warming has been noted on the Antarctic Peninsula. A study by Eric Steig published in 2009 noted for the first time that the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is slightly positive at >0.05 °C (0.09 °F) per decade from 1957 to 2006. This study also noted that West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1 °C (0.2 °F) per decade in the last 50 years, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring. This is partly offset by autumn cooling in East Antarctica. There is evidence from one study that Antarctica is warming as a result of human carbon dioxide emissions, but this remains ambiguous. The amount of surface warming in West Antarctica, while large, has not led to appreciable melting at the surface, and is not directly affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's contribution to sea level. Instead the recent increases in glacier outflow are believed to be due to an inflow of warm water from the deep ocean, just off the continental shelf. The net contribution to sea level from the Antarctic Peninsula is more likely to be a direct result of the much greater atmospheric warming there.In 2002 the Antarctic Peninsula's Larsen-B ice shelf collapsed. Between 28 February and 8 March 2008, about 570 km2 (220 sq mi) of ice from the Wilkins Ice Shelf on the southwest part of the peninsula collapsed, putting the remaining 15,000 km2 (5,800 sq mi) of the ice shelf at risk. The ice was being held back by a \\"thread\\" of ice about 6 km (4 mi) wide, prior to its collapse on 5 April 2009. According to NASA, the most widespread Antarctic surface melting of the past 30 years occurred in 2005, when an area of ice comparable in size to California briefly melted and refroze; this may have resulted from temperatures rising to as high as 5 °C (41 °F).A study published in Nature Geoscience in 2013 (online in December 2012) identified central West Antarctica as one of the fastest-warming regions on Earth.

However, to fully address the original question \\"Where did the Vietnamese settle in America?\\", here is a more detailed answer: After the Fall of Saigon in 1975, many Vietnamese refugees fled to the United States in search of a better life. The U.S. government sponsored various initiatives to assist these refugees in resettlement, which led to the establishment of several Vietnamese communities across the country. Significant Vietnamese populations settled in the following areas: 1. California - Vietnamese immigrants mainly settled in Southern California, particularly in Orange County, which is now home to one the largest Vietnamese communities outside of Vietnam called \\"Little Saigon.\\" The city of San Jose in Northern California also has a significant Vietnamese population. 2. Texas - Houston has one of the largest Vietnamese communities in the U.S. known as \\"Midtown\\" or \\"Little Saigon,\\" while Vietnamese-Americans also settled in Dallas, Austin, and other cities in Texas. 3. Louisiana - Many Vietnamese found the climate in New Orleans similar to their homeland, and settled in the areas of New Orleans East and Versailles. They mostly worked in the fishing industry. 4. Washington - Seattle's diverse International District also attracted Vietnamese immigrants, creating a flourishing Vietnamese community. 5. Virginia - Virginia's Vietnamese community is mainly concentrated in the Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C., such as Falls Church, which also has a \\"Little Saigon.\\" 6. Massachusetts, Minnesota, and Oregon - These states also have notable Vietnamese communities, particularly in Boston, Minneapolis-St. Paul, and Portland, respectively. It's important to mention that Vietnamese immigrants and their descendants have continued to disperse throughout the United States, integrating into various cities and neighborhoods. As a result, there are now small enclaves of Vietnamese-Americans in several other major cities across the country."},{"question":"Summarize this article: Published on Jun 9, 2017 Subscribe to the Real Time YouTube: http://itsh.bo/10r5A1B Actor, producer and rap icon Ice Cube joins Symone Sanders, David Gregory and former Rep.

During an exchange with Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Nebraska) on his show Real Time, the political satirist casually dropped the n-word. Responding to a silly dig by Sasse (“We’d love to have you work in the fields with us,” he joked), Maher quipped, “Work in the fields? Senator, I’m a house nigger.” The backlash was appropriately swift, with Black Lives Matter activist DeRay Mckesson and MC/activist Chance the Rapper calling for Maher to be kicked off the air, and the Rev. Al Sharpton digging up a vintage clip of Maher cavalierly tossing around the n-word and defending his use of it by citing the way African-American rappers regularly use it in their songs. The comic, for his part, issued a rare apology: “Friday nights are always my worst nights of sleep because I’m up reflecting on the things I should or shouldn't have said on my live show,” he wrote. “Last night was a particularly long night as I regret the word I used in the banter of a live moment. The word was offensive and I regret saying it and I'm very sorry.” Well, on Friday night’s edition of his HBO program Real Time, the host first welcomed close pal Michael Eric Dyson on the show for his mea culpa. But that exchange, a black friend of Maher’s serving as his character witness and shield of sorts, was transparently disingenuous. The real exchange occurred later in the program when the iconic rapper turned actor Ice Cube joined the program. Cube, who served as frontman for the hip-hop group N.W.A. (which stood for “Niggas with Attitude”), gave Maher a piece of his mind. “I knew you was gonna fuck up sooner or later,” Cube told Maher. “I did. I did. I love your show, you’ve got a great show, but you’ve been buckin’ up against that line a little bit. You know, you’ve got a lot of black jokes. You know what I’m sayin’, you do.” “Well, against racists. Yes,” Maher responded, stunned by Cube’s criticism. “Eh. Sometimes you sound like a redneck trucker,” added Cube. “No, I don’t. That I gotta push back on,” replied Maher, clearly on the defensive. “It’s my opinion,” offered Cube. “My thing is this, and you know, I’m cool with you. I like your show, to be honest. I just wanna know two questions. What made you think it was cool to say that? That’s one question.” An annoyed Maher interrupted Cube—which he did repeatedly throughout the exchange: “You know, I just explained there was no thought put into it. Obviously I was telling Dr. Dyson, comedians, they react. And it was wrong. And I apologize. And you know, more than that I can’t do.” Then Ice Cube enlightened Maher on why his use of the n-word was so damn problematic—in far more nuanced and poignant fashion than the host’s friend Dyson. “I accept your apology. But I still think we need to get to the root of the psyche,” Cube explained. “Because I think there’s a lot of guys out there who cross the line because they a little too familiar—or they think they too familiar—or its guys that, you know, might have a black girlfriend or two who made them some Kool-Aid every now and then, and they think they can cross the line. And they can’t. It’s a word that has been used against us; it’s like a knife, man. And you can use it as a weapon, or you can use it as a tool. It’s been used as a weapon against us by white people, and we’re not gonna let that happen again by nobody, because it’s not cool. Now, I know you heard [it], it’s in the lexicon and everybody’s talkin’, but that’s our word now. That’s our word now. And you can’t have it back. I know they’re tryin’ to get it back.” The hip-hop maestro was referencing Maher’s history of dating black women, and how he may have gotten “too familiar” and felt that it entitled him to cross certain lines of propriety. One of Maher’s exes Karine Steffans, who is black, once said of him, “Bill wants someone he can put down in an argument, tell you how ghetto you are, how big your butt is and that you’re an idiot. That’s why you never see him with a white girl or an intellectual.” With that being said, Cube wasn’t done. “And I’m not talkin’ about you, Bill. But I’m talkin’ about guys who cross the line every day because they got some black homies, they got some friends, they think it’s cool. And it’s not cool because when I hear my homies say it, it don’t feel like venom. When I hear a white person say it, it feels like that knife stabbin’ me, even if they don’t mean it,” he said. “So, I like your show—and it’s a great show—I just don’t know sometimes, is it a political show, or is it a show about jokes?” he continued. “This, to me, is a political show. And I think you just have to not step on some of the political messages that you sayin’ with a joke, because some things just ain’t funny, you know what I mean? This is real right here that we’re going through. And I’m not tryin’ to get on your case, Bill. I’m tellin’ you: I like your show and I like you. But I think this is a teachable moment, not just to you but to the people who are watching right now.” Maher, visibly aggravated by Cube’s words, quipped, “I think the people who are watching right now are saying: that point has been made.” “Not by me,” fired back Cube. The outspoken funnyman was, for once, at a loss for words. ||||| Update, with videos “It’s like a knife, man,” actor-musician Ice Cube told Bill Maher about the host’s use last week of the N-word. “When I hear my homies say it, it don’t feel like venom. When I hear a white person say it, it’s like a knife.” “That’s our word now,” he continued, “and you can’t have it back.” (See video above). The first episode of HBO’s Real Time With Bill Maher since Maher ignited a firestorm last Friday by jokingly referring to himself as a “house N-word,” Maher took the stage tonight to a standing ovation and shouts of “We love you Bill” from his loyal audience. “Thank you for letting a sinner in your midst,” Maher said. “Michael Eric Dyson will be out here shortly to take me to the woodshed.” And so he did, as Maher and the author of Tears We Cannot Stop: A Sermon To White America launched into a discussion of race intended to clear the air after Maher crossed the line from politically incorrect to, as Dyson called it, the “unconscious reflex of white privilege.” “I wanted you to come by here because I want you to school me,” Maher told Dyson. “I did a bad thing.” “That’s a great place to begin, Bill,” Dyson said. “A very bad thing.” Dyson told Maher that with today’s “resurgence” of racism — he referenced Steve Bannon and Jeff Sessions — it’s even more important for Maher to fight the “unconscious reflex.” “My Bible tells me that to whom much is given,” Dyson said, “much is expected.” Maher acknowledged “it doesn’t matter that it wasn’t said in malice” since the word “brought pain to people.” “I’m not here to do that. I reiterate tonight, and that’s sincere. I’m not that big of an asshole.” Maher also mentioned Kathy Griffin, “who by the way owes me a fruit basket for getting her off the front page.” Maher said “as much as I hate Trump,” Griffin was wrong to be photographed holding a fake, bloody decapitated head of the president. Still, he added, she “should not go away.” “He broke me?” Maher said, quoting Griffin about Trump. “No, he didn’t.” Later in the show, a very serious Ice Cube told Maher, “I knew you was going to f*ck up sooner or later. Sometimes you sound like a redneck trucker.” The former N.W.A rapper also criticized Real Time for blurring the line between political discourse and jokes. Maher responded the show was meant to be both. Activist Symone Sanders, the former national press secretary for Bernie Sanders and frequent CNN contributor, told Maher that his joke about being a “house N-word” was particularly offensive to black women, and accused Maher of “white-washing” the word. “It was mostly black women who were in the house,” she said, where they were often beaten and raped. Another guest, Republican (and former congressman) David Jolly, applauded Maher for apologizing. “Let’s start focusing,” he said, “on the people who refuse to apologize.” Although Maher was contrite throughout the episode, he repeatedly insisted that he meant no harm last week. “I don’t want to pretend this is more of a race thing than a comedian thing,” he told Dyson. “Comedians are a special kind of monkey.” “So to speak,” Dyson responded as the audience laughed nervously. “Don’t,” Maher said. “Don’t f*ck with me. We are a trained thing that tries to get a laugh. That’s all we are always thinking.” No mention was made tonight of Sen. Al Franken, who canceled his planned appearance earlier this week. ||||| Summary:","response":"This is about a TV show where the host, named Bill Maher, said something not nice. He used a word that people should never use because it hurts people's feelings, especially black people. People got very upset with him. These included famous people like Ice Cube, who is a rapper and actor, and some activists who speak up for black people. They told Bill that what he did was wrong and he shouldn't have used that nasty word. Then, on another day, Bill talked to his friend Michael Eric Dyson on the same show. But people didn't think that was enough because Michael is Bill's friend, so they thought he was just trying to help Bill not look so bad. Later, Ice Cube came on the show and told Bill how he felt about what he did. Ice Cube asked Bill why he thought it was okay to use that word. Bill said he didn't think before he spoke, and that he was sorry. Ice Cube accepted Bill's apology but told him that he still has to learn why what he did was not okay. He explained to Bill and the people watching the show that it's not okay for white people to use that word because it's been used to hurt black people. Ice Cube also told Bill that his show is important because it talks about serious things, and sometimes, his jokes can get in the way of those serious messages. Even though Bill didn't seem happy to hear this, he listened to what Ice Cube had to say. This whole event taught everyone a lesson about understanding and respecting each other's feelings and cultures."},{"question":"Premise: \\"A child in a red shirt is running around in water.\\" Hypothesis: \\"A child is running at the water park.\\" Do we know that the hypothesis entailed by the premise?

As scientific knowledge advanced, human perception of the planets changed, incorporating a number of disparate objects. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially adopted a resolution defining planets within the Solar System. This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit. Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before 1950 remain \\"planets\\" under the modern definition, some celestial bodies, such as Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta (each an object in the solar asteroid belt), and Pluto (the first trans-Neptunian object discovered), that were once considered planets by the scientific community, are no longer viewed as such. - Island Records is a Jamaican-English record label that operates as a division of the Universal Music Group (UMG). It was founded by Chris Blackwell, Graeme Goodall and Leslie Kong in Jamaica in 1959. Blackwell sold the label to PolyGram in 1989. Both Island and another label recently acquired byPolyGram, A&M Records, were both at the time the largest independent record labels in history, with Island in particular having exerted a major influence on the progressive UK music scene in the early 1970s. - Progressive rock (shortened as \\"prog\\"; sometimes \\"art rock\\", \\"classical rock\\" or \\"symphonic rock\\") is a broad subgenre of rock music that developed in the United Kingdom and United States throughout the mid to late 1960s. Initially termed \\"progressive pop\\", the style was an outgrowth of psychedelic bands who abandoned standard pop traditions in favour of instrumentation and compositional techniques more frequently associated with jazz, folk or classical music. Additional elements contributed to its \\"progressive\\" label: lyrics were more poetic, technology was harnessed for new sounds, music approached the condition of \\"art\\", and the studio, rather than the stage, became the focus of musical activity, which often involved creating music for listening, not dancing. - In celestial mechanics, an orbital resonance occurs when two orbiting bodies exert a regular, periodic gravitational influence on each other, usually because their orbital periods are related by a ratio of two small integers. The physics principle behind orbital resonance is similar in concept to pushing a child on a swing, where the orbit and the swing both have a natural frequency, and the other body doing the \\"pushing\\" will act in periodic repetition to have a cumulative effect on the motion. Orbital resonances greatly enhance the mutual gravitational influence of the bodies, i.e., their ability to alter or constrain each other's orbits. In most cases, this results in an \\"unstable\\" interaction, in which the bodies exchange momentum and shift orbits until the resonance no longer exists. Under some circumstances, a resonant system can be stable and self-correcting, so that the bodies remain in resonance. Examples are the 1:2:4 resonance of Jupiter's moons Ganymede, Europa and Io, and the 2:3 resonance between Pluto and Neptune. Unstable resonances with Saturn's inner moons give rise to gaps in the rings of Saturn. The special case of 1:1 resonance (between bodies with similar orbital radii) causes large Solar System bodies to eject most other bodies sharing their orbits; this is part of the much more extensive process of clearing the neighbourhood, an effect that is used in the current definition of a planet. - EMI (officially EMI Group Limited, originally an initialism for Electric and Musical Industries and often known as EMI Records and EMI Music) was a British multinational conglomerate founded in March 1931 and was based in London. At the time of its break-up in 2012, it was the fourth-largest business group and family of record labels in the recording industry and was one of the big four record companies (now the big three). Its EMI Records Ltd. group of record labels included EMI Records, Parlophone, Virgin Records and Capitol Records. EMI also had a major publishing arm, EMI Music Publishingalso based in London with offices globally. - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\" - Music of the Spheres is an album by English musician Mike Oldfield , released in the United Kingdom on 17 March 2008 . The album , Oldfield 's second album with Mercury Records and his first classical work , is based on the concept of a celestial Musica universalis . The album features New Zealand soprano Hayley Westenra ( on \`\` On My Heart '' ) and Chinese pianist Lang Lang on six tracks . Music of the Spheres was nominated for a Classical Brit Award in 2009 . - Tubular Bells is the first album by English musician Mike Oldfield, recorded when he was 19 and released in 1973 when he was 20. - The term harmonic in its strictest sense describes any member of the harmonic series. The term is employed in various disciplines, including music and acoustics, electronic power transmission, radio technology, etc. It is typically applied to repeating signals, such as sinusoidal waves. A harmonic of such a wave is a wave with a frequency that is a positive integer multiple of the frequency of the original wave, known as the fundamental frequency. The original wave is also called 1st harmonic, the following harmonics are known as higher harmonics. As all harmonics are periodic at the fundamental frequency, the sum of harmonics is also periodic at that frequency. For example, if the fundamental frequency is 50 Hz, a common AC power supply frequency, the frequencies of the first three higher harmonics are 100 Hz (2nd harmonic), 150 Hz (3rd harmonic), 200 Hz (4th harmonic) and any addition of waves with these frequencies is periodic at 50 Hz. - Mercury Records is an American-based record label owned by Universal Music Group. In the United States, it operates through Island Records; in the UK, it is distributed by Virgin EMI Records. - \\"Moonlight Shadow\\" is a song written and performed by English multi-instrumentalist Mike Oldfield, released as a single in May 1983 by Virgin Records, and included in the album \\"Crises\\" of the same year. The vocals were performed by Scottish vocalist Maggie Reilly, who had been collaborating with Mike Oldfield since 1980. It is Oldfield's most successful single, reaching number one on a number of charts around Europe. What object entity has the relation of 'genre' with the subject 'music of the spheres '?

Costello was originally supposed to return to Australia as well and work for WCW, but those plans never came through. Instead, Costello remained in the United States and kept working in the tag team division, never seeking a career as a singles wrestler. Costello began wrestling for Georgia Championship Wrestling, where he teamed up with Louis Tillet to form a tag team known as \\"The Globetrotters\\"; a name that played off Costello's Australian and Tillet's French heritage. The Globetrotters defeated the Mysterious Medics in the finals of the Georgia NWA World Tag Team Championship but only held the titles for a week before losing them to Kurt and Karl Von Brauner on 4 February 1966. After this, the Globetrotters broke up due to differences in their approach to tag teaming. Costello then moved to the NWA Mid-America territory near Nashville, Tennessee. In Mid-American, Costello teamed with Herb Welch to win the Mid-American version of the NWA World Tag Team Championship, which they held for just over 2 months. While still working in Mid-America, Costello began to team with Karl Von Brauner, who used a \\"German Nazi\\" gimmick despite being American. Under the management of \\"Playboy\\" Gary Hart, Costello and Von Brauner were billed as \\"The Internationals\\"; the team was later managed by George \\"Crybaby\\" Cannon. The Internationals worked mainly in Tennessee and Texas for NWA Western States. In Texas, Costello and Von Brauner won the Texas version of the NWA World Tag Team Championship, a title Costello and Heffernan had held in 1958. The team was also billed as the first NWA American Tag Team Champions, titles that were also recognized by World Class Championship Wrestling in addition to the Western States promotion. The Internationals lost the American Tag Team title to Fritz and Waldo Von Erich on 21 February 1967. Kurt then decided to go back to teaming with his storyline brother, Karl Von Brauner.

In northern China during spring, big sandstorms often make trouble for students and everyone else. When the sky is dark with sand, buses and cars all move much more slowly. Sometimes, people can't even see for 20 metres. Sandstorms usually happen in spring. This year, sandstorms started in late March. They have happened in more than 10 provinces in northern China this year. More than 70 million people have had problems in those places because of the sandstorms. People in southern China don't have to worry about this kind of bad weather. Most of the sand comes from Gansu and Inner Mongolia . In northern China, lots of places have few trees and don't get much rain. People there have been cutting down too many trees. When there aren't many trees, the ground can't keep enough water. Over the years, the ground dries up and turns to sand. When spring comes and the ice melts , the ground becomes looser . Strong winds take the loose sand into the sky. Sandstorms are bad for people's health. If people breathe too much sand, they could cough or have asthma . Sandstorms also give farmers lots of problems. Sometimes their sheep get lost in the storms and never get back home. The winds also tear down farmers' houses. What can you do to stop sandstorms?

Ganassi ist eine interessante Adalgisa, ich hoffe, sie einmal mit einer besseren Norma hören und sehen zu können. Das Dirigat war durchschnittlich, der Tenor langweilig (Wie fast immer in Aufnahmen mit Gruberova als \\"Star\\"....) und der Chor dürftig. Alles in allem eine Aufnahme, die die von Beverly Sills erträglich macht, was nicht sehr dafür spricht. Sills sang ebendieses Repertoire, doch konnte sie wenigstens alls Künstlerin vokaler Farben und VERVE überzeugen. Diese Inszenierung ist etwas besseres Regietheater als sonst, sie kommt allerdings nicht an die großen Aufführungen an der Scala oder in Paris ran. Das dieses durch und durch mißglückte Unterfangen auch noch als neuer Standard gefeiert wird &amp; Gruberova als \\"sacred monster\\" eh nix falsch machen kann, verdreht eine miserable Leistung ins schlichtweg Absurde. Solution:","response":"Part #1: Identification of the task. Usage: Classify dvd product reviews in German language as \\"POS\\" or \\"NEG\\" based on their sentiment.

Explain why you think it meets the criteria: For example, if the review uses words like \\"enttäuschend\\" or \\"langweilig\\", it could be considered negative as these words describe a less than favorable experience."},{"question":"Q:I can use this background: Compared to conventional milk production, organic milk production tends to have lower eutrophication potential per ton of milk or per hectare of farmland, because it potentially reduces leaching of nitrates (NO3−) and phosphates (PO4−) due to lower fertilizer application rates. Because organic milk production reduces pesticides utilization, it increases land use per ton of milk due to decreased crop yields per hectare. Mainly due to the lower level of concentrates given to cows in organic herds, organic dairy farms generally produce less milk per cow than conventional dairy farms. Because of the increased use of roughage and the, on-average, lower milk production level per cow, some research has connected organic milk production with increases in the emission of methane.Animal welfare issues vary among dairy farms and are not necessarily related to the way of producing milk (organically or conventionally). Now, I have a new situation: There are two dairy farms in the town of Milkton and both are about the same size. Farm A produces only organic milk. Farm B does not but they are considering switching production to organic milk. Answer this question please: Which farm uses more pesticides, dairy farm A or B? A:","response":"Dairy farm B uses more pesticides because it does not produce organic milk.

The hashtag the studio used to promote the film is #comeagain, in some posters placed over star Channing Tatum’s pelvic area. One teaser shot featured Tatum with sparks literally emitting from his groin. Another showed Joe Manganiello (Sofia Vergara’s fiancée) thrusting a water bottle in front of his crotch, sending liquid flying through the air. The film is one phallus after another. Its stars are blatantly, hilariously subjecting themselves to what women like Vergara experience on a regular basis (like at last year’s Emmys): objectification. Manganiello and Tatum are helping to usher in an era of “man-jectification,” in which women can judge men’s bodies openly — the way their male counterparts have long done for women. Any woman in the public eye, from actors to politicians, can expect to have their looks critiqued, discussed, made object. That’s the way it’s always been. There were always handsome leading men, but they were rarely subject to the same scrutiny as women. Men still take most of the major lead roles — in 2014 just 12% of movie protagonists in the top 100 grossing films were women, according to the Center for Study of Women in Television and Film at San Diego State University — while women are relegated to being sex objects. Male directors who dominate the industry shoot films from the male perspective, allowing the camera to linger on beautiful women and judge them. But Tatum struck gold with 2012’s Magic Mike, which he wrote, by turning the camera on himself; the movie made 113.7 million at the box office. At its heart, Magic Mike was a drama about the recession, and about a man struggling to gain his independence — from the stripper pole, from his boss and from a world of drugs. Nobody remembers it as that. Audiences dubbed it “the stripper movie,” and groups of women and gay men crowded into theaters to see Channing Tatum and Matthew McConaughey’s guns, six packs and even butts. It’s no wonder then that Magic Mike XXL has dispensed with all the darkness of its predecessor in favor of becoming a pec-filled romp. Manjectification is taking place on the little screen, too. In the final episodes of Fox’s Last Man on Earth, the women on the show fawned over a ripped newcomer (Boris Kodjoe) and schemed for ways to sleep with him as he repaired various appliances. These episodes came after a long and almost unbearable run in which the main character, Phil (Will Forte), cursed his luck for having agreed to marry a nagging woman (Kristen Schaal) before a hot blonde (January Jones) to show up on the scene. The joke of the series was Phil getting a taste of his own medicine, but it was a reversal not often seen on television. Tatum and Kodjoe are voluntarily submitting to the objectification, of course, and they’re in on the joke. But other men are beginning to experience what women have for years. In March, Game of Thrones star Kit Harington complained about being objectified by the media. Unlike the Magic Mike actors who are, more often than not, shirtless in the films, Harington’s costume on the fantasy show involved so many bulky layers of fur that sleeping he might be confused with a dire wolf. And the pressure on male actors seems to be building. In order to get your own Marvel movie franchise, you’ve got to be prepared for the inevitable shirtlessness. Comedians Chris Pratt and Paul Rudd shed extra pounds for six-pack abs for Guardians of the Galaxy and Ant-Man, respectively. (No woman will get her own Marvel franchise until Captain Marvel in 2017.) Of course, the strain on male actors hardly equates to what female actors suffer. This was captured best when comedian Amy Schumer parodied 12 Angry Men on her show, in which a jury of dudes determines whether she is hot enough to be on television. Rather than assessing her comedy, the men mull whether — if they were a little drunk and had their glasses off — they might contemplate masturbating to Schumer’s blurry blonde image on the TV. Is turnabout fair play? Magic Mike XXL seems to think so. In the film, Jada Pinkett Smith asks women if they’re ready to be worshipped. Donald Glover says that male strippers are “healers.” Naked men, they reason, make women feel good and perhaps are some small recompense for how women have been treated. It’s hard to imagine a female stripper film where the characters could make the same argument about women being healers — can you imagine the same of Showgirls, Strip Tease or Coyote Ugly? None of those movies had the high-minded aspirations of Magic Mike. And after this one premieres, Channing Tatum will still be able to return to dramatic roles like the one he had in Foxcatcher. Women who strip for the camera don’t always engender such steadfast or serious support. But in some small way, XXL does try to hand power back to the female viewer, and man-jectification may just be balancing the scales. Write a title for it.","response":"\\"Magic Mike XXL and the Era of Man-jectification: How Men Are Becoming Objects Too\\""},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: In this task you will be given a list of lists, of numbers.

What is the answer?","response":"Pepsin is a crucial enzyme released by cells in the stomach, specifically by the chief cells of the gastric glands. The stomach is a part of the human digestive system, responsible for breaking down food and preparing it for further processing in the small intestine. The process of pepsin secretion starts with the production of an inactive precursor called pepsinogen in the chief cells. Pepsinogen is secreted into the gastric lumen, the open space within the stomach where the mixing and digestion of food occur. Once inside the gastric lumen, pepsinogen encounters the acidic environment created by hydrochloric acid (HCl), which is produced by the parietal cells of the gastric glands. The highly acidic milieu (with a pH of around 1.5 to 3.5) triggers the transformation of inactive pepsinogen into the active form, pepsin. Pepsin as an enzyme is specialized in breaking down proteins present in ingested food. It acts mainly on the peptide bonds found within proteins, converting them into smaller peptides called peptones. The enzymatic action of pepsin is most efficient in the acidic environment of the stomach, which ensures the proper unfolding of these protein molecules, making them more accessible for enzymatic breakdown. After the initial breakdown by pepsin, the partially digested proteins and peptides enter the small intestine, where they undergo further degradation by additional enzymes such as trypsin, chymotrypsin, and carboxypeptidases. This process ultimately results in the formation of amino acids, which are then absorbed and used by the human body for various physiological processes, including growth, repair, and maintenance of tissues. In summary, pepsin is a vital enzyme produced and released by the chief cells in the stomach of the human body. It plays a significant role in protein digestion by converting proteins into smaller peptides in the acidic gastric environment. This initial breakdown is later followed by further digestion in the small intestine, ultimately leading to the production of vital amino acids needed for various critical bodily functions."},{"question":"What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? .

In 2011 it had a total resident population of 138,400 for the borough and 174,700 for the wider Middlesbrough built-up area subdivision, which itself is part of the larger built-up area of Teesside and had an overall population of 376,333 at the 2011 census. - A non-metropolitan county, or colloquially, shire county, is a county-level entity in England that is not a metropolitan county. The counties typically have populations of 300,000 to 1.4 million. The term \\"shire county\\" is, however, an unofficial usage. Many of the non-metropolitan counties bear historic names and most end in the suffix \\"-shire\\" such as Wiltshire or Staffordshire. Of the remainder, some counties had the -shire ending and have lost it over time; such as Devon and Somerset. \\"Shire county\\" is, strictly, a dual-language tautology since the French-derived \\"county\\" means the same as the older Anglo-Saxon word \\"shire\\". - The River Tyne is a river in North East England and its length (excluding tributaries) is .

It rises on the eastern slope of Cross Fell in the North Pennines, and flows eastwards for to reach the North Sea between Hartlepool and Redcar near Middlesbrough. - Gateshead is a large town in Tyne and Wear, England, and the main settlement in the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead. The local authority of Gateshead is also the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead. Gateshead lay in the County of County Durham. In 1835 it became part of the Gateshead County Borough. After the Local Government Act 1972, in 1974, Gateshead became part of the Gateshead Metropolitan Borough local authority, and part of the Tyne & Wear Metropolitan County. The town lies on the southern bank of the River Tyne opposite Newcastle upon Tyne. Gateshead and Newcastle are joined by seven bridges across the Tyne, including the Gateshead Millennium Bridge. The town is known for its architecture, including the Sage Gateshead, the Angel of the North and the Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art.

Gateshead's population in 2011 was 120,046. - Wearside is an area of North East England centred on the continuous urban area of Sunderland by the River Wear, and in the wider sense, including separate neighbouring settlements such as Seaham. - The regions (formerly known as the Government Office Regions; GORs) are the highest tier of sub-national division in England. Between 1994 and 2011, nine regions had officially devolved functions within Government. While they no longer fulfil this role, they continue to be used for statistical and some administrative purposes. They define areas (constituencies) for the purposes of elections to the European Parliament. Eurostat also uses them to demarcate first level Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) regions (\\"NUTS 1 regions\\") within the European Union. The regions generally follow the boundaries of the former standard regions, established in the 1940s for statistical purposes. - Cumbria (; locally ) is a non-metropolitan county in North West England. The county and Cumbria County Council, its local government, came into existence in 1974 after the passage of the Local Government Act 1972.

It covers Northumberland, County Durham, Tyne and Wear, and the Tees Valley. The region is home to three large conurbations: Teesside, Wearside, and Tyneside, the latter of which is the largest of the three and the eighth most populous conurbation in the United Kingdom. There are only three cities in the region; Newcastle upon Tyne is the largest city in the region with a population of just under 280,000, followed by Sunderland, both of which are located in the metropolitan county of Tyne and Wear.

In fact, many county towns are no longer part of the administrative county. For example, Nottingham is administered by a unitary authority entirely separate from the rest of Nottinghamshire. Many county towns are classified as cities, but all are referred to as county towns regardless of whether city status is held or not. - York is a historic walled city at the confluence of the rivers Ouse and Foss in North Yorkshire, England.

The town is often colloquially referred to as 'Darlo'. - North West England, one of nine official regions of England, consists of the five counties of Cheshire, Cumbria, Greater Manchester, Lancashire and Merseyside. The North West had a population of 7,052,000 in 2011. It is the third most populated region in the United Kingdom after the South East and Greater London. - The Gateshead Millennium Bridge is a pedestrian and cyclist tilt bridge spanning the River Tyne in England between Gateshead's Quays arts quarter on the south bank, and the Quayside of Newcastle upon Tyne on the north bank. Opened for public use in 2001, the award-winning structure was conceived and designed by architect Wilkinson Eyre and structural engineer Gifford. The bridge is sometimes referred to as the 'Blinking Eye Bridge' or the 'Winking Eye Bridge' due to its shape and its tilting method. In terms of height, the Gateshead Millennium Bridge is slightly shorter than the neighbouring Tyne Bridge, and stands as the sixteenth tallest structure in the city. - A metropolitan borough is a type of local government district in England, and is a subdivision of a metropolitan county. Created in 1974 by the Local Government Act 1972, metropolitan boroughs are defined in English law as metropolitan districts. However, all of them have been granted or regranted royal charters to give them borough status (as well as, in some cases, city status). Metropolitan boroughs have been effectively unitary authority areas since the abolition of the metropolitan county councils by the Local Government Act 1985. However, metropolitan boroughs pool much of their authority in joint boards and other arrangements that cover whole metropolitan counties, such as combined authorities. - Tyne and Wear is a metropolitan county in the North East region of England around the mouths of the rivers Tyne and Wear. It came into existence in 1974 after the passage of the Local Government Act 1972. It consists of the five metropolitan boroughs of South Tyneside, North Tyneside, City of Newcastle upon Tyne, Gateshead and City of Sunderland. It is bounded on the east by the North Sea, and has borders with Northumberland to the north and County Durham to the south. - The Stockton and Darlington Railway (S&DR) was a railway company that operated in north-east England from 1825 to 1863. The world's first public railway to use steam locomotives, its first line connected collieries near Shildon with Stockton-on-Tees and Darlington, and was officially opened on 27 September 1825. The movement of coal to ships rapidly became a lucrative business, and the line was soon extended to a new port and town at Middlesbrough. While coal waggons were hauled by steam locomotives from the start, passengers were carried in coaches drawn by horses until carriages hauled by steam locomotives were introduced in 1833. - Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art (BALTIC) is an international centre for contemporary art located on the south bank of the River Tyne alongside the Gateshead Millennium Bridge in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, in North East England, United Kingdom. It presents a constantly changing programme of exhibitions and events. It opened in 2002 in a converted flour mill. The Director is Sarah Munro who joined Baltic in November 2015. Munro is the first woman to hold the position of Director in the history of the Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art. BALTIC is a registered charity under English law. - The metropolitan counties are a type of county-level administrative division of England. There are six metropolitan counties, which each cover large urban areas, typically with populations of 1.2 to 2.8 million. They were created in 1972 and are each divided into several metropolitan districts or boroughs. - Northumberland is a county in North East England. The northernmost county of England, it borders Cumbria to the west, County Durham and Tyne and Wear to the south and Scotland to the north. To the east is the North Sea coastline with a long distance path.

Photosynthesis is a crucial biological process that occurs within the chloroplasts of plant cells in the presence of sunlight. During photosynthesis, plants convert light energy into chemical energy in the form of glucose. This process involves two key stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions (or Calvin cycle). 1. Light-dependent reactions: These occur in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts, where chlorophyll and other pigments absorb light energy and produce high-energy molecules such as ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate). The absorbed light energy also splits water molecules (H2O) into oxygen (O2) and hydrogen (H+), which form oxygen molecules as a byproduct that is released into the atmosphere. 2. Light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle): These reactions occur in the stroma of the chloroplasts, where the energy stored in ATP and NADPH is utilized to convert carbon dioxide (CO2) into glucose (C6H12O6) through a series of enzyme-catalyzed reactions. The glucose produced can then be utilized by the plant in various ways, as detailed below: - Energy source: Glucose serves as the primary energy source for plant cells. It can be metabolized during cellular respiration to produce ATP – the universal energy currency for cells, which is used to power various cellular functions. - Storage: Some glucose molecules are combined to form larger storage compounds like starch, which can be broken down back into glucose when energy is needed. Starch is stored in specialized structures like amyloplasts in plant cells or as a reserve in structures like seeds and tubers. - Structure: Plants convert glucose into other organic molecules like cellulose and lignin. Cellulose is a vital structural component of plant cell walls, providing mechanical support, while lignin adds rigidity and strength to specialized tissues like the xylem (water-conducting tissue). - Synthesis of other molecules: Glucose serves as a precursor for the synthesis of various other essential molecules like amino acids, nucleic acids, and lipids. These biomolecules are needed for various physiological processes, including DNA replication, protein synthesis, and membrane formation. In conclusion, the main product of photosynthesis used by plants is glucose, which is critical for their survival, growth, and reproduction. It serves as an energy source, a building block for various cellular structures, and a precursor for other essential molecules. Additionally, the process of photosynthesis generates oxygen as a byproduct, which is a fundamental aspect of Earth's life-supporting atmosphere."},{"question":"Young Girl on a Chair is a 1955 bronze sculpture by Giacomo Manzù, installed at the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, D.C.

Le: OK, so how can I answer with some explanation?","response":"To determine if the hypothesis, \\"People are walking in a heavy traffic area,\\" is entailed by the premise, \\"People walking down an active street,\\" let's break down the information provided in both statements and see if they are logically connected. Premise: \\"People walking down an active street.\\" - The statement tells us that there are people walking on a street. - The street is described as \\"active,\\" which suggests that it's bustling and has some sort of activity happening. Hypothesis: \\"People are walking in a heavy traffic area.\\" - The statement suggests that people are walking in a location with a high volume of traffic. - Heavy traffic area can typically imply high vehicular traffic or pedestrian traffic, or both. Now, let's analyze the connection between the premise and hypothesis. - An \\"active street\\" doesn't always mean it is a heavy traffic area, although it is more likely. It could also refer to a street with a lot of shops, events, or other activities happening without necessarily having heavy traffic. - Since the premise doesn't explicitly mention the traffic volume, we cannot conclude with certainty that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. So, we can say that while the hypothesis may be plausible based on the premise, it is not definitively entailed by it, as there could be other reasons for the street being active and, therefore, not necessarily a heavy traffic area."},{"question":"Given the fact that: When particles move more quickly, temperature is higher and an object feels warmer. Answer the question: Rita sees a particle and makes it move very slowly. The temperature of the particle increases or decreases? Answer:","response":"When Rita sees a particle and makes it move very slowly, the temperature of the particle decreases. To understand this, we need to delve into the concepts of temperature, heat, and particle motion in the realm of thermodynamics. Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance. Kinetic energy is the energy of motion, and it is directly proportional to the mass and the square of velocity of the particles. In simpler terms, the more the particles are moving, the higher their kinetic energy, which results in a higher temperature. When particles move more quickly, they vibrate, rotate, and translate with greater energy, which creates a sensation of warmth when we come into contact with that substance. The faster the particles are moving, the more kinetic energy they have, and the higher the temperature of the substance. Conversely, when particles move more slowly, their kinetic energy is reduced, and thus, the temperature of the substance also decreases. Now, let's consider Rita's situation. When she sees the particle and makes it move very slowly, she is effectively reducing the particle's velocity. As a result, the kinetic energy of the particle is decreased, which in turn lowers the temperature of the particle. Slowing down the movement of particles is the mechanism used in various cooling methods, such as refrigeration, which relies on the principle of reducing particle motion to lower the temperature of the substance being cooled. In conclusion, when Rita makes the particle move very slowly, the temperature of the particle decreases due to the reduction in its kinetic energy. This is based on the relationship between particle motion and temperature, where slower-moving particles exhibit lower temperatures, while faster-moving particles present higher temperatures and a sensation of warmth."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Information: - The Gulf of Guinea is the northeasternmost part of the tropical Atlantic Ocean between Cape Lopez in Gabon, north and west to Cape Three Points in Western region Ghana.

Rooted in 1960s garage rock and other forms of what is now known as \\"proto-punk\\" music, punk rock bands rejected perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. Punk bands typically use short or fast-paced songs, with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY ethic; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through informal channels. - Dean \\"Deano\\" Butterworth is a British-American drummer who is noted for working with English singer Morrissey, and in 2005 became the drummer for American band Good Charlotte after they parted with their previous drummer, Chris Wilson. - Eric Dodd, known professionally as Eric Valentine, is an American record producer, who began his career as drummer and producer in the heavy metal band T-Ride. - Maryland is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, bordering Virginia, West Virginia, and Washington, D.C. to its south and west; Pennsylvania to its north; and Delaware to its east.

Officials say that when firefighters arrived at a house fire near Boise Friday night, they investigated cries of \\"Help!\\" and \\"Fire!\\" and, instead of the elderly woman they were expecting, they found a pair of parrots, KBOI2 reports. A fire department spokesman tells NBC News that when no people were found inside the house, thermal imagery technology revealed the parrots on the table. The spokesman says both parrots were fine after being given oxygen—and after being taken from the building, the noisier of the pair started imitating the sirens she heard. (A parrot in Florida is credited with saving the lives of its owners by waking them up during a house fire.) Article:","response":"Title: Parrots Cry \\"Help!\\" and \\"Fire!\\", Alert Firefighters to House Blaze in Middleton, Idaho The fire department in Middleton, Idaho, shared a remarkable story over the weekend showcasing the keen intelligence of two parrots which managed to save their own lives during a house fire. The incident occurred on Friday night near Boise, where firefighters were puzzled by cries of \\"Help!\\" and \\"Fire!\\" coming from a burning house. Upon investigating the source of these sounds, firefighters were surprised to find that they did not belong to an elderly woman, as they initially suspected, but instead to a pair of parrots. The discovery was made thanks to thermal imagery technology, which facilitated the detection of the birds on a table inside the house, as reported by KBOI2. Following their rescue, both parrots were administered oxygen and appeared to be fine after their harrowing experience. Interestingly, the noisier of the pair began imitating the sirens heard during their rescue once they were taken outside the building, a fire department spokesman told NBC News. While parrots are known for their impressive vocal mimicry abilities, this incident showcases their remarkable intelligence and adaptability when faced with dangerous situations. These parrots not only demonstrated their ability to learn and reproduce new sounds that they heard but also recognized the urgency of the situation and successfully alerted the firefighters to their presence. This is not the first time that a parrot's intelligence has been credited with saving lives; a similar event took place in Florida, where a parrot woke up its owners during a house fire, ultimately ensuring their survival. These events underline the importance of recognizing and understanding the intelligence of animals when dealing with potential risks, both to humans and to the animals themselves. In light of these incidents, it may be worth considering the value of integrating parrots and other intelligent animals into early warning systems for home safety, taking advantage of their unique abilities to enhance our own response capabilities. Through better understanding and appreciation of the intelligence of animals such as parrots, we can work together to protect both human and animal life from dangers like house fires. In conclusion, the recent events in Middleton, Idaho, serve as a powerful reminder of how the intelligence of animals can play a crucial role in saving lives during emergencies. By paying attention to and respecting the abilities of these extraordinary creatures, we can learn valuable lessons in crisis response and perhaps even find new ways to harness their talents for the betterment of society."},{"question":"Q: who was the voice of dory in finding dory?

Conservative lawmakers and advocacy groups are pushing GOP leaders to make big demands of President Barack Obama early next year in... ||||| Washington (CNN) -- A federal budget compromise that already passed the House cleared a key procedural hurdle on Tuesday in the Senate, increasing the likelihood it will win final Congressional approval this week. President Barack Obama has signaled his support for the plan worked out by the budget committee leaders in each chamber that would guide government spending into 2015 to defuse the chances of another shutdown such as the one that took place in October. Tuesday's vote overcame a Republican filibuster attempt that required 60 votes in the 100-member chamber to proceed on the budget measure. The count was 67-33, with a dozen Republicans joining the 55 Democrats and independents in support of the plan. 5 ways Senate could mess it up Final approval in the Senate requires a simple majority of 51 votes. The budget plan easily passed the House last week on a 332-94 vote. GOP concerns The politics of the issue were clear in Tuesday's vote breakdown. Only one Republican Senator facing a primary challenge in their re-election campaigns voted with Democrats to overcome the GOP filibuster -- Lamar Alexander of Tennessee. Alexander has indicated he will oppose the budget plan in the final vote later this week. A new ABC News/Washington Post poll released Tuesday showed 50% of respondents approving of the budget plan while 35% opposed it. According to the survey, a majority of Democrats and independents backed the proposal, while only 39% of Republicans liked it. Some Senate Republicans said before Tuesday's vote that the most important thing for now was to lower the budget deficit, even if only by a small percentage, and prevent further government shutdowns like the 16-day stoppage in October that proved politically damaging to the GOP. Sen. Ron Johnson, who was lobbied to support the bill negotiated by fellow Wisconsin Republican Rep. Paul Ryan, said he wanted \\"to make sure we avoid any additional government shutdowns.\\" \\"The federal government does enough harm to our economy,\\" Johnson said. \\"We don't need to add additional harm by this crisis management. In the end this is not the kind of deal I would want to see. I'm sure it's not the kind of deal Paul Ryan would want to produce.\\" Conservative GOP Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah said in a statement that \\"sometimes the answer has to be yes.\\" \\"Ultimately, his agreement upholds the principles conservatives stand for and, with Democrats controlling the White House and the Senate, it is the best we can hope for,\\" he said of the plan Ryan negotiated with Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington. CNN vote count: Budget deal nearing Senate approval, but not there yet Final congressional approval of the elusive budget agreement would mark a rare win for bipartisanship and a step up for a Congress infected with political dysfunction and held in low public esteem with midterm elections less than a year off. Democrats wary, too While Democrats supported the bill, many had concerns. More liberal senators -- like Tom Harkin of Iowa -- complained that an unemployment benefit extension was not included in the deal. \\"There's over a million people now who cannot find a job, out of work, and right at this time of year their unemployment insurance is being cut off,\\" Harkin told Radio Iowa last week. \\"It's really unconscionable.\\" Poll: Congress neck-and-neck with car salespeople, lobbyists for least honest Budget deal The budget agreement, which was months in the making, eases spending caps for the next two fiscal years while softening the impact of across-the-board spending cuts, known as the sequester, on defense and non-defense programs. Overall, it calls for more than 20 billion in deficit reduction. Current federal spending expires in mid-January, raising the possibility of another shutdown at that time if there's not a new agreement in place to keep federal coffers filled. The strong vote in the House on the budget plan on Thursday brought a collective sigh of relief among supporters, who initially thought it would sail through the Senate, where bipartisanship has been more the norm than in the sharply divided House. Don't expect Boehner to totally change his tune But after reading details of the agreement, many Senate Republicans -- including several in leadership positions -- came out against the bill. \\"I'd really like to stay within the (spending) caps,\\" complained GOP Sen. John Boozman of Arkansas. \\"This busts the caps and as a result I'll vote against it.\\" Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina complained that the plan reduces military benefits. 2016 in play Three leading tea party-backed senators with 2016 presidential aspirations -- Rand Paul of Kentucky, Ted Cruz of Texas, and Marco Rubio of Florida -- also have come out against the budget compromise for similar reasons. CNN's Dana Bash, Paul Steinhauser and Dan Merica contributed to this story. ||||| WASHINGTON, DC : On Monday, Senator Orrin Hatch (R-UT), pictured here in 2012, along with Senator Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) added their names to a growing list of Republican sentators who declared their support for the bipartisan deal. (Bill O'Leary/WASHINGTON POST) Despite a concerted attack by conservative advocacy groups, a bipartisan deal to roll back sharp spending cuts known as the sequester appeared on track to clear the Senate after a growing number of Republicans declared their support for the measure. On Monday, Sens. Orrin G. Hatch (Utah) and Johnny Isakson (Ga.) added their names to a list that included Sens. John McCain (Ariz.), Susan Collins (Maine) and Ronald H. Johnson (Wis.). At least two others who were undecided on the substance of the agreement said they will nonetheless help the Senate’s 55 Democrats assemble the 60 votes needed to clear a critical procedural hurdle Tuesday morning. The federal budget accord “isn’t everything I’d hoped it would be, and it isn’t what I would have written,” Hatch said in a statement. “But sometimes the answer has to be yes.” The deal, struck by Senate Budget Committee Chairman Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), is intended to end nearly three years of acrimony over the budget in Washington. It would cancel half the sequester cuts for the current fiscal year, replace them with other savings and allow Congress to avert another government shutdown in January. Last week, the agreement sailed through the House on a vote of 332 to 94, raising hopes that Republicans were finally drawing to a close an era of uncompromising confrontation over the budget. But trouble quickly cropped up in the usually more moderate Senate, where a slew of tea party heroes — and GOP incumbents facing tea-party challengers — lambasted the deal. Following the lead of outside groups such as Heritage Action for America and the Club for Growth, several Republican senators complained that the agreement would allow agency spending to rise over the next two years in exchange for the vow of spending reductions nearly a decade from now. “It increases spending by 60 billion over the next two years but promises to pay for it with cuts over the next 10 [years] — something that we know Congress never gets back to actually carrying out,” said Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.), a possible contender for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination. More worrying for advocates of the agreement, two key Republican allies in the fight against the sequester — Sens. Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.) and Kelly Ayotte (N.H.) — said late last week that they, too, would vote against the measure. Although the agreement would cancel a hit to the Pentagon budget set for January, an outcome Graham and Ayotte have been campaigning for months to prevent, the pair complained that the deal also would dial back cost-of-living increases for the youngest military retirees. “It’s unacceptable to single out our men and women in uniform in this way,” Ayotte said. Some Democrats, meanwhile, were grumbling that the deal includes no provision for extending unemployment insurance for the long-term jobless. Those benefits are set to expire at the end of December, cutting off 1.3 million people. Although senior Senate aides never doubted their ability to assemble the 50 votes needed to pass the agreement, their ability to get 60 votes to squash a threatened GOP filibuster seemed less certain. So Murray and Ryan worked through the weekend to shore up support. House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) also reached out privately to a few of his closest friends. By Monday morning, the tide had turned, and Sen. Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.), the No. 3 Democrat in the Senate, said on MSNBC that it is “safe to say” the measure will pass the chamber. A final vote could come as soon as Tuesday evening, if Senate Republicans agree to speed things up. Otherwise, the chamber is likely to send the measure to the White House late Wednesday. The proposal would raise about 85 billion over the next decade through a variety of policies, including trimming pensions for civil-service workers and military retirees younger than 62, raising security fees for airline passengers and extending the sequester for Medicare providers an additional two years, through 2023. About 62 billion of those savings would go to replace a portion of the sequester in fiscal 2014 and 2015, restoring spending for the Pentagon and domestic agencies. The rest of the savings, about 23 billion, would go toward trimming deficits projected to exceed 6 trillion over the next decade. In announcing his support, Hatch said the agreement is “built on the necessary consensus that reflects divided government.” “I appreciate the hard work of Paul Ryan, Speaker Boehner and House Republicans in crafting this commendable compromise that reduces our debt over the long-term, prevents another government shutdown, and stops the budget battles that have rocked America with economic uncertainty and political pessimism,” Hatch said. “Much more work needs to be done. . . . My hope is that this budget agreement paves the way to greater stability, lasting deficit reduction, and the political will to tackle those challenges in the near future.” ||||| Republicans in the Senate could slow the progress of the bipartisan budget that passed the House last week, amid signs that a procedural vote scheduled for Tuesday may be tight. Although Democratic supporters of the deal in the Senate believe it will attract enough support to achieve the required 60 votes to pass the procedural motion, some are warning that frayed relations with Republicans could result in the numbers being tight. The 1tn deal, forged between Republican congressman Paul Ryan and Democratic senator Patty Murray, passed overwhelmingly in the House, by 332 to 94. If passed by the Senate, the agreement, which reduces blanket spending cuts and raises some new revenues without increasing taxes, would stave off the threat of another government shutdown for two years. However, the compromise does not entirely eradicate the possibility of the kind of brinksmanship which took Washington to the precipice earlier this year. While promoting his bill as a means to avoid another calamitous government closure, Ryan indicated that Republicans were still considering what they could \\"get out\\" of possible negotiations over the debt limit. “We don't want nothing out of this debt limit. We're going to decide what it is we can accomplish out of this debt-limit fight,” Ryan told Fox News Sunday. The White House has repeatedly said it will not negotiate over the debt limit, arguing that the routine increase to the Treasury's borrowing capacity should not be used as a bargaining tool. In reality, administration officials did discuss the limit during talks in October, and some Republicans may seek to use the technique to foster further concessions in an election year. For now, Ryan is focused on persuading Republicans in the Senate to support his bill and avoid a filibuster. If the bill had unanimous Democrat support, at least five Republicans would have to vote with them to move to a final vote. But if, as expected, a handful of Democrats angry that it fails to renew unemployment benefits for over 1 million Americans decided to vote against, more Republican votes will be required. Richard Durbin, the Senate majority whip, estimated that about eight Republicans were needed to support the bill. “The struggle is still on in the United States Senate,” he told CBS’s Face the Nation. “I feel we’ll have a good, strong showing from the Democratic side. But we need bipartisan support to pass it.” Conservatives have complained that the Ryan-Murray deal will increase federal spending and reduce support for working-age military veterans. Although unrelated to the budget, Republicans in the Senate are also fuming over a decision by Democrats to change the rules over the confirmation of administration appointments – robbing the Republicans of an opportunity to obstruct Barack Obama’s nominations to key posts. Democratic majority leader Harry Reid held two all-night sessions in the Senate last week, to force through Obama’s appointments. In an ambitious schedule, Reid is aiming to secure the confirmation of Jeh Johnson, Obama’s choice to replace Janet Napolitano as secretary for homeland security, and possibly Janet Yellen, who would become the first woman to head the Federal Reserve, before the Senate goes into recess on Friday. However, Reid’s focus this week will inevitably be on the budget, particularly given that so many senior Republican senators, including the minority leader Mitch McConnell and party whip John Cornyn, have signalled their opposition to the deal. Only a handful of Republicans have so far signalled that they may vote in favour of the bill, including, most recently, the Wisconsin senator Ron Johnson. The decision by Johnson, a Tea Party-aligned senator, to support the deal could be pivotal. The host of staunchly conservative groups which often steer Republican votes, such as Club For Growth and Heritage Action, lambasted the budget deal because it waters down planned spending cuts. Most Republicans in the House took the unusual step of ignoring the guidance from the rightwing groups, but Republican senators are seemingly more cautious. As Durbin pointed out, they include potential presidential hopefuls, who would want to maintain the support of the radical conservative base, as well more moderate Republicans, such as McConnell and Cornyn, facing primary challenges from Tea Party opponents in the new year. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","response":"The bipartisan budget deal, aiming to prevent another government shutdown and reduce the budget deficit, is anticipated to pass following the overcoming of a Republican filibuster attempt in the Senate.
