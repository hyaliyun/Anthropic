Combine the constant terms (419 and 1513): 41*i = 133*i + 1932 3. To solve for 'i', we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. To do this, subtract 133*i from both sides of the equation: 41*i - 133*i = 133*i - 133*i + 1932 This simplifies to: -92*i = 1932 4. To find the value of 'i', divide both sides by -92: i = 1932 / -92 5. Calculating the result: i = -21 So, the solution to this math problem is i = -21."},{"question":"Question: Roland felt his stomach knotting. Having ridden out of the city through the Saint-Denis Gate, he now was nearly home, and the hurt inside was cutting so deep that he thought it would drive him mad. He repeated again and again the pledge he had just made to Nicolette: I am your true troubadour, now and forever. It felt like a knife stabbing into him. I do love her, as I have not loved any other - except Diane. Under his fur-lined mantle he was sweating, despite the bone-deep chill of the January night. Was my pledge to Nicolette a lie? No, not now that Diane has vowed herself to God. He had always believed that a man or a woman could love but one person. For all the years he had loved Diane, he had accepted that as a sacred law of Love. It was the way things should be. But it was not the way they were. Not for him. What if I had known, that day I saw Nicolette at Chinon, that Diane was still alive? I would have wanted Nicolette just as much, but would not have begun this. There would have been no messages, no song in her garden. But I was sure Diane was dead. There was nothing but a memory of a younger time to check my feelings for Nicolette. And then, when I found Diane again, I could not have her. I had lost her forever. So at last I wrote again to Nicolette. But tonight, when Nicolette would have let me make love to her - and how I want her! - I could not go beyond an embrace and a kiss. Not as long as I still love Diane. When he had set out, a full moon had hung low above the huddled rooftops of the university town. Now the silver disk was high overhead, and he could discern the small house he had bought two years ago with money he brought with him from Sicily. Question: Why was Roland sweating?

A simple rule of thumb to decide whether a question is a factoid or not is to see if two different people with average reading/comprehension skills would come up with the same answer after reading the passage. It's an ackward moment at Dr. Who (Peter Cushing)'s home, as he is about to meet Ian (Ron Castle), who happens to be the boyfriend of his daughter Barbara (Jennie Linden). She tells her younger sister, Susan \\"Susy\\" (Roberta Tovey) to tend to the door up. This is no ordinary family, as Susy had been reading a huge book, by Physics for the Enquiring Mind by Eric M. Roberts, highly advanced for somebody of such a young age - alike the bigger sister, who was reading Science Is Science, and it's grandfather who's reading a science-fiction comic. Ian is clumsy and stubles on entering... again. Ian has brought a present, but Dr. Who insists in showing him his last invention. Susy thinks that Ian is so stupid, he won't understand it, but they three go out to the street to check of the red phone booth. Ian is amazed about how big it's on the inside. The machine will transport everything in time and place.Barbara appears and jumps to Ian's arms. He steps back and sets the machine onto motion with the four of them inside. The scenery immediately changes: they are on a place of jungle twigs and burnt soil called Skaro. It's another planet. Susan is excited to have the opportunity to go around and investigate. She find a kind of alien flower. Barbara screams at the small statue of a crocrodile. On the mayhem, Ian falls onto the thing and breaks it.Susan find the lights of empty buildings. Barbara starts thinking that something terrible happened in that place, and that it's dangerous. Ian tells Dr. Who that he's expected at home, so that they must return. Finally, who obliges. Susan gets lost because she finds another of those beautiful flowers. She runs away because a hand has touched her, but nobody seems to believe her.Back at the phone booth, they cannot see anyone with their surveillance cameras, but Susy insists that she was touched on the shoulder. There are knocks on the door, which startle Ian, but there isn't anybody around. They try to leave, but can't, and when they step aside, Susan courageously picks up a small blue container - it's has four small tubes with a liquid inside.They go to the city, which looks empty. Dr. Who gets tired easily. They enter an empty home with different rooms. Ian's door is the only one which doesn't open automatically, as he needs to touch something. Barbara walks a long corridor, and it looks as though she's being watched. She ends up being trapped and screams. Susan sits on the spot to open up the door. Susy, Ian and Who follow a noise to a communication room. Dr. Who looks tired. When they turn around, the three of them find themselves surrounded by Daleks. Ian is left dizzy by the Daleks, who also took the object which they found. They reunite with Barbara in a room/cell.Temmosus (Geoffrey Toone), Antodus (John Bown), Dyoni (Yvonne Antrobus) and Elyon (Mark Petersen). Some of them believe the letter offering to be their friends - supposedly written by Susan. Who devises a plan to escape using Susan's cape as an insulator. At that moment, a Dalek appears to bring them food, they put food in their periscope and attack it by blinding its eye with the disgusting food. Ian gets into the blue Dalek. There is also the image of a kind of green claw, a proof of the mutations which have taken place in the . Susan leads the way, and pretends to be the blue Dale's prisoner. They are soon found out anyway, so they have to break the lift, but the blue Dalek with Ian inside can't get into it. Now we realise that finally, Ian unstuck the head and was able to leave it in time.The four humans arrive in time to tell the Thals that they cannot hide in the forst forever. In fact, the Daleks are planning to bomb all the planet. However, the Thals have become peaceful, too peaceful. It was war which destroyed the planet and caused all the destruction and polution in Skaro. The Thals insist, and even the death of one of them was not convincing. Dr. Who tells Ian to take Dyoni to the Daleks. The leader won't allow it, so that settles the matter: they will have to fightSusan and Ian with cross a mutant-infested swamp with some Thals. On their way, they find the tubes which are polluting the water. Elyon stays behind to take some samples of the water, when he is eaten by something from the river.The Daleks are reuniting: they want to destroy the Thals forever. The other four follow the pipes to some caves. There is a fight between the two remaining Thals, because one of them wants to go back and forget the city.Who was supposed te watch some cakes, but they get burnt, to Susan's disappointment. Two female ladies are looking at themselves in the mirror, which gives Who an idea. Ian has to jump over a cliff, which he does, but then one of the Thals seems to have second thoughts over the whole ordeal. With plenty of mirrors, Who and the thals will make the detectors useless. The Daleks start to move on. Dr Who and Susan are captured again. The Daleks start the countdown for the bomb.Finally, one of the Daleks decides that they must fight. Dr. Who offers his time machine if the Daleks don't explode the bomb, but the Daleks will figure it out how it works after having exploded the bomb. Susan, Ian and the two Thals enter the Dalek's castle and run away using another lift. Finally, the rest of the Daleks fight.They reach control room. Two Daleks destroy one another.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Mother of Tears Context: The film begins with members of the Catholic Church digging up the body of a 19th-century church official, whose casket has a box-shaped urn chained to it. Inside the box they discover artifacts belonging to Mater Lachrymarum (Moran Atias), the last surviving member of the Three Mothers; an ancient trio of powerful black witches. In particular, the box contains a magic cloak that, when worn by Mater Lachrymarum, increases her powers significantly. The urn is shipped to the Museum of Ancient Art in Rome where Sarah Mandy (Asia Argento), an American studying art restoration, works. Sarah is dating the curator Michael Pierce, a single father who is away from the museum that night. With help from the assistant curator, Sarah opens the box and finds the cloak, a dagger, and three statues representing the three witches. Sending Sarah to her office to retrieve tools to help her translate the text on the artifacts, the curator is promptly attacked by the demonic agents of Mater Lachrymarum. Sarah arrives too late to save her boss (who is being disembowelled by the monsters) and starts to flee the museum. Unfortunately, she is pursued by Mater Lachrymarum's familiar (a baboon) and is only able to escape when a disembodied voice magically throws open a series of locked doors keeping her trapped inside the museum. Sarah tells the police what happened as she spends the night with Michael and his son. Michael visits the Cardinal who sent him the urn only to find out that, shortly after mailing the urn to him, he had a severe stroke and is now in a coma. An assistant of the priest gives Michael a piece of paper, which the Cardinal was writing on before collapsing. On it is scrawled the name \\"Mater Lachrymarum\\".

When left on the walls, soap scum is formed and mildew and molds grow. To prevent the build up of these items, squeegee your shower walls and door after each use. Run over the walls and corners with a clean, dry towel to soak up any remaining water. Leave the shower door ajar to allow the area to dry. Maintaining this daily routine will make it easier to clean your travertine shower. To eliminate soap scum, switch from bar soap to liquid soap. While wiping down your shower walls after each use will dramatically decrease the presence of soap scum, mildew, and mold, trace amounts of these items will cover your shower walls. Clean your shower every one to two weeks. Spray the walls and shower door with a gentle cleaner. Allow the product to sit for 5 to 10 minutes. Buff the travertine stone, glass, and metal fixtures with a clean microfiber cloth. Eradicate mineral build-up with a stone scrub, an abrasive cleaner that should be used with caution on polished surfaces. Spray the treated area with a gentle cleaner and blot with a microfiber cloth. Constant exposure to water can damage travertine tiles, ruin grout, and encourage the production of soap scum, mildew, and mold. To maintain a clean, structurally sound shower, conduct a deep clean and an assessment every six months. Treat your walls with a soap film remover to remove soap scum build up. Allow the product to sit for a few minutes before polishing it off with a microfiber rag. Target mildew and mold in your shower with a mild mildew remover. After allowing product to sit for a few minutes, remove the residue with a clean microfiber rag. Examine your grout and search for cracks and holes. If you discover any missing grout, repair it immediately—cracks and holes in the grout may lead to extensive water damage. Allow the repaired grout to cure for 7 to 10 days. Observe the tiles for discoloration. If you spot a dark tile that was once light, this is a sign of water absorption. Apply a sealer to your shower.

Options: - Sentence A: \\"I cut the paper with erasers\\" - Sentence B: \\"I cut the paper with scissors\\" Let me think hard. Detailed solution:","response":"To determine which of the two sentences is nonsensical, we need to analyze the content of each sentence and see if it makes logical sense. Sentence A: \\"I cut the paper with erasers\\" - Here, the subject is \\"I,\\" the action is \\"cut,\\" the object being acted upon is \\"the paper,\\" and the tool being used is \\"erasers.\\" - The function of erasers is to remove pencil or ink marks from paper, not to cut paper. Consequently, using erasers to cut paper would be unfeasible, making the sentence nonsensical. Sentence B: \\"I cut the paper with scissors\\" - In this sentence, the subject is still \\"I,\\" the action is \\"cut,\\" the object being acted upon is \\"the paper,\\" and the tool being used is \\"scissors.\\" - Scissors are commonly used to cut paper, which makes this sentence logical and coherent. Therefore, the nonsensical sentence among the given options is Sentence A: \\"I cut the paper with erasers.\\""},{"question":"Here is a premise: Jane shook her head. Here is a hypothesis: Jane waved her head. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","response":"To evaluate whether the hypothesis follows from the premise, we need to first understand the meaning behind both statements and then analyze their relationship. Premise: \\"Jane shook her head.\\" This statement implies that Jane moved her head from side to side, presumably to indicate disagreement, disapproval, or a negative response to something. Hypothesis: \\"Jane waved her head.\\" This statement seems to suggest that Jane moved her head in a larger, more noticeable manner, typically used to indicate some form of greeting or acknowledgement. The word \\"waved\\" creates some ambiguity when describing the movement of one's head, as it is more commonly used to describe the movement of one's hand or arm. Now, let's analyze the relationship between these statements. To determine if the hypothesis is true given that the premise is correct, we must examine whether there is a logical connection between Jane shaking her head and Jane waving her head. While both statements describe Jane moving her head, they have completely different implications. As mentioned earlier, shaking her head is typically associated with a negative response or disagreement, while waving her head, if done in an exaggerated manner, might convey greeting or acknowledgement. Thus, it is not possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. Although both statements involve movement, the specific actions in each statement (shaking and waving) imply distinct meanings and purposes. Therefore, the truthfulness of the premise, \\"Jane shook her head,\\" does not guarantee the truthfulness of the hypothesis, \\"Jane waved her head.\\""},{"question":"Write a sentence not in English.","response":"I will write a sentence in Spanish, as it is the second most spoken language in the world.

He had the good opportunity to see various tidal conditions. First he saw the spring tide, which he noted as case A. About a week later he saw the neap tide. He noted that as case B. Rob got curious about the science behind various tidal conditions. But I can use this background: When the Moon is at first quarter or third quarter, the Sun and Moon are separated by 90° when viewed from the Earth, and the solar tidal force partially cancels the Moon's tidal force. At these points in the lunar cycle, the tide's range is at its minimum; this is called the neap tide, or neaps. Neap is an Anglo-Saxon word meaning \\"without the power\\", as in forðganges nip (forth-going without-the-power).Spring tides result in high waters that are higher than average, low waters that are lower than average, 'slack water' time that is shorter than average, and stronger tidal currents than average. Neaps result in less extreme tidal conditions. There is about a seven-day interval between springs and neaps. What is an answer for this question: In which case the low waters would be higher, case A or case B? A:","response":"In case B, the low waters would be higher. This is because case B represents the neap tide, which results in less extreme tidal conditions. During neap tides, high waters are lower than average, and low waters are higher than average. In contrast, case A represents the spring tide, which causes high waters to be higher than average and low waters to be lower than average."},{"question":"Identify the most salient words in this sentence: ferns and ivy growing from rock next to a small waterfall","response":"Step 1: Read the sentence and understand its meaning.

Five grammatical cases are distinguished : nominative , genitive , dative , accusative , and vocative . Do these sentences mean the same thing?","response":"Yes, these sentences essentially mean the same thing. They both convey the same information about distinguishing five grammatical cases: nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, and vocative. The difference between them lies in the choice of words and punctuation, but both sentences express the same underlying idea. 1. \\"Five grammatical cases are differentiated: nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, and vocative.\\" 2. \\"Five grammatical cases are distinguished: nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, and vocative.\\" Here is a breakdown of these sentences: - In the first sentence, the verb \\"differentiated\\" is used, whereas in the second sentence, the verb \\"distinguished\\" is used. Both of these verbs mean to recognize or identify differences or to make distinctions between things. In the context of grammatical cases, \\"differentiated\\" and \\"distinguished\\" can be considered synonymous. - The first sentence does not include the serial or 'Oxford' comma before the conjunction \\"and,\\" while the second sentence does. The use or omission of the serial comma may depend on individual preference or a style guide being followed; it does not change the meaning of the sentence. To summarize, both sentences convey the same idea regarding the differentiation or distinguishing of five grammatical cases in the order of nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, and vocative. The choice of words and punctuation may vary, but the meaning remains consistent between the two sentences."},{"question":"Title: For Hard Cores only.

How to prevent blocked sweat glands Wash your skin with antiseptic soap. Use a gentle, non-irritating soap to wash your skin, focusing on areas that are most likely to be affected by blocked sweat glands. These areas include the groin, armpits, beneath the breast, and any other area of skin that folds against itself.","response":"The most logical next event after understanding how to prevent blocked sweat glands and washing your skin with antiseptic soap would be to continue taking further preventative measures, such as wearing loose and breathable clothing, maintaining good personal hygiene, and addressing underlying causes for blocked sweat glands. In detail, the following steps are essential: 1. Wear loose, breathable clothing: Opt for loose-fitting clothes that allow your skin to breathe and are made from natural fibers, such as cotton. This reduces friction, irritation, and chafing, which in turn decreases the likelihood of sweat glands becoming clogged. 2. Change clothes frequently: Try to change your clothes, especially underwear and workout clothes, daily and immediately after engaging in any physical activity that causes sweating. This helps remove sweat and bacteria from the skin's surface, reducing the risk of blocked sweat glands. 3. Use lightweight and non-comedogenic moisturizers: Applying heavy creams or moisturizers can contribute to clogged pores. Choose a lightweight, non-comedogenic product that won't block your pores. 4. Maintain proper hydration: Staying hydrated helps support your body's natural detoxification process and keeps your skin functioning optimally. Aim to drink between 2 to 3 liters of water daily, and increase this amount if you're sweating excessively or are in a hot or humid environment. 5. Monitor your diet: Monitor your diet and limit excessively fatty, sugary, or salty foods. Instead, consume a well-balanced diet that includes a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats to support overall skin health and your body's natural detoxification systems. 6. Exfoliate regularly: By regularly incorporating a gentle exfoliation routine, you can remove dead skin cells and unclog pores. Use a gentle scrub or body brush to exfoliate areas prone to sweat gland blockages. 7. Manage stress: Stress can contribute to excessive sweating and blocked glands. Engaging in stress-relieving activities like meditation, yoga, or mindfulness exercises can help decrease stress levels and reduce the likelihood of gland blockages. 8. Regularly examine your skin: Make it a habit to examine the areas of your skin that are prone to blocked sweat glands. By frequently checking these areas, you can detect early signs of blockage and take corrective action accordingly. 9. Consult a healthcare professional: If you're experiencing recurrent blocked sweat glands, it's essential to consult a healthcare professional to rule out a more serious underlying issue, like an infection or a chronic health condition. 10. Consider medical treatments: If preventative measures are not effective enough, consult a dermatologist or healthcare professional for guidance on medical treatments such as oral or topical antibiotics, anti-inflammatory medication, or other therapies that target specific skin conditions related to blocked sweat glands. 11. Maintain overall health: Supporting your overall health and wellness is crucial in preventing blocked sweat glands and related skin issues. Regular exercise, a balanced diet, proper hydration, stress management, and sufficient sleep are all critical factors to consider for maintaining good health and minimizing the risk of sweat gland issues."},{"question":"This is some data: The Waterman eatType restaurant; The Waterman food Italian; The Waterman priceRange cheap; The Waterman customer rating 5 out of 5; The Waterman area riverside; The Waterman familyFriendly yes.

While on a safari in Australia, Albert discovered two new species of live-bearing tetrapods. In the first species, species A, the adult individuals had high body mass on average. In the second species, species B, the adult individuals had low body mass on average. Which species will have longer lifespans? Answer:","response":"To answer this question, we need to consider the factors that may affect the lifespan of species A and species B. Step 1: Identify factors that could affect lifespan Some factors that could impact the lifespan of a species include body mass, metabolic rate, predation, disease, and environmental conditions. Step 2: Evaluate the impact of body mass on lifespan In general, animals with larger body mass tend to have longer lifespans because they often have slower metabolic rates, which can result in reduced cellular damage over time. However, this observation may not hold true for all species because other factors can also play a significant role in determining lifespan. Step 3: Consider other factors that may influence lifespan In addition to body mass, other factors could have a more significant impact on the lifespan of species A and species B. For instance: - If species A has a more stable food supply or habitat, it could live longer. - If species B is more resistant to diseases or has fewer predators, it may live longer despite its lower body mass. - If species A or B has evolved better longevity strategies, such as more efficient DNA repair mechanisms, it may live longer. Step 4: Compare the overall factors for both species Without more information on factors like metabolic rate, predation, disease resistance, and environmental conditions for species A and species B, it's difficult to definitively determine which species will have a longer life span based solely on body mass. Conclusion: Although larger body mass often correlates with longer lifespans, it's not possible to determine which of the two species (A or B) will have longer lifespans without more information on other influential factors."},{"question":"Answer this question: who has sold the most records in hip hop??","response":"As of now, the artist who holds the title for the most record sales in hip-hop history is Marshall Bruce Mathers III, professionally known as Eminem. Born on October 17, 1972, in St. Joseph, Missouri, Eminem is an American rapper, songwriter, and record producer. With over 220 million records sold worldwide, he has become one of the most successful and influential hip-hop artists in history.

He grew up in a predominantly black, working-class Detroit neighborhood, where he developed his unique style and perspective. He started participating in rap battles and eventually caught the attention of rapper and producer Dr. Dre, who signed him to his label, Aftermath Entertainment, in 1998. Eminem's first major-label album, \\"The Slim Shady LP,\\" was released in 1999. It debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 chart and went on to achieve multi-platinum status. Some of the hit singles from the album include \\"My Name Is,\\" \\"Role Model,\\" and \\"Guilty Conscience.\\" In 2000, he released his third studio album, \\"The Marshall Mathers LP,\\" which sold over 1.76 million copies in its first week. The album went on to be certified diamond in the United States and is considered one of the greatest hip-hop albums of all time. The album featured hit singles such as \\"The Real Slim Shady,\\" \\"Stan,\\" and \\"The Way I Am.\\" Eminem's success continued with the 2002 release of \\"The Eminem Show,\\" which included singles like \\"Without Me,\\" \\"Cleanin' Out My Closet,\\" and \\"Sing for the Moment.\\" This album also went on to be certified diamond in the United States.

In 2003, he was listed on Rolling Stone's list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. Eminem's impact and influence on hip-hop culture and music as a whole have been substantial. He is seen as a trailblazer for white rappers, proving that talent, authenticity, and dedication can break barriers in a predominantly black genre. He has inspired countless artists to pursue careers in rap and hip-hop and remains a prominent figure in the music world to this day. Though other artists like Jay-Z, Kanye West, and Tupac Shakur have also sold millions of records and made significant impacts on the hip-hop genre, Eminem's sales and cultural influence make him the current record holder in hip-hop history."},{"question":"What happens next in this paragraph?

The structure resembles a cross section of a swimming pool, essentially two concave ramps (or quarter-pipes), topped by copings and decks, facing each other across a flat transition, also known as a \\"tranny\\". Originally half-pipes were half sections of a large diameter pipe. Since the 1980s, half-pipes contain an extended \\"flat bottom\\" between the quarter-pipes; the original style half-pipes are no longer built. Flat ground provides time to regain balance after landing and more time to prepare for the next trick. - Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe. Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City.

Context: Facebook has a long track record and sordid history of abusing their users’ trust and privacy, including the most recent and egregious cases currently making headlines with Cambridge Analytica as well as election meddling in the US and Britain. As if that wasn’t enough, it then came to light that they have also been tracking and storing users’ phone call and text message data, including “who contacted whom, what time, and how long the conversation was.” This is nothing new, as we can see from this 2012 “study” in which they deliberately manipulated news feeds to influence users’ emotional state. And again with their settlement with the FCC back in 2011 (that they likely violated with their recent offenses) over deceiving consumers by telling them their information was private, but then repeatedly sharing it and making it public. And then there’s The Ugly Memo, in which a FB exec justifies growth at any cost in the name of connecting people, even if that results literally in people dying: We talk about the good and the bad of our work often. I want to talk about the ugly. We connect people. That can be bad if they make it negative. Maybe it costs a life by exposing someone to bullies. Maybe someone dies in a terrorist attack coordinated on our tools. And still we connect people. The ugly truth is that we believe in connecting people so deeply that anything that allows us to connect more people more often is *de facto* good. And up until this most recent Cambridge Analytica scandal, Facebook was negotiating with various healthcare organizations to share patients’ health data with FB so they could match it up to your social circle to allegedly provide better health care.

Question: Will induces diffusion in a gas and a liquid. The gas likely diffuses much faster or slower? Paragraph : This is also called diffusion, and the process is much faster in gases than in liquids, because the particles in gases are further apart. A:","response":"Based on the given paragraph, the process of diffusion is much faster in gases than in liquids. The primary reason for this increased rate of diffusion in gases is attributed to the fact that particles in gases are further apart from each other compared to those in liquids. Diffusion is the process in which particles spread out evenly within a given space as a result of their inherent kinetic energy, which drives them to move randomly. In both gases and liquids, molecules are in constant motion, colliding with each other and their container walls. However, there are some key factors that cause the difference in diffusion rates between gases and liquids: 1. Particle spacing: In gases, the particles are spaced much further apart than they are in liquids. This allows them to travel greater distances without being obstructed by neighboring particles, making diffusion more efficient. In contrast, the particles in liquids are more tightly packed together, which results in more frequent collisions, thereby slowing down the rate of diffusion. 2. Kinetic energy: Since gas molecules possess higher kinetic energy than liquid molecules, they tend to move at faster speeds, resulting in quicker diffusion. The increased movement and speed of these gas particles contribute to the overall faster rate of diffusion compared to that in liquids. 3. Intermolecular forces: Lower intermolecular forces in gases allow the particles to move more freely than in liquids, where these forces are much stronger. The stronger forces in liquids keep particles relatively closer, thus slowing down the diffusion process as the particles encounter more resistance while moving. In conclusion, induced diffusion in a gas occurs at a much faster rate than in a liquid due to the greater spacing between gas particles, their higher kinetic energy, and the weaker intermolecular forces present in gases compared to liquids."},{"question":"(CNN) -- The U.S. space shuttle program retired in 2011, leaving American astronauts to hitchhike into orbit. But after three long years, NASA's successor is almost ready to make an entrance. Orion, the agency's newest manned spaceship, is being prepared for its first mission in December. In future missions, it will journey into deep space -- to Mars and beyond -- farther than humans have ever gone before. Orion comes loaded with superlatives. It boasts the largest heat shield ever built and a computer 400 times faster than the ones on the space shuttles. It will be launched into space on the most powerful rocket NASA has ever made. No astronauts will be aboard the December flight, which will test the spacecraft's systems for future manned missions. Final work on the spacecraft is under way at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Orion came one step closer to completion this month with the stacking of the crew module atop the service module. \\"Now that we're getting so close to launch, the spacecraft completion work is visible every day,\\" Orion Program Manager Mark Geyer said in a statement. A 3,600-mile journey When complete, the Orion capsule will resemble a fencing foil, with a tall spire shooting up from a rounded base. At the top will sit a launch abort system, with downward-facing thrusters that would save the crew from a jarring crash in the event of a rocket malfunction. The bottom portion, the service module, will perform various functions such as in-space propulsion and cargo storage. Nestled between the two will be the crew module, capable of supporting human life from launch until recovery. Attached to the service module will be a United Launch Alliance Delta IV Heavy rocket. For the first time since the space shuttle's debut launch in 1981, the crew compartment will ride on the tip of the rocket rather than hanging onto its side, evoking the configuration of the famous Apollo or Gemini missions.

The trope isn’t entirely Hollywood fantasy, but the reality of emerging tattoo recognition technology is closer to a dystopian tech thriller. Soon, we may see police departments using algorithms to scrape tattoos from surveillance video or cops in the field using mobile apps to analyze tattoos during stops. Depending on the tattoo, such technology could be used to instantly reveal personal information, such as your religious beliefs or political affiliations. For years, law enforcement has used tattoos to identify criminal suspects as well as unidentified victims. Police have also used tattoos to map out subcultures and networks of gangs and hate groups. Until recently, however, tattoo matching and analysis has involved flipping through the pages of photo binders; any computer-assisted matching has been limited to metadata searches of keywords. NIST's Official Tattoo Recognition Technology Logo In 2014 and 2015, federal researchers at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) joined forces with the FBI to launch a program to accelerate tattoo recognition technology. As part of Tatt-C (the code name for NIST’s \\"Tattoo Recognition Technology Challenge\\"), officials assembled a giant dataset of prisoner tattoos and divvied it out to biometric companies, research institutions, and universities. They were asked to run five experiments to show how well their algorithms could match tattoos under various circumstances. Some tests involved matching different photos of the same person’s tattoo. Other experiments sought to match similar tattoos on different people based on their characteristics—such as a crucifix, Minnie Mouse, and Chinese calligraphy. These tests pose serious concerns for privacy, free expression, religious freedom, and the right of association. Each one of these experiments correlated to a specific law enforcement use. The Tatt-C results, released last summer, now serve as a crystal ball into what law enforcement has planned for this technology over the years to come. Here are the five tests and what they tell use about the future of tattoo recognition technology. Related: Learn why EFF is calling for an end to this research. Note on the data: The Tatt-C dataset contained 15,000 images obtained by the FBI from prisoners. The dataset was split into subsets and sub-subsets for individual trials. Tatt-C participants self-reported their results, which were not independently verified. The percentages below reflect the accuracy within the experiment, and not necessarily how accurate the technology would perform in the real world. Tattoo Detection: Why would police want algorithms that can detect whether an image has a tattoo or not? Any given law enforcement agency may be sitting on an immense, unsorted collection of images. Mugshots, scars, birthmarks, and tattoos—all mixed up together, some unlabeled, some mislabeled. Without computer assistance, it could take significant staff-power to sort through it all. NIST suggests that automated tattoo detection would streamline an agency’s ability to classify images. Perhaps the more concerning use case for privacy advocates is that tattoo detection technology would also pave the way for algorithms to isolate tattoos from images scraped from the Internet or captured by security cameras. The bad news is the technology is already highly sophisticated. Tatt-C’s research team reported back that three different organizations’ algorithms could detect a tattoo in an image with more than 90% accuracy. The private biometric technology company MorphoTrak (a subsidiary of Safran) claimed the best result; their algorithm was able to detect whether an image contained a tattoo or not with 96.3% accuracy. Tattoo Identification: When we say biometrics, we are talking about unique physical or behavioral characteristics that can be used to identity you. Fingerprinting has been used by criminal justice agencies for over a century to identify suspects; tattoo recognition can be used in much the same way. Let’s say a cop is questioning someone on the street who refuses to provide an ID card. The officer could run a photo of one of the person’s tattoos through a database to find a photo of the same tattoo captured during a previous arrest. One situation NIST imagines is applying tattoo recognition technology to video surveillance of a robbery in which the suspect is wearing a mask but a neck tattoo is visible. Just as facial recognition technology raises serious privacy concerns, people should be wary of tattoo recognition technology’s invasiveness. Not only can it identify everyday people caught on camera while going about their business, it could eventually lead to tracking people using their tattoos. NIST asked Tatt-C participants to match a photo of a tattoo to other pictures of the photo taken over time. Four different companies and research institutions reported that their algorithm could return a hit on the first result with more than 95% accuracy. Again, MorphoTrak came out on top, returning a hit with 99.4% accuracy. Region of Interest: NIST uses “Region of Interest” to describe how well an algorithm can match a small piece of a tattoo to a wider image of the whole tattoo. For example, could the algorithm recognize that a tiny skull tattoo is part of a larger half-sleeve arm tattoo. The idea here is that sometimes only a portion of a tattoo is caught on surveillance; is that enough to identify someone if police have the whole tattoo on file? This technology would also help police match a tattoo, even if the person subsequently added more to the design. Yet again, MorphoTrak provided the most accurate results: the algorithm could return a hit on the first result with 94.6% accuracy. Purdue University, which has developed an app [.pdf] with support from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, was close behind with 91.6% accuracy. Mixed Media: When you get a tattoo, the artist rarely inks their first draft on your skin. The artist will draw it out on paper, then turn it into a purple transfer to trace out with the needles. The question for researchers is whether an algorithm can reverse engineer this process; rather than matching tattoos to tattoos, can they match a tattoo to an image in another medium. If a witness sees a tattoo during a crime, they could describe it for a sketch artist, who could run the sketch through a tattoo database. Or, if an officer wants to see if a tattoo correlates to a gang symbol, the tattoo could be compared to street graffiti. But this technology sets law enforcement on a dangerous path, since it would allow a police officer to learn more than just your identity, but your interests, political beliefs, or religion. An investigator could plug an image of an Anarchist circle-A or the Republican elephant into its database to return a list of people who have tattoos of those images. This technology is on the horizon, but at this stage it is still relatively underdeveloped. The MITRE Corporation—a non-profit organization that manages research centers on behalf of the federal government—produced the most successful results. The algorithm could produce matches within the first 10 results with 36.5% accuracy. Although that number is fairly low, that may not prevent law enforcement from using it to generate leads. However, less reliable algorithms have greater potential of capturing innocent people in investigations. Tattoo Similarity: One of the most worrisome applications of tattoo recognition technology is its potential ability to reveal connections or shared beliefs among a population. For example, rather than matching a particular tattoo of a crucifix with an individual, police could run the image of a crucifix through a database to produce a long set of people with similar cross tattoos. This essentially means police would be able to create lists of people based on their religion, politics, or other affiliations as expressed by their tattoos. This type of tattoo matching could sweep up fans of the same bands or members of the same labor union or military unit. This application has a high likelihood of generating false positives—matching someone whose tattoo may be visually similar, but not actually symbolically similar. That could result in people being improperly associated with groups, such as gangs, with which they have no actual affiliation. Law enforcement primarily wants to use this technology to identify members of gangs and hate groups, who often use coded symbols to express their affiliation. But that’s not necessarily what NIST researchers focused on during Tatt-C’s “Tattoo Similarity Experiments,” which tested how well algorithms could match different tattoos with similar visual features. Many of the images NIST asked participants to analyze were religious symbols—often Catholic iconography, such as hands holding rosaries and Jesus Christ’s crucifixion. This should raise bright red flags for those concerned about religious freedom, especially in light of how authoritarian governments have used tattoos to oppress religious minorities. Nazi Germany’s use of tattoos to track Jews during the Holocaust comes to mind. Indeed, the six-pointed Star of David was one of the images used during the NIST experiments. However, in that case, the star also serves as the symbol of the Gangster Disciples, a Chicago street gang. So even when law enforcement is attempting to use tattoos to investigate gangs, people who are simply expressing their religion could be labeled as affiliates of criminal gangs. The good news is that the technology is still in its early stages. Researchers attributed the drop in accuracy to a problem they called the “semantic gap.” That refers to the difficulty computers have in divining meaning from tattoos that contain relevant symbols, but are not clearly visually similar. MITRE achieved the best results; its algorithm could establish a correct match within the first 10 results with 14.9% accuracy. What’s Next Although the NIST and FBI experiments were largely academic research exercises, law enforcement is already deploying the technology. Purdue University, with support from the Department of Homeland Security, has developed a graffiti and tattoo matching app—GARI—that is now in use by law enforcement agencies across the state of Indiana. Meanwhile, companies like MorphoTrak and DataWorks are now offering tattoo recognition as part of biometric software packages that also include fingerprint scanning, iris scanning, DNA analysis and facial recognition. We know that sheriff's departments in California have contracts with these companies. It’s also clear that the lessons learned from the Tatt-C project are being used to refine future research and tattoo recognition technology. Following the Tatt-C project, NIST released training materials for law enforcement that explained how camera framing and lighting can make tattoos more easily recognizable by algorithms. Researchers further recommended that an even larger dataset—more than 100,000 images—be compiled for distribution to third-party researchers. This summer, NIST plans to launch its next major series of experiments: Tatt-E, short for the Tattoo Recognition Technology Evaluation. Using tattoo databases from the Michigan State Police, Tennessee Department of Corrections, and the Pinellas County Sheriff’s Office in Florida, NIST intends to run a similar set of tests internally, connecting to each algorithm through an API. For the sake of civil liberties, privacy, and dignity, we believe that NIST should halt this program immediately. Take action now to call for an end to experimentation with our tattoos. ||||| Tattoo Recognition Technology – Challenge (Tatt-C) Tatt-C Publications September 15, 2015: The first public report on Tatt-C has been published as NISTIR 8078 – Tattoo Recognition Technology – Challenge (Tatt-C) Outcomes and Recommendations.

The Tattoo Recognition Technology – Challenge (Tatt-C) is being conducted to challenge the commercial and academic community in advancing research and development into automated image-based tattoo matching technology. The activity will assess the capability of image-based tattoo recognition algorithms to perform detection and retrieval of tattoos, with the goals to determine which algorithms are most effective and whether any are viable for the following operational use-cases: 1. Tattoo Similarity – matching visually similar or related tattoos from different subjects; 2. Tattoo Identification - matching different instances of the same tattoo image from the same subject over time; 3. Region of Interest - matching a small region of interest that is contained in a larger image; 4. Mixed Media - matching visually similar or related tattoos using different types of images (e.g. sketches, scanned print, computer graphics, or natural images); 5. Tattoo Detection - detecting whether an image contains a tattoo or not. Interested Parties Please contact NIST if: a) You are a developer of tattoo matching algorithms or have an interest in developing such a capability. b) You represent an organization possessing suitable tattoo datasets that might be valuable to our effort. c) You have an operational interest or need for image-based matching of tattoo images. Background Tattoos have been used for many years to assist law enforcement in the identification of criminals and victims and for investigative research purposes. Historically, law enforcement agencies have followed the ANSI-NIST-ITL 1-2011 standard to collect and assign keyword labels to tattoos. This keyword labeling approach comes with drawbacks, which include the limitation of ANSI-NIST standard class labels to describe the increasing variety of new tattoo designs, the need for multiple keywords to sufficiently describe some tattoos, and subjectivity in human annotation as the same tattoo can be labeled differently between examiners. As such, the shortcomings of keyword-based tattoo image retrieval have driven the need for automated image-based tattoo recognition capabilities. Structure of Tatt-C Tatt-C is structured around problems that are designed to challenge the commercial and academic community in advancing research and development into automated image-based tattoo recognition technology. While some research and commercial capability is available, tattoo recognition is not a mature industry. There is no common test data and use cases to evaluate and develop systems for next generation government applications. To address this shortcoming, the Tatt-C dataset was developed as an initial tattoo test corpus that addresses use cases derived from operational scenarios provided by the FBI’s Biometric Center of Excellence (BCOE). The Tatt-C dataset consists of still images of tattoos captured operationally by law enforcement agencies. The operational nature of this corpus imposes challenges on traditional image retrieval methodologies given the large variation in capture environment/process and tattoo content/quality. The following are examples of such challenges represented in the Tatt-C dataset: Inconsistent image lighting and scale Occlusions due to clothing and different image backgrounds Different tattoo background or embellishments around primary tattoo content Blended images or multiple tattoos in a single image Inconsistent orientation of body/appendages and images Extremely faded tattoos Ambiguous or unfamiliar abstractions (difficult or impossible for different people to view and interpret consistently) The Tatt-C dataset provides a basis for objectively measuring and comparing tattoo recognition capabilities, with partitions focused on but not limited to the following use cases: Tattoo Similarity. What is the retrieval performance for finding visually similar or related tattoos from different subjects? Tattoo Identification. What is the retrieval performance for finding different instances of the same tattoo image from the same subject over time? Region of Interest. What is the retrieval performance for finding a small region of interest that is contained in a larger image? Mixed Media. What is the retrieval performance for finding visually similar or related tattoos using different types of images (e.g. sketches, scanned print, computer graphics, or natural images)? Tattoo Detection. What is the performance for detecting whether an image contains a tattoo or not? Reference Please cite references to the Tatt-C dataset as: Mei Ngan and Patrick Grother.

Earlier this week the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST), which is a part of the US Department of Commerce, hosted a challenge to explore how recognition technology could be used to identify people based on their tattoos. The event, which was the first of its kind, was called the Tattoo Recognition Technology — Challenge (Tatt-C) and was sponsored by the FBI's Biometric Center for Excellence. The participants, which included six groups from both academia and the commercial sector, were given a large data set and asked to create algorithms that scan the information and make identifying people easier based on their body art. Some of the tasks in the challenge included developing algorithms that can do things like identify an image that contains a tattoo, or matching an image of body art with an image of person who has the same tattoo. So why is the government trying to improve its tattoo-based recognition technology? Well, for starters its current process for using body art data is incredibly outdated, said Mai Ngan, a computer scientist for NIST who helped organize the event. \\"Right now, law enforcement collects tattoos and labels them using a text-based approach. But that method is not working for a number of reasons,\\" Ngan told Business Insider. Currently, law enforcement has been assigning keyword labels to tattoos in a database to help identify people. But that system isn't really effective because examiners describe tattoos differently or they simply aren't filling out information about the tattoo at all, Ngan said. Because the current system is so flawed, there's a need for automated image-based tattoo matching technology to be adopted. But the government also wants to improve the system because tattoos can prove helpful in identifying criminals or victims when there isn't much other biometric data available. \\"Tattoos have been used for a long, long time to help with the identification of people and also for investigative research,\\" Ngan said. \\"Tattoos aren't what we call a primary biometric, so they aren't a fingerprint or an iris. They can't uniquely identify a person. But in the cases where you don't have a face or a fingerprint, tattoos are helping cold cases to progress the investigation,\\" Ngan said. While one in five in the U.S. currently have some sort of body ink, the rate of tattoos among criminals is much higher, which is a big reason why law enforcement has taken such an interest in the technology, she said. However, improving the current system doesn't mean that the government wants to keep tabs on everyone who has a tattoo. Most of the tattoo data is collected when someone is arrested and booked, Ngan said. \\"The government doesn't have plans to collect everyone who has a tattoo,\\" Ngan said. \\"We don't want to judge, just because you have a tattoo doesn't mean you are a criminal.\\" ||||| An EFF Investigation Finds NIST/FBI Experimented with Religious Tattoos, Exploited Prisoners, and Handed Private Data to Third Parties Without Thorough Oversight Tattoos are inked on our skin, but they often hold much deeper meaning. They may reveal who we are, our passions, ideologies, religious beliefs, and even our social relationships. That’s exactly why law enforcement wants to crack the symbolism of our tattoos using automated computer algorithms, an effort that threatens our civil liberties. Right now, government scientists are working with the FBI to develop tattoo recognition technology that police can use to learn as much as possible about people through their tattoos. But an EFF investigation has found that these experiments exploit inmates, with little regard for the research’s implications for privacy, free expression, religious freedom, and the right to associate. And so far, researchers have avoided ethical oversight while doing it. The research program is so fraught with problems that EFF believes the only solution tis for the government to suspend the project immediately. At a minimum, scientists must stop using any tattoo images obtained coercively from prison and jail inmates and tattoos that contain personal information or religious or political symbolism. EFF has been filing public records requests around the country to reveal how law enforcement agencies are using mobile biometric technology—including facial recognition, digital fingerprinting, and iris scanning—to identify people based on their physical and behavioral characteristics. As part of this investigation, we learned that the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), one of the oldest federal scientific institutions, began an initiative in 2014 to promote and refine automated tattoo recognition technology for the FBI. Tattoos, of course, are a biometric characteristic, but they’re also unique because they’re elective (people generally choose to get tattoos) and expressive (they say things about our personal lives). Importantly, tattoos are also speech, and any attempt to identify, profile, sort, or link people based on their ink raises significant First Amendment questions. The FBI’s plans for automated tattoo recognition go beyond developing algorithms that can identify people by their tattoos. The experiments facilitated by NIST also focused on improving technology that can map connections between people with similarly themed tattoos or make inferences about people from their tattoos (e.g. political ideology, religious beliefs). On top of the free speech concerns, the project should raise red flags for religious liberty advocates, since many of the experiments involved sorting people and their tattoos based on Christian iconography. NIST’s Tattoo Recognition Technology program also raises serious questions for privacy: 15,000 images of tattoos obtained from arrestees and inmates were handed over to third parties, including private companies, with little restriction on how the images may be used or shared. Many of the images reviewed by EFF contained personally identifying information, including people’s names, faces, and birth dates. If that wasn’t alarming enough, NIST researchers also failed to follow protocol for ethical research involving humans—they only sought permission from supervisors after the first major set of experiments were completed. These same researchers have also not disclosed to their supervisors that the tattoo datasets they are using to seed the experiments came from prisoners and arrestees. Under federal research guidelines, research involving prisoners triggers enhanced scrutiny and ethical oversight to prevent their exploitation. Instead, NIST and the FBI are treating inmates as an endless supply of free data. Now, with NIST and the FBI on the precipice of a new, larger experiment that will use upwards of 100,000 tattoo images, officials must suspend any further research into tattoo recognition technology until they address the First Amendment, ethical, and privacy concerns EFF has identified. Learn more about NIST's experiments and five ways law enforcement would like to use tattoo recognition technology. Updated June 6, 2016: NIST provided a written response to reporters and EFF. Note: Because many of the tattoo images in the data set contain personal information, EFF will not be re-publishing any government records featuring the images. Tattoos and Law Enforcement Tattoos are free speech that we wear on our skin. When we look at our tattoos, we may see important milestones in our lives or mistakes that we made in our youth. We may see symbols that represent our ethnic heritage or our pride in our affiliations, such as our military units, church membership, or political ideology. We get tattoos of the musicians and films that have enchanted us, or we memorialize the birth of our children and the family members who have passed away. Some may even get tattoos of our medical conditions in case of an emergency. Our tattoos express who we were, who we are, and who we hope to be. But when law enforcement looks at our tattoos, they see unique biometric identifiers and a shortcut to learning our personal beliefs and our social connections. Today, law enforcement generally obtains images of tattoos by photographing detainees during the jail booking process or during prison intake. However, police have been known to collect data on tattoos during routine stops, often using that information to place people in controversial gang databases. In one particularly heinous case, police in San Diego are being sued after officers entered a strip club, detained workers, forced them to pose nude and took photos of their tattoos. Traditionally, police have used regular cameras to collect these images and kept the photos in physical albums and text-based databases. Now, law enforcement is pursuing mobile devices and apps that can collect and analyze tattoos instantly. Due to recent advances, current algorithms are able to match tattoos with greater than 90% accuracy. However, algorithms that can accurately connect people based on their tattoos are still in their nascent stages. NIST's Official Tattoo Recognition Technology Logo That’s where NIST comes in. In 2014, NIST’s Image Group launched the Tattoo Recognition Technology program, with sponsorship from the FBI’s Biometric Center for Excellence, to conduct experiments to accelerate this technology in the private and academic sectors. The first major foray was called the Tattoo Recognition Technology Challenge—Tatt-C for short. NIST and the FBI compiled an “open tattoo database” of 15,000 images—many, if not most collected from prisoners—that formed the basis of NIST’s Tatt-C competition. The data was distributed to 19 organizations—five research institutions, six universities, and eight private companies, including MorphoTrak, one of the largest marketers of biometric technology to law enforcement agencies. The dataset was designed to be the first standardized metric for testing tattoo recognition algorithms. The Tatt-C competition required participants to perform a series of tests and report their results to NIST, which is part of the U.S. Department of Commerce. These experiments included identifying whether an image contained a tattoo and whether algorithms could match different images of the same tattoo taken over time. The most alarming research involved matching common visual elements between tattoos with operational goal of establishing connections between individuals. This summer, NIST plans to launch the next phase: Tattoo Recognition Technology Evaluation, or Tatt-E. These experiments will be conducted internally by NIST using third-party algorithms to analyze an even larger dataset. NIST researchers are hoping to amass a dataset of more than 100,000 images for experimentation that would be collected by the Pinellas County Sheriff’s Department in Florida, the Michigan State Police, and the Tennessee Department of Corrections. Based on the lack of attention to civil liberties, privacy, and research ethics, EFF believes that Tatt-E should not occur and that NIST’s tattoo recognition research more generally should not move forward without proper oversight. Experimenting With Religious Tattoos NIST was not coy about the information tattoos can reveal about a person’s personal beliefs. As researchers wrote in several of NIST’s whitepapers on tattoo recognition: “Tattoos provide valuable information on an individual’s affiliations or beliefs and can support identity verification of an individual.” Following EFF criticism, NIST scrubbed the \\"religious\\" line from the slide One slide from a workshop went even further. In answering the question of “Why Tattoos?” researchers said that tattoos “suggest affiliation to gangs, sub-cultures, religious or ritualistic beliefs, or political ideology” and “contain intelligence, messages, meaning and motivation.” After EFF brought our concerns to NIST officials, the agency responded by attempting to scrub references to religion and politics from its public documentation. But officials can’t erase how the experiments targeted individuals with religious tattoos. For example, the “tattoo similarity” and “mixed media” experiments tested how well algorithms could match different people’s tattoos that contained visually similar imagery. Many of the tattoos of the test subjects contained Catholic iconography, such as Jesus Christ’s crucifixion, praying hands with rosaries, and Jesus Christ wearing the crown of thorns. It is totally inappropriate for researchers to use religious imagery for experiments, especially if the end result is technology that can be used to group people who share common beliefs. While NIST researchers were enthusiastic about the ability to divine this kind of meaning from tattoos, none of the proposals or subsequent reports analyzed or even acknowledged the potential impact on civil liberties. These experiments may not have been allowed to move forward if they had been conducted with proper oversight, which is why EFF is calling for a suspension of this research. At the very least, no further tests should be allowed that involve religious imagery or linking people based on similar tattoos. Experimenting With Inmates as Human Subjects NIST researchers are using tattoo images obtained from prisons and jails without questioning whether the experiments require enhanced oversight to comply with federal ethical rules regarding research on prisoners. Rather, they are treating inmates as a bottomless pool of free data. When government scientists perform experiments involving people, they are supposed to adhere to the Common Rule, a series of federal regulations and principles for ethical research. The Common Rule was developed in response to historically troubling scientific research on humans, such as U.S. experiments with syphilis on African-American men in the South. Its purpose is to provide independent oversight of any research conducted on humans. The rule also imposes heightened scrutiny on research involving vulnerable populations, such as prisoners. Today, the Common Rule has been adopted by more than 15 federal agencies, including NIST. Whenever research involves prisoners, the Common Rule has a special, independent section that limits the types of experiments than can be conducted and requires rigorous oversight by an Independent Review Board (IRB). That oversight body must include at least one inmate or their representative. The goal is to protect prisoners and detainees from being coerced into becoming research subjects merely because they are incarcerated. NIST’s first tattoo recognition experiment, Tatt-C did not go through this process in advance of conducting the research, despite the fact that the images were collected from inmates. Documents obtained by EFF through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) show that project leaders didn’t even run their experiments up the ladder for ethical review until after the experiments were completed. The researchers claimed they didn’t know that was required. A NIST Supervisor retroactively exempted research from oversight. In their subsequent filings to supervisors, these researchers failed to disclose that the research involved prisoners. Instead, researchers only said that the information was “operationally collected.” NIST officials later retroactively approved the research after concluding that it did not involve research on human subjects, much less research on prisoners. However, the images themselves clearly show that samples came from prisoners. Many of the images feature inmates in prison uniforms and, in some cases, handcuffs. Thus, the images were taken for law enforcement purposes, not for research, raising questions about whether prisoners were aware that their personal information would be used in this way, and whether they consented to being research subjects. NIST further claims that the research did not require IRB review because the FBI had stripped the images of all “identifiable private information.” What NIST means is that the names of the individuals were removed and replaced with code, although other identifiers were maintained. We believe this step did not render the images free of identifiable private information. Tattoos are inherent personally identifiable information—a tattoo is unique to the person who wears it. Otherwise, law enforcement would have no interest in using tattoos to identify subjects. Beyond that, the tattoos themselves often included sensitive, identifiable information, such as names and dates of birth of relatives. This is further underscored by how NIST characterized the research in an article promoting the project in NIST's in-house magazine: the headline read, “Nothing Says You Like a Tattoo.” Researchers are attempting to have it both ways. In scientific papers, NIST regularly emphasized that tattoos are valuable for identifying people, but when it came to filing disclosures, researchers contradicted themselves, saying “tattoo images are not well-suited for individual identification.” Yet, several algorithms were able to match an individual’s tattoos with more than 95% accuracy. With the upcoming Tatt-E project, EFF is concerned that researchers will once more ignore the fact that these images are identifiable and came from prisoners. Although researchers working on Tatt-E are now asking supervisors for approval before doing any work with the tattoo images, time and time again over the last year, supervisors have declined to require IRB oversight. EFF believes that these determinations have been based on incomplete evaluations and misstatements about the nature of the images. NIST’s failure to follow the Common Rule’s oversight requirements is not some procedural hiccup. Inmates are unable to opt out of law enforcement taking photos of their tattoos in a correctional setting. Worse, the images are now being used for an entirely different purpose and it is highly unlikely that the FBI sought informed consent before handing over the images to third parties for research. These problems underscore EFF’s concerns about scientific ethics and human rights, especially since images captured under duress were handed over to third parties, several of which are for-profit businesses that will ultimately financially benefit from access to the dataset. The agency should act responsibly and halt the program until it goes through the full oversight process. Research Lacking Basic Privacy Safeguards EFF is also concerned that NIST and the FBI did not impose adequate privacy safeguard before sharing a massive tattoo database containing personal information with a number of private companies. The documentation indicates that the Tatt-C dataset was provided to third parties with very little restrictions on who can access the images and how long the images may be retained. As a result, many of the public reports and presentations published online contain images of tattoos that should not have been made publicly available. NIST’s position contradicts the agency’s own guidelines for protecting Personally Identifiable Information (PII). In 2010, the agency published a handbook on how other federal agencies can protect PII from online data breaches. In the handbook, NIST advisors stated that photographic images and biometric data are PII, especially images that reveal a person’s religion, date of birth, or “activities.” From NIST's \\"Guide to Protecting the Confidentiality of Personally Identifiable Information\\": EFF’s review of the images made public shows that PII was not fully removed from the files. Several of the images contained text spelling the names of family members. In at least two cases, these included the full names of the family members. In another tattoo, a 14-year-old child’s name was listed along with her date of birth. Many of the tattoos were located on parts of the body that would not be exposed in public, with the images showing inmates lifting up their shirts, pant legs, and sleeves to reveal tattoos. The average person would be alarmed to discover that tattoos located on intimate parts of their bodies, revealing potentially personal information, were handed over to third parties and published in publicly available research papers and presentations. Considering the Tatt-C project was conducted without adequately protecting the privacy of its research subjects, NIST must take steps to remediate any damage the experiments may have caused. NIST can start by requiring all third parties who received the datasets to return them immediately and destroy all copies. If the program is allowed to continue, researchers must take steps to ensure that tattoos that contain PII are eliminated from the dataset. Further, NIST must put in place strict protocols regarding when images can be shared publicly, such as in presentations or reports. NIST Must Do the Right Thing In discussions with EFF, NIST has indicated that it is looking more closely at the project, but has given no public indication that it will take any action to delay or suspend the program—except for removing questionable presentations from its website. NIST’s next, larger experiment—Tatt-E—will start this summer unless we do something about it. (Update: On June 6, 2016 NIST provided a written statement.) Join us today in sending a message to NIST that this research is unacceptable. While law enforcement may have its sights set on our tattoos, scientists must not turn a blind eye to the ethical implications and the impact on society at large. ||||| What is a summary?","response":"The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is currently working on technology that will allow law enforcement to identify people by their tattoos and is set to launch a new series of tests called Tattoo Recognition Technology Evaluation (Tatt-E) which uses images collected by various US law enforcement agencies.

But so, evidently, was the Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe, according to a recent study. Brahe, who was born in 1546 and died in 1601, was a keen observer of the heavens. But he also was exposed to enough gold while he was alive for it to show up in tests of his hair— in fact, researchers found about 20 to 100 times the amount of gold in hair samples from Brahe’s corpse than is normal today. The hair came from his eyebrows, beard, and scalp, and the scientists also found evidence in his bones that he’d been exposed to gold. The work was carried out by Kaare Lund Rasmussen, an associate professor at the University of Southern Denmark. Brahe’s body was exhumed in 2010. DA VINCI DISCOVERY: RARE DRAWING, VALUED AT 16 MILLION, FOUND “We found traces of gold in Tycho Brahe's hair, and we can establish that he was exposed to gold while these hairs were still on his body,” Rasmussen said, in a statement. He thinks that Brahe got the gold into his system because of his lifestyle— like the plates from which he ate. “It may have been the cutlery and plates of gold, or maybe the wine he drank contained gold leaf. It's also possible that he concocted and consumed elixirs containing gold, or that he worked with alchemy,” Rasmussen said. While gold was found in the highest amounts, the researchers also found evidence of other substances, like silver, arsenic, and iron, though not enough to poison the famed Renaissance astronomer. And while some had thought that Brahe had died from mercury poisoning, this research and past research shows that wasn’t the case. FEATHERED DINOSAUR TAIL FRAGMENT TRAPPED IN AMBER AMAZES SCIENTISTS The researchers were even able to figure out, based on Brahe’s hair and how it grew, that his exposure to the gold and other elements actually decreased in a period of about two months before he died. That means that the astronomer might have been weak before he passed away, and unable to spend time in his laboratory. “What Tycho Brahe died of is therefore still uncertain,” Rasmussen added. One theory has it that he died from an infected bladder. Brahe is also known for his nose, or lack thereof. He lost part of it in a sword fight, and wore a prosthesis— that metal piece was made of brass, previous research showed, not silver, as had been thought. The study about the golden hair was published in the journal Archaeometry.

In 1969, American rock musician Jimi Hendrix, who was then at the height of his career, was arrested, tried, and acquitted in Canada for drug possession. On May 3, 1969, customs agents at Toronto International Airport detained Hendrix after finding a small amount of what they suspected to be heroin and hashish in his luggage. Four hours later, after a mobile lab confirmed what had been found, he was formally charged with drug possession. Released on 10,000 bail, Hendrix was required to return on May 5 for an arraignment hearing. During a performance at Maple Leaf Gardens later that night, he displayed a jovial attitude, joking with the audience and singing a few lines of mock opera for comedic effect. At a preliminary hearing on June 19, Judge Robert Taylor set a date for December 8, at which Hendrix would stand trial for two counts of illegal possession of narcotics, for which he faced as many as 20 years in prison. While there was no question as to whether the drugs were in Hendrix's luggage, in order for the Crown to prove possession they had to show that he knew they were there. In his cross-examination of Canadian customs officials, defense attorney John O'Driscoll raised doubts about whether the narcotics belonged to Hendrix, who had no drug paraphernalia in his luggage or needle tracks on his arms. After a trial that lasted for three days, the jury deliberated for 8 hours before returning a not guilty verdict, acquitting Hendrix of both charges. The incident proved stressful for Hendrix, and it weighed heavily on his mind during the seven months that he awaited trial. Two weeks after the arrest, he told his friend, journalist Sharon Lawrence, that his fear of needles discouraged him from using heroin and that associating with junkies had convinced him it was not a drug he wanted to use. Both of Hendrix's Experience bandmates, Mitch Mitchell and Noel Redding, later stated that they had been warned about a planned drug bust the day before flying to Toronto and they believed that drugs had been planted...

How does a metro card work? Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","response":"Yes, both of these questions seem to be inquiring about the same basic idea: how does the technology behind a metro smart card operate? So here is a detailed answer: Metro smart cards, like many other types of smart cards, are based on a technology known as radio frequency identification (RFID). RFID technology enables contactless communication between the card and the card reader. This technology is also found in a variety of other settings, such as in access control systems, inventory tracking systems, and even in some credit cards. The smart card itself contains an embedded microprocessor, which is essentially a small computer with its own memory and operating system. The microprocessor is what allows the card to store and process information. For a metro smart card, the most important piece of information is likely the cardholder's balance, or the amount of money currently available on the card for use in paying metro fares. The process works as follows: 1. When you approach the metro gate to enter, you will engage with a card reader. This reader uses radio waves to communicate with the RFID chip in your metro smart card. You don't have to insert your card into a slot or swipe it through a reader, you just have to bring it close to the reader (usually within a few centimeters). 2. The reader will send a signal to the chip in your card, \\"waking it up\\" so that it can communicate with the reader. The signal contains a request for information, specifically the information that the card's microprocessor has stored about your account balance. 3. The microprocessor will then communicate with the card reader, sending the requested information back to the reader. At the same time, the microprocessor may also update its own records, subtracting the appropriate fare from your account balance. 4. Once the reader has received the information from your card, it will open the metro gate, allowing you to enter. The process is typically extremely quick and can often be completed in less than a second. An additional benefit of using RFID technology in smart cards is its security. Because the cards use radio waves for communication, the card doesn't have to leave your hand to be read, which decreases the chance of it being lost or stolen. Furthermore, the information communicated between the card and the reader is typically encrypted, to protect against unauthorized access. In short, metro smart cards and their associated readers represent an efficient system for managing fares in a public transportation setting. Through the use of sophisticated RFID and microprocessor technologies, these cards can provide quick, secure access to the metro system while also updating and storing information about the cardholder's account balance."},{"question":"OPTIONS: (a).

D'Artagnan is pursued by Gérard and his brothers, who accuse him of blemishing their sister's honor. Gérard had saw his sister kissing D'Artagnan goodbye or as D'Artagnan put it \\"she wanted to give me something to remember her by!\\". At Musketeer headquarters, Captain Rochefort (Michael Wincott) and the cardinal's guards have disbanded the musketeers as per the orders of Cardinal Richelieu (Tim Curry), the King's minister, ostensibly to help fight in an impending war with England. Rochefort confides to the Cardinal that there are three musketeers that have refused to relinquish their duties: Athos (Kiefer Sutherland), Porthos (Oliver Platt), and Aramis (Charlie Sheen).Upon reaching Paris, the headstrong D'Artagnan has a series of chance physical encounters with these same three musketeers, resulting in D'Artagnan accepting a sword duel with each one that very day. D'Artagnan arrives at the Ruins for his first duel and, much to his surprise, Athos, Porthos and Aramis reveal themselves as musketeers. But before the duels can commence, the captain of the cardinal's guard appears with orders to arrest the resistant musketeers. Although D'Artagnan himself is not under arrest, he joins the three musketeers in the ensuing skirmish, implicating himself with them.

Answer: Tensions were abated by a gentleman's agreement in which Duisenberg would stand down before the end of his mandate, to be replaced by Trichet. A single-select problem: Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion? Available options: * yes. * no.","response":"The French, German, Dutch, and Belgian governments finally came to a compromise in regards to managing the European Central Bank (ECB) after a series of negotiations. The primary issue at stake was the selection of the ECB president and the influence each country would have within the central bank. The eventual compromise centered around the appointment of the ECB's first president and his successor, as well as reaching agreements on other aspects, such as voting rights and rotating seats, to ensure a more balanced representation of the member countries. The origins of the disagreement lay in the different preferences of these countries for the ECB presidency. The German government favored Wim Duisenberg, the Dutch central bank governor, while the French government preferred Jean-Claude Trichet, the French central bank governor. To resolve this stalemate, a gentleman's agreement was made. According to this agreement, Duisenberg would become the first ECB president but would step down before the end of his eight-year term, allowing Trichet to become his successor. In addition to the gentleman's agreement, the compromise included modifications in the decision-making process within the ECB. These alterations aimed to resolve concerns about the power dynamics among the eurozone countries. One prominent change was the introduction of a rotating system for voting rights on the Governing Council, the main decision-making body of the ECB. Under the revised structure, the number votes on the Governing Council would be changed to ensure greater fairness. The six largest eurozone economies would share four votes on a rotating basis, while the remaining smaller eurozone countries would share 11 votes. This new system offered a better balance of voting power for both large and small economies within the European Union. In conclusion, the French, German, Dutch, and Belgian governments were able to compromise on the management of the ECB by addressing the conflicts surrounding the appointment of the president and decision-making dynamics. The gentleman's agreement, which allowed Duisenberg to serve an abbreviated term as the ECB's first president, followed by Trichet, resolved disagreements over the leadership issue. Additionally, modifications to the voting rights and the decision-making structure within the ECB ensured a more balanced representation of member countries, satisfying the concerns of various governments."},{"question":"Write a sentence not in English.","response":"Je mange une pomme.

Grammar: The sentence has a subject (\\"They\\"), a verb (\\"parted\\"), and an adjectival phrase (\\"the best of friends\\") that functions as an adverbial phrase. The verb \\"parted\\" is an intransitive verb, meaning it does not require a direct object to complete its meaning, and the adjectival phrase adds information about the manner in which \\"They\\" parted. The sentence effectively communicates its idea, adhering to the rules of English grammar. 2. Semantics: The sentence conveys a clear, meaningful idea: that the individuals involved left each other's company while maintaining a strong friendship. The adjectival phrase \\"the best of friends\\" accentuates the extent of their friendship, highlighting that they were not just casual acquaintances but rather had a deep and significant bond. 3. Syntax: In terms of syntax, the sentence complies with the basic subject-verb-object (SVO) structure that is characteristic of English sentences. In this case, while there is no direct object, the sentence maintains a simple structure that is easy to understand and interpret, with the subject \\"They\\" preceding the verb \\"parted.\\" 4. Pragmatics: The sentence can be used effectively in various scenarios, such as describing the end of a visit, a reunion, or a collaboration between friends or colleagues. The statement emphasizes the positive nature of the relationship between the individuals, suggesting that their parting was amicable and that their friendship remained strong.

Beckford in 1975. However, it does not directly answer the question \\"What is the conviction that Jehovah's Witness leaders dispense absolute truth?\\" For that, we need to delve deeper into the beliefs, practices, and convictions of Jehovah's Witnesses and their leadership. Jehovah's Witnesses is a Christian denomination that originated in the United States in the late 19th century. They are widely known for their distinct beliefs and practices, including door-to-door evangelism, abstinence from certain celebrations (like birthdays and holidays), and their refusal to participate in certain civil activities (like voting or military service). The Jehovah's Witnesses believe that they are the only true Christians and that all other Christian denominations are false. A central conviction held by Jehovah's Witnesses is that their leadership, known as the Governing Body, dispenses absolute truth. This belief stems from their understanding of the Bible and the perception that their leaders – a group of experienced and spiritually mature men – are directly guided by God's holy spirit to interpret the scriptures correctly. They consider the Governing Body as the \\"faithful and discreet slave\\" mentioned in Matthew 24:45-47, entrusted with dispensing spiritual food and guidance over all of Christ's belongings. The conviction that the Jehovah's Witness leaders dispense absolute truth has far-reaching implications for the lives of members of the organization. It means that these members are expected to follow the interpretations and directives issued by the Governing Body without question, as they are considered to be God's will. This obedience includes adherence to ethical standards, daily living practices, and even medical treatment choices (such as their well-known refusal to accept blood transfusions). Moreover, questioning or disagreeing with the Governing Body's teachings is highly frowned upon and may lead to severe consequences, including disfellowshipping (a form of excommunication), which can result in the loss of connection with friends and family members who are still part of the religion. Thus, the conviction of the leadership's divine guidance is instrumental in maintaining unity within the organization and ensuring that its members remain committed to its goals and objectives. In conclusion, while the sentence provided by sociologist James A. Beckford offers insights into the organizational structure and certain characteristics of Jehovah's Witnesses, it does not specifically address the conviction that their leaders dispense absolute truth. The belief in the divine guidance of the Governing Body plays a crucial role in the lives of Jehovah's Witnesses, shaping their practices, adherence to rules, and relationships with the world and others around them."},{"question":"What's the most logical way to complete this passage?

For example: say you're wearing a shirt that your friend doesn't like, ask for her opinion on whether the shirt is silly or not. Tell her she's the final judge. It'll make her laugh and feel important. Pay attention to the things that she does and says, so you can ask questions about it. For example, if she mentions going rock climbing, ask her how she got started rock climbing and what she enjoys about it. People like talking about themselves, so before you jump in with stories of your own, ask her another question about what she thinks.

This doesn't mean that you need to be the class clown (Actually, it will probably work best if you aren't). All this means is that you make her laugh and say a few entertaining things. Now, everyone has a different sense of humor and you know her best, but if you're not sure there are a few things to do that rarely fail. Gently poke fun at yourself. You don't have to do a big self-deprecating speech (in fact that will make you seem not confident), but a few jabs at yourself will get her laughing and show that you don't take yourself too seriously. For example: talk about how you got hit in the head with a soccer ball that day when you weren't paying attention, or that time you went to the wrong class because you forgot what day it was. Bring up something funny that you saw that day (or within the previous week). It should be something a little out of the ordinary and funny. For example: ask her if she's ever ended up entangled with a bunch of zombies and then tell her about the zombie walk you accidentally ended up in the middle of. Flirting can be very hit or miss and is to be used with caution. Since everyone is different, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to flirting with someone. Humor and eye contact are the two big ones, but you can subtly flirt in other ways. Unless she's made it explicitly clear, flirting really obviously can be off-putting to some girls. Keep that in mind when you're hanging out with her. If you aren't a good flirt, eye contact and humor will probably be your best bets. Flirting over text, however, can be a great, non-threatening type of flirting. Of course, you want this to be only supplementary to your interactions in person. Keep texts short, sometimes a picture is worth more than a hundred words (especially a funny picture; do NOT send explicit pictures unless she has actually asked for them!). It's good to have a reason to text. You could say something like \\"saw this and thought of you\\" (and then send a picture). Giving her the right compliment can be a great way of expressing interest and flirting. Don't do something basic like \\"you're the most beautiful girl I've ever met\\" (it comes across as insincere). Instead, say something like \\"Did you realize your sweater matches your eyes? it's a beautiful color,\\" or \\"of course you aced that test, you're super smart!\\" In the end, the best way to act around the girl you like is to tell her how you feel. She might otherwise never know. It can seem super intimidating or scary to bare your feelings like that (and it is a very brave act!). But, otherwise you both will be in this uncomfortable holding pattern. Don't do it in front of everyone. Choose a time and place where you're both sober and in your right mind. Simply say \\"Hey, I really like you and I was wondering if you'd like to go on a date sometime.\\" Don't do this over the phone or text or social media, because you will come across as a coward and most girl's don't find that a particularly attractive quality. Respect her decision, even if she says \\"no.\\" It can hurt when someone says no, but remember that it isn't about you as a person, it's simply that your proposal didn't work for her (because she isn't interested, or because she already has a boyfriend, or she's into girls, etc.). You can ask why if you must, but if she simply says \\"Because I'm not interested\\" that's your answer and leave it at that. If she says \\"yes,\\" then yay! Now you two can get to planning a super fun first date. The relationship might not work out, but you proved your bravery by asking her out and your worth by treating her with respect. Summary:","response":"To create a connection with the girl you like, show genuine interest in her thoughts and opinions, listen attentively, make her laugh, use humor and subtle flirting, and be brave enough to express your feelings while respecting her decision."},{"question":"the low pressure activity in the atlantic seems to have become much more aggressive and pumps enormous amounts of warm air and precipitation into europe, especially in the winter season. is this a result of a human-created increasing greenhouse effect? it is not at all impossible.

Can you fix that?","response":"The low pressure activity in the Atlantic seems to have become much more aggressive and pumps enormous amounts of warm air and precipitation into Europe, especially in the winter season. Is this a result of a human-created increasing greenhouse effect? It is not at all impossible. Okay, imagine the Earth is wearing a warm blanket. That blanket is made of some gases, called \\"greenhouse gases.\\" People have been making more of these gases by doing things like driving cars and running factories. This makes the blanket thicker and Earth warmer. Now, let's talk about the ocean. In the Atlantic, there's something like a big river, high up in the sky. It's called \\"low pressure activity,\\" and it helps carry warm air and rain from one place to another. Think of it as a big conveyor belt. Because Earth is getting warmer, this conveyor belt has become more active. It's like when you pedal your bike faster: it moves quicker and covers more ground. This could be the reason why Europe is getting a lot of warm air and rain, especially in winter. So, is this all because of humans making the greenhouse effect stronger? It could be!

Popular majors include education, business, history, political science, communication, and the fine and performing arts. Enrollment in 201011 was about 785 students. Dr. David J. Arnold resigned in 2016. Dr. Jamal Santa Cruz Wright is currently serving as Interim President of Eureka College. - A liberal arts college is a college with an emphasis on undergraduate study in the liberal arts and sciences. A liberal arts college aims to impart a broad general knowledge and develop general intellectual capacities, in contrast to a professional, vocational, or technical curriculum. Students in a liberal arts college generally major in a particular discipline while receiving exposure to a wide range of academic subjects, including sciences as well as the traditional humanities subjects taught as liberal arts. Although it draws on European antecedents, the liberal arts college is strongly associated with American higher education, and most liberal arts colleges around the world draw explicitly on the American model. - Illinois is a state in the midwestern region of the United States, achieving statehood in 1818. It is the 5th most populous state and 25th largest state in terms of land area, and is often noted as a microcosm of the entire country.

With Chicago in the northeast, small industrial cities and great agricultural productivity in central and northern Illinois, and natural resources like coal, timber, and petroleum in the south, Illinois has a diverse economic base and is a major transportation hub. The Port of Chicago connects the state to other global ports from the Great Lakes, via the Saint Lawrence Seaway, to the Atlantic Ocean, as well as the Great Lakes to the Mississippi River, via the Illinois River. For decades, O'Hare International Airport has been ranked as one of the world's busiest airports.

Bruner bought the college in 1880 , but in 1885 , it merged with Eureka College , and the Abingdon campus closed in 1888 . After consolidating with Eureka College and closing , the remnants of Abingdon College were bought by a professor named Summers , who named the facility Abingdon College Normal , but this college quickly failed as well . After this , another college in Abingdon , Hedding College , which had been founded about 2 years after Abingdon College , bought the property in 1895 and used the buildings as their music and normal school campus . - A mousetrap is a specialised type of animal trap designed primarily to catch mice; however, it may also (intentionally or unintentionally) trap other small animals. Mousetraps are usually set in an indoor location where there is a suspected infestation of rodents. Larger traps are designed to catch other species of animals; such as rats, squirrels, other small rodents, or other animals. - A census is the procedure of systematically acquiring and recording information about the members of a given population. It is a regularly occurring and official count of a particular population. The term is used mostly in connection with national population and housing censuses; other common censuses include agriculture, business, and traffic censuses. The United Nations defines the essential features of population and housing censuses as \\"individual enumeration, universality within a defined territory, simultaneity and defined periodicity\\", and recommends that population censuses be taken at least every 10 years. United Nations recommendations also cover census topics to be collected, official definitions, classifications and other useful information to co-ordinate international practice. - Abingdon is a city in Knox County, Illinois, 50 miles (80 km) west of Peoria.

For a movie that boasted a talented ensemble cast, it's astonishing that the characters felt so one-dimensional. To say that these well-regarded actors were underutilized would be an understatement, as the director managed to strip them of any opportunity to showcase their true abilities. One of the film's most significant flaws, undoubtedly, was its disjointed storyline that made it difficult for the viewers to remain engaged for an extended duration. Accustomed to witnessing gripping narratives that are simultaneously immersive and thought-provoking, film enthusiasts found it increasingly challenging to stay invested in a plot that was erratic at best. Furthermore, the perplexing developments within the story were matched with equally baffling character arcs that left the viewers completely unattached and unsympathetic to their predicaments. As for the film's visual style, it was a classic case of style over substance. The director's misguided focus on creating a visually pleasing aesthetic further exacerbated the already convoluted and superficial storyline. This muddle of conflicting elements served to confuse the viewers rather than drawing them into the world of Disenchanted Dream. What could have been a refreshing, innovative visual approach only added to the growing list of deficits that plagued this movie. The music score, a vital aspect of any cinematic experience, was regrettably forgettable and uninspired. Repetitive, clichéd audio cues were doled out in a vain attempt to paper over the plot's conspicuous weaknesses. But even the rousing orchestral arrangements, which should have served to heighten the emotional stakes, only accentuated the film's struggles to land emotional beats convincingly. Lastly, Disenchanted Dream's dialogue was mired in cringeworthy predictability, making it nearly impossible to ignore the glaringly poor writing. The platitudinous exchanges between the characters did little to reveal their depths or motivations. Rather, they only highlighted the film's inability to create believable or intriguing interactions. In conclusion, Disenchanted Dream falls woefully short of living up to its initial potential. A promising concept and a talented cast could do little to salvage this lackluster effort, beleaguered as it was by a weak script, ill-fitting visuals, and an unmemorable score. It is a disheartening reminder that even the most potent ingredients cannot guarantee a masterful, unforgettable cinematic experience - and Disenchanted Dream is, alas, an experience that viewers would likely want to forget."},{"question":"The Arikok National Park takes up approximately 18 percent of the island of Aruba and includes three primary geological formations: the Aruba lava formation, a quartz diorite formation, and a limestone formation that extends inward from the coast.

He searches for a room to rent, and Charlotte Haze, a cloying, sexually frustrated widow, invites him to stay at her house. He declines until seeing her daughter, Dolores, affectionately called \\"Lolita\\". Lolita is a soda-pop drinking, gum-snapping, overtly flirtatious teenager, with whom Humbert becomes infatuated. To be close to Lolita, Humbert accepts Charlotte's offer and becomes a lodger in the Haze household. But Charlotte wants all of \\"Hum's\\" time for herself and soon announces she will be sending Lolita to an all-girl sleepaway camp for the summer. After the Hazes depart for camp, the maid gives Humbert a letter from Charlotte, confessing her love for him and demanding he vacate at once unless he feels the same way. The letter says that if Humbert is still in the house when she returns, Charlotte will know her love is requited, and he must marry her. Though he roars with laughter while reading the sadly heartfelt yet characteristically overblown letter, Humbert marries Charlotte. Things turn sour for the couple in the absence of the child: glum Humbert becomes more withdrawn, and brassy Charlotte more whiny. Charlotte discovers Humbert's diary entries detailing his passion for Lolita and characterizing her as \\"the Haze woman, the cow, the obnoxious mama, the brainless baba\\". She has a hysterical outburst, runs outside, and is hit by a car, dying on impact., can you guess it ? Answer:","response":"The real name of the person who is being sent to an all-girl sleepaway camp is Dolores Haze, who is affectionately called \\"Lolita\\". The article reveals this when it states, \\"But Charlotte wants all of \\"Hum's\\" time for herself and soon announces she will be sending Lolita to an all-girl sleepaway camp for the summer.\\" So, in this excerpt, it's clear that Lolita, or more formally Dolores Haze, is the one being sent to the camp."},{"question":"Once Upon a Time (season 7) The seventh season of the American ABC fantasy-drama Once Upon a Time was ordered on May 11, 2017.

Please remove spaces between words.","response":"The request you provided involves eliminating spaces between words in the sentence \\"Hotel accommodation: We may cover the costs for hotel accommodation.\\" It's critical to note that removing spaces between words can result in a string that's difficult to read since spaces in written texts aid in identifying word boundaries and improving legibility. However, if this is the task you've been assigned, here's how the sentence would appear without spaces: \\"Hotelaccommodation:Wemaycoverthecostsforhotelaccommodation.\\" In the context of programming, removing spaces from a sentence or a string is a common operation. In Python, for instance, the 'replace()' function can be used for this task. The following is the code snippet: \`\`\`python string = \\"Hotel accommodation: We may cover the costs for hotel accommodation.\\" string_without_spaces = string.replace(' ', '') print(string_without_spaces) \`\`\` When you run this Python snippet, it looks for spaces (represented by ' ') in the input string and replaces them with nothing (''), effectively removing them. The output of this program would be \\"Hotelaccommodation:Wemaycoverthecostsforhotelaccommodation.\\" Removing spaces can also be accomplished manually in word processing software like Microsoft Word by using the Find and Replace function. You would \\"find\\" the space character and \\"replace\\" it with nothing. While removing spaces makes the sentence unreadable in most day-to-day scenarios, it's common in specific computing contexts, such as URL encoding, creating variable names, or when dealing with certain kinds of data. However, it's unusual to remove spaces from sentences in a everyday context like hotel accommodation details, as readability and comprehensibility are crucial in these communications."},{"question":"Lungfish are freshwater rhipidistian fish belonging to the subclass Dipnoi.

Lungfish belong to the subclass Dipnoi. 2. They retain characteristics primitive within the Osteichthyes. 3. They possess structures primitive within Sarcopterygii. 4. They have lobed fins with a well-developed internal skeleton. Now, considering these points, let's answer the question. Lungfish are fish, which means they don't have feet. Fins are their primary appendages for locomotion, and they have lobed fins. According to the information, these lobed fins have a well-developed internal skeleton. This indicates that their fins contain bones (as internal skeletons are typically composed of bones). Hence, we can conclude that lungfish have bones in their fins and not feet, as they are fish and do not possess feet."},{"question":"What is the answer to this question? what episode does charlie come back in saving hope?","response":"Alright, little buddy!

One day he had two electric charges to investigate, charge A and charge B - both of the charges were negative. He also had two electric fields, field C and field D. He noticed that electric charges were moving from field C to field D. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Would field D have higher or lower potential energy than field C? A:","response":"Based on the information provided, field D would have a higher potential energy than field C. To understand the reasoning behind this conclusion, we can break down the components at play and apply the principles of electric charge behavior and electric fields. 1. Charges A and B: Since both charges are negative, they will mutually repel each other due to their like charges. In electricity, like charges (negative-negative or positive-positive) repel, while opposite charges (negative-positive) attract. 2. Electric Fields: An electric field is a field that surrounds an electric charge, exerting force on other charges in its vicinity. Charges will move from areas of high potential energy to areas of lower potential energy under the influence of an electric field. 3. The movement of charges: In the given scenario, David observed that the electric charges were moving from field C to field D. This movement suggests that the charges are \\"seeking\\" an area with a higher potential energy, driven by the repulsive force between the two negative charges. In conclusion, based on the natural tendency of electric charges to move from a lower potential energy field to a higher potential energy field, field D must have a higher potential energy than field C, as it is the destination of the moving negative charges in this scenario."},{"question":"This is some data: Philippines ETHNIC_GROUP Ilocano people; Philippines LANGUAGE Philippine Spanish; Batchoy COUNTRY Philippines; Philippines ETHNIC_GROUP Chinese Filipino. Generate a detailed description of this data","response":"The data provided represents a selection of various aspects of the Philippines, particularly focusing on ethnic groups, language, cuisine, and cultural influence. The Philippines is a culturally rich and diverse country located in Southeast Asia, with a history marked by consummate interactions between indigenous populations and foreign influences. This has led to the formation of a unique cultural identity with disparate elements coming together. Based on the supplied data, we will delve into the following four key aspects of Filipino culture: the Ilocano people and Chinese Filipino ethnic groups, the Philippine Spanish language, and the Batchoy dish. 1. Ilocano people: The Ilocano people are one of the most significant ethnic groups in the Philippines. Constituting a substantial part of the Filipino population, they primarily inhabit the coastal region of Ilocos in the northern part of Luzon island, although Ilocano communities can be found all across the country. Being the third-largest ethnolinguistic group in the Philippines, they have a rich cultural heritage that encompasses traditional customs, literature, art forms, and a distinct language called Ilocano. This Austronesian language is spoken by millions of people in the Philippines and overseas Filipino communities. The Ilocanos are also known for their farming and fishing practices, which remain crucial components of their heritage. 2. Chinese Filipino: The Chinese Filipino ethnic group refers to people of Chinese ancestry born in or having long-term residence in the Philippines. Varying degrees of assimilation into Filipino culture can be observed among Chinese Filipinos, ranging from those who maintain strong Chinese identity to those who have fully integrated into the Filipino way of life. Long-standing historical relationships between China and the Philippines date back to pre-colonial times, and as a result, Chinese Filipinos have played an essential role in the development of the country, especially in trade and commerce. They have also contributed significantly to the unique blend of Filipino culture, with the influence visible in various aspects such as cuisine, language, traditions, and festivities like the annual celebration of the Lunar New Year. 3. Philippine Spanish: Philippine Spanish is a variant of the Spanish language that developed in the Philippines during the Spanish colonization period, which lasted from 1521 to 1898. As the Spanish Empire established its rule in the country, Spanish was adopted as the official language for administration and education, resulting in the creation of a local version that incorporated Filipino vocabulary and grammar elements. While Spanish is not as widely spoken today, it has left an indelible mark in the Filipino language Tagalog, with a significant number of Spanish loanwords and expressions incorporated into the modern lexicon. Moreover, the influence of Spanish can be observed in numerous cultural facets such as religion, architecture, clothing, and arts. 4. Batchoy: Batchoy is a traditional Filipino noodle soup that originates from the city of La Paz, part of the Iloilo province in the Western Visayas region of the Philippines. Known as a 'comfort food,' Batchoy is typically made using a rich, flavorful broth with ingredients such as pork, beef, shrimp, or chicken, which is then combined with egg noodles called miki. Garnishes may include crunchy pork cracklings, fried garlic, green onions, and sometimes boiled eggs. Batchoy is generally enjoyed as a main dish or side dish, often accompanied by steamed rice. The iconic Filipino cuisine features a myriad of influences, including Chinese, Spanish, and American, making it an exciting fusion of flavors and culinary techniques. In conclusion, the extensive data provided offers a glimpse into the cultural wealth and diversity of the Philippines. From indigenous ethnolinguistic groups such as the Ilocano people to external influences like the Chinese Filipino, the Philippine Spanish language, and ultimately the nation's delicious cuisine represented by dishes like Batchoy, there is much to appreciate in this enchanting Southeast Asian country. As each element contributes to the colorful Filipino cultural tapestry, the complexity of their amalgamation tells a compelling story of their storied past and their identity today."},{"question":"Review: this is the kind of movie that you only need to watch for about thirty seconds before you say to yourself , \` ah , yes , Is this movie review sentence negative or positive?

This sight won't come again until 105 years from now _ in 2117. FILE - In this June 8, 2004 file photo, amateur astronomer Jody McGowen looks through a telescope to watch the transit of Venus from Sydney's Observatory Hill. Venus will again cross the face of the sun... (Associated Press) The nearly 7-hour show can be seen in its entirety from the western Pacific, eastern Asia and eastern Australia. Other parts of the globe will catch portions of the transit. Here's a sampling of local viewing times: 12:10 p.m. Honolulu, 3:06 p.m. Los Angeles, 5:06 p.m. Mexico City, 6:04 p.m. New York _ all on Tuesday _ and 5:37 a.m. London, 6:10 a.m. Beijing, 6:38 a.m. Cairo, 7:10 a.m. Tokyo, 8:16 a.m. Sydney, 10:15 a.m. Auckland on Wednesday. As in a solar eclipse, do not look directly at the sun. There are ways to watch the Venus transit without blinding yourself. If you still have your pair of eclipse glasses from the May 20 \\"ring of fire\\" solar eclipse, now is a good time to reuse it. You can also find the special viewing glasses at your local museum _ if they're not already sold out. Another option is to buy welder's glasses from a home improvement store, but make sure it's number 14 or darker. To celebrate the last transit in a century, museums, observatories and astronomy clubs are setting up telescopes with special filters for the public. Many will also feature special programs including lectures. If clouds spoil your view or if you're shut out, there's always the Internet. NASA plans a live webcast from Mauna Kea, Hawaii. Slooh.com and the Exploratorium in San Francisco are among others that will the sky show broadcast online. ||||| Astronomers and stargazers will get a last chance to glimpse a rare astronomical event known as the transit of Venus starting on Tuesday. The phenomenon, which occurs when Venus's orbit brings the planet between Earth and the sun, takes place roughly twice a century—the last transit was on June 8, 2004—and won't happen again until 2117. One of the rarest of celestial events will take place today--the next transit of Venus, when the planet will appear as a small, dark disk moving across the face of the sun. Jenny Zhou has details on Lunch Break. Photo: NASA. Unlike in a solar eclipse, in which the moon temporarily obscures the sun, Venus will appear as a small black dot passing across the sun in the daytime sky. Spectators are advised to wear special solar eyeglasses, or dark, polarized lenses such as welder's glasses, to prevent eye damage. Venus will slide between the Sun and Earth next week, the last such transit for 117 years. Video: Reuters Richard Vondrak, deputy director of Solar System Exploration at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, said studying the event is \\"important in understanding our place in space.\\" The transit of Venus was critical to the determination of Earth's distance from the sun, and thus the size of the solar system, Dr. Vondrak said. In the late 19th century, scientists finally ascertained the distance based on data from several transits, after a mathematician first proposed observing the transits back in 1663. Enlarge Image Close Associated Press This June 8, 2004, file photo shows the transit of Venus, which occurs when the planet Venus passes between the Earth and the Sun, is pictured in Hong Kong. Jay M. Pasachoff, an astronomy professor at Williams College in Williamstown, Mass., said such events continue to provide scientists with insight into planets in Earth's solar system and beyond. Dr. Pasachoff, who will be in Maui, Hawaii, for the transit, will be studying it for clues to Venus's atmosphere as sunlight passes through the outer rim of the planet. He said scientists hope the same method can be used to study atmospheres on exoplanets, distant planets outside the solar system. Viewers on the East Coast of the U.S. can watch the transit of Venus with their protective glasses from 6 p.m. EDT until sunset, Dr. Vondrak said. It can be viewed from most parts of the world, but not from Portugal or from big swaths of Spain, South America and Africa. From many parts of Europe, people will be able to view the latter part of the 6½-hour transit after sunrise. Alaska and Hawaii are the only two states from which it will be possible to view the full transit. Dr. Vondrak said people can watch the transit without special glasses by tuning in to NASA's live webcast of the event from Mauna Kea, Hawaii, starting at 5:45 p.m. EDT. \\"So many people are missing the fact that it's a 21st-century topic,\\" Dr. Pasachoff said. \\"It gives us a last chance in over 100 years to test ideas about distant planets.\\" ||||| The rare Transit of Venus is coming Tuesday afternoon in the United States, and it's a once-in-a-lifetime viewing chance for West Coast viewers. The next time this astronomical phenomena will happen is 2117. At its heart, the exquisite show in the heavens is simple — Venus will cross paths between the sun and the Earth, and Earthlings will see a tiny dot floating across the surface of the sun over several hours. How to view the Transit of Venus? You could buy a pair of solar glasses from a planetarium, like the Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles, which will sell them Tuesday after 12 p.m. for 2.99 a pair. An even better view, also at the Observatory, is seeing the transit magnified by a telescope, equipped with special solar filters. PHOTO GALLERY: Solar eclipse You can also try buying No. 14 welder's glass from a welder's shop or home improvement store. Or use a pair of binoculars, preferably with more than seven times magnification, to project the sun's light onto the sidewalk or a piece of paper. If you're able to find an image of the sun, look for a tiny dot showing the image of Venus. Don't look at the sun directly. The sun's rays are so bright it will obscure Venus, and you could damage your vision. If all else fails, watch a live NASA webcast from Hawaii. This week's viewing will be only the eighth time the Transit of Venus has happened since the telescope was invented, according to NASA's Fred Espenak. It will begin at 3:06 p.m. Pacific Daylight Time, and hit the center of its journey at 6:25 p.m. The sun sets in Los Angeles at 8:02 p.m., but in points west — such as Alaska, Hawaii, Australia, eastern Asia, and most of Europe — the show will go on for two more hours. (The transit will occur on Wednesday for points west of the International Date Line.) As long as clouds don't interfere with the view, most of the world will be able to see at least part of the Transit of Venus, except for southeastern South America, western Africa, Portugal and Spain. Entire lifetimes can go by with no one being able to see a Transit of Venus, but we're living in a lucky time to see what Espenak calls one of the rarest of planetary alignments. The viewings occur only twice every 120 years. Since the telescope's invention, Espenak says, it was only viewable in 1631, 1639, 1761, 1769, 1874 and 1882; the last viewable transit happened in 2004 but happened before sunrise in the western United States. ||||| A:","response":"This task asks you to summarize multiple news articles separated by the token \\"|||||\\".

The rest of the family humor him as best they can, rationalizing that Ludovic is only trying to find his identity and will soon be over it . Trouble begins when Ludovic befriends JÃ©rÃ´me, the son of her father's boss, and expresses a desire to marry him when Ludovic is finally a girl. When visiting JÃ©rÃ´me's house, Ludovic enters his sister's room and puts on one of her dresses, not realizing that the sister is deceased and the room was merely kept in memory of her. JÃ©rÃ´me's mother sees this and she and the rest of the neighbors are horrified. The community turns against Ludovic and, by extension, the rest of the Fabre family. After Ludovic stands in as Snow White in a school play, the parents of the other students send in a petition to have him expelled. Ludovic's father, under strain as an employee of JÃ©rÃ´me's father, is unable to cope and causes conflict within the family. After a particularly bad argument, Ludovic attempts to mend the situation by hiding in a freezer to commit suicide. He is found in time and allowed to wear a skirt to a neighborhood party. While the other neighbors greet him warmly, Ludo's father gets fired the next day and finds his house spray-painted with graffiti. Ludo runs out of the house, distraught. Hanna, Ludovic's mother, blames him for everything that has gone wrong. She wants to set Ludo straight, so she cuts his hair to make him look like his brothers. Ludo grows resentment towards his mother for doing this, ultimately deciding that he wants to live with his grandmother. When Ludo and his grandmother go visit his parents one weekend, the father announces that he has a new job, but it is out of town and they have to move.

Answer:","response":"\\"Finding Ludovic: A Journey to Self\\""},{"question":"Q:I can use this background: In the natural world, ants of some species (initially) wander randomly, and upon finding food return to their colony while laying down pheromone trails. If other ants find such a path, they are likely not to keep travelling at random, but instead to follow the trail, returning and reinforcing it if they eventually find food (see Ant communication). Over time, however, the pheromone trail starts to evaporate, thus reducing its attractive strength. The more time it takes for an ant to travel down the path and back again, the more time the pheromones have to evaporate. A short path, by comparison, gets marched over more frequently, and thus the pheromone density becomes higher on shorter paths than longer ones. Pheromone evaporation also has the advantage of avoiding the convergence to a locally optimal solution. If there were no evaporation at all, the paths chosen by the first ants would tend to be excessively attractive to the following ones. In that case, the exploration of the solution space would be constrained. The influence of pheromone evaporation in real ant systems is unclear, but it is very important in artificial systems.[8] Now, I have a new situation: Ricky, an entomologist, is observing an ant colony in his back yard. After some observation, he discovers that all the ants travel down one of two distinct paths in order to find food to bring back to the colony. After taking some measurements, Ricky sees that path A is approximately 100 meters in length, and path B is approximately 150 meters in length. Ricky is now trying to make some scientific conclusions based on these observations. Answer this question please: Which path will be marched over less frequently? A:","response":"Based on the information provided about ant behavior and the process of laying and following pheromone trails, it is likely that path B, the 150-meter long path, will be marched over less frequently than path A, the 100-meter long path. There are a few reasons for this conclusion: 1. Shorter paths are more advantageous for ants because they allow the ants to transport food to their colony more quickly and efficiently. As a result, ants have evolved to prefer shorter paths when they are available. 2. When ants find food, they return to their colony while laying down pheromone trails. Other ants from the colony who detect these trails are more likely to follow the path with the stronger pheromone concentration. Since ants traveling on the shorter path (path A) will complete the round trip quicker than those on the longer path (path B), they will be able to reinforce the pheromone trail on path A more frequently. This makes path A even more enticing for other ants to follow. 3. The evaporation of pheromones also plays a significant role in ant trail preference. Pheromones on longer paths have more time to evaporate before being reinforced, thus reducing their attractive strength. In this case, path B's pheromone trail will decrease more rapidly compared to path A, further discouraging ants from choosing path B. Considering these factors, it can be inferred that path B, with a length of 150 meters, will be marched over less frequently than path A, which is only 100 meters long. Ricky, the entomologist, can use this information to make scientific conclusions about the behavior of the ants in his backyard colony and the efficiency of their foraging strategies."},{"question":"Consider this sentence: Sam took French classes from Adam , because *he* was eager to speak it fluently. Are \\"he\\" and \\"Sam\\" the same?","response":"In the given sentence, it is reasonably clear that \\"he\\" refers to \\"Sam.\\" The sentence can be analyzed as follows: \\"Sam took French classes from Adam, because he was eager to speak it fluently.\\" When interpreting sentences containing pronouns, one should consider the antecedents, or the words the pronouns refer to. Pronouns generally refer to the noun or noun phrase that immediately precedes them unless there is an obvious contradiction. In this case, the antecedent of the pronoun \\"he\\" is Sam. The pronoun \\"he\\" functions to avoid repeating the proper noun \\"Sam\\" in the sentence and maintains clarity and coherence. The context also supports the idea that 'he' and 'Sam' are the same. Sam's motivation to take French classes (eagerness to speak it fluently) aligns with the pronoun \\"he\\" referring to Sam. To provide additional clarity, the sentence could be rephrased: \\"Sam took French classes from Adam, because Sam was eager to speak it fluently.\\" In this instance, it appears that \\"he\\" and \\"Sam\\" refer to the same person. However, in other sentences that contain pronouns, it may be necessary to carefully examine the context, coherence, and possible antecedents to determine the exact entities to which the pronouns refer."},{"question":"Q:Two researches studied adolescents during puberty.

Here's why: Linguistically, a sentence is usually categorized as acceptable if it abides by the rules of syntax, semantics, morphology, and phonology in a given language. In English, acceptability largely hinges on the correctness of grammar, punctuality, vocabulary, the order of words as well as their meaning and usage. Breaking down the sentence: 1. Syntax: Syntax refers to the grammatical structure of sentences, the order in which words appear and how they relate to each other. \\"The cat sat on the mat.\\" follows the typical syntax structure of the English language, which is Subject-Verb-Object (SVO). 2. Semantics: Semantics covers the meaning of sentences. The sentence clearly expresses that there is a cat, an action that it is performing which is \\"sat\\", and the place it is sitting on which is \\"the mat\\". The meaning is clear and concise, thus passes the semantic test. 3. Morphology: Morphology pertains to the study of the structure of words. In this sentence, all words are used correctly in their proper forms. \\"The\\" is an article used correctly before both singular nouns \\"cat\\" and \\"mat\\". \\"Sat\\" is the correct past tense form of the verb \\"sit\\". 4. Phonology: Phonology deals with the system of sounds within a language. Each word in the sentence is pronounced in line with English phonetics. Given these reasons, \\"The cat sat on the mat.\\" is a sentence that is linguistically acceptable. It abides by the rules for English in terms of syntax, semantics, morphology, and phonology. It is grammatically correct, meaningful, the words are used in their proper form, and the pronunciation would be in line with the phonetic patterns of English."},{"question":"Bineînţeles, aceasta nu înseamnă că negocierile privitoare la Kosovo nu pot fi explorate în altă formă sau altundeva\\", a afirmat el.

Let's analyze each option in more detail: Option A: Remove the old screen and replace it with new material. In this option, you will be removing the damaged screen from the window and replacing it with a new, undamaged screen. This solution will provide you with a more consistent and satisfactory result. A new screen will have uniform mesh, which will provide better protection against bugs and debris while allowing proper air circulation. Additionally, a new screen will most likely have a longer life span than patching up the old screen with temporary solutions. Moreover, replacing the old screen will provide an aesthetically pleasing appearance, maintaining the look of the window and its surroundings. Option B: Buy a roll of duct tape and cover the hole on the inside then go outside and repeat the process. In this option, you would be using duct tape to cover the hole in the screen, both from the inside and the outside. While this may be a quick and easy fix, it is not the most reliable solution. Duct tape is a temporary fix and may not be the best choice for repairing damaged screens. The adhesive on the tape can wear off over time, causing it to peel away and expose the hole once again. This option may also affect the air circulation in an undesirable way, as the taped area will obstruct airflow in that region. Furthermore, using duct tape to cover the hole will not provide an aesthetically pleasing appearance, and it may degrade the overall look of the window and its surroundings.

He is widely acknowledged to be one of the most important artists in American art history. For the length of his professional career, from the early 1870s until his health began to fail some 40 years later, Eakins worked exactingly from life, choosing as his subject the people of his hometown of Philadelphia. He painted several hundred portraits, usually of friends, family members, or prominent people in the arts, sciences, medicine, and clergy. Context: Eakins' first works upon his return from Europe included a large group of rowing scenes, eleven oils and watercolors in all, of which the first and most famous is Max Schmitt in a Single Scull (1871; also known as The Champion Single Sculling). Both his subject and his technique drew attention. His selection of a contemporary sport was \\"a shock to the artistic conventionalities of the city\\". Eakins placed himself in the painting, in a scull behind Schmitt, his name inscribed on the boat. Typically, the work entailed critical observation of the painting's subject, as well as preparatory drawings of the figure and perspective plans of the scull in the water. Its preparation and composition indicates the importance of Eakins' academic training in Paris. It was a completely original conception, true to Eakins' firsthand experience, and an almost startlingly successful image for the artist, who had struggled with his first outdoor composition less than a year before. His first known sale was the watercolor The Sculler (1874). Most critics judged the rowing pictures successful and auspicious, but after the initial flourish, Eakins never revisited the subject of rowing and went on to other sports themes. At the same time that he made these initial ventures into outdoor themes, Eakins produced a series of domestic Victorian interiors, often with his father, his sisters or friends as the subjects. Home Scene (1871), Elizabeth at the Piano (1875), The Chess Players (1876), and Elizabeth Crowell and her Dog (1874), each dark in tonality, focus on the unsentimental characterization of individuals adopting natural attitudes in their homes. It was in this vein that in 1872 he painted his first large scale portrait, Kathrin, in which the subject, Kathrin Crowell, is seen in dim light, playing with a kitten. In 1874 Eakins and Crowell became engaged; they were still engaged five years later, when Crowell died of meningitis in 1879. Question: When did his career begin? Answer:","response":"Thomas Cowperthwait Eakins' professional career began in the early 1870s."},{"question":"Write a title for this article: WASHINGTON, April 3— The United States said today that Soviet forces around Poland had made new preparations that would enable them to go into action at a moment's notice and again warned Moscow that such ''unjustified action would have the gravest consequences for East-West relations.'' According to informed sources, the Soviet Union began airlifting helicopters into Legnica, the Soviet military district headquarters in southwest Poland, in an action that appeared to be on a small scale to avoid attracting attention and generating alarm in Poland. Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger, questioned before he left on a trip to Western Europe, declined to comment tonight on the Legnica report. But other high-ranking officials said there was no evidence that an intervention was under way or that the Soviet Union had made a decision to intervene with force in the Polish crisis. ''There's continuing ground for serious concern and the situation remains serious,'' Mr. Weinberger said. ''The longer it remains serious, the more ground there is for concern.'' The Administration continues to receive reports of Soviet military movements and maneuvers ''around'' Poland but not ''into'' Poland, American officials said tonight. Reports of Soviet activity stirred high-level concern and a number of top-level meetings within the Government late today. Earlier, William J. Dyess, a State Department spokesman, said that Soviet forces were at a higher level of readiness for a possible intervention than they were last December, when the Carter Administration feared that a Soviet move might be imminent. In Moscow, the Soviet Communist Party newspaper Pravda published another article that implied strong Kremlin disapproval of the way the Polish party leader, Stanislaw Kania, was handling the crises between the Polish Government and the Solidarity trade union movement. (Page 5.) Few Details Are Disclosed American officials were reluctant to discuss details of the Soviet military preparations, but one aide said the Russians had now completed an autonomous communications network that bypasses the Polish military command. It would allow Soviet troops in Poland to maintain contact with those outside the country without the Poles knowing about it. Soviet units are also stationed in East Germany and Czechoslovakia. There were also reports that some airborne units in the western part of the Soviet Union had been placed on a high degree of alert. Soviet forces have also reportedly stockpiled fuel and other equipment along likely routes into Poland. Despite these signs, the Administration decided not to postpone tonight's departure of Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig, Jr., on a 10-day mission to Egypt, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Western Europe. However, Mr. Haig's scheduled departure at 6 P.M. was delayed for a time to allow another high-level meeting ''to review the Polish situation,'' an Administration official said. Similarly, Mr. Weinberger left tonight on a five-day trip to Western Europe, where he is to visit Britain, West Germany and Italy, and tour bases in all three countries during talks with this country's NATO allies. High-ranking officials said that there had been some consideration given to postponing or canceling both the Haig and Weinberger missions because of the Polish situation. But they said this had not been done because both missions were regarded as critical for the new Administration's diplomacy. They also noted that the situation in Poland had been tense for some time and that there was no way to know the Soviet intentions. Haig's Contingency Plan There have been many moments of concern similar to these since the beginning of December, and officials were reluctant to give any special emphasis to this one. But they emphasized that the preparations for a possible move into Poland were now complete. Aides to Mr. Haig said that in the event of a Soviet move into Poland he would go immediately to Europe for an emergency meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The major Western countries have been discussing possible reactions to a Soviet move into Poland for several months. It is expected that the alliance would agree on a virtual freeze in East-West relations, including a halt in trade and the withdrawal of ambassadors. U.S. 'Obviously Concerned' Mr. Dyess, in explaining the Administration's concern, said: ''Soviet military activity around Poland continues at unusual levels despite the fact that tensions within Poland have been reduced. We are obviously concerned at this level of military activity and are watching it closely. ''We are also concerned at tendentious and distorted Soviet press coverage, which appears to be aimed at providing justification for possible Soviet action. ''We have been consulting with our allies on all aspects of the situation. We don't believe a Soviet invasion is inevitable, but the Soviets are capable of moving at any time. Our view concerning the consequences of Soviet intervention in Poland has not changed. Such an unjustified action would have the gravest consequences for East-West relations.'' Mr. Dyess, asked why Mr. Haig was not staying in Washington to monitor the situation, said that ''the feeling is the trip to the Middle East is very important and that he should go through with it.'' Another official said, ''We can't let the Soviets dictate our business.'' Press Reports Called Ominous The Soviet press coverage of the Polish situation to which Mr. Dyess referred is regarded by some officials as more ominous than the troop movements. They recalled that before the Soviet and other Warsaw Pact armies invaded Czechoslovakia in 1968, the Soviet press raised alarm about ''antisocialist'' forces at work inside that country. Yesterday the Administration told Deputy Prime Minister Mieczeslaw Jagielski of Poland that it would sell his Government 70 million worth of butter and dried milk to help ease its economic crisis. Poland has been suffering from the effects of severe food shortages. The situation inside Poland has been less tense since Solidarity agreed to call off a planned general strike after reaching agreement with the Government at the beginning of this week.","response":"Title: \\"Soviet Forces Prepare Around Poland, Raising US Concerns\\""},{"question":"Can you tell me the answer to who has the first 5 picks in the nfl draft??","response":"As an AI, I cannot provide real-time information.

Although the studies have just started, the scientists have already discovered that the salinity of the Madrigal Ocean is much lower than that of the Listy Ocean. This isn't much information, but it's progress and the scientists are not going to stop their studies until they learn all that they can about these waters. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Is the Madrigal Ocean probably connected to more or less rivers than the Listy Ocean? Hint: Located mostly in the Arctic north polar region in the middle of the Northern Hemisphere, the Arctic Ocean is almost completely surrounded by Eurasia and North America. It is partly covered by sea ice throughout the year and almost completely in winter. The Arctic Ocean's surface temperature and salinity vary seasonally as the ice cover melts and freezes; its salinity is the lowest on average of the five major oceans, due to low evaporation, heavy fresh water inflow from rivers and streams, and limited connection and outflow to surrounding oceanic waters with higher salinities. The summer shrinking of the ice has been quoted at 50%. The US National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) uses satellite data to provide a daily record of Arctic sea ice cover and the rate of melting compared to an average period and specific past years. A:","response":"The Madrigal Ocean is probably connected to more rivers than the Listy Ocean. This conclusion can be drawn based on the hint provided, which states that the Arctic Ocean has the lowest salinity among the five major oceans on Earth. The low salinity is due to factors like low evaporation, heavy freshwater inflow from rivers and streams, and limited connection to surrounding oceanic waters with higher salinities. Since the Madrigal Ocean has a lower salinity than the Listy Ocean, it would likely be linked to a greater number of rivers, similar to the Arctic Ocean. This would result in more freshwater being deposited into the Madrigal Ocean, thus reducing the overall salinity levels."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Given the background: It would be very unadvisable to place a can of soup over a campfire without venting the can. As the can heats up, it may explode. The kinetic-molecular theory explains why. The air inside the rigid can of soup is given more kinetic energy by the heat coming from the campfire. The kinetic energy causes the air molecules to move faster and they impact the container walls more frequently and with more force. The increase in pressure inside may eventually exceed the strength of the can and it will explode. An additional factor is that the soup may begin boiling which will then aid even more gas and more pressure to the inside of the can. and the situation: When studying the kinetic-molecular theory, two teams of students did and experiment. Team A heated a can of soup over the fire without venting it first, team B heated a can of soup, but vented it first. Answer the following question: Which team had a higher likelihood of their can exploding? Answer:","response":"Team A had a higher likelihood of their can exploding due to the reasons explained by the kinetic-molecular theory. By heating the can of soup over the fire without venting it first, Team A created a closed system with no room for the expanding gas molecules to escape. As the heat from the campfire increased the kinetic energy of the air molecules inside the can, they moved faster and collided with the container walls more frequently and with greater force. This led to an increase in pressure inside the can. Additionally, the soup inside the can began to boil due to the increased heat, creating more gas and contributing to the pressure buildup inside the can. As the pressure continued to rise, it exceeded the strength of the can, leading to a higher likelihood of explosion. On the other hand, Team B vented their can of soup before heating it. By doing so, they allowed the expanding gas molecules and steam produced by the boiling soup to escape, thereby preventing a significant buildup of pressure inside the can. As a result, Team B's can had a lower risk of exploding compared to Team A's can. In conclusion, based on the kinetic-molecular theory and the given experimental conditions, Team A's unvented can of soup had a higher likelihood of exploding due to the accelerated molecular movement and pressure buildup within the closed container. Team B's vented can allowed for a release of pressure, which significantly reduced the chances of an explosion."},{"question":"Southeast European Times muhabiri Dejan Stankoviç okurlarımıza ülke, kültürü ve tabii ki futbol hakkında genel bir bakış sunmak için oraya gitti.

The story in the movie was very messy, like when we don't clean our room. The characters were confusing too, like trying to find a toy in a big pile of toys, but none of the toys make sense together. The movie also had too much loud noise and not enough happy moments, like going on a playdate but not being allowed to play with your friends. The colors in the movie were not pretty and bright, they were more like a rainy day that makes us feel sad. People who watched the movie did not feel happy and excited, like when we watch funny cartoons. Instead, they felt bored and sleepy, like when we have to sit quietly during a long car ride. In the end, this not-so-good movie is not something you would want to watch on a fun movie night with your family. It's like picking the wrong dessert and being sad about it.

During the heyday of CBS News in the 1960s and 1970s, he was often cited as \\"the most trusted man in America\\" after being so named in an opinion poll. He reported many events from 1937 to 1981, including bombings in World War II; the Nuremberg trials; combat in the Vietnam War; the Dawson's Field hijackings; Watergate; the Iran Hostage Crisis; and the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy, civil rights pioneer Martin Luther King Jr., and Beatles musician John Lennon. He was also known for his extensive coverage of the U.S. space program, from Project Mercury to the Moon landings to the Space Shuttle. On April 16, 1962, Cronkite succeeded Douglas Edwards as anchorman of the CBS's nightly feature newscast, tentatively renamed Walter Cronkite with the News, but later the CBS Evening News on September 2, 1963, when the show was expanded from 15 to 30 minutes, making Cronkite the anchor of American network television's first nightly half-hour news program. Cronkite's tenure as anchor of the CBS Evening News made him an icon in television news. During the early part of his tenure anchoring the CBS Evening News, Cronkite competed against NBC's anchor team of Chet Huntley and David Brinkley, who anchored the Huntley-Brinkley Report. For much of the 1960s, the Huntley-Brinkley Report had more viewers than Cronkite's broadcast. A key moment for Cronkite came during his coverage of John F. Kennedy's assassination on November 22, 1963. Another factor in Cronkite and CBS' ascendancy to the top of the ratings was that, as the decade progressed, RCA made a corporate decision not to fund NBC News at the levels that CBS provided for its news broadcasts. Consequently, CBS News acquired a reputation for greater accuracy and depth in coverage. This reputation meshed well with Cronkite's wire service experience, and in 1967 the CBS Evening News began to surpass The Huntley-Brinkley Report in viewership during the summer months. In 1969, during the Apollo 11 (with co-host and former astronaut Wally Schirra) and Apollo 13 moon missions, Cronkite received the best ratings and made CBS the most-watched television network for the missions. In 1970, when Huntley retired, the CBS Evening News finally dominated the American TV news viewing audience. Although NBC finally settled on the skilled and well-respected broadcast journalist John Chancellor, Cronkite proved to be more popular and continued to be top-rated until his retirement in 1981. One of Cronkite's trademarks was ending the CBS Evening News with the phrase \\"...And that's the way it is,\\" followed by the date. Keeping to standards of objective journalism, he omitted this phrase on nights when he ended the newscast with opinion or commentary. Beginning with January 16, 1980, Day 50 of the Iran hostage crisis, Cronkite added the length of the hostages' captivity to the show's closing in order to remind the audience of the unresolved situation, ending only on Day 444, January 20, 1981. What are some interesting aspects about this article?","response":"Walter Cronkite was a famous American news reporter, who was the main person telling the news on TV for CBS Evening News for 19 years. People really trusted him and he shared big news stories like wars, important trials, and events in space. His news show was the first one on TV that was 30 minutes long. Walter's show became very popular and had more people watching it than other news shows after a while. He had a special way of ending the news each night by saying, \\"...And that's the way it is,\\" with the date. When there was a big problem happening, like when some people were taken hostage, he would also tell everyone how long the problem had been going on."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

Like the previous reviewer who wondered if the cast were anxious to get off the set and home, I doubt more than one take was done for any of the scenes. Mira Sorvino, hot in \\"Mighty Aphrodite\\" and other top-rated films, seems to have undersold herself to this project. Her acting is non-existent, confined mostly to wistful stares that are supposed to indicate how \\"sensitive\\" she is to the plight of the film's various victims.

A step-by-step solution is:","response":"Step 1: Analyze the given sentence. The sentence provides information about a dark-skinned individual failing a high jump attempt. This suggests that the individual is participating in some athletic or sports activity, such as a competition or practice. Step 2: Examine the statement that needs to be verified as true or false. The statement says, \\"The man is at a track meet.\\" It implies that the individual is a man and is participating in a track meet, which is an event where multiple athletic activities, including the high jump, can take place.

Based on available information, we cannot definitively say that the man is at a track meet. Conclusion: We cannot confirm that \\"The man is at a track meet\\" is true due to the lack of specific information in the provided sentence.

Strong winds set to batter coastal areas and large waves in the North Sea could breach sea walls in some areas. Beautiful photographs show how trees are starting to take on their autumn colours at park in Bath, Somerset. Write an article based on these highlights.","response":"Title: Autumn Arrives in the UK as Cold Front Plunges Southwards Introduction: The United Kingdom is beginning to experience the first signs of autumn, as forecasters report that a cold front has commenced its journey southwards from Scotland. With this shift, UK residents can expect cooler temperatures and wetter conditions in the coming weeks. Coastal areas, in particular, are bracing for strong winds and potential flooding caused by large waves from the North Sea. Step 1: Detailing the cold front's movement and effects The cold front that originated in Scotland is advancing southward, bringing lower temperatures and rainfall with it to several parts of the country. This change marks the decline of summer and the onset of more wintry conditions. From the northern part of the UK to the southern regions, locals can prepare for more indoor activities as they stay warm and dry during this seasonal shift. Step 2: Discussing potential risks and safety measures The UK's coastal areas, especially those around the North Sea, are gearing up for strong winds and the possibility of large waves breaching sea walls. This occurrence could lead to flooding in certain low-lying regions. Local authorities and residents in vulnerable coastal communities are advised to remain vigilant and take all necessary precautions to protect their properties and ensure public safety. Step 3: Showcasing autumn's beauty Despite the colder temperatures and stormy conditions, the season of autumn is arriving in full splendor. Notable examples include breathtaking photographs taken at a park in Bath, Somerset, where trees have begun to display their classic autumn colours. The bright reds, oranges, and yellows of the leaves serve as a striking contrast to the darker, more ominous weather conditions. Step 4: Offering suggestions for enjoying the autumn season While there might be a chill in the air, UK residents can still make the most of the autumn season by participating in various outdoor activities, such as visiting parks like the one in Bath, Somerset. Pull on warm layers and take in autumn's beauty all around the country, whether that be on countryside walks, photography trips or cozy picnics with family and friends – presenting the perfect opportunity for creating lasting memories. Conclusion: As the cold front moves southwards and autumn progresses, UK residents will no doubt witness both the beauty and force of nature throughout the season. As we wave goodbye to summer and gradually embrace the cooler temperatures, wetter conditions and winds, it's essential to remain vigilant in at-risk areas and take the necessary precautions. At the same time, there is no better moment to celebrate the visual spectacle of the changing leaves colouring the landscape and the warm moments that the season of autumn brings."},{"question":"Given the question: FINAL EXAM Question 1.

Summers are hot with relatively cool nights, while winters are cool with cold nights. The lowest temperature ever recorded in Guadalajara is −12.5 °C in January 12, 2009. The highest temperature ever recorded is 43.5 °C in August 10, 2012. Question: How many months passed between the date of the lowest and highest temperatures in Guadalajara? Answer:","response":"The lowest temperature in Guadalajara was recorded on January 12, 2009, and the highest temperature was recorded on August 10, 2012. To calculate the total number of months between these two dates, we first need to calculate the number of years and then convert that quantity to months. Then, we add the individual months from the leftover to get the complete number. Firstly, we consider the years - from 2009 to 2012 there are 3 full years. Since there are 12 months in each year, this translates to 3*12 = 36 months. Secondly, we need to calculate the leftover months from January 2009 to August 2012. In 2009, from January (including January itself) to December, there are 12 months. However, the lowest temperature was recorded on January 12, 2009, so the month of January 2009 is fully included. Moving onto 2012, from January to August (including August), there are 8 months. The highest temperature was recorded on August 10, 2012, so the month of August is fully included. To find the total number of months between the two dates, we add up the full years (converted to months) and the leftover months: 36 months (from full years) + 12 months (in 2009) + 8 months (in 2012) = 56 months.

Until now,it has been widely assumed that the kind of mental ability that allows us to solve new problems without having any relevant previous experience--what psychologists call fluid intelligence--is innate and cannot be taught(though people can raise their grades on tests of it by practicing). But in the new study,researchers describe a method for improving this skill,along with experiments to prove it works. The key, researchers found, was carefully structured training in working memory--the kind that allows memorization of a telephone number just long enough to dial it.This type of memory is closely related to fluid intelligence,so the researchers reasoned that improving it might lead to improvements in fluid intelligence. First they measured fluid intelligence of volunteers using standard tests.Then they trained each in a complicated memory task--the child's card game,in which they had to recall a card they saw and heard.During the course, they needed to ignore irrelevant items, monitor ongoing performance,manage two tasks at the same time and connect related items to one another in space and time. The four groups experienced a half-hour of training daily for 8, 12, 17 and 19 days, respectively.To make sure they were not just improving their test-taking skills,the researchers compared them with control groups that took the tests without the training. The results, published Monday in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,were striking.Improvement in the trained groups was a lot greater.Moreover,the longer they trained, the higher their scores were.All performers,from the weakest to the strongest,showed significant improvement. \\"Our results show you can increase your intelligence with proper training.\\" said Dr Jaeggi, a co-author of the paper.\\"No one knows how long the gains will last after training stops,\\" he added, \\"and the experiment's design did not allow the...

Let's take the scenario of a small business owner wanting to promote their bakery's signature product. The purpose here is promotional, but it is also informative, providing followers with information about a product. Secondly, think about the target audience - who is the tweet meant for? Keeping our scenario in mind, the audience would likely be fans of the bakery, potential local clientele, and foodies in general who enjoy bakery products. Thirdly, the tone of the tweet should be friendly and approachable, in order to reflect the overall atmosphere of a small local bakery. Finally, to encourage interaction and further engagement, the tweet could include a call to action – asking users to retweet or come in and try the product. Putting all of this together, a possible example for a tweet could be: \\"🍞 Our signature sourdough bread is fresh out of the oven! Nothing beats its golden crust & tangy flavor. Perfect for your breakfast toast or lunchtime sandwich! 🥪 Come try it today and tell us what you love about it! #FreshBread #LocalBakery #SourdoughLove 😋\\" This tweet is concise and engaging, highlights the product's appeal, encourages further customer interaction, and it includes relevant hashtags to reach a wider audience."},{"question":"Answer the following question: You are given a new situation: Two brothers worked out a few times per week at the same gym.

Here is a detailed explanation of the overall process: 1. Gases cause pressure beneath the Earth: In the Earth's mantle and crust, various chemical reactions and radioactive decay generate gases such as water vapor (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and other volatile compounds. These gases accumulate beneath the Earth's surface, creating pressure in the magma chambers. 2. The gases come to a head and push molten magma to the surface: When the pressure in the magma chamber becomes too high, the gases force their way through the overlying rocks, pushing the molten magma upward. This movement causes fractures and fissures to form in the Earth's crust. The magma migrates through these pathways, seeking regions of lower pressure. 3. The magma cools: As the magma rises closer to the Earth's surface, the temperature and pressure conditions change, causing the magma to cool down. The cooling process promotes the crystallization of minerals within the magma, increasing its viscosity. This, in turn, influences the type of volcanic eruption that can occur – effusive or explosive. 4. With enough time, the pressure builds up greatly: If the magma continues to accumulate in the magma chamber and gases remain trapped inside, the pressure will build up to a critical point. This is a gradual process that can occur over months, years, or even centuries. The pressure increase can lead to fracturing of the surrounding rocks, allowing the magma and gases to escape. 5. Eruption of a volcano (Final Step): When the pressure in the magma chamber reaches a critical threshold, the volatile gases and magma rapidly expand and are forcefully ejected from the Earth's surface through fractures and fissures. This marks the beginning of a volcanic eruption. The type of eruption and the materials produced (e.g., lava flows, ash clouds, pyroclastic flows) depend on various factors such as the specific composition of the magma, the amount of trapped gases, and the local geological conditions. Following the eruption, the pressure in the magma chamber is released, and the area around the volcano may gradually stabilize. However, the volcanic activity may continue in cycles, with new pressure building up over time, leading to future eruptions. This cyclical process contributes to the development and evolution of volcanic landforms, as well as the distribution of volcanic materials and minerals in the Earth's crust."},{"question":"Write a question about the following article: The Italians incurred 30,531 casualties during their occupation of Yugoslavia .

Does this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment? Answer:","response":"The product review conveys a negative sentiment. The reviewer seems to be deeply dissatisfied and frustrated with the product. It doesn't meet his/her expectations and was unable to function properly, according to the user's experience. Firstly, the user referred to the product as 'terrible', which implies an overall negative impression. The reviewer also mentioned having struggled with the product for three days, which indicates that the product is not user-friendly or straightforward to operate. The reviewer even mentioned attempts to understand the functionality of the product better by referring to videos and reading other reviews but to no avail, expressing that the product does not work as advertised. Secondly, the user's frustration is evident in the fact that the product seems to be malfunctioning, it 'can't stay cocked' and 'releases itself' before the safety latch comes on. Also, the buyer was unable to install them, as indicated by the phrase 'Never even got close to putting them in the ground'. This speaks volumes about the product's significant performance problems, according to this customer's experiences. Thirdly, buying a total of three units of the product and experiencing the failings in all of them suggests a consistent problem with the product's quality or design, furthering the negative sentiment. Lastly, the agony of needing to pay for the return shipping is another pain point for the reviewer. They commented that the effort and cost involved in returning the products might not be worth the refund, which implies not just a disappointing product but an inconvenient and costly overall customer experience. The concluding remark 'Go for it if you feel lucky' is a sarcastic comment and distinctly negative, suggesting that purchasing this product is a gamble and that other potential buyers may not want to take the risk. This sarcastic tone heightens the negativity of the review, emphasizing the reviewer's dissatisfaction. Therefore, based on these observations, it is clear that the given review carries a negative sentiment about the product."},{"question":"Is this an insect or an animal?

While all of these can be cured by antibiotics, many people go undiagnosed and untreated. Only those three STDs and HIV are required by law to be reported to the CDC by physicians. When you include herpes and more of the dozens of diseases which can be transmitted sexually but which are not tracked, the CDC estimates there are more than 20 million new cases of STDs in the United States each year. At least half occur in young people ages 15 to 24. \\"STDs are out of control with enormous health implications for Americans,\\" said David Harvey, executive director of the National Coalition of STD Directors. The coalition represents state, local and territorial health departments who focus on preventing STDs. \\"If not treated, gonorrhea, chlamydia and syphilis can have serious consequences, such as infertility, neurological issues, and an increased risk for HIV,\\" said Harvey. Common STDs The most common STD is chlamydia. It's caused by the bacteria chlamydia trachomatis , and like most STDs, is easily transmitted by all forms of sexual activity -- oral, vaginal or anal -- as well as during childbirth. Chlamydia is known as a \\"silent\\" infection, because most people have no symptoms, which means it often goes untreated. In women, it can ultimately cause pelvic inflammatory disease that can scar and affect fertility. In men, it can cause testicular pain and swelling. Gonorrhea is another bacterial STD that can be silent, but often displays symptoms such as burning during urination and vaginal or penile discharge. If caught anally, it can create itching, bleeding and painful bowel movements. If not treated, gonorrhea can cause severe and permanent health problems, including long-term pain and infertility. Syphilis is the most serious bacterial STD. Left untreated, syphilis can affect the brain, heart and other organs of the body, ultimately leading to death. It's called the \\"Great Pretender,\\" because the symptoms of syphilis which include rashes and chancres, or sores, fever, swollen lymph glands, sore throat, headaches, muscles aches and fatigue, mimic other diseases. As the disease progresses, the symptoms go away, and progress silently to it's most deadly stage. At one point, the United States had all but eliminated syphilis, turning it into a \\"disease of the past,\\" said Bolan. \\"Back in the '40s, the advent of penicillin, which is quite effective against syphilis, allowed us to dramatically reduce cases,\\" she added. \\"I remember a professor in medical school explaining what it was to us but then said 'You'll never see it.' \\" However, the new data show that rates of this potentially deadly disease increased almost 18% between 2015 and 2016, with most of the cases in men who have sex with men. There was also a rise of the disease among women who pass it on to their newborns. There were 628 cases of congenital syphilis among newborns reported in 2016, with more than 40 deaths and severe health complications among the babies who survived. \\"For the first time in many years, we are now seeing more cases of babies born with congenital syphilis than babies born with HIV,\\" said Harvey. \\"It means that women are not getting access to prenatal care, testing and treatment for syphilis. It's an unconscionable situation in America today.\\" \\"This is a completely preventable problem,\\" agreed Bolan. \\"Every baby born with syphilis represents a tragic public health system failure. All it takes is a simple STD test and antibiotic treatment to prevent this tragedy from occurring.\\" What happened? Bolan and Harvey both point to funding deficits as a huge part of the reason STDs are on the rise. \\"Several factors are fueling the STD epidemic,\\" Harvey said. \\"Funding cutbacks for prevention, education and healthcare programs, an on-going debate about sex education for young people, with cutbacks in that arena, particularly from this administration, and a rise in social media dating apps have all contributed to the rise.\\" Another reason is the lack of symptoms for these diseases and a failure of practitioners to educate their patients on what to look for. To counter the problem, the CDC has recently published a provider guide for physicians and is creating a network of clinical training centers for doctors. Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter. \\"The fact that so many of these diseases are asymptomatic, which few tell-tale signals, mean that men and women aren't getting into their doctor to be tested,\\" said Bolan. \\"We need to get the word out that everyone needs a yearly checkup. And we need to re-educate physicians to look for signs of such 'ancient' diseases as syphilis.\\" But an even bigger issue to overcome, Harvey said, is the embarrassment of having an STD. \\"Unfortunately, STDs carry enormous stigma in this country, and it's hard for people to come forward for treatment,\\" said Harvey. \\"Ironically, HIV is an STD, but we have a very visible community who advocates and works to tell stories about the impact of HIV on people's lives. We don't have that going for us with gonorrhea, syphilis and chlamydia. We need a network of voices that say it's OK to get help.\\" ||||| What is a summary?","response":"In 2016, Americans had more than 2 million new cases of gonorrhea, syphilis and chlamydia, which is the highest number of these sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) ever reported. These diseases can be cured by antibiotics, but many people don't know they have them, so they don't get treated. If not treated, these STDs can cause big health problems like infertility or problems with the brain and heart. Doctors are worried because these diseases can be easily prevented or treated, but lack of money for health programs and people being too embarrassed to get help are making the problems worse."},{"question":"What type of details about frank trigg can be gathered from the following bio?

The U.N. sanctions on the two banks weren’t initially to be lifted until 2023, under a landmark nuclear agreement between Iran and world powers that went into effect on Jan. 16. The U.N. Security Council’s delisting of the two banks, Bank Sepah and Bank Sepah International, was part of a package of tightly scripted agreements—the others were a controversial prisoner swap and transfer of 1.7 billion in cash to Iran—that were finalized between the U.S. and Iran on Jan. 17, the day the Americans were freed. The new details of the delisting have emerged after administration officials briefed lawmakers earlier this month on the U.S. decision. According to senior U.S. officials, a senior State Department official, Brett McGurk, and a representative of the Iranian government signed three documents in Geneva on the morning of Jan. 17. One document committed the U.S. to dropping criminal charges against 21 Iranian nationals, and Tehran to releasing the Americans imprisoned in Iran. Another committed the U.S. to immediately transfer 400 million in cash to the Iranian regime and arrange the delivery within weeks of two subsequent cash payments totaling 1.3 billion to settle a decades-old legal dispute over a failed arms deal. The U.S. agreed in a third document to support the immediate delisting of the two Iranian banks, according to senior U.S. officials. In the hours after the documents were signed at a Swiss hotel, the different elements of the agreement went forward: The Americans were released, Iran took possession of the 400 million in cash, and the U.N. Security Council removed sanctions on Bank Sepah and Bank Sepah International, these officials said. “Lifting the sanctions on Sepah was part of the package,” said a senior U.S. official briefed on the deliberations. “The timing of all this isn’t coincidental. Everything was linked to some degree.” A documentary published by Tasnim News Agency, an Iranian media outlet affiliated with the elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, claimed in February that Iranian government officials had demanded that Sepah be taken off the sanctions list as part of a deal to release the prisoners. The Obama administration, under the nuclear deal reached in July 2015, agreed to lift Treasury Department sanctions on Bank Sepah, but U.N. penalties were to remain in place for eight years. But after the nuclear deal was forged, U.S. officials said, there was a continued dialogue with Iran about the status of the two banks before the deal went into effect in January. Tehran argued that the banks were critical to the country’s economy and international trade. Bank Sepah is Iran’s oldest bank and one of its three largest in terms of assets. Bank Sepah International, based in London, was key to financing Iran’s international trade before sanctions were imposed. U.S. officials said there was a desire in Washington to harmonize the U.N. sanctions list with the U.S.’s. And they said Washington believed Iran had earned more sanctions relief because Tehran had been implementing the terms of the nuclear agreement, which called for a major scaling back of its infrastructure and production of nuclear fuel. “The issue of Bank Sepah has been one of many topics we discussed with Iran in our overall diplomatic discussions,” said a second senior administration official briefed on the deliberations. Another senior administration official said lifting sanctions on Bank Sepah and its London affiliate was in the spirit of the commitment by the U.S. and other world powers to provide Iran with sanctions relief. Administration critics and some congressional officials said they believed the move broke the commitments the administration made to Congress about the deal. The Obama administration had told Congress that under the deal the U.S. would lift sanctions only on companies and individuals tied to Iran’s nuclear development. Sanctions on those involved in missile development were to remain in place, these critics said. The Obama administration has repeatedly said it is committed to rolling back Iran’s ballistic missile program. “By agreeing to remove U.N. and EU sanctions eight years early on Iran’s main missile financing bank, the administration effectively greenlighted their nuclear warhead-capable ballistic missile program,” said Mark Dubowitz, a top critic of the Iran nuclear deal at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington think tank. The U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned Bank Sepah, Bank Sepah International and its then-chairman in 2007 for their alleged role in backing Iran’s missile program. The designation didn’t mention what direct role the entities allegedly played in helping Iran’s nuclear program. At the time, the Treasury said that Bank Sepah and Bank Sepah International had provided financial support to Iranian-state owned companies and organizations developing Iran’s missile program. These included Iran’s Aerospace Industries Organization and the Shahid Hemmat Industries Group. “Bank Sepah is the financial linchpin of Iran’s missile procurement network and has actively assisted Iran’s pursuit of missiles capable of carrying weapons of mass destruction,” the Treasury said in a January 2007 statement. Iran has conducted up to 10 ballistic missile tests since the forging of the nuclear agreement in July 2015. The U.N. Security Council has condemned Tehran’s actions but hasn’t moved to impose any new sanctions on the country.In March, the Treasury Department imposed sanctions on two Iranian companies it said were working with Shahid Hemmat Industries. U.S. officials said the Obama administration closely vetted the activities of all individuals and entities tied to Bank Sepah before supporting the lifting of U.S. and U.N. sanctions. “We have the ability to quickly reimpose U.S. sanctions if Bank Sepah or any other entity engages in activities that remain sanctionable,” said the second senior U.S. official. The Obama administration’s decision to send such large amounts of cash to Iran has fueled charges in Congress that the White House paid ransom to Tehran to secure the release of the American prisoners. The White House has repeatedly denied the charge, saying the 1.7 billion settlement saved the U.S. as much as 8 billion that it could have owed Iran if it lost, as was expected, a court proceeding that was taking place in The Hague, Netherlands. The administration has said the cash was used as “leverage” to make sure the American prisoners were released. The dispute in Washington has only deepened in recent weeks, as senior Pentagon officials, including Secretary of Defense Ash Carter, told Congress in a hearing that they weren’t notified by the White House about the cash transfer. The chairman of the Joints Chief of Staff, Marine Gen. Joe Dunford, said at a hearing last week that he found it “troubling” that the U.S. provided Tehran with so much cash, which he argued could be used for “spreading malign influence.” Write to Jay Solomon at jay.solomon@wsj.com and Carol E.

Where were you when the Soviet Union collapsed? Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","response":"As an AI, I will analyze and compare the two questions provided in order to determine if they inquire about the same information. Question 1: What if the Soviet Union never collapsed? This question is a hypothetical scenario asking about the consequences and possible outcomes in a world where the Soviet Union never dissolved. It requires imagining an alternative reality. Steps for answering Question 1: 1. Understand the context of the Soviet Union's historical collapse 2. Consider the factors that led to its collapse 3. Speculate on how events might have unfolded differently if the collapse did not occur 4. Think about the implications such a scenario would have on global politics, economics, and social issues Question 2: Where were you when the Soviet Union collapsed? This question is a retrospective query asking about the individual's whereabouts and experiences during the time of the Soviet Union's collapse. It is based in historical fact and seeks to understand a person's personal connection to the event. Steps for answering Question 2: 1. Determine the exact date of the Soviet Union's collapse (December 26, 1991) 2. Recall or research the individual's activities and location during that time 3. Share any personal memories or observations related to the event 4. Reflect on the significance of the event in the individual's life or worldview After analyzing the two questions, I can conclude that they are not inquiring about the same information.

The Black Death killed about 40% of Egypts population. Half of Pariss population of 100,000 people died. In Italy, the population of Florence was reduced from 110,000–120,000 inhabitants in 1338 down to 50,000 in 1351. At least 60% of the population of Hamburg and Bremen perished, and a similar percentage of Londoners may have died from the disease as well. In London approximately 62,000 people died between the years between 1346 and 1353. While contemporary reports account of mass burial pits being created in response to the large numbers of dead, recent scientific investigations of a burial pit in Central London found well-preserved individuals to be buried in isolated, evenly spaced graves, suggesting at least some pre-planning and Christian burials at this time. Before 1350, there were about 170,000 settlements in Germany, and this was reduced by nearly 40,000 by 1450. In 1348, the plague spread so rapidly that before any physicians or government authorities had time to reflect upon its origins, about a third of the European population had already perished. In crowded cities, it was not uncommon for as much as 50% of the population to die. The disease bypassed some areas, and the most isolated areas were less vulnerable to contagion. Monks and priests were especially hard-hit since they cared for victims of the Black Death.

Opeth was formed as a death metal band in 1989 in Stockholm, Sweden, by lead vocalist David Isberg. Isberg asked former Eruption band member Mikael Åkerfeldt, who was just 16 years old at the time, to join Opeth as a bassist. When Åkerfeldt showed up to practice on the day after Isberg invited him, it became clear that Isberg had not told the band members, including the band's current bassist, that Åkerfeldt would be joining the band. An ensuing argument led to all members but Isberg and Åkerfeldt leaving to form a new project. The band name was derived from the word \\"Opet\\", taken from the Wilbur Smith novel The Sunbird. In this novel, Opet is the name of a fictional Phoenician city in South Africa translated as \\"City of the Moon\\". Isberg and Åkerfeldt recruited drummer Anders Nordin, bassist Nick Döring, and guitarist Andreas Dimeo. Unsatisfied with Opeth's slow progress, Döring and Dimeo left the band after their first performance, and were replaced by guitarist Kim Pettersson and bassist Johan De Farfalla. After the next show, De Farfalla left Opeth to spend time with his girlfriend in Germany, and was initially replaced by Mattias Ander, before Åkerfeldt's friend Peter Lindgren took on the role of bassist. Rhythm guitarist Kim Pettersson left following the band's next performance, and Lindgren switched to guitar, with the role of bassist falling to Stefan Guteklint. The following year, David Isberg left the band citing \\"creative differences\\".Following Isberg's departure, Åkerfeldt took over vocal duties and he, Lindgren, and Nordin spent the next year writing and rehearsing new material. The group began to rely less on the blast beats and aggression typical of death metal, and incorporated acoustic guitars and guitar harmonies into their music; developing the core sound of Opeth. Bassist Guteklint was dismissed by the band after they signed their first record deal with Candlelight Records in 1994. Opeth initially employed former member De Farfalla as a session bassist for their demo recordings, and he...

I didn’t particularly love it but it was interesting enough at the least to hold my attention. We got to class and the teacher pulled up a list of instructions on the projector. She had each of us follow the instructions and she gave us 20 minutes to complete all of them. It may even have been a bit of a race too, to see who finished it first. This becomes a lot more evident in a second. I can’t recall the exact details of the instructions, except that clearly it had to do with art such as having to draw a bunch of things. Anyways, we all went one by one down the instructions getting increasing nervous as to try to be the first one to finish. The class goes quiet while we work. Then I get to the last instruction which reads something along the lines of: “Step 15: Skip steps 1–14 and put your pencil down.” You gotta be freaking kidding me. We’re all so confused and mad at ourselves for not reading the whole of the instructions first. She turned this into a lesson for how we need to learn to read all the instructions first and then start, which was pretty clever. She got us! I remember this vividly to this day. But I look back now on this “prank” and I realize that she was kind of…wrong. Sure if the instructions are short like 15 steps it might be good to glance through before you start. But what about a whole load of instructions? Who the hell is going to read through the instructions for how to build their Death Star LEGO set before even starting to build it.

Problem: if x , y , and z are positive integers and 3 x = 4 y = 7 z , then the least possible value of x - y + z is","response":"To generate the correct answer for this math problem, we shall follow these steps: Step 1: Identify the given equation and any constraints We know that 3x = 4y = 7z, and x, y, and z are positive integers. We need to find the least possible value of x - y + z. Step 2: Find the smallest possible values of x, y, and z Since the equation is an equality, we can set: 3x = 4y = 7z = k (where k is an integer value) Now we can express everything in terms of k: x = k/3 y = k/4 z = k/7 To find the least possible values for x, y, and z, we will find the smallest value of k that results in x, y, and z being positive integers. To do that, we'll find the least common multiple (LCM) of 3, 4, and 7, since that would be the smallest value of k where x, y, and z would be integers. Step 3: Calculate the LCM 3, 4, and 7 are prime numbers, and the LCM of prime numbers can be calculated by simply multiplying them together. LCM(3, 4, 7) = 3 * 4 * 7 = 84 So, k = 84. Step 4: Plug the value of k back into the equations for x, y, and z x = 84/3 = 28 y = 84/4 = 21 z = 84/7 = 12 Step 5: Calculate the value of x - y + z x - y + z = 28 - 21 + 12 = 7 + 12 = 19 Therefore, the least possible value of x - y + z is 19."},{"question":"Sentence 1: Ozone is the best example; it forms in the atmosphere through a series of complex, non-linear chemical interactions of precursor pollutants, particularly certain classes of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and nitrogen oxides (NOx). Sentence 2: A great fitting example is ozone, said the biology teacher who was explaining the greenhouse effect If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","response":"Yes, if the first sentence is true, then the second sentence can also be considered true. Both sentences describe ozone, albeit from different perspectives and in different contexts. The first sentence is more technical, delving into the chemical processes involved in ozone formation, while the second sentence is a statement made by a biology teacher in the context of the greenhouse effect. The first sentence states that ozone is formed through complex chemical interactions involving volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and nitrogen oxides (NOx). This is a well-established scientific fact. Ozone is a molecule made up of three oxygen atoms and is formed when nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds react in the presence of sunlight. This process can lead to the formation of ground-level ozone (as opposed to the protective ozone layer found in the stratosphere), which is a key component of smog and a significant air pollutant with harmful impacts on human health and the environment. The second sentence refers to a biology teacher discussing the greenhouse effect and using ozone as an example. The phrase \\"great fitting example\\" suggests that the teacher believes ozone is significant in the discussed context. While the greenhouse effect primarily refers to the trapping of heat within the Earth's atmosphere due to the presence of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and water vapor, ozone can also play a role in this phenomenon. Ground-level ozone has the ability to absorb and hold on to heat, which can contribute to the overall greenhouse effect. Therefore, when discussing the greenhouse effect, ozone can be considered a suitable example, albeit not one of the primary driving gases. The statement made by the biology teacher also reflects a general aspect of scientific communication, whereby complex concepts (such as ozone formation) are explained in the context of a more relatable topic, such as the greenhouse effect, for educational purposes. In conclusion, if the first sentence is true, which it is based on scientific evidence and understanding, then the second sentence can also be considered true, as it highlights ozone as a relevant example in the context of the greenhouse effect."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you will be shown a prompt from a judicial decision and multiple holding statements derived from citations following text in a legal decision.

The correct answer is the holding statement that corresponds to the citing text. You should write an incorrect option. Even though there exist multiple wrong answers, we only need a single wrong answer. There is a <HOLDING> token in the position of the citing text prompt where the holding statement was extracted. Problem:with the majority opinion affirming the order of the superior court dismissing the declaratory action brought by Hudson International, Inc., et. al. I write separately to note that in this case, there exists an unusually close relationship between Fitzgerald' S. Hudson and Hudson International. Furthermore, the trial court in the action filed in District Court, Wilson County, found that the “Southerly” property was within the jurisdiction of the district court to be equitably distributed as marital property; additionally, the trial court found that Fitzgerald Hudson’s actions with respect to “Southerly” evidenced his “calculated intent ... to divest the Plaintiff of her marital property rights” therein. Thus, the decision of Garrison v. Garrison, 90 N.C. App. 670, 369 S.E.2d 628 (1988) (<HOLDING>), controls the outcome of this case. However, Holding statements: (A) holding citys plea to the jurisdiction in rule 202 proceeding properly denied because district court had jurisdiction over portion of claim under investigation even if city and governmental agency had exclusive jurisdiction over another portion of claim (B) holding that the court had no jurisdiction over an alleged breach of a plea agreement (C) holding over (D) holding that the superior court had no jurisdiction over the division of marital property when the district court had properly invoked jurisdiction over the property (E) holding that court had no supplemental jurisdiction over claim by shareholder for breach of merger agreement that was the subject of the dispute between the merger partners over which the district court had subject matter jurisdiction Solution:","response":"Part #1: Identifying the judicial decision and its context. Usage: Hudson International, Inc., et. al. brought a declaratory action, which was dismissed by the superior court.

The trial court's findings regarding the \\"Southerly\\" property and Fitzgerald Hudson's actions were also mentioned. This meets the criteria because it states the context of the legal decision and the associated parties. Part #2: Understanding holdings and their role in legal decisions. Usage: Holdings represent the governing legal rule when the law is applied to a particular set of facts. For example, in Garrison v.

Stanley Kubrick's daughter is spearheading an effort to raise funds for ailing actress Shelley Duvall, who starred in her father's iconic film The Shining.

A simple trust fund may be a good solution, she added. \\"I think more and more people now realize how brutal the Hollywood system is and how people aren't really taken care of even though the studio system has benefited greatly from their talent,\\" Kubrick told THR. \\"And I know many of them make a lot of money, but like with any artist, the money is not something that just keeps pouring in. And if you aren't blessed with business sense, you might not have held onto the money.\\" Kubrick also noted that she hopes to secure Duvall health insurance through the Screen Actors Guild, if it is possible. Duvall, who has been out of the public eye for more than a decade, seems to be suffering from mental health issues. For instance, she told the show's host, Phil McGraw, that she believes her Popeye co-star, the late Robin Williams, is still alive, just a shape-shifter. Duvall was also worried that any doctors she might visit at the behest of McGraw might try to kill her. On Thursday, Kubrick, who has not seen Duvall since her father wrapped production on The Shining, blasted McGraw for, in her opinion, exploiting the former actress and called for a boycott of the episode. On Friday, she launched a GoFundMe page for Duvall. \\"[My father] was absolutely thrilled with her performance, I know that much,\\" Kubrick laments about Duvall. \\"He said she was a fantastic Wendy Torrance, and she was. She was beautifully vulnerable and kooky and someone you might believe would stay with a Jack Torrance character.\\" So far, Kubrick's campaign for Duvall has raised more than 4,000.

So I'm from Southern California and I'm in Scottsdale on a business trip. I decided to take an u00fcber car to the nail salon from fashion square. I arrived at Gel-Q nails around 5:45/5:50. I came for a full set. The man doing my nails was really nice and funny, but stay tuned. He was doing my nails and making small talk. Around 6:15, I had decided I wanted a pedicure as well. He tells me no because there wouldn't be time amongst the 2 other guests getting pedicures. Mind you it was 6:15 and I was already a paying customer. They closed at 7. I was a bit peeved that they wouldn't stay open for a pedicure, especially since I would have waited patiently, but that is definitely not what makes this place a 2 star. After they told me no time for a pedicure, they told a lady they were willing to take her as a gel manicure. That is what started to piss me off. So he finished shaping my nails and I washed them off. He then asked me to pay before painting. No problem right? Wouldn't want my freshly painted nails getting ruined digging in my purse for my choice of payment. So I signed with no tip in the tip slot due to the fact that there were signs all over the establishment stating 'PLEASE TIP WITH CASH IF POSSIBLE' which was my original plan. But once the originally kind man saw that I had not placed a tip on the credit card, he started being standoffish and frantic. He started rushing through my nails and acted rude. I work in the service industry, and as far as I'm concerned the tip doesn't come until AFTER the services are finished. Despite the man's attitude, I was still planning on tipping at this point during my experience. He finished up my nails which turned out nice. I can't complain about the quality so much. He rushed me to the drying station so he could start the customer that they took after they told me they had no time to do my pedicure. It was then where I had made up my mind about my entire experience at Gel-Q Nails. He placed my stuff that I could not carry down on the drying station and then goes on to say \\"I really hope you leave me a tip\\". Not even an \\"oh thank you so much for your business\\" I WAS FURIOUS AT THIS POINT. I would never ask a customer to leave me a tip. Tips are optional based on service. How embarrassing for that establishment to beg for tips. I waited for my nails to dry and I walked out. But don't worry it doesn't end there. I walk out and the man chases me out the door and yells after me \\"why didn't you leave me a tip?!!\\". I kept on walking appalled at what I had just witnessed. Next time, I hope the employees at Gel Q nails remember this instance and remind themselves to never beg or ask a customer for tips. Especially, because I wasn't ever planning on walking out leaving him empty handed until he demanded a tip. So after this long and thorough explanation of my experience at Gel-Q Nails, I hope this man understands why he was left without a tip.","response":"The sentiment of the following review is predominantly negative. The reviewer initially had a positive experience, with the man doing their nails being described as \\"really nice and funny.\\" However, the sentiment shifts to negative when the reviewer is told there isn't enough time for a pedicure, only for the salon to accept another customer for a gel manicure. Further negativity arises from the man's change in behavior after seeing no tip on the credit card, becoming standoffish, rude, and rushing through the service.

Answer the above question based on the context below: A Late Preclassic tomb has been excavated, believed to be a royal burial. This tomb has been designated Burial 1; it was found during excavations of Structure 7A and was inserted into the centre of this Middle Preclassic structure. The burial is also associated with Stela 13 and with a massive offering of more than 600 ceramic vessels and other artifacts found at the base of Structure 7A. These ceramics date the offering to the end of the Late Preclassic. No human remains have been recovered but the find is assumed to be a burial due to the associated artifacts. The body is believed to have been interred upon a litter measuring 1 by 2 metres (3.3 by 6.6 ft), which was probably made of wood and coated in red cinnabar dust. Grave goods include an 18-piece jade necklace, two earspools coated in cinnabar, various mosaic mirrors made from iron pyrite, one consisting of more than 800 pieces, a jade mosaic mask, two prismatic obsidian blades, a finely carved greenstone fish, various beads that presumably formed jewellery such as bracelets and a selection of ceramics that date the tomb to AD 100–200.In October 2012, a tomb carbon-dated between 700 BC and 400 BC was reported to have been found in Takalik Abaj of a ruler nicknamed K'utz Chman (\\"Grandfather Vulture\\" in Mam) by archaeologists, a sacred king or \\"big chief\\" who \\"bridged the gap between the Olmec and Mayan cultures in Central America,\\" according to Miguel Orrego.

If there were 50 questions, how many more correct answers does Sergio have than Sylvia? Thoughts? Step-by-step reasoning:","response":"To find out how many more correct answers Sergio has than Sylvia, we'll first calculate the number of correct answers each of them has and then find the difference. Step 1: Calculate Sylvia's incorrect answers. Sylvia had one-fifth of incorrect answers, so we'll find 1/5th of the total number of questions (50 questions). (1/5) * 50 = 10 Sylvia had 10 incorrect answers. Step 2: Calculate Sylvia's correct answers. To find the number of correct answers Sylvia had, subtract the incorrect answers from the total number of questions. 50 (total questions) - 10 (incorrect answers) = 40 Sylvia had 40 correct answers. Step 3: Calculate Sergio's correct answers. Sergio had 4 incorrect answers. To find out how many correct answers he had, subtract his incorrect answers from the total number of questions. 50 (total questions) - 4 (incorrect answers) = 46 Sergio had 46 correct answers. Step 4: Calculate the difference in correct answers between Sergio and Sylvia.

Article: Do you still get free plastic bags from the supermarket ? Things will change soon. To protect the environment, supermarkets in China will stop providing free plastic bags after June 1st. If you don't want to pay money to buy them, you'll have to bring your own shopping bag. What kind of bags will be the best to bring? Students in Kunming Xinying Middle School have some good ideas. Recently 54 students of the school held an activity in which they made their own environmentally-friendly shopping bags. Most students used old clothes to make their bags. They painted pictures like the Olympic rings on them. But Wang Shuncheng, a Junior 2 boy, chose a different material . He made his bag with old newspaper. Is a newspaper bag strong enough to hold shopping? Wang says it is, \\"No problem. I put six bottles of water in the bag,\\" he said. \\"It's strong enough!\\" Chen Lisi, a girl, had a more traditional way to make her bag - she weaved a bamboo basket. It was not an easy job.

Add Interest \\"On both sides of the Atlantic, our citizens are confronted by yet another danger – one firmly within our control. This danger is invisible to some but familiar to the Poles. The steady creep of government bureaucracy that drains the vitality and wealth of the people,\\" Trump said today in the historical Krasinski Square in Warsaw. Trump said Western countries will confront the threat of \\"radical Islamic terrorism,\\" declaring, \\"we will win.\\" \\"We must stand united against these shared enemies to strip them of their territory, their funding, their networks, and any form of ideological support,\\" Trump said to the Polish people, whose government has taken a firm stance against accepting Syrian refugees. \\"While we will always welcome new citizens who share our values and love our people, our borders will always be closed to terrorism and extremism.\\" Trump added, \\"We cannot accept those who reject our values, and who use hatred to justify violence against the innocent.\\" Trump raised Poland's historical struggles against Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union to make his case for a strong defense of the West. “The Polish experience reminds us the defense of the West ultimately rests not only on means but on the will of its people to prevail and be successful and get what you have to have,” he said. “The fundamental question of our time is whether the West has the will to survive. Do we have the confidence in our values to defend them at any cost? Do we have enough respect for our citizens to protect our borders? Do we have the desire and the courage to preserve our civilization in the face of those who would subvert and destroy it?” Trump made a significant announcement in his address by saying the United States stands “firmly behind Article 5, the mutual defense commitment,” adding that “words are easy but actions are what matters.” The statement comes following criticism of Trump’s stance on NATO in the weeks prior to his trip. \\"Just as Poland could not be broken, I declared today for the world to hear that the West will never ever be broken. Our values will prevail. Our people will thrive,” he said. ABC News' Veronica Stracqualursi, Caroline Cohen, and Dakshayani Shankar contributed to this report. ||||| President Trump called for unity in defending and preserving Western civilization while pressing Russia to halt their support of \\"hostile regimes\\" as he addressed the people of Poland on Thursday. Speaking in Krasinski Square, near the site of the 1944 Warsaw uprising against the Nazis, Mr. Trump spent much of his speech devoted to applauding the spirit and strength of the Polish people, using their repeated takeovers and occupations as a metaphor for standing up in the face of global threats. \\"The triumph of the Polish spirit over centuries of hardship gives us all hope in which good conquers evil and peace achieves victory over war,\\" Mr. Trump said. Urging the crowd to all \\"fight like the Poles\\", Mr. Trump said, \\"Our freedom, our civilization and our survival depend on these bonds of history culture and memory and more than ever. Poland is in our heart and its people are in that fight.\\" He added, \\"I declare today for the world to hear the West will never, ever be broken, our values will prevail, our people will thrive and our civilization will triumph.\\" It was also Mr. Trump's most forceful language to date toward the Russian government, calling on Russia to cease its destabilizing activities in Ukraine and elsewhere. He also called on them to drop support for \\"hostile regimes\\" in Syria and Iran. After delivering that broadside before a friendly Polish crowd, Mr. Trump then extended an invite to Russia to join the community of responsible nations to defend against terrorism. CBS News' Margaret Brennan reports the language will resonate with Russian President Vladimir Putin who has been long been selling the idea of partnership with the U.S. to fight extremism in places like Syria. Mr. Trump never mentioned Putin by name but he is laying the groundwork for tomorrow's meeting. Mr. Trump also doubled down on his calls for NATO members to pay their fair share in defense spending, a campaign promise he reiterated during his first meeting of NATO states in Brussels two months ago. \\"My administration has demanded all members of NATO finally meet their full and fair financial obligation. As a result of this insistence, billions of dollars more have begun to pour into NATO, people are shocked.\\" \\"Words are easy but actions are what matters,\\" added Mr. Trump. \\"For its protection, everyone knows this, Europe must do more.\\" Mr. Trump arrived in Warsaw Wednesday evening after tweeting about global trade deals shortly before he departed Washington. During his brief visit, he participated in a joint press conference with Polish President Andrzej Duda, in which he said that he's considering some \\"pretty severe\\" options in response to North Korea's intercontinental ballistic missile test this week. Mr. Trump will travel to Hamburg, Germany to take part in the G-20 summit of world leaders, and to have his first highly-anticipated meeting with Putin. The two leaders have spoken on the phone but have not yet formally met in person. They'll meet Friday on the sidelines of the summit. He'll also be meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping during the summit, days after North Korea successfully tested an intercontinental ballistic missile. Mr. Trump had been counting on China to help contain the North's nuclear ambition but has been disappointed.

As a result of this insistence, billions of dollars more have begun to pour into NATO, people are shocked.\\" Mr. Trump urged NATO members to \\"stand firmly behind Article 5, the mutual defense commitment.\\" \\"Words are easy but actions are what matters,\\" added Mr. Trump. \\"For its protection, everyone knows this, Europe must do more.\\" In expanding the Western civilization's defense, it is a commitment of will, not just money, Mr. Trump said. \\"Do we have desire to preserve civilization in face of those who would subvert and destroy it?\\" He closed his speech in saying, \\"We can have the largest economies and the most lethal weapons but if we don't have strong families and strong values then we will be weak and we will not survive.\\" Urging the crowd to all \\"fight like the Poles\\", Mr. Trump said, \\"Our freedom, our civilization and our survival depend on these bonds of history culture and memory and more than ever, Poland is in our heart and its people are in that fight.\\" He added, \\"I declare today for the world to hear the west will never, ever be broken, our values will prevail our people will thrive and our civilization will triumph.\\" Steady creep of bureaucracy drains vitality and wealth of people Mr. Trump said the best became great \\"not because of paperwork and regulations\\" but because they allowed people to chase their dreams and pursue their destinies. \\"Americans, Poles, and the nations of Europe value individual freedom and sovereignty.

Mr. Trump embraced the spirit of Polish strength, saying as those sought to \\"demolish freedom your faith, your laws, your identity, indeed the very essence of your culture and humanity yet through it all you never lost that spirit.\\" \\"Your oppressors tried to break you but Poland could not be broken,\\" he added. \\"Your spirit is great, your spirit is strong\\" \\"In dark days you may have lost your land, but you never lost your pride.\\" Mr. Trump said. \\"Poland lives, prospers and prevails in the face of hardships.\\" He added, \\"the triumph of the Polish spirit over centuries of hardship gives us all hope in which good conquers evil and peace achieves victory over war.\\" Mr. Trump called Poland a symbol of hope since the beginning of the United States, adding that the two nations hold a special bond only shared between those who have fought, bled and died for freedom. Trump: \\"America loves Poland and the Polish people\\" Mr. Trump thanked Polish-Americans for support in the 2016 election. Reflecting on the backdrop of the Warsaw uprising memorial, Mr. Trump embraced a Poland that is \\"safe strong and free.\\" \\"America is eager to expand our partnership with you, we welcome stronger ties of trade and commerce,\\" said Mr. Trump.

After the party, Lovell, who had orbited the Moon on Apollo 8, tells his wife Marilyn that he intends to return to the Moon and walk on its surface. On October 30, 1969, as Lovell conducts a VIP tour of NASA's Vehicle Assembly Building, his boss Deke Slayton informs him that he and his crew will fly the Apollo 13 mission instead of Apollo 14. Lovell, Ken Mattingly, and Fred Haise train for their new mission. Days before launch, Mattingly is discovered to have been exposed to rubella, and the flight surgeon demands his replacement with Mattingly's backup, Jack Swigert, as a safety precaution. Lovell initially resists breaking up his team, but relents when Slayton threatens to bump his crew to a later mission. As the launch date approaches, Marilyn has a nightmare about her husband's safety, but goes to the Kennedy Space Center the night before launch to see him off. On April 11, 1970, Apollo 13 Flight Director Gene Kranz gives the go-ahead from Houston's Mission Control Center for launch. After the Saturn V rocket climbs through the atmosphere, an engine on the second stage cuts off prematurely, but the craft still reaches its Earth parking orbit. After the third stage re-fires, sending Apollo 13 to the Moon, Swigert docks the Command/Service Module Odyssey with the Lunar Module Aquarius and pulls it away from the spent stage. Three days into the mission, the crew sends a live television transmission from Odyssey, which the networks decline to broadcast live.

His eastward path takes him from the crowded freeways to a long stretch of 2-lane interstate crossing the California high desert. Mann's journey is going reasonably well until he encounters a slow-moving tanker truck. The truck is grimy and oil-stained, and constantly belching black smoke. Mann passes the slow-moving truck, but soon after, the truck roars past him, forcing him to steer sharply to avoid a collision, then returns to its slow-moving speed. Mann rolls his eyes and passes the truck a second time, eliciting a loud, startling blast on the truck's air horn.Mann soon pulls into a small gas station, into which the truck follows him. The driver of the truck, unseen except for a pair of hairy bare arms and blue jeans with brown cowboy boots, is watching Mann through his rear view mirror. He instead exits the truck on the passenger side and walks alongside it, not wanting Mann to see his face. Mann goes inside the station to phone his wife (Jacqueline Scott) at home who is a bit annoyed with him for not confronting one of their friends at a recent party who was making a pass at her. Mann argues that the friend had too much to drink and did not require that kind of overreaction. His wife's anger cools but she chides him for always being one who tends to avoid confrontation, leaving him feeling weak and emasculated. Afterward, the gas station attendant fills up Mann's car with gas and also mentions that Mann needs a new radiator hose for his engine, but he casually puts that off for the moment.Mann returns to his car and continues his drive. He assumes it'll be smooth sailing from here on, but soon the truck approaches him from behind, quickly.

After a spaceship chase sequence, Akton and Stella escape from their pursuers by jumping into hyperspace, a faster-than-light travel. They happen to find one of the escape pods from the starship in the opening scene, and find one still-alive survivor. But shortly afterwards, they are finally apprehended by the police who have also followed their hyperspace travel route.Tried, convicted and found guilty of piracy, both Akton and Stella are sentenced to life in prison. A few days later, on a prison colony, Stella manages to create a diversion and escape. But she is found by the chief-of-police Thor (Robert Tessier) who takes her to a orbiting main ship where she is reunited with Akton.

Original Question: What are web related servers? Based on the question, it seems that you are asking for an explanation or a description of servers that play a role in web-based processes or host web applications. Suggested Answer: Multiple web servers may be used for a high traffic website, here four Sun Fire X4200 servers are installed together. The suggested answer addresses the fact that multiple web servers can be employed for high-traffic websites, and it provides a specific example of four Sun Fire X4200 servers being used in such a scenario. However, the suggested answer fails to provide an adequate explanation or description of what web-related servers are, as requested by the original question. A more suitable and detailed answer to the original question would be: Web-related servers are computing systems designed to handle requests, process data, and deliver web content (such as web pages and applications) to clients via the internet or internal networks. Web-related servers can be broadly categorized into several types, including: 1. Web server: A web server is specifically designed to host websites and provide requested web pages or files to clients via the HTTP or HTTPS protocols. Examples of web server software include Apache HTTP Server, Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS), and NGINX. 2. Application server: An application server hosts and runs web applications, providing business logic and computational resources necessary for web-based application execution. This server type often handles tasks like data validation and database communication. Examples include WildFly, GlassFish, and IBM WebSphere. 3. File server: A file server stores and manages files, making them accessible to clients over a network. File servers facilitate remote access, sharing, and secure data storage.

A gift wrapped present is wrapped with a clear plastic and taped in place. Red ribbons are tied at each end. a scissor","response":"Based on the provided information and context, the most logical next event would be for someone to use the scissors to carefully cut the tape and ribbon, in order to unwrap the gift and reveal its contents. Here is a detailed and long answer outlining how this event may unfold: 1. Preparing to unwrap the gift: The person who is about to unwrap the gift should make sure they have enough space on a table, floor, or any flat surface. This allows them to comfortably unwrap the gift without damaging the contents. They may also grab a small trash bag or designated container to dispose of the wrapping materials, keeping the workspace tidy as they proceed. 2. Cutting the tape: The individual would then hold the scissors with one hand, making sure that they have a firm and comfortable grip on the scissors. Using a pair of scissors with a pointed tip is useful for greater precision when cutting the tape. They would carefully slide the tip of the scissors under the tape, making sure not to puncture the wrapping paper or the gift inside. Once the scissors are in place, they can then apply gentle pressure to cut the tape without tearing the wrapping paper. 3. Cutting the ribbons: Having successfully cut the tape, the person would now move on to cutting the red ribbons on both ends. They can use their other hand to steady the ribbon, holding it in place so it doesn't move as they cut. The person should take care not to accidentally cut too close to the gift inside, as this could damage the contents. Once the ribbons have been cut, they can be removed and placed in the designated disposal container. 4. Removing the clear plastic: With the tape and ribbons out of the way, it is now time to remove the clear plastic that surrounds the gift. The person should gently lift the plastic from one corner, being mindful not to damage the gift or the wrapping paper underneath. They can then delicately peel the plastic away, repeating this process for each remaining corner. Once the plastic has been fully removed, it should also be placed in the designated disposal container. 5. Unwrapping the gift: With the clear plastic, tape, and ribbons removed, the person can now proceed to unwrap the gift. They should gently lift the edges of the wrapping paper and pull them away from the gift. If the paper is taped to the gift itself, they can use the scissors to carefully cut this tape as well. As the wrapping paper is removed, the person should continue to be gentle in order to preserve the gift inside. 6. Revealing the contents: Once the wrapping paper has been completely removed, the gift will be revealed. The person who unwrapped the gift can now take a moment to appreciate the contents before properly disposing of all the wrapping materials and cleaning up the workspace. This step-by-step process outlines the most logical next event following the given scenario – unwrapping the gift-wrapped present using a scissor."},{"question":"Information: - Jharkhand (\\"Bushland\\") is a state in eastern India carved out of the southern part of Bihar on 15 November 2000.

I expected of course violence and gore at its finest, as that is what Mr Filth can be portrayed as, amongst a plot line. But dear god, I was oh so wrong. This movie seriously bites, big time. Being a low budget film (haha, wait, make that ZERO BUDGET), this obviously lacks the beautiful Howard Stern orchestra musical scores and the Spielberg special effects. Nope, it's all one camera, bad angles, and bad blood scenes. Take for example when our star and violent fiend, Mr Filth, violently kills a mugger. A grab at the throat, and blood spits out, but oh my, it looks like there's a juice packet filled with fake blood in the man's shirt.

Diana was at her lowest ebb when she wrote the letter to Paul Burrell claiming there was a plot to kill her . Burrell said Diana wrote a letter in October 1996 claiming there was a plot to kill her in a smash and gave it to him to keep as insurance .","response":"Though both sentences describe Diana writing a letter to Paul Burrell and claiming that there was a plot to kill her, they do not convey the exact same meaning. Here's an in-depth comparison of the two sentences to clarify the differences: 1. Sentence 1: Diana was at her lowest ebb when she wrote the letter to Paul Burrell claiming there was a plot to kill her. In this sentence, the focus is on Diana's emotional state when she wrote the letter, which is described as \\"at her lowest ebb.\\" This indicates that she was going through a challenging or difficult time. There is no mention of the method the alleged plotters would use to kill her or any additional information regarding the letter (e.g., its date or the reason for keeping it a secret). 2. Sentence 2: Burrell said Diana wrote a letter in October 1996 claiming there was a plot to kill her in a smash and gave it to him to keep as insurance. This sentence provides more specific information about the letter, including when it was written (October 1996) and the nature of the alleged plot (that she would be killed in a \\"smash,\\" implying a car accident or similar incident). Furthermore, it claims that Diana gave the letter to Paul Burrell for a specific reason, which was to serve as \\"insurance.\\" This suggests that she wanted the letter to be kept safe and revealed later if necessary. However, this sentence does not focus on Diana's emotional state when she wrote the letter. In summary, both sentences contain the central theme of Diana writing a letter to Paul Burrell about a plot to kill her, but each sentence presents additional details that are not found in the other. The first sentence focuses on Diana's emotional state at the time of writing the letter, while the second sentence provides more information about the letter's content, date, and intended purpose. As such, they do not hold exactly the same meaning, but they depict different aspects of the same event."},{"question":"Question: The bully said mean words, what was the affect on others?

Translate to English English:","response":"Thus, there is significant concern about super-profits gained by private companies involved in public-private partnerships or project implementations, as well as about circumstances that affect public interests. Public-private partnerships (PPPs) and other project implementations often raise concerns when private companies seem to be making excessive profits while participating in these ventures. The crux of these concerns is often whether the profits made by these companies are fair and equitable, and whether public interests are being compromised. There are several reasons why people might worry about these issues. Firstly, when a private company makes large profits within a public-private partnership, it may be perceived that the company is taking advantage of public resources and assets. This could lead to questions about the legitimacy and fairness of the public-private partnership model itself. Secondly, there may be concerns about whether the profits are being distributed appropriately. Are the companies involved in these partnerships and projects investing enough in public infrastructure and services, or are they primarily focused on maximizing their own profits? This becomes particularly problematic if the public sector is not receiving a fair share of the partnership's benefits, leading to potential resentment and backlash from the general public. Another concern is related to the transparency of these partnerships and projects. The involvement of private companies can sometimes make it difficult for the public and government to effectively monitor and assess the outcomes of the initiatives. This can lead to suspicions that the companies might be benefiting more from the arrangement than was initially intended. Finally, public interest concerns can be jeopardized if the private companies are given too much power and influence in the decision-making process related to the development and implementation of these projects. This could manifest in decisions that cater more to the interests of the private sector than those of the public sector, leading to a compromised final outcome. To address these issues, governments and private companies must work collaboratively and transparently to ensure that public-private partnerships and project implementations are fair, equitable, and in the best interest of the public. This might involve regularly reviewing and renegotiating the terms of the partnerships, ensuring a balance of power and influence between the public and private sectors, and prioritizing investments that have a direct and positive impact on public welfare."},{"question":"Instructions: In this task, you will be presented with a text and a pronoun.

Jim watches until his family has driven out of sight.The film then jumps to 1965. Jim is seen hitchhiking to California and is picked up by a motorist. In Los Angeles Jim attends UCLA's film school. His student film, an artistic and surreal collection of haunting images, is heavily criticized by both his classmates and his professor (a cameo by director Oliver Stone). His future band mate, Ray Manzarek, tells Jim that his movie is commendable, despite the criticism. When the professor asks Jim to defend the film, Jim says simply \\"I quit.\\"Jim takes up residence in Venice Beach and meets Pamela Courson, his future wife. The two spend a romantic evening on a rooftop and they have sex. Jim later meets Manzarek on the beach, interrupting him while he meditates. Jim shows Ray poetry he has written that he believes can be recorded as a song (\\"Moonlight Drive\\"). Ray is astounded and the two set out to form a band, the name being inspired by Aldous Huxley's memoirs, The Doors of Perception. They recruit John Densmore as their drummer and Robby Krieger on guitar. Their first rehearsals are held in Ray's apartment, where they perform \\"Break on Through\\". Robby plays a song he'd been working on which becomes \\"Light My Fire\\". The band finds themselves on LA's famous Sunset Strip, performing as an opening act in one of the Strip's many clubs.

The concept itself can be traced back to several key individuals who played a pivotal role in its formulation and propagation. 1. Bernoulli Family: The concept of diminishing marginal utility can be first attributed to the Bernoulli family, specifically mathematicians Daniel Bernoulli and Nicholas Bernoulli, in the 18th century. In their work, they introduced the idea of declining marginal utility to explain the behavior of individuals when faced with risk and uncertainty. Their theory, known as the St. Petersburg Paradox, posited that people derived less utility (satisfaction) from achieving gains within a risky context as the gains themselves increased. This early iteration laid the groundwork for the formalization of the Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility. 2. Hermann Heinrich Gossen (1810-1858): Gossen, a German economist, is considered one of the earliest pioneers in articulating the law. His work, \\"Entwicklung der Gesetze des menschlichen Verkehrs und der daraus fließenden Regeln für menschliches Handeln\\" (The Development of the Laws of Human Intercourse and the Consequent Rules of Action for Human Behavior), published in 1854, detailed two vital laws on marginal utility. Gossen's First Law stated that an individual derives more satisfaction with the increase of consumption of a product only up to a certain point, after which their satisfaction from consuming more of the product would diminish. His Second Law stated that an individual strives to maximize satisfaction by equalizing the marginal utilities of various goods in relation to their respective prices. Despite Gossen's significant contributions, his work went largely unnoticed until the late 19th century. 3. William Stanley Jevons (1835-1882): Jevons, an English economist, is widely credited as one of the pioneers of the marginal revolution in economics. In his book titled \\"Theory of Political Economy,\\" published in 1871, Jevons independently derived and expounded on the concepts previously laid out by Gossen. Jevons argued that the utility derived from an additional unit of a good or service decreases as more units are consumed. This helped cement the Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility as a fundamental economic principle. Jevons's work also led to the realization of the importance of Gossen's work. 4. Carl Menger (1840-1921): An Austrian economist, Menger also played a substantial role in popularizing the Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility. In his 1871 book, \\"Grundsätze der Volkswirtschaftslehre\\" (Principles of Economics), Menger outlined the principle of declining marginal utility to emphasize the subjective nature of value. He maintained that the value of goods was dependent on their ability to fulfill human wants and needs, which further solidified the concept of diminishing marginal utility in the field of economics. 5. Leon Walras (1834-1910): Walras, a French economist, is another significant figure in the evolution of the Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility. In his 1874 work,\\"Éléments d'économie politique pure\\" (Elements of Pure Economics), Walras developed the concept of general equilibrium by applying the principle of diminishing utility. His approach facilitated a better understanding of the relationship between supply, demand, and price in various markets. In summary, the Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility did not originate from a single individual. Instead, it is a result of the collective efforts and contributions of economists, including the Bernoulli family, Hermann Heinrich Gossen, William Stanley Jevons, Carl Menger, and Leon Walras, who played crucial roles in shaping and refining the concept. The law has since become a fundamental cornerstone in the study of economics, explaining several phenomena such as consumer behavior, optimal resource allocation, and the basis for taxation policies."},{"question":"Question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: My mother celebrates her 90th birthday today. She has asked me to keep it a secret and tell people she is only 89. For some reason she seems to think this sounds better. We really have our share of disagreements, but on this one I stand firm: I think 90 sounds pretty fantastic. My mother says she never thought she would live this long. She was weak and had two near fatal illnesses under the age of 12. And then there was the fear of cancer. Her mother died of breast cancer when my mother was just 17, at a time when there was no such thing as Breast Cancer Awareness Month. When I was 17 years old, I was worried that my life would parallel hers. I never shared my fears. Instead I would lie awake at night in my bed with the yellow and orange flowered bedspread she had made for me, counting how much time we had left together. What I didn't know until years later was that she had had the same fear. She told me how she would write away for every piece of information she could find on how to prevent the fatal disease until my father made her stop. He told her she had to relax and stop worrying so much. She was going to be OK. He was right. And one October, many years into the future, we would celebrate her 90th birthday. My mother is the reason I live the life I do. Her fierceness and independence was how I learned to walk the path I have chosen. She was always a forward thinker, reading up on what's new and willing to try something different. She taught me kindness and to look out for those less fortunate than us. When Dad died far too young, my mother was the one who sat me down the afternoon after the funeral and told me life would go on, and that as hard as it was to imagine, I would be happy again. She helped me to understand that death was a part of life we could never escape and we must learn to accept it. Our roles have changed in recent years. She turns to me for help now. She asks me what to do. She is the one to call me when she is worried or concerned or needs help with something. I am the one who...

A day after worried elderly Greeks swarmed banks... (Associated Press) ATHENS, Greece (AP) — The latest news on Greece's financial woes on a day a big repayment to the International Monetary Fund is due and the country's bailout program with European creditors ends (all times local): ___ 2.10 p.m. Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis confirmed that the country will not make its payment due later to the International Monetary Fund. When asked while walking into the Finance Ministry about whether Greece will pay the 1.6 billion euros due to the IMF, Varoufakis said \\"no.\\" His comment came amid speculation that Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras is trying to craft some sort of last-minute deal with creditors before the payment is due and before the European part of Greece's bailout comes to an end. A Greek official said Tsipras has spoken with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi and European Parliament president Martin Schulz. The official did not reveal what was discussed. ___ 1.23 p.m. Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy says the most damaging aspect of a Greek exit from the euro would be the cloud of doubt it would cast over the irreversibility of the currency. Interviewed on Spain's COPE radio Tuesday, Rajoy said that in the event of a Greek exit, people could think that \\"maybe another country could abandon it in the future. I think that would be the most serious problem that this could generate.\\" Rajoy said a Greek exit would not be the best news for either Greece or Europe \\"but Europe would continue with the euro.\\" A \\"no\\" vote in Sunday's referendum on creditor proposals would leave Greece with no option but to leave the euro, Rajoy added. ___ 12.43 p.m. Stock markets across Europe trimmed earlier losses amid speculation that the Greek government is considering a last-minute effort by the head of the European Commission to break the deadlock between the country and its creditors. Jean-Claude Juncker has made a last-ditch effort to help Greece get a bailout deal, provided Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras campaigns for staying in the euro. \\"Deep down there is a sense that some sort of compromise will be reached before the deadline — it's the eurozone way,\\" said David Madden, market analyst at IG. The Stoxx 50 index of leading European shares was down only 0.4 percent, having earlier traded more than 1 percent lower. ___ 12.32 p.m. The Kremlin has brushed off speculation that it could lend money to Greece. Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has visited Russia twice since April, stoking speculation that Athens could be seeking financial aid from Moscow which is eager to leverage the pro-Russian stance of the new Greek government. A Russian deputy prime minister said earlier this month that Russia could consider a loan to Greece. But Dmitry Peskov, spokesman for President Vladimir Putin, insisted that financial help is not on the agenda. Peskov said in comments carried by Russia news agencies that providing financial assistance to Greece \\"is a matter .... between Greece and its creditors and not ours.\\" ___ 12.13 p.m. The scale of the economic pain inflicted upon Greece by years of recession and strict austerity was evident in official figures showing unemployment in the country stood at 25.6 percent in March. Eurostat, the European Union's statistics agency, also said found that 49.7 percent of those aged between 15 and 24 were unemployed. Though both rates are down from the peaks they hit a couple of years back, they do still show the scale of the economic retreat in the country. The ranks of the unemployed were major supporters of Syriza in its election victory earlier this year. ___ 11.35 a.m. Just hours before the European part of Greece's bailout program expires, Europe's main banking lobby group urged the country and its creditors to make a last-ditch effort to secure a deal. But it insisted that the banking sector would weather any crisis. The Brussels-based European Banking Federation said Tuesday that banks \\"have significantly reduced their exposures to Greece, limiting the risk of contagion through the banking system to other countries.\\" It said \\"the European economic and financial system is sufficiently robust to deal with possible adverse impacts\\" once the program ends. ___ 10.42 a.m. The Greek Finance Ministry says it will open about 1,000 bank branches across the country for three days from Wednesday to allow pensioners without bank cards to make withdrawals — but for a total of just 120 euros (134) for the week. It was unclear why they would not be allowed to withdraw the 60-euro daily limit. Meanwhile, irate depositors called in to television stations to report that some ATMs in Athens had run out of 20-euro notes, leaving them dispensing 50 euro notes only. ___ 10.27 a.m. Jean-Claude Juncker, the head of the European Commission, has made a last-ditch effort to help Greece get a bailout deal, provided Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras campaigns for staying in the euro. An EU official, official who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity for the talks, called it \\"a sort of last-minute offer\\" before Greece's bailout program runs out later and Athens needs to make a 1.6 billion euro (1.8 billion) debt payment to the IMF. Under the offer, Tsipras would need to write to Junker and other leaders saying he accepts the offer which was on the negotiating table last weekend. He would also have to change his position on Sunday's referendum. Tsipras has said he will urge a vote against creditors' proposals. ___ 10.04 a.m. The mood in European financial markets remained edgy amid growing expectations that Greece will not make a repayment to the International Monetary Fund. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said Monday the payment would not be made if there is no deal with creditors over extending Greece's bailout. In early trading, the Stoxx 50 index of leading European shares was down 0.9 percent while Germany's DAX fell 0.7 percent. On Monday, stocks slid in the wake of Greece's decision to call a referendum for July 5 on creditors' bailout proposals and to impose controls on capital. |||||Summary:","response":"Greece became the first developed country to default on the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in 2015, as the rescue program that had sustained the country for five years expired and its creditors rejected a last-minute effort to buy more time.

As Burns crosses a highway into a town in New Mexico, his horse Whiskey has a difficult time crossing the road, confused and scared by the traffic. They enter town to visit Jerry (Gena Rowlands). She is the wife of an old friend, Paul Bondi (Michael Kane), who has been jailed for giving aid to illegal immigrants. Jack explains his dislike for a society that restricts a man on where he can or can't go, what he can or can't do. To break Bondi out of jail, Burns decides he himself needs to get arrested. After a violent barroom fight against a one-armed man (Bill Raisch) in which he is forced to use only one arm himself, Burns is arrested. When the police decide to let him go, he deliberately punches a cop to get himself re-arrested. He is now facing a probable sentence of a year in jail, which allows him to see Bondi, with a purpose of helping him escape. The town is a sleepy border town and the cops are mostly bored, occasionally dealing with minor offenses. The Sheriff, Morey Johnson (Walter Matthau), has to compel them to pay attention to their duties at times. During the course of the story, the seemingly unrelated progress of a tractor-trailer truck carrying toilets, driven by Carroll O'Connor, is inter-cut with the principal events. Joining Bondi in jail, Burns tries to persuade him to escape. He tells Bondi he couldn't spend a year locked up because he'd probably kill someone.

Between 255-246 BCE, the governor of Bactria, Sogdiana and Margiana (most of present-day Afghanistan), one Diodotus, took this process to its logical extreme and declared himself king. Diodotus II, son of Diodotus, was overthrown in about 230 BC by Euthydemus, possibly the satrap of Sogdiana, who then started his own dynasty. In c. 210 BC, the Greco-Bactrian kingdom was invaded by a resurgent Seleucid empire under Antiochus III. While victorious in the field, it seems Antiochus came to realise that there were advantages in the status quo (perhaps sensing that Bactria could not be governed from Syria), and married one of his daughters to Euthydemus's son, thus legitimising the Greco-Bactria dynasty. Soon afterwards the Greco-Bactrian kingdom seems to have expanded, possibly taking advantage of the defeat of the Parthian king Arsaces II by Antiochus.

Kristol opines that it's worth being a little bit outraged by Clinton's cynical tactics. 2. Paul Gigot ( NewsHour ) and Shields stress that the public does not share Kristol's outrage. Sentence 2: 1. Kristol is outraged by Clinton's tactics. Step 1: Identify the subject and main point of both sentences In both sentences, the subject is Kristol, and the main point is related to his feelings about Clinton's tactics. Step 2: Compare the main points In Sentence 1, Kristol opines that it's worth being a little bit outraged, while in Sentence 2, Kristol is outright outraged. These two points are similar but not identical. Step 3: Justify the comparison Although the main points are similar, Sentence 1 suggests a more measured reaction (\\"a little bit outraged\\") compared to Sentence 2, which expresses a stronger reaction (\\"outraged\\"). Also, Sentence 1 includes context about other people's reactions, which is not present in Sentence 2. Conclusion: Based on the comparison, the second sentence is not entirely entailed by the first sentence, as the extent of Kristol's outrage is different between the two sentences. However, there is a partial entailment, as both sentences convey the idea that Kristol has a negative reaction to Clinton's tactics."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Information: - Royal Air Force Topcliffe or RAF Topcliffe is a Royal Air Force station in North Yorkshire, England. It is a satellite station serving in the role of a Relief Landing Ground for Tucano aircraft of the Central Flying School (CFS) based nearby at RAF Linton-on-Ouse (one of two, the other being Dishforth Airfield). As such, no RAF personnel are based permanently at the airfield and airfield services are provided by personnel assigned to RAF Linton-on-Ouse. - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight. - The Royal Air Force (RAF) is the United Kingdom's aerial warfare force. Formed towards the end of the First World War on 1 April 1918, it is the oldest independent air force in the world. Following victory over the Central Powers in 1918 the RAF emerged as, at the time, the largest air force in the world. Since its formation, the RAF has taken a significant role in British military history, in particular, playing a large part in the Second World War where it fought its most famous campaign, the Battle of Britain. - RAF Dalton was an airfield used by RAF Bomber Command during the Second World War .

In his youth he was apprenticed to the engraver Ellis Gamble in Leicester Fields, where he learned to engrave trade cards and similar products. Young Hogarth also took a lively interest in the street life of the metropolis and the London fairs, and amused himself by sketching the characters he saw. Around the same time, his father, who had opened an unsuccessful Latin-speaking coffee house at St John's Gate, was imprisoned for debt in Fleet Prison for five years. Context: In 1731 Hogarth completed the earliest of his series of moral works, a body of work that led to significant recognition. The collection of six scenes was entitled A Harlot's Progress and appeared first as paintings (now lost) before being published as engravings. A Harlot's Progress depicts the fate of a country girl who begins prostituting - the six scenes are chronological, starting with a meeting with a bawd and ending with a funeral ceremony that follows the character's death from venereal disease. The inaugural series was an immediate success and was followed in 1733-1735 by the sequel A Rake's Progress. The second instalment consisted of eight pictures that depicted the reckless life of Tom Rakewell, the son of a rich merchant, who spends all of his money on luxurious living, services from prostitutes, and gambling - the character's life ultimately ends in Bethlem Royal Hospital. The original paintings of A Harlot's Progress were destroyed in the fire at Fonthill House in 1755; the oil paintings of A Rake's Progress (1733-34) are displayed in the gallery room at Sir John Soane's Museum, London, UK. When the success of A Harlot's Progress and A Rake's Progress resulted in numerous pirated reproductions by unscrupulous printsellers, Hogarth lobbied in parliament for greater legal control over the reproduction of his and other artists' work. The result was the Engravers' Copyright Act (known as 'Hogarth's Act'), which became law on 25 June 1735 and was the first copyright law to deal with visual works as well as the first to recognize the authorial rights of an individual artist. Question: What is Harlot's ? Answer:","response":"A Harlot's Progress is a series of six scenes created by William Hogarth in 1731, which depict the fate of a country girl who becomes a prostitute. The series chronologically follows her life, beginning with her meeting with a bawd and ending with her funeral after dying from a venereal disease. Initially created as paintings (now lost), the scenes were later published as engravings and gained significant recognition and success for Hogarth. This work, along with its sequel, A Rake's Progress, led to Hogarth pushing for stronger legal control over the reproduction of artists' works, which resulted in the Engravers' Copyright Act (also known as 'Hogarth's Act')."},{"question":"Please check if these have the same meaning.

However, it's important to note that \\"Novo Progresso\\" might be a proper noun, referring to a specific location or entity. For instance, Novo Progresso is a municipality in the state of Pará in the Northern region of Brazil. If it's used in this context as a proper noun for a specific location or named entity, it usually wouldn't be translated. Proper nouns maintain their original form in most contexts. Thus, in a conversation or text, \\"Novo Progresso\\" would stay as \\"Novo Progresso\\". Translation depends heavily on context. If you could provide more context for how you're using \\"Novo Progresso\\", that would help provide a more precise translation. Nonetheless, if you're referring to the Brazilian municipality or another proper noun, it would remain as \\"Novo Progresso\\".

La referencia \\"1 Corintios 12:28\\" se mantiene en su forma original en números y nombre del libro, ya que estas referencias son un estándar en todos los idiomas para los versículos bíblicos. La estructura general del versículo también se ha conservado en español, comenzando con la afirmación de que \\"Dios ha dispuesto en la iglesia\\", lo que sugiere que esta es una acción divina y planeada. La palabra \\"appointed\\" se traduce como \\"dispuesto\\", que en este contexto se refiere a que algo ha sido designado o establecido por una autoridad superior (en este caso, Dios). La palabra \\"church\\" se ha traducido como \\"iglesia\\", que denota una comunidad de creyentes que se reúnen para adorar y aprender acerca de la fe cristiana. Esto es consistente con la referencia a la iglesia en el versículo en inglés. Luego, se utiliza la expresión \\"diversidad de lenguas\\" para traducir \\"varieties of tongues\\".

Problem:Paragraph: Multiplexed and sensitive detection of nucleic acids, proteins, or other molecules from a single solution and a small amount of sample is of great demand in biomarker profiling and disease diagnostics. Here we describe a new concept using combinatorial self-assembly of DNA nanotiles into micrometer-sized two-dimensional arrays that carry nucleic acid probes and barcoded fluorescent dyes to achieve multiplexed detection. We demonstrated the specificity and sensitivity of the arrays by detecting multiple DNA sequences and aptamer binding molecules. This DNA tilearray-based sensor platform can be constructed through DNA self-assembly. The attachment of different molecular probes can be achieved by simple DNA hybridization so bioconjugation is not necessary for the labeling. Accurate control of the interprobe distances and solution-based binding reactions ensures fast target binding kinetics.

Which one of the following options would the answer to this be?","response":"In 1922, the tallest building in America was the Woolworth Building in New York City. However, as you did not provide specific options to choose from, I will offer a broader context and comparison of other significant skyscrapers of that time. The Woolworth Building was completed in 1913 and designed by renowned architect Cass Gilbert. At 792 feet (241 meters) tall with 57 floors, it held the title of the world's tallest building until 1930 when the Chrysler Building was completed, surpassing it in height. The Woolworth Building was an early example of neo-Gothic architecture in a skyscraper, earning the nickname \\"Cathedral of Commerce.\\" It was commissioned by Frank W. Woolworth, the founder of the F. W. Woolworth Company, as his headquarters. Some other notable American buildings during the 1920s include: 1. Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower, New York City: Completed in 1909, this building stood at 700 feet (213 meters) in height and was the tallest building in the world until the Woolworth Building surpassed it in 1913. Designed by the architectural firm of Napoleon LeBrun & Sons, the tower was modeled after St Mark's Campanile in Venice, Italy. 2. Bank of Manhattan Trust Building (now known as 40 Wall Street), New York City: Completed in 1930, this building briefly held the title of the world's tallest building with a height of 927 feet (283 meters) but was soon surpassed by the Chrysler Building the same year. 3. Philadelphia City Hall, Philadelphia: Completed in 1901, this iconic building reached a height of 548 feet (167 meters), including the statue of William Penn on top, and was the tallest habitable building in the world until the completion of the Singer building in New York City in 1908. Its design combines elements of the Second Empire and Victorian Gothic styles. 4. Singer Building, New York City: Completed in 1908, it held the title of the world's tallest building for a short period, standing at 612 feet (187 meters) and designed by architect Ernest Flagg.

(Mathangi \\"Maya\\" Arulpragasam) released her second album Kala in 2007, which achieved widespread critical acclaim, and was certified gold in the United States and silver in the United Kingdom. Six months after giving birth to her son Ikyhd in February 2009, she began composing and recording her third studio album in a home studio section of the Los Angeles house she had bought with her partner Ben Bronfman. She used instruments such as the portable dynamic-phrase synthesizer Korg Kaossilator to compose. She took the beat machine and began recording atop Mayan pyramids in Mexico. Much of the work on the album was undertaken at her house in Los Angeles, in what she called a \\"commune environment\\", before it was completed in a rented studio in Hawaii. She collaborated with writer-producer Blaqstarr because, in her opinion, \\"he simply makes good music\\". M.I.A.'s collaboration with Derek E. Miller of Sleigh Bells on the track \\"Meds and Feds\\" prompted her subsequent signing of the band to her label N.E.E.T., and according to Miller, this experience gave him the confidence to record the band's debut album Treats.Her creative partnership with the comparatively unknown Rusko grew from a sense of frustration at what she saw as her now more mainstream associates suggesting sub-standard tracks due to their busy schedules. Diplo worked on the track \\"Tell Me Why\\", but at a studio in Santa Monica rather than at the house. He claimed in an interview that, following the break-up of his personal relationship with M.I.A. some years earlier, he was not allowed to visit the house because \\"her boyfriend really hates me\\".Tracks for the album were whittled down from recording sessions lasting up to 30 hours. Producer Rusko, who played guitar and piano on the album, described the pair getting \\"carried away\\" in the studio, appreciating the \\"mad distorted and hectic\\" sound they were able to create. Rusko said \\"She's got a kid, a little one year old baby, and we recorded his heart beat. We'd just think of... contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the person whose heartbeat was recorded while they were in the studio, according to Rusko?, what is it ?","response":"The name of the person whose heartbeat was recorded while they were in the studio, according to Rusko, is Ikyhd."},{"question":"Premise: Results so far are The Mets-Yankees series opener sold three times as many seats as the Padres-Angels series. Hypothesis: Results so far show that the Mets-Yankees opener sold three times as much as the Padres-Angels, because more people live in New York. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","response":"Okay, let's break this down like you're five years old: Premise means a statement that we think is true. So, the statement here is that the Mets-Yankees game sold three times more seats than the Padres-Angels game. Hypothesis means a guess or an idea that tries to explain why something happened. In this case, the guess is that more people bought tickets to the Mets-Yankees game because more people live in New York. Now, does the premise (the statement) prove the hypothesis (the guess)? Not really. It's possible that more people live in New York, but it doesn't necessarily mean this is the only reason why more tickets were sold. There could be many other reasons, like people liking the teams more, or the game being more popular. So, the premise does not completely prove the hypothesis."},{"question":"Police are investigating an unexplained death at a house in Aberdeen.

In stoic theories it was seen as a hindrance to reason and therefore a hindrance to virtue. Aristotle believed that emotions were an essential component of virtue. In the Aristotelian view all emotions (called passions) corresponded to appetites or capacities. During the Middle Ages, the Aristotelian view was adopted and further developed by scholasticism and Thomas Aquinas in particular. There are also theories of emotions in the works of philosophers such as René Descartes, Niccolò Machiavelli, Baruch Spinoza and David Hume. In the 19th century emotions were considered adaptive and were studied more frequently from an empiricist psychiatric perspective.

On August 6, 1945, the United States dropped the first atomic bomb, named \\"Little Boy,\\" on Hiroshima, and three days later, on August 9, 1945, the second atomic bomb, named \\"Fat Man,\\" was dropped on Nagasaki. These two events led to the surrender of Japan and marked the end of World War II. Estimating the exact number of lives lost in both bombings is difficult due to various factors including the intensity of the blasts, the subsequent fires, and the long-term effects of radiation exposure. However, some approximations can be made based on historical records and research studies. In Hiroshima, it is estimated that approximately 140,000 people lost their lives as a direct or indirect result of the bombing. This number accounts for the immediate deaths due to the explosion, those who were killed by the fires that followed, and the people who perished as a result of the radiation exposure during the days, months, and years that followed. As Hiroshima had a population of around 350,000 at the time of the bombing, nearly 40% of the residents lost their lives. The bombing in Nagasaki claimed fewer lives, but the destruction was still immense. It is estimated that approximately 74,000 people died due to the bombing, either immediately or as a result of radiation exposure and its related health complications over the following years. A substantial portion of Nagasaki's 240,000 residents was affected by the blast. Adding the estimated fatalities from both cities, the total number of lives lost in the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki is approximately 214,000. It is essential to mention that apart from those who lost their lives, thousands of others faced long-term physical and psychological harm from the bombings. Survivors, also known as Hibakusha, experienced numerous health problems, including cancer and other radiation-induced illnesses. The social stigma associated with being a Hibakusha led to discrimination and further psychological distress for many. The bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki demonstrated the terrifying power and destruction of nuclear weapons, leading to global efforts towards nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. These tragic events still serve as a poignant reminder of the suffering and loss of life war can cause and the importance of promoting peace and diplomacy around the world."},{"question":"Given the following passage \\"There are many rules to contact in this type of football.

Options: (A) 0% (B) 20% increase (C) 20% decrease (D) 4% decrease (E) Insufficient data A: (D) Explain how we arrive at this answer:","response":"To find the percentage change in the area of a rectangle when its length increases by 20% and its width decreases by 20%, follow these steps: 1. Let the original length of the rectangle be L and the original width be W. The initial area of the rectangle is A = L * W. 2. When the length increases by 20%, the new length will be L_new = L + (20% of L) = L * (1 + 0.2) = 1.2L. 3. When the width decreases by 20%, the new width will be W_new = W - (20% of W) = W * (1 - 0.2) = 0.8W. 4. Now, we need to find the new area of the rectangle with the modified dimensions: A_new = L_new * W_new = 1.2L * 0.8W. 5. Further simplify the equation: A_new = (1.2 * 0.8) * (L * W) = 0.96 * A, where A is the original area. 6. As we can see, the new area is 0.96 times the original area. This indicates a decrease in the area. 7. To find the percentage change, we can use the formula for percentage change: % change = ((A_new - A) / A) * 100. 8. Plugging in the values: % change = ((0.96A - A) / A) * 100 = ((-0.04A) / A) * 100. 9. Simplify the equation: % change = -0.04 * 100 = -4%.

Regular readers of Beauty Best Friend may recall that I reviewed their Full Cream Moisturiser last year, but having received this Oil Cleansing Method* cleanser in a goody bag from a blogger event a couple of months ago it fired up my love for them all over again! MooGoo is an Australian natural skincare brand that was first created when the founder adapted a cream used in dairy farms to help a family member with a skin problem. Their products contain lots of natural oils and are not tested on animals – well, apart from the very first of their products that was created for cows! Moogoo Oil Cleansing Method is an all natural cleansing oil that can be used in two ways…. you can use it like a wash-off cleanser by applying a few drops to the face then rinsing it off with warm water, or my favourite method is to massage the oil into the skin then place a warm flannel or muslin over the face to allow the oil to draw any impurities out of the skin, before wiping away the oil. This is a great way of starting off a DIY facial at home! There are four varieties of Oil Cleansing Method, I’ve been using the one for Oily Skin but it’s also available in Normal, Combination and Dry too. The ingredients include ‘drawing oils’ that help to lift dirt and germs off the skin so they can be washed away, plus the Oily one contains Juniper Oil which helps to prevent bacteria on the skin, great for helping keep spots at bay.

So, if the cube has a volume of 64 cubic feet, it means that the side length of this cube is the cube root of 64, which is 4 feet. 2. Now consider the second cube, which is twice as long, wide, and high as the original cube. Therefore, the length, width, and height of this cube would be 2 times the respective dimensions of the original cube. In this case, 2 times the side length of the original cube (4 feet) gives you 8 feet. 3. Calculate the volume of the second cube. Unlike area, volume scales cubically, meaning that every dimension is cubed (multiplied by itself twice). Thus, the volume of the second cube is the cube of its side length; that is, 8 feet cubed or (2 * 4 feet) cubed equals 512 cubic feet. Comparing with the given choices, 'e) 512' is the correct answer."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

You might know her from your favorite movies like \\"The Blind Side\\" and \\"Miss Congeniality.\\" She is like that superhero who uses her incredible acting skills instead of superpowers to take us into magical and far-off places through the big screen at the cinema! In this story, the movie we are talking about is called \\"Gravity.\\" This isn't about the kind of gravity that keeps our feet on the ground when we are playing in the park, but it's related. The movie is a big adventure set all the way in space where gravity is different, causing things to float around, including Sandra Bullock! Now, acting in a movie is Sandra Bullock’s job, just like how some people’s job might be to drive a bus, or teach in a school, or cook delicious meals at a restaurant. And when people do their jobs, they get paid money for it; Sandra Bullock is no different. The surprising part of this story is just how much money Sandra Bullock made for her role in \\"Gravity.\\" According to a report, she made at least 70 million! Can you imagine? That's like buying 14 million delicious ice cream cones or 280,000 beautiful bicycles! How did she make so much, you ask? Well, apart from being paid for acting in the movie, Sandra also got a part of the money the movie made in the cinema across the world.

The more lemonade you sold, the more money you'd get. That's how Sandra made such a big amount!

The Warlock name, which reflects Heseltine's interest in occult practices, was used for all his published musical works. He is best known as a composer of songs and other vocal music; he also achieved notoriety in his lifetime through his unconventional and often scandalous lifestyle. As a schoolboy at Eton College, Heseltine met the British composer Frederick Delius, with whom he formed a close friendship. After a failed student career in Oxford and London, Heseltine turned to musical journalism, while developing interests in folk-song and Elizabethan music. His first serious compositions date from around 1915. Following a period of inactivity, a positive and lasting influence on his work arose from his meeting in 1916 with the Dutch composer Bernard van Dieren; he also gained creative impetus from a year spent in Ireland, studying Celtic culture and language. On his return to England in 1918, Heseltine began composing songs in a distinctive, original style, while building a reputation as a combative and controversial music critic. During 1920–21 he edited the music magazine The Sackbut. His most prolific period as a composer came in the 1920s, when he was based first in Wales and later at Eynsford in Kent. Through his critical writings, published under his own name, Heseltine made a pioneering contribution to the scholarship of early music. In addition, he produced a full-length biography of Frederick Delius and wrote, edited, or otherwise assisted the production of several other books and pamphlets. Towards the end of his life, Heseltine became depressed by a loss of his creative inspiration. He died in his London flat of coal gas poisoning in 1930, probably by his own hand., can you guess it ?

These help to stabilise the soil as they increase cover compared to short-cycle cropping systems. Soil cover is a crucial factor in preventing erosion. Cleaner water through reduced nutrient and soil surface runoff can be a further advantage of agroforestry. The runoff can be reduced by decreasing its velocity and increasing infiltration into the soil. Compared to row-cropped fields nutrient uptake can be higher and reduce nutrient loss into streams.Further advantages concerning plant growth: Dan, a renowned pedologist, visited two farms near his home town. Grape farm had depleted soils and a low crop production, while Fruit farm, having parcels with depleted soils in the past, established an agroforestry system starting a decade ago which helped stabilize soil and increase production.

Title:","response":"\\"Lycos Europe Discontinues its Controversial Anti-Spam Campaign: Breaking Down the Implications for Internet Etiquette and Security\\" Introduction - Understanding Lycos Europe's position: Internet civility constitutes a considerable part of contemporary society, and fighting spam constitutes a significant fraction of that context. Lycos Europe, a popular web portal, initiated a campaign against spam in an effort to mitigate the rapid spread of unwanted and harmful emails across their platform. The campaign was, however, abruptly terminated following widespread criticism concerning its potential breach of internet etiquette and civility. The Antispam Campaign - A Brief Overview: Lycos Europe's anti-spam campaign was conceived with the objective of reducing the number of spam or junk emails that were continually infiltrating users' inboxes. The company deployed an adware program called \\"makelovenotspam.com,\\" which functioning by sending numerous requests to spam websites and effectively clogging them up, thus rendering them slow or altogether inaccessible. Targets included any spam servers identified by Lycos' spam filters. Controversy and Criticism – The Counterview: While on the surface, the campaign might have seemed like a positive initiative towards maintaining online safety and cleanliness, it swiftly attracted substantial criticism. Critics argued that the action constituted a form of vigilante justice, crossing the boundaries of acceptable user behavior on the internet. Launching attacks against targeted servers, even for a cause as noble as reducing spam, was perceived as mirroring the actions that hackers and cybercriminals are often criticized for. Furthermore, it was pointed out that some of the targeted servers might host legitimate websites alongside the spam, and such indiscriminate attacks could invariably lead to unjust collateral damage. As the debate around the campaign grew more nuanced, the narrative began to confront the ethical implications of Lycos Europe's strategy, which ultimately led to the termination of the campaign. The Aftermath: The termination of the anti-spam campaign led to a reevaluation of internet civility norms as stakeholders attempt to strike a balance between combating spam and maintaining the overall integrity of the internet. It emphasized the importance of not succumbing to the tactics of those one seeks to stop in the name of cybersecurity. Lycos Europe’s discontinued campaign underscored the need for thoughtful and responsible action even when addressing the scourge of internet spam – signaling that the intent to stop wrongdoing doesn't justify the use of potentially harmful methods. Conclusion - Lessons Learned: The discontinuation of Lycos Europe's anti-spam campaign serves as a critical case study for other web portals and companies operating in the digital sphere. It highlights the importance of preserving internet ethics and civility while designing digital campaigns and driving against online malpractices like spamming. As the internet continues to become more ingrained in our daily lives, it becomes increasingly necessary to tread a careful path that respects both the ethics of internet use and the urgency of effective spam control."},{"question":"Choose from options: Determine if the sentence is true based on the text below: According to AskMen, Holly Weber was the 66th most desirable woman of 2009.

Education: A Democratic administration may strive to make higher education more affordable and accessible by increasing funding for public colleges and universities, expanding student loan forgiveness programs, and providing universal access to early childhood education programs. 4. Foreign Policy: In the area of foreign policy, Democrats tend to emphasize diplomacy, global cooperation, and multilateralism. The new administration may work to repair relationships with traditional allies, recommit to NATO, lift travel bans, and re-engage in international negotiations, such as the Iran Nuclear Deal. 5. Immigration: Democratic administrations generally favor comprehensive immigration reform, which could involve providing a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, rescinding measures like the family separation policy, and revamping border security practices. 6. Social Issues: A Democratic administration would be more likely to support policies that promote LGBTQ+ rights, racial and gender equality, and abortion access, as well as advocate for criminal justice reform. 7. Tax Policy: Democrats often focus on creating a more equitable tax system. This may include raising taxes on higher-income individuals and corporations, expanding tax credits for low- and middle-income families, and closing tax loopholes. 8. Economic Policies: Democratic administrations tend to prioritize investments in infrastructure, social safety net programs, and income inequality reduction. This might involve an increase in the minimum wage, expanded worker protection laws, and more funding for public programs such as affordable housing and job training. 9. Gun Control: Democrats are generally in favor of implementing stricter gun control policies, including expanding background checks, restricting access to assault weapons, and promoting gun safety education. However, it is essential to understand that these policy changes may not all happen immediately or simultaneously, as they are contingent on various factors like congressional support, economic factors, and public opinion. Moreover, the implementation of these policies may be gradual or face opposition from various stakeholders. Regardless, a Democratic-led White House would likely prioritize these issues and work towards addressing them over the course of its term."},{"question":"Robin married Alex's cousin which he did not approve of since he hated her.

Answer the question: What is the gravitational effect on an object that is far from Earth by Earth high or low? A:","response":"The gravitational effect on an object that is far from Earth by Earth high or low can be analyzed through the principle of gravitational force, which is described by Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation. According to this law, the gravitational force between two objects is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. Mathematically, the gravitational force (F) is given by: F = (G * m1 * m2) / r^2 where: - G is the gravitational constant (6.67430 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) - m1 and m2 are the masses of the two objects (in this case, Earth and the object) - r is the distance between the centers of the two objects When the object is at a high distance (far) from Earth, the value of r will be large, and as a result, the gravitational force (F) will be lower. On the other hand, when the object is close to Earth (low distance), the value of r will be smaller, and thus the gravitational force (F) acting on the object will be higher. In summary, the gravitational effect on an object that is far from Earth (high distance) will be lower, and the effect will be higher when the object is closer to Earth (low distance). It is important to note that the gravitational force never becomes zero, but it keeps decreasing with increasing distance between the objects."},{"question":"This has to be the funniest stand up comedy I have ever seen.

I've been wedding dress shopping at about 4 places including here. This has been the worst experience I've had by far. I made an appointment over a week in advance. The woman who \\"helped\\" me, Anissa, was very unhelpful. In spite of being about 10-15 minutes into my appointment time, she ended up helping someone else who came in to pick up her dress. This was not a fast pick up process. I was left to zip up myself and walk out to the mirror alone. When I asked her how the dress looked bustled, she said she didn't know. I asked if she had a photo. She said she did not have a photo but I could look up online how dresses bustle because they are all the same. She did not offer to look up anything, write any of the dress names down, really help me with much of anything. I had to really prompt her for everything. This was my one and only chance to try on dresses with my dad. He was struggling a great deal with the camera and she did not offer to help at all. I am not a fussy bride, nor a high needs bride. I do believe that if you make an appointment in advance and are prepared to spend 2,000, the sales person should be there for the customer.

The bulk of the larger states, and some groups of small states, were integrated through a different, four-step process. The first step in this process was to convince groups of large states to combine to form a \\"princely union\\" through the execution by their rulers of Covenants of Merger. Under the Covenants of Merger, all rulers lost their ruling powers, save one who became the Rajpramukh of the new union. The other rulers were associated with two bodies—the council of rulers, whose members were the rulers of salute states, and a presidium, one or more of whose members were elected by the rulers of non-salute states, with the rest elected by the council. The Rajpramukh and his deputy Uprajpramukh were chosen by the council from among the members of the presidium. The Covenants made provision for the creation of a constituent assembly for the new union which would be charged with framing its constitution. In return for agreeing to the extinction of their states as discrete entities, the rulers were given a privy purse and guarantees similar to those provided under the Merger Agreements.Through this process, Patel obtained the unification of 222 states in the Kathiawar peninsula of his native Gujarat into the princely union of Saurashtra in January 1948, with six more states joining the union the following year. Madhya Bharat emerged on 28 May 1948 from a union of Gwalior, Indore and eighteen smaller states. In Punjab, the Patiala and East Punjab States Union was formed on 15 July 1948 from Patiala, Kapurthala, Jind, Nabha, Faridkot, Malerkotla, Nalargarh, and Kalsia. The United State of Rajasthan was formed as the result of a series of mergers, the last of which was completed on 15 May 1949. Travancore and Cochin were merged in the middle of 1949 to form the princely union of Travancore-Cochin. The only princely states which signed neither Covenants of Merger nor Merger Agreements were Kashmir, Mysore and Hyderabad. The answer to this question is:","response":"The United State of Rajasthan."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Information: - Sven Oftedal (March 22, 1844 March 30, 1911) was a Norwegian American Lutheran minister. He served as president of Augsburg College and helped found the Lutheran Free Church. - Augsburg College is a private, coeducational liberal arts college located in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Upon its founding in 1869, it was a Norwegian-American Lutheran seminary known as Augsburg Seminary. Its first college class began in the fall of 1874. Today, the college enrolls approximately 3000 undergraduate students and 800 graduate students. The school is known for its emphasis on service learning; volunteering in the community is both an instructional strategy and a required part of a students coursework.

Sven Oftedal ( 3 June 1905 -- 23 June 1948 ) was the Norwegian Minister of Social Affairs in 1945 and 1945 - 1948 . - The Lutheran Free Church (LFC) was a Lutheran denomination that existed in the United States, mainly in Minnesota and North Dakota, from 1897 until its merger into the American Lutheran Church (ALC) in 1963. The history of the church body predates its official organization, and a group of congregations that did not join the ALC formed the Association of Free Lutheran Congregations. Background. Georg Sverdrup and Sven Oftedal were two scholars from prominent Haugean families in Norway who came to Augsburg Seminary in Minneapolis, Minnesota, to teach in the 1870s, bringing with them a radical view of Christian education that was centered on Scripture and the simple doctrines of Christianity. The Haugean movement took its name from Norwegian lay evangelist Hans Nielsen Hauge who spoke up against the Church establishment in Norway. Sverdrup and Oftedal had been concerned about hierarchy within the Christian church as well as the study of the Bible. They believed that, according to the New Testament, the local congregation was the correct form of God's kingdom on earth. Their vision was for a church that promoted a living Christianity, emphasized an evangelism that would result in changed lives, and enabled the church member to exercise his/her spiritual gifts.

Guess I was lucky that night. Come to think of it, I was. I made 475 at roulette that night. Asked for a table for 3 - and immediate seating, right along the outer wall, so that we could people watch. No bad experience with 45 minute waits, or being rejected for seating. Strange group of people sifting through Vegas at those hours. Ordered a carpaccio, and a special rib-eye steak pasta. My girlfriend ordered the Calamari and Fusilli pasta, with proscuitto, peas, and truffle butter. Carpaccio - Not sure what to expect. Quite good, peppery with the peppercorns, arugula. Felt like it was missing some dressing, however. Parmesan Regianno was a bit overpowering. Seasoned mushrooms on top of the carpaccio was a good touch though. Calamari - Excellent consistency and seasoning. Not overpoweringly salty, tender calamari, but crispy batter on outside. Slight lime flavoring to accompany the taste. Basil aioli was a bit excessive, but nicely placed on the side, so completely optional. Fried pepperoncini also was quite good, made me want to eat it even though I'm not a fan of milder peppers in general. Rib-eye pasta - A very heavy pasta, using Radiatore pasta, with rib-eye steak and caramelized onions. Rib-eye was a bit overdone, in my opinion. Did not seem as tender, and did not take advantage of the natural marbling of typical rib-eye. May not have been the best cut. However, flavoring was excellent. Very hearty, like a stew. Good for a warmer day, though in Vegas, that never happens. Fusilli - Brilliant pasta dish. Although, it's not hard to mess up this one. Simple Fusilli con Piselli e Proscuitto. Though tasted so rich, likely due to truffle butter. Mmm. Truffle butter. Service was a bit weird. We had another over-excited waiter. Edged on creepy.

The Angles were a German tribe who crossed the English Channel . Later two more groups crossed to Britain. They were the Saxons and the Jutes. Through many years, the Saxons, Angles and the Jutes mixed their different languages. The result is what is called Anglo-Saxon or old English. The next great invasion of Britain was done by Vikings about 1, 100 years ago. Many English words used today come from these ancient Vikings. The next invasion of Britain took place more than 900 years ago, in 1066. History experts call this invasion the Norman Conquest. The Normans were a French-speaking people from Normandy in the north of France. These new rulers spoke only French for several hundred years. It was the most important language in the world at that time. It was the language of educated people. But the common people of Britain still spoke old English. Old English took many words from the Norman French. Some of these include \\"damage\\", \\"prison\\", and \\"marriage\\".

The local police department and city council have been attempting to devise plans to lower crime rates and increase safety, but so far, most efforts have failed to produce the desired results. Upon analyzing the data, they find that most of these crimes occur in neighborhoods with poor lighting conditions, especially during the late evening and nighttime hours. Recently, the city council has been considering the implementation of a new initiative, which involves investing in improved street lighting infrastructure throughout the city, with the primary focus on areas with the highest crime rates. By increasing the visibility in these areas, they believe that residents will feel safer and potential criminals will be deterred from committing crimes due to an increased perceived risk of apprehension. Hypothesis: The hypothesis of this initiative is that improving street lighting conditions in areas with high crime rates will significantly reduce instances of theft and burglary in the community, therefore promoting overall safety and well-being for its residents. The theory behind this hypothesis is based on the principles of \\"Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design\\" (CPTED), which states that designing a physical environment in a manner that discourages criminal behavior is an effective way to prevent crime. An increased presence of light in public spaces can help achieve this goal by making potential criminals feel more vulnerable and exposed, while also increasing the sense of security for residents as they use and navigate through their neighborhoods."},{"question":"Premise: Then it was you, Mary, who destroyed the will? She shook her head, and Poirot shook his also. Hypothesis: So you destroyed the will, Mary? She denied it. Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","response":"The hypothesis is not entirely entailed by the premise. In the given premise, we understand that there is a situation in which a character, Mary, is being accused of destroying the will. Both Mary and Poirot shake their heads in response, which generally indicates disagreement, denial, or negation, without necessarily stating it in words. The hypothesis rephrases the question and the implied denial linking to Mary. It states the question, \\"So you destroyed the will, Mary?\\" to which \\"She denied it\\" implies Mary's denial of the accusation. Now, let's break down the outcomes of each statement: - In the premise, both Mary and Poirot shake their heads, pointing to their disagreement with the accusation. - In the hypothesis, Mary verbally denies the accusation. The two statements don't completely overlap because the premise suggests a head shake disagreement but does not explicitly mention Mary's denial. The hypothesis expressly indicates her denial. However, they are similar in the fact that both statements represent Mary's lack of agreement or acknowledgment with the accusation being made. In conclusion, while the hypothesis is not entirely entailed by the premise, the premise implies a similarity in the reaction.

Snow is a type of precipitation that falls when temperatures are below freezing. 2. \\"leaves the northern hemisphere carpeted\\" - The phrase \\"carpeted\\" most likely implies an extensive covering, like when a floor is carpeted. The northern hemisphere, during wintertime, lots of its landmass gets covered in snow, particularly the farther north you go. 3. Given the fact presented initially and the subsequent statement/question, the most logical interpretation is that the question is implying does the snow (frozen rainfall) cover (carpet) the northern hemisphere.

The girls' name Vanessa was invented by which 18th century Anglo-Irish writer?","response":"The girls' name Vanessa was invented by the 18th century Anglo-Irish writer Jonathan Swift. Swift is considered one of the greatest satirists in the English language, known for his works like \\"Gulliver's Travels,\\" \\"A Tale of a Tub,\\" and \\"A Modest Proposal.\\" He was born on November 30, 1667, in Dublin, Ireland, and died on October 19, 1745. The name Vanessa came about as a result of the relationship between Jonathan Swift and Esther Vanhomrigh. Esther Vanhomrigh was the daughter of a Dutch merchant who settled in Ireland. She became infatuated with Swift, who was more than 20 years her senior, after he became her tutor in the early 1700s. They developed an intense friendship, and Swift would often send her letters under the pseudonym Cadenus, an anagram of Decanus, which means \\"Dean,\\" a title Swift held at St. Patrick's Cathedral in Dublin. Jonathan Swift created the name Vanessa by merging \\"Van\\" from Esther's last name, \\"Vanhomrigh,\\" and \\"Essa,\\" a pet form of her first name, \\"Esther\\". He used this name when referring to her in their private correspondence and in the poem \\"Cadenus and Vanessa,\\" which was published after both of their deaths. The poem chronicles the friendship between Cadenus (Swift) and a young woman named Vanessa (Esther Vanhomrigh). It is believed that their friendship was unlikely to have been a romantic one, at least on Swift's part, given his connection with another woman named Esther, Esther Johnson, who was known as \\"Stella.\\" Swift and Stella shared a close friendship, as well as rumors of a secret marriage, throughout their lives. Historically, the name Vanessa became relatively well-known after Swift's creation, and its usage grew more widespread over the centuries. Vanessa is now a common name in many countries and languages, taking on various forms and pronunciations. The invention of the name Vanessa by Jonathan Swift is a fascinating example of how a creative mind can leave a lasting impact on the world, even through something as seemingly simple as a name."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given a text from tweets and a boolean question whether this tweet has positive sentiment or negative sentiment.

Suddenly, a man (Paul Bettany) appears from the shadows, claiming to be an old friend while revealing the marten's name as Gwin. When Mo comes out of the book shop, he quickly recognizes the man as a person called Dustfinger, whom quickly asks to be read back into the book, only for Mo to flee with Meggie from him. Travelling across Italy, Mo takes Meggie on a visit to Meggie's great aunt Elinor (Helen Mirren), whereupon he reveals to Meggie why he fled from Dustfinger. While she was young, Mo read to her from Inkheart, inadvertently freeing Dustfinger as a result, due to a gift he possessed from birth, that marks him as a \\"Silver Tongue\\". Unfortunately, his gift also freed the book's villain Capricorn (Andy Serkis) and several of his henchman, but at the same time, losing Resa after being forced to flee with his infant daughter. Soon, Dustfinger reappears seeking Mo, accompanied by Capricorn's minion, Basta (Jamie Foreman), who quickly captures Mo and his family and takes back Inkheart, destroying Elinor's valuable library in the process. The four are taken to Capricorn's new castle in the real world, and imprisoned in the stables, which house various creatures from different storybooks, including the winged monkeys from The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, the...

Debates were covered on front pages of college newspapers and emphasized in yearbooks, and team members even received the equivalent of athletic letters for their jackets. There even were rallies sending off the debating teams to matches. Yet, the debates never attained the broad appeal that athletics enjoyed. One reason may be that debates do not have a clear winner, as is the case in sports, and that scoring is subjective. In addition, with late 19th-century concerns about the impact of modern life on the human body, athletics offered hope that neither the individual nor the society was coming apart.\\" Answer: A:","response":"The formation of debate in American colleges was significantly influenced by athletics during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Athletics served as a powerful model that provided structure, enthusiasm, and recognition to early debate competitions, guiding their development with the use of rhetoric, symbolism, and metaphors that were commonly associated with sports. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, higher education was experiencing a shift that broadened the emphasis on physical activities and sports, especially in elite universities such as Harvard, Yale, and Princeton. This time frame is marked by the establishment of intercollegiate sports, including the first debate between Harvard and Yale in 1892. As intercollegiate sports rapidly gained prestige and popularity, competitions between the schools attracted extensive coverage in college newspapers, with debates being featured on their front pages. This widespread recognition was essential in molding the early perceptions of debating as a competitive and prestigious activity. Athletic-inspired symbolism and metaphors were an integral part of the way debates were framed and perceived, with words like \\"teams,\\" \\"matches,\\" and \\"rallies\\" being borrowed from the sports jargon. The use of athletic terminology helped to create a shared vocabulary and understanding of debate competitions, reinforcing the similarities and common ground between athletics and debating. The adoption of sports metaphors also allowed for a more engaging and vivid representation of academic competitions, making them more relatable and appealing to the general public. The emulation of athletic practices went beyond the language and covered various aspects of debate competitions. Debaters were granted the equivalent of athletic letters to wear on their jackets, recognizing and rewarding their achievements in a manner analogous to sports stars. Moreover, the practice of holding rallies for sending off debate teams to compete in matches mirrored the enthusiasm and support typically reserved for sports events. These actions helped elevate the status of debating, reinforcing its competitive nature and fostering a sense of pride and camaraderie among team members. Despite the clear impact of athletics on the formation of debate, there were notable differences and limitations that prevented debates from achieving the same level of widespread appeal as sports events. One key factor was the lack of a clear winner in debates. Unlike sports competitions, where victories can be objectively quantified by points or scores, debates relied on subjective evaluations, making it difficult to determine a definite winning team. This aspect might have dampened the excitement and attraction for some spectators, who were less inclined to engage with an ambiguous contest. Another possible reason for the lesser appeal of debates compared to athletics is related to the late 19th-century concerns about the impact of modern life on the human body. Athletics embodied an ideal of physical excellence and the rejuvenation of the body, providing hope and reassurance for the general public faced with the challenges of rapid societal changes. In comparison, debates, although challenging and stimulating for the participants, did not offer the same promise of physical resilience and the strengthening of the individual or community. In conclusion, athletics played a crucial role in guiding the formation of debate during the late 19th and early 20th centuries by providing a powerful model for organizing and presenting intellectual competitions. The adoption of athletic rhetoric, symbolism, and metaphors, as well as the emulation of various practices from sports events, helped elevate the prestige and status of debating. However, inherent limitations and differing societal expectations prevented debates from attaining the broad appeal that athletics enjoyed during that time."},{"question":"Information: - The Atari 8-bit family is a series of 8-bit home computers introduced by Atari, Inc. in 1979 and manufactured until 1992.

Title: Disappointing Superhero As a major fan of superhero movies, I eagerly awaited the release of \\"Disappointing Superhero\\", but I must admit, this movie did not live up to the expectations set by its marketing campaign. I will lay out the reasons for my negative review step by step. 1. Poor Character Development: One of the key elements of a successful superhero movie is strong, relatable characters. Unfortunately, \\"Disappointing Superhero\\" failed in this aspect. The protagonist's backstory lacked depth, and it was hard to understand the motivations behind their actions. The supporting characters were equally disappointing, with very little effort put into making them memorable or significant to the plot. 2. Underwhelming Visual Effects: A good superhero movie needs breathtaking visual effects to keep the audience engaged. However, the CGI and special effects in \\"Disappointing Superhero\\" were subpar and detracted from the overall experience. In some scenes, the green screen was glaringly obvious, and the lack of attention to detail took me out of the immersive world the creators were trying to build. 3. Predictable Storyline: The plot of \\"Disappointing Superhero\\" was formulaic and unoriginal. From the beginning, it was easy to foresee the twists and turns the story would take. This predictability made it impossible to feel genuinely invested in the narrative. Even worse, the third act felt rushed, leaving a lot of loose ends untied and giving no satisfying conclusion to the story. 4. Lackluster Villain: The antagonist in \\"Disappointing Superhero\\" was one-dimensional and failed to pose a significant threat to the hero. They were easily defeated and even seemed to lack motivation for their evil endeavors. It's difficult for a viewer to feel the tension and fear that should come from a powerful adversary when the villain is written so weakly. 5. Subpar Acting: The performances from the lead actors felt forced and wooden, which ultimately made it difficult to identify with or care about the characters. It seemed as if the actors were more focused on delivering punchlines rather than delving into the emotional layers of their roles. In conclusion, \\"Disappointing Superhero\\" is a letdown for fans of the genre. Despite its enticing premise and potential for greatness, the movie suffers from weak character development, poor visual effects, a predictable plot, a forgettable villain, and subpar performances from the cast. I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this film to anyone in search of an engaging and immersive superhero experience."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Question: What southern area not in the US are you likely to find a marmoset?

The final bill will likely include a mandate that most Americans buy health insurance, subsidies for the purchase of insurance and bans on denial of coverage based on pre-existing conditions. The bill may also include a \\"public option,\\" government insurance that would compete with private insurance. The underlying presumption behind this legislation is that government health insurance should be expanded to cover the uninsured. This presumption is wrong. Government should not subsidize health insurance -- for the uninsured, the poor, the elderly or anyone else -- or regulate health insurance markets. Here's why. Subsidizing health insurance means that patients and doctors are insulated from the costs of health care, so they utilize too much -- often in the form of unnecessary tests or medical procedures whose value hasn't been proven. This excess demand, along with technological progress, means rapidly growing deficits, so governments limit reimbursements to health providers or ration care. This kills innovation and creates its own inequities. The taxes necessary to fund subsidies are a drag on economic growth. The reason the Obama administration and congressional Democrats are seeking to cover the uninsured is that health insurance is expensive. Without government support, many people could not afford health insurance. The conventional wisdom is that government should therefore subsidize health insurance for those who cannot afford it. This confuses two issues: whether government should help the poor, and how government should help the poor. If society wants everyone to have health insurance, the obvious approach is to give the poor enough money so that individuals can purchase on their own. Just because people want government to help the poor doesn't require it to pay for specific kinds of goods. If some people do not purchase insurance and then become ill, they would have to rely on private charity. Now one possible objection to designing anti-poverty programs in this way -- cash transfers, but no subsidies for health insurance -- is that it would require a lot of cash. That is not a convincing objection. Health insurance is just as expensive if provided as a separate benefit. The cash approach makes clear just how much money is involved, but it does not increase the amount. The other possible objection to the cash transfer approach holds that, if left unregulated, private health insurers would deny coverage based on pre-existing conditions. Thus, some people might get no health insurance at all. This outcome is unlikely, however, assuming health insurance is unregulated. In that case, insurers would set higher premiums for the unhealthy, but they would cover anyone willing to pay a sufficiently high price. Thus, the question is whether society should compensate those who face higher prices because of their health status? The answer is no. Advocates for such compensation would suggest that it is basic fairness for society to insure people against the bad luck of being born with lousy genes. Many differences in health status, however, arise from behavior: heart disease from overeating, lung cancer from smoking, and cirrhosis from drinking, to name a few. If society compensates everyone for differences in their health status, it is often rewarding unhealthy behavior, perhaps even encouraging it. In addition, it is logical for society to treat the differences in financial well-being due to health in the same way it treats differences due to IQ, athletic ability, race, country of origin, family background, and so on. These and other factors mean that some people, through no fault of their own, face hard financial circumstances, whether because of their ability to earn income or because of the higher prices they face for certain goods, such as health insurance. Yet if society tried to equalize all differences resulting from, say, IQ, it would kill the incentive to work hard and destroy the economy's productive capacity. Thus, most people believe society should reduce these differences -- by helping the poor -- but most also recognize that society should not attempt to eliminate all differences. This same tradeoff -- between helping the least fortunate and promoting an efficient economy -- applies in the case of health insurance. A reasonable balance is for government to provide a social safety net that protects the poor and allows them to purchase some health insurance on their own. An alternative is to provide health insurance vouchers, but only to the poorest segment of society. Guaranteeing health insurance for everyone is too costly, and it means worse health care for everyone. That is why Obamacare, and existing subsidies for health insurance, are treatments that are worse than the disease. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jeffrey Miron. What are highlight points for this article?","response":"1. The underlying presumption behind the proposed health care bill is that government health insurance should be expanded to cover the uninsured, which the author argues is wrong. 2. Subsidizing health insurance can lead to overutilization of medical services, increasing deficits and hindering innovation while also creating inequities. 3. The author suggests that instead of subsidizing health insurance, the government should provide cash transfers to the poor, allowing them to purchase insurance themselves. 4. Unregulated private health insurers are more likely to cover individuals with pre-existing conditions at higher premiums, as opposed to denying coverage altogether. 5. Equalizing all financial differences due to factors like health status, IQ, or background would destroy economic incentives and productivity. Instead, the author proposes providing a basic social safety net or health insurance vouchers for the poorest segment of society."},{"question":"Data: name = The Phoenix, food = Chinese, priceRange = cheap, priceRange = moderate, customer rating = 1 out of 5, area = city centre.

Article: Todd McHugh doesn't think he is a hero, but police say the California teenager probably saved a mother and her two young children from serious injury or death last month. He pulled them out of their car, stuck on light-rail tracks in Folsom, California, about 90 seconds before a train smashed into it. McHugh, 17, was northbound on his way to meet friends when the silver car in front of him turned off the road, went into a ditch and jolted to a stop on the tracks. McHugh jumped out of his vehicle and went to help. The driver, a woman who police say had fallen asleep, was behind the wheel and dazed. Her two daughters aged 7 and 10, were in the back seat, buckled in. McHugh took the woman's hand and helped her from the car. She unbuckled the kids. Another driver who had pulled over to help shouted that a train was coming, McHugh recalled. Police said the other man ran along the tracks and tried to wave down the train. It was dark and there was a bend in the tracks. The train operator probably never saw him. McHugh said the driver applied the brakes, but the train was still going fast when it came up on them. The woman, her daughters and McHugh took shelter behind his truck as the train smashed into their car, dragging it down the tracks, the teenager said. The woman's car was destroyed. Officials said the train was damaged. But none of the crew and four passengers were injured. Police said the outcome could have been far worse: \\"Had she sat there for another minute or two, she and her daughters could have been in that vehicle when the train struck it, and they could have been severely injured or killed.\\" McHugh said he \\"didn't do anything anyone else wouldn't have done.\\" Question: What can we infer from the passage?

Movie title: Paranormal Activity Movie plot: Young couple Katie and Micah move to a new house in San Diego. Katie claims an evil presence has been haunting her since she was a child, so Micah sets up a camera in their bedroom to record any paranormal activity that occurs while they sleep. Katie hires psychic Dr. Fredrichs, who reveals that Katie is being haunted by a demon that feeds off of negative energy and is intent on tormenting Katie. He advises them not to communicate with the demon and to contact demonologist Dr. Johann Averies if needed. Katie seems interested, but Micah does not take this seriously. The camera manages to capture many strange occurrences, which are minor at first, such as noises, flickering lights, and doors moving on their own. On the thirteenth night they were awoken at the sound of a screeching demon downstairs. During the fifteenth night, Katie, in an apparent trance, stands beside the bed and stares at Micah for two hours before going outside. Micah tries to convince Katie to go back inside, but she refuses and appears to remember none of it the next day. One day Micah brings home a Ouija board, which infuriates Katie. When they leave the house, the camera records an unseen force moving the planchette to form an unknown message on the Ouija board, which then spontaneously catches fire. Katie sees the video and pleads with Micah to contact the demonologist, but again he refuses. During the seventeenth night, Micah sprinkles baby powder in the hallway and bedroom. The couple are awakened by creaks, and find non-human footprints leading to the attic, where Micah finds a burnt photograph of a young Katie, previously thought to have been destroyed in an unexplained house fire. Katie finally calls the demonologist, Dr. Averies, but he is occupied. They eventually call Dr. Fredrichs back to the house, but he is overwhelmed by the demonic energy upon entering. He apologetically leaves despite their pleas, stating that his presence only makes the demon angrier. During the twentieth night, Katie is pulled out of the bedroom by an...","response":"In \\"Paranormal Activity\\", Micah sets up a camera in the bedroom shared with his wife Katie. This decision is directly influenced by consistent claims from Katie stating that an evil presence has been haunting her since she was a child. His motive is to capture footage of any paranormal activities that the couple might experience while they are sleeping. It's key to their investigation into the eerie happenings in their home, and is once used as a central tool to document and analyze these occurrences. The idea to document the supposed paranormal activities demonstrates Micah's skeptical outlook on the situation. Unlike Katie, he does not initially believe in the presence of any supernatural entity. He remains skeptical, even as the psychic Dr. Fredrichs warns them of a tormenting demon haunting Katie. Despite Katie's willingness to seek professional help from the demonologist Dr. Johann Averies, Micah dismisses the suggestion. The camera set up by Micah later captures several disturbing incidents, validating Katie's experiences. These recorded instances include strange noises, flickering lights, and doors opening and closing on their own. The occurrences are minor at first but progressively escalate to more profound events like Katie standing in a trance, unseen forces manipulating the Ouija board, and physical evidence of non-human footprints in the house. Even when the manifestations become more drastic, Micah continues refusing to contact a professional demonologist, showing his stubbornness and prioritization of evidence above personal safety. This constant recording also highlights the tension and deterioration of their relationship under the stress of these supernatural happenings. They argue frequently over the situation, especially when Micah brings a Ouija board, against Katie's worries. Micah prioritizes recording and gathering evidence over Katie's mental and emotional wellbeing, and this ultimately leads to their downward spiral as the hauntings escalate. By setting up the camera, Micah essentially becomes a catalyst for the events that unfold rather than a deterrent. The demon feeds on negative energy, and the camera's intrusive presence and Micah's obsession with it exacerbate Katie's fear and tension, providing the energy for the demon to grow stronger. His refusal to accept external help also presents him as a tragic figure of hubris, as his reliance on his own prowess to deal with the situation backfires. In an investment perspective, looking on how this plot unfolds, it explores an interesting mix of found-footage horror, interpersonal conflict, and supernatural elements. Its low-budget setup with maximum payoff presents a unique opportunity for profit considering the popularity of horror genre. Nevertheless, it's also critical to evaluate other areas including public reception, market trends, potential for sequels, associated risks, and the production team's expertise and track record in the industry."},{"question":"Write a sentence about the following things: bay, island, lie","response":"A bay is like a big pool of water beside the land, an island is like a piece of land floating in water, and lie means to rest or to not tell the truth, little buddy."},{"question":"Generate a question about the following movie plot: In the year AD 140, twenty years after the Ninth Legion disappeared in the north of Britain, Marcus Flavius Aquila, a young Roman centurion, arrives in Roman Britain to serve at his first post as a garrison commander.

A:","response":"Title: Beneath the Surface Genre: Action, Adventure, Thriller Logline: When the S-33, an American submarine, mysteriously sinks after an encounter with a German resupply sub, the surviving crew must navigate the depths of the ocean and unravel the connection between the two submarines before a sabotaged mission puts the world at risk. Plot: Act I: The year is 1942, at the height of World War II. The S-33, an American submarine, is tasked with a covert mission to intercept communications between two enemy vessels in the Atlantic Ocean. Led by Commander John Harris, the crew is composed of a mix of seasoned sailors and fresh recruits, inexperienced but eager to prove their worth. As the S-33 travels through hostile waters, tensions among the crew rise, particularly between the young rookie Logan Thompson and the hardened Chief Petty Officer, Jack Mitchell. Their bickering becomes a subplot that runs throughout the film. Act II: The S-33 receives orders to engage a top-secret German resupply submarine, believed to be containing a powerful new weapon that could shift the balance of the war. As they close in on the target, a surprise depth charge attack launched by the German sub cripples the S-33, causing it to sink to the depths of the ocean. Exploring the wreckage of their vessel, the surviving crew members discover that the attacks were anticipated, as crucial information about their mission was leaked. Was there a mole aboard the S-33? The crew struggles to determine who could be responsible for the betrayal, with the ongoing conflict between Logan and Jack intensifying under suspicion. Act III: While working together to salvage essential equipment from the damaged S-33, Logan and Jack accidentally uncover a hidden chamber containing classified documents. These files reveal that a high-ranking American officer was secretly collaborating with the German resupply submarine to transport illicit materials meant to frame the American government for war crimes. It becomes apparent that leaking the information that led to the S-33's sinking was part of the traitor's plan. With the knowledge of the conspiracy, Commander Harris leads the crew in capturing the German submarine and securing its dangerous cargo. They then use the sub and its communication system to expose the traitorous American officer and foil his sinister plot, and clear their names in the process. In a suspenseful climax, the crew faces a final confrontation with the traitor's allies who attempt to keep the truth from emerging. Through their bravery and teamwork, they ultimately triumph over their enemies, proving their camaraderie was not destroyed by the suspicion and tensions that plagued them earlier. In the end, the bonds between the crew members are reaffirmed, and they return home as heroes, their mission and the S-33's sacrifice now acknowledged as essential in preventing a potential global catastrophe. Beneath the Surface is a thrilling war adventure that dives deep into the human spirit, confronting themes of loyalty, betrayal, trust, and the unwavering bond between soldiers in the face of adversity."},{"question":"\\"he rushed out the gate and ran out to greet them . the man pulled the wagon to a stop and christine along with arlo got down . wade reached her and they hugged each other tightly . \`\` i 'll never go back unless you go with me , '' she said softly to him . wade let go of christine and picked up _ ...\\" What is the word in the blank space (_)?

Victoria believed the rumours. She hated Conroy, and despised \\"that odious Lady Flora\\", because she had conspired with Conroy and the Duchess of Kent in the Kensington System. At first, Lady Flora refused to submit to a naked medical examination, until in mid-February she eventually agreed, and was found to be a virgin. Conroy, the Hastings family and the opposition Tories organised a press campaign implicating the Queen in the spreading of false rumours about Lady Flora. When Lady Flora died in July, the post-mortem revealed a large tumour on her liver that had distended her abdomen. At public appearances, Victoria was hissed and jeered as \\"Mrs. Melbourne\\". What lady in waiting was at the heart of a 1839 court scandal?","response":"The lady-in-waiting at the heart of the 1839 court scandal was Lady Flora Hastings. She was one of Queen Victoria's mother's ladies-in-waiting and developed an abdominal growth that sparked wide rumours, claiming it to be due to an out-of-wedlock pregnancy by Sir John Conroy. Queen Victoria was amongst those who believed these rumours, her distaste for both Lady Flora and Sir John Conroy already well established, rooted in their conspiracies with the Duchess of Kent as part of the Kensington System. The scandal stirred further when Lady Flora initially refused a medical examination, a potential attempt to debase the rumours. It was not until mid-February that she reluctantly agreed to undergo the examination, which ultimately refuted the circulating speculations by confirming her as a virgin. The controversy did not end there. Sir John Conroy, the Hastings family, and the opposition Tories started a press campaign against the Queen, accusing her of spreading the false rumours about Lady Flora. The court scandal peaked when Lady Flora died in July of the same year. Her post-mortem revealed a large tumour on her liver, which had been the real cause behind the noticeable distention in her abdomen, not a pregnancy as rumoured.

A few years ago, June was surprised and excited when she came into a fortune from her uncle, who had been single. After receiving it, she made a shopping list. On it she wrote down all the ways she could use to spend the money. Every time I told her not to spend all of the money and to save some, she would always say impatiently , \\" I know, I know!\\" One day, when I was in June's home, she passed a piece of paper to me. \\"I thought over your suggestion for several nights.

Cut off the tops of the seed pod branches. Cut away dead or diseased branches. Prune off wispy branches. Cut off branches that are rubbing against the main stem. Prune 1/3 of the plant over several seasons to \\"restart\\" your plant. Article:","response":"Title: How to Take Care of Your Plant: A Simple Guide for Little Gardeners Hey, little gardener! Today, I'm going to tell you how to take care of your plants by doing something called \\"pruning.\\" Pruning means cutting off some parts of the plant to help it grow better and stay healthy. So grab your kid-safe scissors and let's learn how to do this together! 1. Look for Extra Stems First, we are going to look for what we call \\"secondary stems.\\" These are like the extra arms of the plant that grow really close to the ground. If your plant is all grown up (or \\"mature\\"), you might see two or three of these extra stems. 2. Give the Seed Pods a Haircut Next, we want to find the seed pod branches. Seed pods are like little houses that the plant's seeds live in. The branches holding these seed pods might have some extra, unnecessary parts at their tops. So, just like you get a haircut, we are going to give these branches a little snip at the top. 3. Remove the Unhealthy Parts Sometimes, some parts of our plants get sick or don't look good. These are usually the dead or diseased branches. It's important to help your plant stay healthy by gently cutting away these parts. 4. Say Goodbye to Thin Branches Now, look for thin, weak branches that we call \\"wispy branches.\\" These branches don't help the plant grow very well, so we want to remove them by cutting them off. 5. Stop Branches from Rubbing Against Each Other You know how when you and your friends play \\"London Bridge,\\" you hold hands? Well, sometimes branches do that too, but it's not very good for your plant. We need to cut off the branches that are rubbing against the main stem of the plant. That way, they won't give your plant boo-boos. 6. Give Your Plant a Fresh Start Lastly, we'll do what's called \\"restarting\\" your plant. This doesn't mean starting all over. It just means we're going to help your plant feel like new again! How? By pruning off one-third of the plant. But don't do this all at once! Help your plant restart by doing this over a few different times, like over a few seasons. And that's it! Great job, little gardener! Now your plant should be all set to grow big and strong. Remember, taking care of plants is a fun and important job, so keep practicing and you'll be a plant pro in no time!"},{"question":"Please answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose third Benhardt play was La Tosca? , can you please find it? The French playwright Victorien Sardou wrote more than 70 plays, almost all of them successful, and none of them performed today. In the early 1880s Sardou began a collaboration with actress Sarah Bernhardt, whom he provided with a series of historical melodramas. His third Bernhardt play, La Tosca, which premiered in Paris on 24 November 1887, and in which she starred throughout Europe, was an outstanding success, with more than 3,000 performances in France alone.Puccini had seen La Tosca at least twice, in Milan and Turin. On 7 May 1889 he wrote to his publisher, Giulio Ricordi, begging him to get Sardou's permission for the work to be made into an opera: \\"I see in this Tosca the opera I need, with no overblown proportions, no elaborate spectacle, nor will it call for the usual excessive amount of music.\\"Ricordi sent his agent in Paris, Emanuele Muzio, to negotiate with Sardou, who preferred that his play be adapted by a French composer. He complained about the reception La Tosca had received in Italy, particularly in Milan, and warned that other composers were interested in the piece. Nonetheless, Ricordi reached terms with Sardou and assigned the librettist Luigi Illica to write a scenario for an adaptation.In 1891, Illica advised Puccini against the project, most likely because he felt the play could not be successfully adapted to a musical form. When Sardou expressed his unease at entrusting his most successful work to a relatively new composer whose music he did not like, Puccini took offence. He withdrew from the agreement, which Ricordi then assigned to the composer Alberto Franchetti. Illica wrote a libretto for Franchetti, who was never at ease with the assignment. When Puccini once again became interested in Tosca, Ricordi was able to get Franchetti to surrender the rights so he could recommission Puccini. One story relates that Ricordi convinced Franchetti that the work was too violent to be successfully staged. A Franchetti family tradition holds that Franchetti gave the work back as a grand...

It is measured by assessing the patterns of variation in temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, precipitation, atmospheric particle count and other meteorological variables in a given region over long periods of time. Climate differs from weather, in that weather only describes the short-term conditions of these variables in a given region. - Agriculture is the cultivation and breeding of animals, plants and fungi for food, fiber, biofuel, medicinal plants and other products used to sustain and enhance human life. Agriculture was the key development in the rise of sedentary human civilization, whereby farming of domesticated species created food surpluses that nurtured the development of civilization. The study of agriculture is known as agricultural science. The history of agriculture dates back thousands of years, and its development has been driven and defined by greatly different climates, cultures, and technologies. Industrial agriculture based on large-scale monoculture farming has become the dominant agricultural methodology. - Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for the body. It is usually of plant or animal origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals. The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells to provide energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth. - Management (or managing) is the administration of an organization, whether it be a business, a not-for-profit organization, or government body. Management includes the activities of setting the strategy of an organization and coordinating the efforts of its employees or volunteers to accomplish its objectives through the application of available resources, such as financial, natural, technological, and human resources. The term \\"management\\" may also refer to the people who manage an organization. - The Caribbean (or ) is a region that consists of the Caribbean Sea, its islands (some surrounded by the Caribbean Sea and some bordering both the Caribbean Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean) and the surrounding coasts. The region is southeast of the Gulf of Mexico and the North American mainland, east of Central America, and north of South America. - A breed is a specific group of domestic animals having homogeneous appearance (phenotype), homogeneous behavior, and/or other characteristics that distinguish it from other organisms of the same species. Breeds are formed through genetic isolation and either natural adaptation to the environment or selective breeding, or a combination of the two. Despite the centrality of the idea of \\"breeds\\" to animal husbandry and agriculture, no single, scientifically accepted definition of the term exists. A breed is therefore not an objective or biologically verifiable classification but is instead a term of art amongst groups of breeders who share a consensus around what qualities make some members of a given species members of a nameable subset. - <onlyinclude> Agricultural science is a broad multidisciplinary field of biology that encompasses the parts of exact, natural, economic and social sciences that are used in the practice and understanding of agriculture. (Veterinary science, but not animal science, is often excluded from the definition.)</onlyinclude> - A currency (from , \\"in circulation\\", from ) in the most specific use of the word refers to money in any form when in actual use or circulation as a medium of exchange, especially circulating banknotes and coins. A more general definition is that a currency is a \\"system of money\\" (monetary units) in common use, especially in a nation. Under this definition, US dollars, British pounds, Australian dollars, and European euros are examples of currency. These various currencies are recognized stores of value and are traded between nations in foreign exchange markets, which determine the relative values of the different currencies. Currencies in this sense are defined by governments, and each type has limited boundaries of acceptance. - The Dominican Republic is a sovereign state occupying the eastern two-thirds of the island of Hispaniola, in the Greater Antilles archipelago in the Caribbean region. The western one-third of the island is occupied by the nation of Haiti, making Hispaniola one of two Caribbean islands, along with Saint Martin, that are shared by two countries. The Dominican Republic is the second-largest Caribbean nation by area (after Cuba) at , and 3rd by population with 10.08 million people, of which approximately three million live in the metropolitan area of Santo Domingo, the capital city. - Plants are mainly multicellular, predominantly photosynthetic eukaryotes of the kingdom Plantae. - In economics, products can be classified into goods and services. Goods are items that are tangible, such as books, pens, salt, shoes, hats and folders. Services are activities provided by other people, such as doctors, lawn care workers, dentists, barbers, waiters, or online servers. According to economic theory, consumption of goods and services is assumed to provide utility (satisfaction) to the consumer or end-user, although businesses also consume goods and services in the course of producing other goods and services. - Port-Margot is a commune in the Borgne Arrondissement, in the Nord Department of Haiti. It has 36,937 inhabitants. - The Caribbean Sea is a sea of the Atlantic Ocean in the tropics of the Western Hemisphere. It is bounded by Mexico and Central America to the west and south west, to the north by the Greater Antilles starting with Cuba, to the east by the Lesser Antilles, and to the south by the north coast of South America. - Fiber or fibre (from the Latin fibra) is a natural or synthetic substance that is significantly longer than it is wide. Fibers are often used in the manufacture of other materials. The strongest engineering materials often incorporate fibers, for example carbon fiber and ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene. - A fuel is any material that can be made to react with other substances so that it releases chemical or nuclear energy as heat or to be used for work. The concept was originally applied solely to those materials capable of releasing chemical energy but has since also been applied to other sources of heat energy such as nuclear energy (via nuclear fission and nuclear fusion). - The history of agriculture records the domestication of plants and animals and the development and dissemination of techniques for raising them productively. Agriculture began independently in different parts of the globe, and included a diverse range of taxa. At least 11 separate regions of the Old and New World were involved as independent centers of origin. - A biofuel is a fuel that is produced through contemporary biological processes, such as agriculture and anaerobic digestion, rather than a fuel produced by geological processes such as those involved in the formation of fossil fuels, such as coal and petroleum, from prehistoric biological matter. Biofuels can be derived directly from plants, or indirectly from agricultural, commercial, domestic, and/or industrial wastes. Renewable biofuels generally involve contemporary carbon fixation, such as those that occur in plants or microalgae through the process of photosynthesis. Other renewable biofuels are made through the use or conversion of biomass (referring to recently living organisms, most often referring to plants or plant-derived materials). This biomass can be converted to convenient energy-containing substances in three different ways: thermal conversion, chemical conversion, and biochemical conversion. This biomass conversion can result in fuel in solid, liquid, or gas form. This new biomass can also be used directly for biofuels. - Borgne is an arrondissement in the Nord Department of Haiti. It has 83,823 inhabitants. Postal codes in the Borgne Arrondissement start with the number 15. - Hispaniola (Spanish: \\"La Española\\"; Latin: \\"Hispaniola\\"; Taíno: \\"Haiti\\") is the 22nd-largest island in the world, located in the Caribbean island group, the Greater Antilles. It is the second largest island in the Caribbean after Cuba, and the tenth most populous island in the world. - Medicinal plants have been identified and used throughout human history. Plants make many chemical compounds that are for biological functions, including defence against insects, fungi and herbivorous mammals. At least 12,000 such compounds have been isolated so far; a number estimated to be less than 10% of the total. Chemical compounds in plants mediate their effect on the human body through processes identical to those already well understood for the chemical compounds in conventional drugs; thus herbal medicines do not differ greatly from conventional drugs in terms of how they work. This enables herbal medicines to have beneficial pharmacology, but also gives them the same potential as conventional pharmaceutical drugs to cause harmful side effects. Moreover, plant material comes with a variety of compounds which may have undesired effects, though these can be reduced by processing. - An economy (From Greek \\"household\\" and o \\"manage\\") is an area of the production, distribution, or trade, and consumption of goods and services by different agents in a given geographical location. Understood in its broadest sense, 'The economy is defined as a social domain that emphasizes the practices, discourses, and material expressions associated with the production, use and management of resources'. Economic agents can be individuals, businesses, organizations, or governments. Economic transactions occur when two parties agree to the value or price of the transacted good or service, commonly expressed in a certain currency, but monetary transactions are only a small part of the economic domain. - Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms of the kingdom Animalia (also called Metazoa). The animal kingdom emerged as a basal clade within Apoikozoa as a sister of the choanoflagellates. Sponges are the most basal clade of animals. Animals are motile, meaning they can move spontaneously and independently at some point in their lives. Their body plan eventually becomes fixed as they develop, although some undergo a process of metamorphosis later in their lives. All animals are heterotrophs: they must ingest other organisms or their products for sustenance. - Haiti , officially the Republic of Haiti, is a sovereign state located on the island of Hispaniola in the Greater Antilles archipelago of the Caribbean Sea. It occupies the western three-eighths of the island, which it shares with the Dominican Republic. Haiti is in size and has an estimated 10.6 million people, making it the most populous country in the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and the second-most populous country in the Caribbean as a whole. - The Greater Antilles is a grouping of the larger islands in the Caribbean Sea: Cuba, Hispaniola (containing Haiti and the Dominican Republic), Puerto Rico, Jamaica, and the Cayman Islands. The Greater Antilles constitute over 90% of the land mass of the entire West Indies, as well as over 90% of its population, with the balance made of the archipelago of the Lesser Antilles, which is a chain of islands to the east (running north-south and encompassing the eastern edge of the Caribbean Sea where it meets the Atlantic Ocean) and south (running east-west off the northern coast of South America). - Borgne ( Haitian Creole : Obòy ) is a commune in the north coast of Haiti , west of Cap - Haïtien and northwest of Limbé , in Nord Department . The economy there is based on agriculture and fishery . Other nearby places include Port - Margot , Robin , and Fond La Grange . Borgne is currently in the early stages of developing a \`\` sister cities '' relationship with Honeoye Falls , New York , United States . Satellite view of Borgne - Monoculture is the agricultural practice of producing or growing a single crop, plant, or livestock species, variety, or breed in a field or farming system at a time. Polyculture, where more than one crop is grown in the same space at the same time, is the alternative to monoculture. Monoculture is widely used in both industrial farming and organic farming and has allowed increased efficiency in planting and harvest. - Trade, or commerce, involves the transfer of goods and/or services from one person or entity to another, often in exchange for money. A network that allows trade is called a market. - A farm is an area of land that is devoted primarily to agricultural processes with the primary objective of producing food and other crops; it is the basic facility in food production. The name is used for specialised units such as arable farms, vegetable farms, fruit farms, dairy, pig and poultry farms, and land used for the production of natural fibres, biofuel and other commodities. It includes ranches, feedlots, orchards, plantations and estates, smallholdings and hobby farms, and includes the farmhouse and agricultural buildings as well as the land. In modern times the term has been extended so as to include such industrial operations as wind farms and fish farms, both of which can operate on land or sea. - Ants are eusocial insects of the family Formicidae and, along with the related wasps and bees, belong to the order Hymenoptera. Ants evolved from wasp-like ancestors in the Cretaceous period, about 99 million years ago and diversified after the rise of flowering plants. More than 12,500 of an estimated total of 22,000 species have been classified. They are easily identified by their elbowed antennae and the distinctive node-like structure that forms their slender waists. - Culture can be defined in numerous ways. In the words of anthropologist E.B. Tylor, it is \\"that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society.\\" Alternatively, in a contemporary variant, \\"Culture is defined as a social domain that emphasizes the practices, discourses and material expressions, which, over time, express the continuities and discontinuities of social meaning of a life held in common.\\" - A civilization, or civilisation (see spelling differences), is any complex society characterized by urban development, social stratification, symbolic communication forms (typically, writing systems), and a perceived separation from and domination over the natural environment by a cultural elite. Civilizations are intimately associated with and often further defined by other socio-politico-economic characteristics, including centralization, the domestication of both humans and other organisms, specialization of labour, culturally ingrained ideologies of progress and supremacism, monumental architecture, taxation, societal dependence upon farming as an agricultural practice, and expansionism. - Fond La Grange is a village near Borgne, Haiti. A hospital is located there. The hospital is run by the Alyans Sante Borgne, a partnership between the nongovernmental organization H.O.P.E. (Haiti Outreach Pwoje Espwa, based in Rochester New York) and the Haitian government's ministry of public health (MSPP). - Borgne is a commune in the Borgne Arrondissement, in the Nord department of Haiti. The economy there is based on agriculture and fishery. Other nearby places include Port-Margot, Robin, and Fond La Grange. Borgne is currently in the early stages of developing a \\"sister cities\\" relationship with Honeoye Falls, New York, United States. - Established in 1973, the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) is an organization of fifteen Caribbean nations and dependencies. CARICOM's main purposes are to promote economic integration and cooperation among its members, to ensure that the benefits of integration are equitably shared, and to coordinate foreign policy. Its major activities involve coordinating economic policies and development planning; devising and instituting special projects for the less-developed countries within its jurisdiction; operating as a regional single market for many of its members (Caricom Single Market); and handling regional trade disputes.

Second question: How long does it take weed to get out of your system? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","response":"Yes, those two questions are asking the same thing. They both want to know how long it takes for marijuana, which is also called weed, to leave your body. Now, think of your body like a magical toy box. When you put a toy (in this case, marijuana) inside the box, it takes some time for it to disappear. It doesn't go away all at once, but after a while, the magical box makes the toy harder and harder to find. For marijuana, our body may take a few days to a month to make it all go away. It depends on how much of the toy was put into the box and how the box works for each person. Some people's magical toy boxes are quicker, while others take longer."},{"question":"Q:Generate a 5-star review (1 being lowest and 5 being highest) about an app with package com.google.android.gms.

In this article, we will explore three unique techniques using natural ingredients such as hydrogen peroxide, strawberries, and activated charcoal, to whiten and remove stains from your teeth. 1. Rinse with 3% Hydrogen Peroxide Hydrogen peroxide is a popular ingredient in many store-bought teeth whitening products, and for good reason. It's well known for its antibacterial and bleaching properties. Here's how to use it: Step 1: Gather a bottle of 3% hydrogen peroxide, which can be easily found at your local pharmacy or supermarket. Step 2: Swish a small amount of the solution around in your mouth for 30-60 seconds to ensure it comes into contact with all your teeth surfaces. This will help in breaking down and removing stains. Step 3: Spit out the hydrogen peroxide and rinse your mouth with water to remove any remaining solution from your teeth and gums. Consistent use of hydrogen peroxide as a mouth rinse can contribute to a whiter and brighter smile by effectively removing stains and bacteria. 2. Make a Paste from Strawberries to Whiten Your Teeth Strawberries are not just a delicious fruit; they also possess natural teeth-whitening properties. The natural malic acid found in strawberries helps to remove surface stains. Here's how to make a strawberry paste for teeth whitening: Step 1: Mash two to three ripe strawberries in a small bowl. Step 2: Add half a teaspoon of baking soda to the mashed strawberries to create a paste. The baking soda acts as a gentle abrasive, removing surface stains from the teeth. Step 3: Apply the paste to your teeth using a toothbrush, and leave it on for 3-5 minutes. Step 4: Rinse your mouth thoroughly and brush your teeth with your regular toothpaste to remove any residue from the strawberry paste. Use this strawberry and baking soda paste once a week to see noticeable improvements in the whiteness of your teeth. 3. Brush Your Teeth with Activated Charcoal Activated charcoal has gained popularity for its ability to absorb impurities and toxins. When it comes to teeth whitening, activated charcoal can bind to and remove stains from the teeth surface. Here's how to use it: Step 1: Wet your toothbrush and dip it into a small amount of activated charcoal powder. Step 2: Gently brush your teeth with the activated charcoal for 2-3 minutes, focusing on the stained areas. Be cautious not to scrub too hard, as this could damage your teeth enamel. Step 3: Spit out the activated charcoal and rinse your mouth thoroughly with water, ensuring all the charcoal residues are gone. Step 4: Follow up with your regular toothpaste to clean your teeth of any remaining activated charcoal. Use activated charcoal to brush your teeth once or twice a week for the best results. Conclusion Maintaining a bright and stain-free smile is now easier than ever. With these three natural teeth-whitening techniques - hydrogen peroxide, strawberries, and activated charcoal - you can achieve the desired results without resorting to harsh chemicals or expensive treatments. Incorporate these methods into your regular dental care routine and flash that dazzling smile with confidence!"},{"question":"Given the question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: It opens at the Dursleys' home where Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) lives and is staying, as usual, during the summer holidays.

Arawak peoples migrated to various Caribbean islands, arriving in Jamaica by the beginning of the eighth century. They were peaceful and lived by \\"slash-and-burn\\" farming. For meat, they bred pigs and ate iguana, both native to the island. They were highly skilled in such manual activities as thatching and weaving. In fact, the hammock was an AmerIndian invention that remains with us today; it is an object which, more than any other, evokes an image of a warm sunny day on a tropical isle. The Arawak left a legacy of paintings in places such as Runaway Caves near Discovery Bay, and shards of pottery found at their settlements near Nueva Sevilla and Spanish Town have added a little to our knowledge about them. Over 200 Arawak sites have been identified, and it is said that when the Spanish arrived in Jamaica there were approximately 100,000 Arawak living on the island. They called Jamaica \\"Xaymaca\\" (\\"land of wood and water\\"). Columbus and the Arrival of Europeans Columbus first arrived in Jamaica on 5 May 1494 at Discovery Bay, where there is now a small park in his honor. He stayed for only a few days but returned in 1502, landing here when the ships of his fleet became unserviceable; he waited at St. Ann's Bay for help to arrive from Cuba. After the death of Columbus in 1505, Jamaica became the property of his son Diego, who dispatched Don Juan de Esquivel to the island as Governor. Esquivel arrived in 1510 and created a base called Nueva Sevilla near St. Ann's Bay, from which he hoped to colonize the rest of the island. The Spanish immediately began subjugating the Arawak population, many of whom died under the yoke of oppression and of diseases carried by the Europeans. A number of them committed suicide rather than live the life created for them by the Spanish. The site of Nueva Sevilla proved to be unhealthy and mosquito-ridden, and in 1534 the Spanish founded Villa de la Vega, today known as Spanish Town. Pig breeding was the main occupation of these early settlers, but they also planted sugar cane and other crops that required large numbers of laborers. The number of Arawak had already fallen dramatically, so the Spanish began to import slaves from Africa to work the land; the first Africans arrived in 1517. Question: \\"What labor intensive crop did the Spanish import slaves to grow?\\" Answer: \\"Thatching\\" Is this answer correct? Possible answers: (i). no. (ii). yes....I think the answer is","response":"i). no. The Spanish imported slaves to grow sugar cane, not thatching."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Hameed Al Husseinie College is a college in Colombo Sri Lanka.

Article: I had the meanest mother in the whole world. While other kids ate candy for breakfast, I had to have cereal, eggs or toast. While others had Cokes and candy for lunch, I had to eat a sandwich. As you can guess, my supper was different from the other kids' too. But at least, I wasn't alone in my sufferings. My sister and two brothers had the same mean mother as I did. My mother insisted upon knowing where we were at all times. She had to know who our friends were and where we were going. She insisted if we said we'd be gone an hour, then we should be gone one hour or less -- not one hour and one minute. And she always insisted upon us telling the truth. Now you can see how mean she was. The worst is yet to come. We had to be in bed by nine each night and up at eight the next morning. We couldn't sleep till noon like our friends. So while they slept - my mother actually had the courage to break the Child Labor Law. She made us work. We had to wash dishes, make beds, and learn to cook. We had to wear clean clothes and take a bath every day. The other kids always wore their clothes for days. We reached the height of disgrace because she made our clothes herself, just to save money. I believe she laid awake at night thinking up mean things to do to us. Through the years, things didn't improve a bit. We could not lie in bed \\"sick\\" like our friends did, and miss school. Our marks in school had to live up to expectations. Our friends' report cards had beautiful colors on them, black for passing, red for failing.

First, I would ensure that the dough has been properly prepared and placed in a suitable, clean bowl. This is important for maintaining food safety and hygiene. 2. Next, I would locate an appropriate covering for the bowl. Ideally, I would look for a plastic wrap or a clean, slightly damp cloth. The plastic wrap would create an airtight seal, while the damp cloth would maintain proper humidity levels within the bowl. Both of these coverings would help prevent the dough from drying out and also create a suitable environment for the dough to rise if needed. 3. Once I have an appropriate covering, I would carefully place it over the bowl, ensuring that the entire opening of the bowl is covered. If using plastic wrap, I would press the edges around the rim of the bowl to create a tight seal. If using a damp cloth, I would make sure that the cloth is evenly draped over the entire opening of the bowl. 4. After placing the covering on the bowl, I would then check the environment where the dough will be resting. If the dough requires a warmer environment to rise, I would find a warm, draft-free area to place the bowl. If the dough does not require rising but needs to be covered for other purposes, I would ensure it's in a clean and safe spot in the kitchen. 5. I would then monitor the dough as needed, checking on it at the appropriate time intervals for proofing or resting, depending on the recipe instructions. 6. When the dough has reached the desired stage, whether it has risen sufficiently or finished resting, I would carefully remove the covering from the bowl. If using a damp cloth, I would be gentle so as not to damage the dough underneath. 7. Finally, I would proceed with the next steps in the recipe, such as shaping, baking, or further processing the dough."},{"question":"What is the title of this article: An urban runoff facility (SMURFF), the first of its kind in the US, catches and treats 3.5 million US gallons (13,000 m3) of water each week that would otherwise flow into the bay via storm-drains and sells it back to end-users within the city for reuse as gray-water, while bio-swales throughout the city allow rainwater to percolate into and replenish the groundwater supply.

The USA had spent some time in Nicaragua, kind of like a sleepover at a friend's house, but this sleepover lasted for many, many years. Now, you might be wondering, why did the USA decide to go back home and stop occupying Nicaragua? Let's find out! First, let's talk about what it means to \\"occupy\\" a country. When one country occupies another, it's like when your older sibling takes over your room without asking. It's not very nice, and the people in the occupied country might not be happy about it. The USA was in Nicaragua to help protect their friends and make sure everything was going okay, but not everyone in Nicaragua liked having the USA there. Now let's learn why the USA decided to leave Nicaragua. There were a few different reasons: 1. Promises, promises: In a big meeting with lots of important people, called a conference, the USA and many other countries talked about letting countries make decisions for themselves, without anyone else being in charge. This idea is called \\"self-determination.\\" Since the USA wanted to keep its promise, they decided it was time to end the occupation and let Nicaragua be in charge of itself. 2. Money and resources: Just like when you go on a long trip, being in another country for a long time can be expensive. The USA decided that it was costing too much money and using too many resources to stay in Nicaragua, and it was time to go home and focus on other things. 3. Peace and friendship: By leaving Nicaragua, the USA wanted to show their friends in Latin America that they respected their independence and wanted to be peaceful neighbors. They hoped that ending the occupation would make their friendship stronger and create a happier future for everyone. So, after many years of staying in Nicaragua, the USA finally said goodbye and went back home. This allowed Nicaragua to make decisions for themselves, and hopefully, make their country a better place to live for all of its people. And that, my little friend, is the story of why the USA ended its occupation of Nicaragua."},{"question":"Translate the following sentence to Romanian: As a matter of fact, Turkey is today a member of the Council of Europe and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe.

Therefore, the sentiment associated with \\"fully realized\\" is highly positive, as it reflects a higher level of craftsmanship and commitment on the part of the storyteller. 2. Story: The word \\"story\\" in this sentence refers to the narrative itself. In a positive context, an engaging story invites readers or audiences to immerse themselves in the world, characters, and scenarios being presented. A good story can evoke a wide range of emotions, stimulate critical thinking, promote discussion, or simply serve as a source of entertainment. As such, the sentiment of the word \\"story\\" can vary largely depending on the context and the specific narrative being referred to.

Marcus is accustomed to performing exorcisms on \\"possessed\\" individuals, but his faith has waned after reading of an autistic child being killed during an exorcism, reminding him of his own disabled son. He comes to realize that he attributes the healing of his son to science, and not to Jesus Christ.

After the ritual, Marcus and his film crew leave believing they have cured her of a mental state that was misdiagnosed as a possession by a powerful demon Abalam.That night, Nell mysteriously appears in Marcus' hotel room. The team tries to contact Louis to get permission to film her, to no avail. Wishing to prove his point, Marcus admits Nell to the hospital for testing, hoping to receive a medical or psychological diagnosis proving demonic possession is not the cause of her illness.

Oxygen is a crucial element required for the proper functioning of the human body, specifically for cellular respiration, which is the process of generating energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) for various metabolic and physiological processes. Given its vital role, it is important to understand the various ways oxygen is released into the air and subsequently taken in by the respiratory system. Oxygen is released into the air primarily due to the following processes: 1. Photosynthesis: The primary source of atmospheric oxygen comes from photosynthesis by plants, algae, and some bacteria. During photosynthesis, these organisms utilize the energy from the sunlight to convert water (H2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2) into carbohydrates and oxygen. The chemical reaction can be represented by the following equation: 6 CO2 + 6 H2O + Sunlight → C6H12O6 + 6 O2 Through this process, oxygen is released into the air and becomes available for the respiratory system to take in. 2. Photolysis: Oxygen is also produced by photolysis, which refers to the decomposition of water vapor as a result of absorbing ultraviolet radiation from the sun. High-energy ultraviolet (UV) photons break the bonds between the hydrogen and oxygen atoms in water molecules, resulting in the formation of atomic hydrogen and oxygen. The reaction can be represented as: H2O + UV Radiation → H + ½ O2 Photolysis, however, is a relatively minor source of atmospheric oxygen compared to photosynthesis. 3. Geological processes: Some geological processes, such as the weathering of rocks and minerals, can also contribute to the release of oxygen into the atmosphere. Some minerals and rocks have a high content of oxygen in the form of oxides, which can be released when these substances undergo chemical reactions or are subject to high temperatures. Additionally, volcanic eruptions can introduce oxygen into the atmosphere as a byproduct of the chemical reactions taking place between molten rock and other earth materials. In summary, the respiratory system takes in oxygen from the air, which has been released primarily by photosynthesis in plants, algae, and some bacteria, and to a lesser extent, by photolysis and geological processes like weathering of rocks and minerals, as well as volcanic activity. Thanks to these natural processes, oxygen is continuously renewed and made available for the respiratory process which is vital for human life and the complex ecosystems we depend on."},{"question":"Q: SINGAPORE — What now? That is the question from the White House in Washington to the Blue House in Seoul — and perhaps also inside the Ryongsong Residence in Pyongyang. Following the historic handshake here between a U.S. president and a North Korean leader, who inked their names to a document with vague but compelling promises, the question emanating from Sentosa's Capella Hotel was what will actually change on the Korean peninsula? Moments after the summit between Donald Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong Un concluded, VOA contributor Greta Van Susteren and I spent a few minutes with the U.S. president and his secretary of state, at the Capella. Trump was elated and within the hour would make a surprising announcement suspending \\"provocative\\" joint U.S.-South Korean drills on the Korean peninsula. \\"We had a great chemistry,\\" the president, speaking to Van Susteren, said of himself and Kim. \\"We will do business.\\" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told us, \\"it's a great day.\\" The president has essentially handed off to Pompeo the hard work of turning a sparse declaration on denuclearization into something truly transformative.

I only watched this delirious piece of Euro-tosh in the way of Alpha Video's dreadful DVD-release (looks like an extremely bad video-transfer), but from what I saw, not nearly interesting enough to purchase No Shame's recent DVD-release. Considering their excellent track record, it will undoubtedly be a major improvement over all previous releases. And don't pay attention to the ridiculous cover shown here, it's not taken from this film (some girl holding the head of a Jim Carrey look-a-like). Spaghetti Western star Anthony Steffen sports a hip hairdo and assumes the role of Lord Alan Cunningham, a man haunted by the memory of his dead wife Evelyn. This leads to a nervous breakdown which has him being retained in a psychiatric clinic. Once released, Cunningham channels this trauma by taking redheaded prostitutes to his countryside castle, subjecting them to vicious acts of torture. His doctor and friend, Richard Timberlane (what do you mean, Italian horror names sound \\"made up?\\"), advises him to forget the past and remarry but Cunningham is obsessed with Evelyn and even organizes a séance at the castle. Eventually, after killing some more girls, he meets Gladys, another redhead, and marries her almost immediately, but the arrival of his new wife spawns a series of sinister events. Bloodthirsty creatures strike at Sir Alan's family, killing them off one by one. Becoming more distraught, Cunningham visits Evelyn's tomb and discovers it to be empty. Soon, a number of \\"outsiders\\" begin to suspect something fishy is going on in the castle and Lord Cunningham's treatment might not have been that successful after all. Director Emilio Miraglia tries to blend Gothic horror with Giallo conventions with limited success. As usual, not the slightest effort was made to convince audiences the film is set in England. The cars drive on the right side of the road, everyone looks very Mediterranean and the castle (and the rest of the architecture) is patently Italian. This is common practice in Italian horror, but sometimes they just take this a little too far. The bad print made this even slightly bearable, since it's so dark, you couldn't see much of the surroundings anyway. But, then again, this is the kind of film where anything can happen in the name of exploitation and depicting reality isn't really the issue. A large part consists of sado-masochistic torture scenes in the castle torture chamber, but most of the time, Anthony Steffen hams his way through this and shows some horrible over-acting. I guess it all depends on your state of mind and this can be a fun piece of nonsense if you're in the right mood. I just couldn't take it, at least not with the print I watched.

The 25-year-old centre-back is valued at about £5million. Kone has played for France at every level from U17 to U20, and was linked with Sunderland last year. Article:","response":"Title: Sam Allardyce Eyes Lorient Defender Lamine Kone as Part of Revamping Efforts Former England football manager, Sam Allardyce, is reportedly expressing interest in securing the services of Lorient centre-back Lamine Kone. The 25-year-old French-Ivorian defender has been growing in stature and is valued at about £5 million in the current transfer market. Kone, who has played for the French national team at every level from under-17 to under-20, was previously linked with a move to Sunderland last year. Lamine Kone's journey began with his youth career, starting with Paris Saint-Germain's youth academy in 2002. The young prospect then honed his football skills while representing other clubs such as Paris FC, Ternes, and the famed Châteauroux, where he completed his youth career in 2008. His senior career took off after signing for Ligue 2 team, Châteauroux, in 2008, and he later signed for Corsican Ligue 1 side, SC Bastia, in 2010. After playing an important role in SC Bastia's promotion to Ligue 1, Kone, in 2014, joined his current club, Lorient. Kone's performances have drawn attention from both traditional football powerhouses and emerging clubs over the past few years. His earlier association with the French national team setup has undoubtedly contributed to his strong football education and growth. Although he did not make the senior stage with the French team, the talented central defender chose to represent the Ivory Coast national team in 2015, winning the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations. Sam Allardyce's interest in Lamine Kone is part of his comprehensive plans to acquire skilled, young, and energetic players in a bid to rejuvenate his team. Allardyce, who has a proven track record of managing in the English Premier League, is aiming to revamp his squad by injecting much-needed dynamism and adaptability. Lamine Kone's acquisition could significantly strengthen the team's defensive options, providing balance, and creating a platform to launch swift attacking moves. Kone has been known for his outstanding aerial abilities, incredible strength, excellent positional sense, and tenacious marking of opposition forwards. These attributes make him a perfect candidate for the physically demanding nature of English football. With Kone's proven experience at various levels of France's national team set up, and a successful career in the French Ligue 1, the potential signing could prove to be a shrewd piece of business for Allardyce. Furthermore, Kone, who is currently regarded as one of Ligue 1's most reliable central defenders, can bring a commanding presence and a significant level of experience to the heart of any defence. Despite the defender's £5 million valuation, which may seem like a substantial investment, the potential improvement Kone could bring to the team outweighs the financial risk. In today's inflated transfer market, securing a young, talented, and experienced player like Lamine Kone for the price of £5 million could be regarded as a sensible and intelligent move. In conclusion, Sam Allardyce's pursuit of Lamine Kone demonstrates his intent to build a solid foundation for his team, emphasizing defensive prowess and experience. If the deal comes to fruition, Kone's arrival could immensely bolster the team's backline, injecting fresh energy into their ranks. Ultimately, Lamine Kone's addition to the squad could be the transformative signing that facilitates further success and progress for Sam Allardyce's team."},{"question":"Are these paraphrases? In the infected EXE files , no text strings are visible within the virus code , but the following text strings are encrypted within the original copy of the ABC virus : No text strings are visible within the initial code in infected EXE files , but the following text strings are encrypted within the viral copy of the ABC virus :","response":"Yes, these two sentences are indeed examples of paraphrasing. Paraphrasing involves rewording or rephrasing a piece of text using different words, expressions, or structure without changing its original meaning. Both sentences convey the same information while using slightly different language and sentence structure. In the first sentence, \\"In the infected EXE files, no text strings are visible within the virus code, but the following text strings are encrypted within the original copy of the ABC virus,\\" the focus is on the fact that there aren't any visible text strings in the virus code within infected EXE files, and that certain text strings are hidden within the original copy of the ABC virus. The second sentence, \\"No text strings are visible within the initial code in infected EXE files, but the following text strings are encrypted within the viral copy of the ABC virus,\\" conveys the same meaning but uses different words and structure in its expression. \\"Virus code\\" becomes \\"initial code,\\" \\"original copy\\" becomes \\"viral copy,\\" and the order of information presentation is slightly altered. So despite the differences in their wording, both sentences communicate exactly the same idea, which is the essence of paraphrasing. The subtle changes ensure that while the original concept remains, the way it is presented or framed is unique, which can help to avoid potential issues with plagiarism while ensuring the information can be understood by various audiences."},{"question":"In this task, you are given a pair of action statements.

Most AM broadcast radios (except for car radios) take advantage of this principle by including a small loop antenna for reception which has an extremely poor efficiency. Using such an inefficient antenna at this low frequency (530–1650 kHz) thus has little effect on the receiver's net performance, but simply requires greater amplification by the receiver's electronics.

Basically, my first experience was a very pushy salesperson at a wedding fair several years ago which really put me off the brand, and it took me a while to try their products again. But when I did I was really impressed, and I can honestly say that nothing I’ve reviewed since has disappointed me! Today I’m reviewing Temple Spa Trufflesque, an Ultra Hydration & Radiance Masque for the face. Trufflesque aims to give hydration and radiance to the skin, and plumps to help reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. It’s a luxury mask suitable for all skin types, particularly dry or dull skin, and it helps to rejuvenate tired skin too. The impressive list of ingredients includes black truffles, gold and silk peptides, but unfortunately these expensive additives contribute to Trufflesque’s slightly expensive price tag. The first thing that strikes me about this product is the amazing packaging. All Temple Spa products have really amazing, premium packaging, and I feel that they add to the feeling that you are about to use something really special on your skin. The dark glass jar has a gold lid and it is nestled in a gold and chocolate brown box with the most amazingly cute mask brush slotted in too. The mask itself is gold and it shimmers so prettily, if you look closely it’s almost as if you can see the particles of real gold! To apply you just paint the golden mask onto your face with the cute little brush (it makes applying the mask so easy) then leave for 15-20 minutes. The mask doesn’t dry completely, it stays a little bit tacky to the touch, and I find that it makes my skin tingle quite a bit. For extra benefits you can also then massage the mask into your skin for around 2 minutes, before removing with a damp muslin cloth or flannel.

Saint-Saëns was born in Paris, the only child of Jacques-Joseph-Victor Saint-Saëns (1798–1835), an official in the French Ministry of the Interior, and Françoise-Clémence, née Collin. Victor Saint-Saëns was of Norman ancestry, and his wife was from an Haute-Marne family; their son, born in the Rue du Jardinet in the 6th arrondissement of Paris, and baptised at the nearby church of Saint-Sulpice, always considered himself a true Parisian. Less than two months after the christening, Victor Saint-Saëns died of consumption on the first anniversary of his marriage. The young Camille was taken to the country for the sake of his health, and for two years lived with a nurse at Corbeil, 29 kilometres (18 mi) to the south of Paris. When Saint-Saëns was brought back to Paris he lived with his mother and her widowed aunt, Charlotte Masson. Before he was three years old he displayed perfect pitch and enjoyed picking out tunes on the piano. His great-aunt taught him the basics of pianism, and when he was seven he became a pupil of Camille-Marie Stamaty, a former pupil of Friedrich Kalkbrenner. Stamaty required his students to play while resting their forearms on a bar situated in front of the keyboard, so that all the pianist's power came from the hands and fingers rather than the arms, which, Saint-Saëns later wrote, was good training. Clémence Saint-Saëns, well aware of her son's precocious talent, did not wish him to become famous too young. The music critic Harold C. Schonberg wrote of Saint-Saëns in 1969, \\"It is not generally realized that he was the most remarkable child prodigy in history, and that includes Mozart.\\" The boy gave occasional performances for small audiences from the age of five, but it was not until he was ten that he made his official public debut, at the Salle Pleyel, in a programme that included Mozart's Piano Concerto in B♭ (K450), and Beethoven's Third Piano Concerto. Through Stamaty's influence, Saint-Saëns was introduced to the composition professor Pierre Maleden and the organ teacher...

As he zooms in, the dog, a jovial golden retriever, playfully comes closer to the small girl, wagging its tail excitedly and sharing in her infectious laughter. The small girl, clad in a pair of overalls and her sun-kissed brown hair tied up in a messy ponytail, takes a brief pause from her mopping and glances over at the dog with eyes full of innocence and curiosity. For a moment, she forgets about washing the floor, as she wraps her small arms around the gentle giant, embracing it with love and appreciation. The camera man pans the lens over to the stately house in the background, appearing to have been recently painted in a warm coral hue, with contrasting white shutters framing each window, seemingly inviting, idyllic for a family portrait. The camera captures the sunbeams streaming through the lush trees, creating a kaleidoscope of dancing shadows along the garden path leading to the main entrance of the house. Beautifully manicured flowerbeds filled with vibrant blossoms spread their perfume into the air, giving life and color to the scene's surroundings. As the camera man continues to capture these tender moments, he realizes the significance of what he is filming.

Now a study in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface shows that Oetzi's remarkable preservation extends even to the blood he shed shortly before dying. The find represents by far the oldest red blood cells ever observed. It is just the latest chapter in what could be described as the world's oldest murder mystery. Since Oetzi was first found by hikers with an arrow buried in his back, experts have determined that he died from his wounds and what his last meal was. There has been extensive debate as to whether he fell where he died or was buried there by others. In February, Albert Zink and colleagues at the Eurac Institute for Mummies and the Iceman in Bolzano, Italy . An earlier study by the group, published in the Lancet , showed that a wound on Oetzi's hand contained haemoglobin, a protein found in blood - but it had long been presumed that red blood cells' delicate nature would have precluded their preservation. Prof Zink and his colleagues collaborated with researchers at the Center for Smart Interfaces at the University of Darmstadt in Germany to apply what is known as atomic force microscopy to thin slices of tissue taken from an area surrounding the arrow wound. The technique works using a tiny metal tip with a point just a few atoms across, dragged along the surface of a sample. The tip's movement is tracked, and results in a 3-D map at extraordinary resolution. The team found that the sample from Oetzi contained structures with a tell-tale \\"doughnut\\" shape, just as red blood cells have. To ensure the structures were preserved cells and not contamination of some kind, they confirmed the find using a laser-based technique called Raman spectroscopy - those results also indicated the presence of haemoglobin and the clot-associated protein fibrin. That, Prof Zink explained, seems to solve one of the elements of the murder mystery. \\"Because fibrin is present in fresh wounds and then degrades, the theory that Oetzi died some days after he had been injured by the arrow, as had once been mooted, can no longer be upheld,\\" he said. The team also suggest that their methods may prove to be of use in modern-day forensics studies, in which the exact age of blood samples is difficult to determine. What is a summary of this text?","response":"Oetzi is a very old mummy that was found with an arrow in his back. Scientists have been trying to find out more about him and how he died. They discovered that he has the oldest red blood cells ever seen! These blood cells give clues that he died quickly after being injured by the arrow. The way scientists found this information can also help in studying crimes today by looking at blood samples."},{"question":"Ask a question about American Idol.","response":"What is the format and impact of the television show American Idol, and how has it contributed to the careers of aspiring singers and musicians in the United States? American Idol is an American singing competition television series that first premiered on June 11, 2002, on Fox. The show was created by Simon Fuller and is produced by FremantleMedia North America and 19 Entertainment. It was initially based on the British series \\"Pop Idol,\\" which was also created by Fuller. American Idol became one of the longest-running and most popular reality singing competitions in the United States, with its last season on Fox airing in 2016. The show was later revived by ABC in 2018, and it currently airs on that network. The format of American Idol primarily involves aspiring singers from across the United States auditioning for a chance to showcase their singing talent on national television. Contestants who successfully pass the initial audition rounds move on to the live performance stages of the show. Live performances typically consist of themed weeks, during which contestants perform songs based on a particular theme, such as a type of music, decade, or artist. Contestants' performances are judged by a panel of judges comprising well-known music industry professionals, like singers, songwriters, and producers. Over the years, the judging panel has included notable names like Simon Cowell, Paula Abdul, Randy Jackson, Mariah Carey, Nicki Minaj, Steven Tyler, Jennifer Lopez, Keith Urban, Katy Perry, Lionel Richie, and Luke Bryan, among others. The audience plays a crucial role in American Idol, as their votes decide the contestant's fate. After each performance show, viewers at home are given a specific period to vote for their favorite contestants through various channels, like text messages, phone calls, and online voting. The contestant with the least number of votes is eliminated from the competition each week. The process narrows down the pool of contestants until the final two contestants compete for the title of \\"American Idol.\\" The winner is awarded a recording contract, monetary prizes, and opportunities to launch their music career. The impact of American Idol on the music industry and popular culture has been significant. The show has launched the careers of multiple successful recording artists, including Kelly Clarkson, Carrie Underwood, Jennifer Hudson, Chris Daughtry, Adam Lambert, and Phillip Phillips, among others. Many of these artists have found mainstream success, earning Grammy Awards, critical acclaim, and commercial achievements. Additionally, American Idol has provided a platform for contestants who didn't win to gain exposure, leading to valuable contacts and opportunities in the entertainment industry. Moreover, American Idol has influenced various television formats and has inspired numerous singing competition shows worldwide, such as \\"The Voice,\\" \\"The X Factor,\\" and \\"America's Got Talent.\\" Overall, the show has had a long-lasting impact on both the television and music industries, becoming a cultural phenomenon and changing the landscape of talent discovery and recognition."},{"question":"In this task, you're given an open-domain question.

She is now saying I raped her. I had a relationship with this woman, who is also 27, around five years ago. We stayed friendly after we split and sometimes bump into each other when out. We got talking in a bar one evening and she told me she is seeing a married man. I am married too, which she knows. Since then, we have been meeting for a drink after work sometimes. We have done a few sexual things but never had full sex. I realise now I have been playing with fire. This woman and I were both at the same club recently and she was very flirty and suggestive with me. She was also pretty drunk but well aware of what she was doing. When we sat down, she sat on my lap. As the evening went on she became more and more sexual. She suggested I walk her back home, which I did, and we had sex. We were both up for it. Now she has phoned and emailed and is angry with me. She says I took advantage and that she would not have had sex if she had been sober. She is saying I coerced her and that, in effect, I raped her. This really worries me in case she takes it further. I know what I did was not good but she did consent, even though she was a bit drunk. Was what I did rape? I feel bad, as though I cannot be trusted with women. If news of this gets to my wife, goodness knows what will happen. DEIDRE SAYS: This is such a difficult area in law. It’s always wrong to have sex with a woman who is too drunk to give meaningful consent. In reality it could all come down to how you both come across in court. She is clearly angry with herself and it may well be true that she would not have suggested you come back had she been sober. But if you genuinely believed she was clear-headed enough to know what she was doing that means you did not rape her. Say you are sorry if she now has regrets but you are clear that you did not rape her. You should be able to find witnesses to her behaviour in the club. If it looks like she will go to the police, tell your wife now and beg for her forgiveness and support. You can find support through False Allegations Support Organisation (0844 335 1992, false-allegations.org.uk). MY partner confessed he paid for a private dance at a strip club at a stag do, even though I specifically asked him not to. Now I feel I am a low priority in his life and not good enough for him. We are 28 and 31 and have a young daughter. We’ve been together for four years. He had a one-night stand when our daughter was a baby. I forgave him and we moved on but it has always haunted me. I told him I would be hurt if he had a private dance so how can I ever trust him? DEIDRE SAYS: It is important he confessed. He probably doesn’t see it as cheating, just a laugh with his mates. To you it was a betrayal because he got too close to another woman, but she was a stranger and paid to do it. You have a child together so concentrate on what you can both do to be close again and restore the trust. MY wife and I only have sex a couple of times a year. This is really frustrating for me as I love sex. We have been married for 18 years, I’m 40, she is 42. She has always had a low sex drive. I have tried talking to her, complimenting her, taking her out, everything I can think of. She does not like me close to her at night so I sleep in the spare room. She says she loves me but is not “in love” with me. I am at the end of my tether and thinking of having an affair. DEIDRE SAYS: Cheating will just add to the problems in your marriage. Is her sex drive really naturally low or did you two never discover what would light her fire? Does she orgasm when you have sex? Try the suggestions in my e-leaflet Orgasm For Women and she might be more interested. I WAS in a violent relationship and eventually found the courage to leave my boyfriend. I am 31, he is 32. We had a child together who is now two. I am still scared of my ex and I do not keep in contact. He has never paid any maintenance and he has not seen our daughter since I left him. I feel it is unfair he should not have to pay anything at all towards the cost of bringing her up. I worry, though, that he might decide that he wants to start seeing her if I claim maintenance. DEIDRE SAYS: Your child’s father is legally liable to pay maintenance. Claiming might trigger a fresh interest from your ex but you can claim without the Child Maintenance Service disclosing your whereabouts to an abusive partner.

The latest row was because she insisted I go to his grandma’s 60th birthday party. We were the only young people there. I gave in and went to the party but only to make my boyfriend happy. His mum was saying bad things about me to other people all the time though I have done nothing wrong. My mum is tired of seeing me come home upset. She wants me to finish with my boyfriend because of this. DEIDRE SAYS: She’s a possessive mum who cannot stand seeing her lovely lad spending time with another female and caring for her. There may be little you can do to win her approval but remain friendly and polite, and ask your boyfriend to speak up for you. I FEEL as if my life is going nowhere I want it to. I am a male aged 18 and want to do a job which would make a difference in the world, but I did not get good exam grades so I am working with my dad in his carpet-cleaning business.

Holst's settings of Indian texts formed only a part of his compositional output in the period 1900 to 1914. A highly significant factor in his musical development was the English folksong revival, evident in the orchestral suite A Somerset Rhapsody (1906–07), a work that was originally to be based around eleven folksong themes; this was later reduced to four. Observing the work's kinship with Vaughan Williams's Norfolk Rhapsody, Dickinson remarks that, with its firm overall structure, Holst's composition \\"rises beyond the level of ... a song-selection\\". Imogen acknowledges that Holst's discovery of English folksongs \\"transformed his orchestral writing\\", and that the composition of A Somerset Rhapsody did much to banish the chromaticisms that had dominated his early compositions. In the Two Songs without Words of 1906, Holst showed that he could create his own original music using the folk idiom. An orchestral folksong fantasy Songs of the West, also written in 1906, was withdrawn by the composer and never published, although it emerged in the 1980s in the form of an arrangement for wind band by James Curnow. In the years before the First World War, Holst composed in a variety of genres. Matthews considers the evocation of a North African town in the Beni Mora suite of 1908 the composer's most individual work to that date; the third movement gives a preview of minimalism in its constant repetition of a four-bar theme. Holst wrote two suites for military band, in E flat (1909) and F major (1911) respectively, the first of which became and remains a brass-band staple. This piece, a highly original and substantial musical work, was a signal departure from what Short describes as \\"the usual transcriptions and operatic selections which pervaded the band repertoire\\". Also in 1911 he wrote Hecuba's Lament, a setting of Gilbert Murray's translation from Euripides built on a seven-beat refrain designed, says Dickinson, to represent Hecuba's defiance of divine wrath. In 1912 Holst composed two psalm settings, in which...

This earthquake ruptured at least two imbricate structures in Longmen Shan Fault System, i.e. the Beichuan Fault and the Guanxian–Anxian Fault. In the epicentral area, the average slip in Beichuan Fault was about 3.5 metres (11 ft) vertical, 3.5 metres (11 ft) horizontal-parallel to the fault, and 4.8 metres (16 ft) horizontal-perpendicular to the fault. In the area about 30 kilometres (19 mi) northeast of the epicenter, the surface slip on Beichuan Fault was almost purely dextral strike-slip up to about 3 metres (9.8 ft), while the average slip in Guanxian–Anxian Fault was about 2 metres (6 ft 7 in) vertical and 2.3 metres (7 ft 7 in) horizontal. Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What was the horizontal slippage in the Beichuan Fault at the epicenter?","response":"The horizontal slippage in the Beichuan Fault at the epicenter can be calculated by considering both components of the horizontal slip: parallel and perpendicular to the fault. As mentioned, the horizontal-parallel slip was 3.5 meters (11 ft), and the horizontal-perpendicular slip was 4.8 meters (16 ft). To find the total horizontal slip, we can use the Pythagorean theorem: Total horizontal slip = √(horizontal-parallel slip² + horizontal-perpendicular slip²) Total horizontal slip = √(3.5² + 4.8²) Total horizontal slip = √(12.25 + 23.04) Total horizontal slip = √(35.29) Total horizontal slip ≈ 5.94 meters. So, the total horizontal slippage in the Beichuan Fault at the epicenter was approximately 5.94 meters (19.5 ft)."},{"question":"Reconstruct a question, answer pair from this explanation: Different individuals react to various asthma influencing factors in a different way.","response":"Question: How do individuals with asthma react to various influencing factors?

Some use them for romantic picnics and marriage proposals. Others race in competitions. Being above the earth gives a whole new perspective on the world around us. As the beginning of a hot air balloon ride, the balloon is flat because the pressure inside the balloon equals the pressure outside. When the air inside the balloon is heated, the speed of movement of those air molecules increases and the pressure goes up. After a while the balloon is completely expanded and the flight is ready to take off. Now, I have a new situation: Bob just came from a hot air balloon ride. On his way home he saw two balloons, balloon A and balloon B. Balloon A was flat, but balloon B was inflated. He was wondering how balloons go up so effortlessly. Answer this question please: Would balloon B have higher or lower inside pressure than balloon A?

The statement mainly provides information about Yugoslavia's action towards foreign visitors and visa requirements during that time. To answer the original question, we need to delve into the historical background of Josip Broz Tito's involvement in Arab-Israeli peace processes. Tito, a prominent political leader and the leader of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, actively participated in the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), an international organization that was neither aligned with or against any major power bloc and aimed to ensure national independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of non-aligned member countries. The primary goal of NAM was to promote peace, cooperation, and global development. Tito's engagement in Arab-Israeli peace processes was inherently connected to his role as one of the NAM leaders. Although there is no precise date or year when Tito first started working on the Arab-Israeli peace process, the search for peace and justice in the Middle East became one of NAM's priorities during the 1960s, and materials point to the active role Yugoslavia played in that decade. Tito managed to maintain good relations with both Arab countries and Israel throughout the 1950s, and his policy of non-alignment allowed him the opportunity to mediate the Arab-Israeli conflict to some extent. During the 1960s, Tito's efforts to mediate the conflict were hampered by the ongoing tensions and wars in the region, but he still managed to maintain diplomatic relations with both sides. More specifically, in 1967, Tito was one of the main driving forces behind the NAM's decision to convene an emergency conference of NAM Foreign Ministers in Belgrade concerning the Arab-Israeli war. Tito's efforts to bring together the foreign ministers of NAM countries to support peace and condemn Israel's aggression marked a significant moment in his involvement in Arab-Israeli peace processes. In summary, although there is no specific year when Tito began working on Arab-Israeli peace processes, his involvement and efforts to promote peace and justice in the Middle East through Non-Aligned Movement became more visible during the 1960s. The statement about Yugoslavia opening its borders to foreign visitors in 1967 does not address Tito's work in Arab-Israeli peace processes directly and does not provide a correct answer to the question."},{"question":"In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Ask a trusted friend, family member, or neighbor to keep an eye out on your home while you’re away. It is absolutely essential that you trust this person and know that they will follow through with checking in. A next door neighbor is a convenient person to monitor your home since they are the most likely person to notice any unusual situations. Do not sacrifice convenience for trust. If you do not feel completely comfortable asking your next door neighbor to check on your home, ask a close friend or family member. Remember to return the favor and offer to do the same for them when they are on vacation. Overgrown lawns or driveways full of snow are surefire giveaways that the homeowner isn’t at home. Be mindful of your friend’s time and offer compensation for these chores. For example, if the neighbor that you’ve asked to keep an eye on things has a teenage son or daughter, offer to pay their child to complete these tasks. Always return the favor and offer to do the same when they go away on vacation. Interior lights signal that someone is at home but leaving your lights on all the time while you are away is not cost effective. A programmable light switch will turn on select lights at a certain time and then turn them off. This saves money, is energy efficient, and is a useful deterrent. An intruder who is watching your home closely may notice that the lights go on and off at certain times every day. Set a schedule for your timers that varies day by day. Never post on social media that you are leaving for a vacation. Avoid posting pictures from your vacation while you are still away, checking in at the airport or your vacation destination, or updating your friends about your vacation. Internet safety is extremely important. Many burglars learn about their potential victims through social media when they post that they will be away, how long they’ll be away, and where they’re going. Notify the post office that you will be away so they do not leave mail and packages at your door. You can also ask your neighbor to collect your mail for you if you prefer not to stop your mail altogether. Avoid scheduling deliveries, like those for online shopping, for times when you are away. Packages that are left outside your front door are easily stolen and alert others that you are out of town. This applies to your curtains, your blinds, or shutters that cover your windows. If you typically leave your blinds open during the day, consider leaving them open when you are away. Noticeable changes can alert others that you aren’t home, like if your curtains are pulled shut for two weeks straight when they are normally open. Summary:","response":"The article discusses the importance of having a trusted friend, family member, or neighbor monitor your home while you're away, maintaining the appearance of being at home, using programmable light switches, practicing internet safety by not sharing vacation details on social media, managing mail and deliveries, and keeping consistent window coverings to prevent burglars from targeting your home during your absence."},{"question":"What is the version of the following sentence with correct punctuation? 1 What is Internet Marketing Its a great question especially if youve decided to make a living at it","response":"1.

And stunned Republicans are left lamenting how the once safe district has become for them the Unlucky 13th. \\"This is going Democratic -- I don't think there's any question about that,\\" said former borough president Guy Molinari, the dean of Staten Island Republicans. He held the congressional seat for nine years himself before handing it over to his daughter, Susan Molinari. \\"It's sad losing this seat,\\" he said. \\"It's bad for the city.\\" Democrats are banking heavily on City Councilman Michael McMahon, who won the Democratic primary and has been endorsed by Sens. Hillary Rodham Clinton and Charles E. Schumer, as well as Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg (I). Loss of the 13th District seat would only add to the woes of the Republican Party statewide, which was once dominated by figures such as Nelson Rockefeller and Alfonse D'Amato but now seems headed for extinction. Democrats hold the governor's office, both U.S. Senate seats, and the State Assembly, and they are within striking distance of taking control of the state Senate in November. Only six of the state's 29 members of Congress are Republican, and Democrats are eyeing two seats as prime targets: the 13th and the 29th District seat of Rep. John R. \\"Randy\\" Kuhl Jr. in Western New York. The GOP's troubles are so bad that many Republicans are openly pleading with former mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to get into the governor's race in 2010, if for no other reason than to try to resuscitate the state party. (Giuliani has been campaigning for Sen. John McCain for president and has made no statement about his plans). The implosion in Staten Island began in May, when popular Republican Rep. Vito J. Fossella, who has held the seat since 1997, was arrested in Virginia for drunken driving, and it was discovered he had a mistress and an out-of-wedlock child. He announced he would not seek reelection. To replace Fossella, the Staten Island Republican establishment settled on Francis H. Powers, a retired Wall Street executive and major GOP donor. But in late June, Powers died of a heart attack. Molinari said he had met with Powers two days earlier, and \\"we spent most of the time talking about his health.\\" One by one over the summer, various Republican figures declined to run for the seat, perhaps fearing a Democratic landslide in New York during a presidential-election year with an unpopular representative of the party in the White House. With Republicans unable to find a strong contender, former state assemblyman Robert Straniere stepped forward -- much to the chagrin of party leaders. Straniere served 24 years in the legislature in Albany but was dogged much of that time by questions about his tangled personal finances, bad real estate deals and failed business ventures, most recently a high-end hot dog restaurant in Manhattan that he shut down in July after only a year. Straniere won a bitter primary against cardiologist Jamshad Wyne after a campaign that included accusations that Wyne was using the nickname \\"Jim\\" to conceal his Pakistani and Muslim origins. The battle was so ugly that Wyne later quit the Republican Party and his job as party finance chief for Staten Island, claiming he was denied the nomination because of racism.

It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. - Comedy is a genre of film in which the main emphasis is on humor. These films are designed to make the audience laugh through amusement and most often work by exaggerating characteristics for humorous effect. Films in this style traditionally have a happy ending (black comedy being an exception). One of the oldest genres in film, some of the very first silent movies were comedies, as slapstick comedy often relies on visual depictions, without requiring sound. When sound films became more prevalent during the 1920s, comedy films took another swing, as laughter could result from burlesque situations but also dialogue. - Marvel Marilyn Maxwell (August 3, 1921 March 20, 1972) was an American actress and entertainer.

Sturges went on to win the Academy Award for Writing Original Screenplay. - A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects. - Jerry Lewis (born Joseph Levitch; March 16, 1926) is an American actor, comedian, singer, film producer, film director, screenwriter, and humanitarian.

The answer is:","response":"The Servants were a prominent British band, emerging from the vibrant indie art rock scene of the mid-1985 and active until 1991. They found a niche in the progressive music landscape, cultivating a dedicated fan base that revered their unique style and musical prowess. Operating under the imprint of the Cherry Red Captured Tracks label, The Servants were based in the United Kingdom and featured David Westlake and Luke Haines in their lineup. Both of these members played a significant part in shaping the band's identity and contributed heartily to its body of work. David Westlake is primarily known as the primary impresario of The Servants, offering both deft musician skills coupled with a keen sense of artistic direction. Known for his deep insights into the indie art rock genre, Westlake brought a unique blend of sophistication and raw energy to the band's music. He was integral to crafting the band's distinct sense of style and aesthetic, setting them apart in a thriving and competitive music scene. Similarly, Luke Haines played a significant role in The Servants' trajectory, bringing his distinctive musical attributes to the table. His collaborative synergy with Westlake created a signature sound that helped define the band's musical character. Their music was a tasteful concoction of indie rock, underscored with elements of art rock — a genre known for challenging the norms of the popular music of the time by experimenting with various musical forms and rich atmospheric arrangements. The Servants were under the professional management of the Cherry Red Captured Tracks label. As a label known for housing adventurous and pioneering indie artists, it undoubtedly offered the right platform for The Servants. They took advantage of this with their unique brand of music and cultural resonance, creating a sound worthy of their label’s reputation. The band's official website, www.lostsheep.com/davidwestlake, hosts exclusive content that provides a deeper dive into their musical journey, including behind-the-scenes material, recorded performances, interviews, and other essential elements that offer an intimate snapshot into their artistic evolution. Unfortunately, though the band ceased to be active by 1991, their legacy persists. They left behind an impressionable music catalog revered by fans and critics alike. The Servants made a considerable impact during their active years, influencing the indie art rock genre and imparting their innovative spirit to their contemporaries and the bands that would come after them. The band's representation is perhaps best encapsulated in an image simply referred to as \\"The Servants.png.\\" This visual piece can be found on various digital platforms, embodying the band's vibe and legacy, showcasing the group’s style reflective of their artistic journey and serving as an appropriate reminder of the band's profound influence on the global indie art genre. In conclusion, The Servants were a band born of the United Kingdom's indie art rock scene, active between 1985 and 1991. While their journey may have been relatively short-lived, their significant influence and standout performances continue to resonate in the art rock scene even decades later. Through their innovation and fearless explorations of musical form, The Servants have left a long-lasting mark on the musical landscape, and their legacy continues to inspire."},{"question":"If Gigot thinks the tax fraud proceedings against Hubbell are legitimate and ordinary, while everyone else regards the indictments as trumped-up mini-crimes meant to squeeze Hubbell into giving Starr what he wants--cooperation., can we conclude that \\"Hubbell has earned whatever sentence is given due to him engaging in tax fraud.\\"?","response":"Okay, imagine you and your friends are playing in a park. Your friend Gigot thinks Hubbell, another kid in the park, did something wrong (like breaking a toy) and should be punished. But the rest of your friends think that Hubbell didn't do anything that bad and that the grown-ups are just trying to make him do what they want. So, if you ask whether Hubbell deserves punishment (like a time-out) because he did something wrong (like breaking the toy), it really depends on who you agree with: Gigot or the rest of your friends. If you agree with Gigot, you might think Hubbell deserves the time-out.

Both of them are trying to change their skin complexion to help their appearances at the competition. Robin begins exposing her skin to high amounts of UV light several days a week. Samantha decides not to use any UV light and instead just uses lotion to help her skin. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Who will produce lower amounts of melanin? Hint: The epidermis also contains melanocytes , which are cells that produce melanin. Melanin is the brownish pigment that gives skin much of its color. Everyone has about the same number of melanocytes, but the melanocytes of people with darker skin produce more melanin. The amount of melanin produced is determined by heredity and exposure to UV light, which increases melanin output. Exposure to UV light also stimulates the skin to produce vitamin D . Because melanin blocks UV light from penetrating the skin, people with darker skin may be at greater risk of vitamin D deficiency. Answer:","response":"Samantha will produce lower amounts of melanin compared to Robin. This is because melanin production is determined by heredity and exposure to UV light. Since Robin is exposing her skin to high amounts of UV light several days a week, her melanocytes will produce more melanin in response to this increased exposure. On the other hand, Samantha is not using any UV light and is only relying on lotion for her skin, so her melanin production will not be stimulated to the same extent as Robin's."},{"question":"Lee spent all of Remy's money on a gift for them.

They could feel guilty if they believe Lee spent too much money, or they could feel glad to receive a thoughtful gift.

Article: We all enjoy the beautiful show of color1s as leaves change each autumn. But did you ever wonder how and why this happens? To answer the question, first you have to understand what leaves are and what they do. Leaves are nature's food factories. Plants take water from the ground through their roots. And they take a gas called carbon dioxide from the air. Plants use sunlight to turn water and carbon dioxide into glucose . Glucose is a kind of sugar. Plants use glucose as food for energy and as a building block for growing. The way plants turn water and carbon dioxide into sugar is called photosynthesis . That means, \\"putting together with light\\". A chemical called chlorophyll helps photosynthesis. Chlorophyll is what gives plants their green color1. As summer ends and autumn comes, the days get shorter and shorter. This is how trees \\"know\\" to begin getting ready for winter. During winter, there is not enough light or water for photosynthesis. Trees rest during this time and live off the food they stored during the summer. They begin to shut down their food-making factories. The green chlorophyll disappears from the leaves. As the bright green fades away, we begin to see yellow and orange leaves. Small amounts of these color1s have been in the leaves all along. We just can't see them in the summer, because they are covered up by the green chlorophyll. The bright reds and yellows we see in leaves are made mostly in autumn. In some trees, like maples, glucose is caught in the leaves after photosynthesis stops. Sunlight and the cool nights of autumn turn this glucose into a red color1. The brown color1 of trees like oaks is made from waste left in the leaves. It is the mixture of all these things that makes the beautiful color1s we enjoy during autumn. Question: What's the author's purpose of writing the passage? Options: A: To explain the process of trees' photosynthesis. B: To encourage readers to protect the environment. C: To analyze the reasons why leaves change color1s. D: To help readers understand what leaves and trees are.","response":"C: To analyze the reasons why leaves change colors."},{"question":"Single/multi-select question: If \\"These men are taking a break from their job.\\", can we conclude \\"the men are working hard right now.\\"?

On that day, I realized that this person I loved and depended on was gone forever. She still lives in family memories, in the thoughts of her friends and co-workers, in the values she had instilled in her children, and in the lovely flower gardens that she had so carefully tended. She loved her gladioli and irises. Each fall she would dig the bulbs out of the soil and carefully wrap them in paper. The bulbs would be stored until the following spring when they would be replanted. It seemed like a lot of effort to me, but each year her flower garden was more glorious than the year before. She put the same hard work into caring for her family, instilling in her children a sense of justice and fair play, compassion, and strong moral values so that we blossomed. Share anecdotes about your mother's life at your Mother's Day party. Too often, we avoid speaking of those loved ones who have passed away, fearful that we will unearth sad feelings.

Input: Background Paragraph: From the data he collected and documented, Aristotle inferred quite a number of rules relating the life-history features of the live-bearing tetrapods (terrestrial placental mammals) that he studied. Among these correct predictions are the following. Brood size decreases with (adult) body mass, so that an elephant has fewer young (usually just one) per brood than a mouse. Lifespan increases with gestation period, and also with body mass, so that elephants live longer than mice, have a longer period of gestation, and are heavier. As a final example, fecundity decreases with lifespan, so long-lived kinds like elephants have fewer young in total than short-lived kinds like mice. Story: Albert is a scientist who travels the planet looking for new species to discover and analyze. While on a safari in Australia, Albert discovered two new species of live-bearing tetrapods.

As is so often the case with street games like this, the gutter drain finally sucks up the last of their hockey balls and they are suddenly left with nothing to do.Wandering around without much purpose, they spy a drying section of concrete and they all decide to write their names in the still wet cement so that their names will be preserved \\"forever.\\" Jimmy Markum and Sean Devine finish their names first. Dave Boyle is just starting to write his name down when a car door opens across the street and a large man steps out with handcuffs and what looks like a badge strapped to his belt. This gives him a presumed air of authority, and he starts badgering the kids about their \\"destruction of municipal property.\\"Silent and even a little surly at first, the three kids are soon cowering in fear. The man decides to make an example of one of the boys, so he grabs David Boyle and tells him that he is going to bring him downtown to the police station and then call his mother. Boyle is thrown in the back of the car and their last view of each other is of him gazing poignantly out of the rear window of that sedan. Meanwhile, the other man in the front seat of the car, a quiet man with a large cross prominently displayed on one of his rings suggesting that he might be a member of the clergy, turns around and looks at David Boyle with predatory delight and eager anticipation.The parents of the kids, many of whom have had prior brushes with the law, realize that this is not orthodox police procedure and a search party for David is quickly organized. Nothing happens for four long days until Boyle, who had been kept locked in the basement of a deserted house, finally escapes his captors and flees for home.All three boys are now grown men as it is now some 25 years later.

You could read in its beautifully printed brochure that the school was designed to help all those \\"children of wealthy parents, who are too busy to learn during the day due to the time spent on the difficult task of maintaining our country's high ranking in the very competitive field of computer games.\\" In other words: when a parent wanted to have some peace and quiet, he or she would leave the kid at home in front of the computer with a bag of chips. When the kid had enough, which normally happened in the evening, he would go to school for about two hours. The creator of PEES and its first principal was Krzycho Jedynak, a former junior high PE teacher in Potylica, a computer games fan and the winner of, as we could read in the beautifully printer brochure, \\"a local Amiga gaming championship\\". Understanding exactly the needs of his future students, he planned to open classes of the following profiles: platform PSP (one group), platform PC (three groups), platform GB (one) and platform Mac (cancelled due to a lack of interest). The school received an astonishing number of applications (four for each spot), which meant that many kids spent their days playing computer games and that many parents wanted time for themselves. To be accepted, young candidates had to demonstrate their social and psychological maturity and computer instincts, evaluated according to a patented method developed by Mr. Jedynak. The parents, on the other hand, had to pass an exam in using a joystick and provide a proof of income of at least 7000 zloty per month for a young family member. During the registration process was so competitive, it ended in violence. A disappointed father of a child who didn't get in, shouted that only VIP brats had been accepted, for which he got hit in the face by editor Furtok, in private - a father of a kid who got in to group B2/platform PC.

Stream of consciousness reasoning: When considering a coin toss, various factors can influence the outcome, such as force, air resistance, and the surface it lands on. The randomness and unpredictability of these variables contribute to the difficulty in determining the coin toss outcome. Furthermore, a fair coin has a 50% chance of landing on heads and a 50% chance of landing on tails, which means it’s equally likely to produce either result. To accurately predict the specific outcome, one would need to have complete knowledge of all the factors affecting the toss and control over them. However, this level of precision and knowledge is virtually impossible to achieve in practice. Additionally, since coin tosses are often used as random events in various situations, from sports to decision-making processes, having forewarning of the outcome may compromise the integrity and fairness of such decisions. Moreover, even with advanced technology or statistical models, the intrinsic nature of the coin toss is still fundamentally random and uncertain. As a result, regardless of any methods used to try and predict the outcome, the true result will still be left up to chance. Therefore, given the numerous variables and inherent randomness involved in a fair coin toss, it is not possible to tell the exact outcome beforehand."},{"question":"Here's a question: If someone is fiddling with something what skill do they likely have? Here are possible answers to this question: - practice - skill - thief - dexterity - knowledge of music I believe the correct choice is \\"dexterity\\", here's why:","response":"Dexterity is the most suitable answer among the given options in the context of someone fiddling with something, and there are several reasons that support this choice. Dexterity refers to the ability to skillfully and gracefully use one's hands to perform intricate tasks requiring fine motor skills. Such tasks may include playing a musical instrument, lock-picking, engaging in art or craftsmanship, or even manipulating small objects for various purposes. To elaborate further, let's analyze the other possible choices individually: 1. Practice: While practice is essential for improving and mastering specific skills, it is not an inherent attribute that individuals possess. In this context, practice refers to the act of repeatedly performing a task rather than a skill that someone might have. Therefore, it does not adequately describe the ability of someone who is fiddling with something. 2. Skill: While skill could be an appropriate term in some situations, it is a broad and general term. In the context of someone fiddling with something, the term \\"skill\\" lacks specificity and does not convey the level of detail needed to explain the ability at hand. Dexterity, on the other hand, precisely pinpoints the use of fine motor skills and adroitness in the scenario given. 3. Thief: Although thieves are commonly depicted as skilled and dexterous individuals in pop culture, the act of fiddling with something does not necessarily indicate criminal intent. Therefore, \\"thief\\" would be an inaccurate assumption to make in this case. Dexterity is the more fitting option as it is an inherent skill and does not assume the individual's motive. 4. Knowledge of music: Fiddling with something might not always relate to music, and it is essential not to limit the context only to musical scenarios. While skilled musicians often exhibit great dexterity, particularly when playing stringed instruments like violins and fiddles, the term \\"knowledge of music\\" does not encompass the broader range of possibilities involving dexterity and fine motor skills. It would be an unfair assumption to label someone who is fiddling with something as a musician solely based on their actions. In conclusion, the term \\"dexterity\\" is the most accurate answer among the given choices, as it captures the essence of an individual's abilities to perform intricate tasks with their hands. This term does not limit the context to musicians or thieves and applies to a wide range of situations where skilled manipulation of small objects or intricate tasks is involved. Hence, choosing \\"dexterity\\" is the most logical and encompassing option in this case."},{"question":"Musa Kayairanga of Rwanda is a traditional healer. He uses natural medicines to treat his patients. He learned how to use computers at a rural telecommunications center in his country. Musa Kayairanga says he exchanges information with doctors as far away as Canada. He also says the computer has improved his knowledge of using plants to treat diseases. Many people in rural areas are now able to communicate with the rest of the world. This is one example of how technology is changing life in developing countries. Andrew Burns is an economist at the World Bank in Washington, D.C. He led a recent study of technology in developing countries. The study found that technology has spread faster in such countries than in rich nations. It also found that technological progress has helped raise wages in developing countries. And it reduced the percentage of people living in extreme poverty from twenty-nine percent in 1990 to eighteen percent in 2004. Progress in communications technology has aided the growth of call centers in developing countries. Call centers are offices where most telephone calls for a business can be answered. For example, a woman in the United States who calls her computer company about a problem might speak with someone in India or Pakistan. Call centers serve businesses in local and international markets. And they have added to economic growth by providing well-paid jobs and new skills for workers who might not have had such employment.

Options: - anger - open mind - biology book - smartness - cynicism Explain why a human would choose \\"open mind\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","response":"A human would choose \\"open mind\\" to answer the question above because having an open mind is an essential quality for effectively learning about the world. An open-minded person is receptive to new experiences, ideas, and perspectives, which allows them to gain a deeper understanding of the diverse and complex realities that exist in the world. By embracing curiosity and being willing to challenge preconceived notions, an open-minded individual becomes more adept at critical thinking, problem-solving, and adaptive learning. In contrast to some of the other options listed: - Anger: This emotion is not typically associated with learning and can, in fact, hinder one's ability to absorb new information. Anger often clouds judgment and obstructs open communication, which are both vital for effective learning. - Biology book: While a biology book can provide valuable insights into life processes and living organisms, it cannot provide a comprehensive understanding of the world as a whole, since learning about the world involves grasping an extensive range of subjects such as geography, culture, history, and more. - Smartness: Although intelligence certainly helps with processing and retaining information, it is not the primary driving force behind seeking knowledge about the world. An open mind is a more fitting characteristic to encourage learning, as it fosters continuous intellectual growth and improvement, even in those who might not be considered traditionally \\"smart.\\" - Cynicism: Cynicism, or a tendency to distrust or question the sincerity or motives of others, can hinder learning as well. A cynical attitude stifles curiosity and impedes open exploration of new concepts, which can lead to limited perspectives and a perpetual state of skepticism. This makes it challenging for one to acquire a well-rounded view of the world. In conclusion, an open mind most effectively leads someone to learning about the world, as it creates an environment conducive to curiosity, exploration, and embracing diverse perspectives, essential factors for acquiring knowledge and understanding."},{"question":"Pick one category for the following text.

It was winter and I had no coat. I had my book bag and my sole Trader Joe’s bag of clothing and was loaded into a van with three social workers. During the long drive in traffic, I fell asleep, so waking up at my new home, I couldn’t make out any street signs and the numbering on the houses did not indicate whether I was in a home in the Bronx or Eastern Queens (which share the same street numbering in certain instances). My foster parents showed me my room and left a plate of food on the table. They barricaded themselves in their bedroom quite like how pilots barricade themselves behind the fortified cockpit door. However, my room didn’t have a lock, and neither did the bathroom. There were bars on my windows with a view of a church parking lot. I took great care to avoid waking a significantly older teen (I was 14, so he must have been 19–20) sleeping on the other bed. I heard two other kids (my foster siblings) in the other room playing music and giggling loudly at 3 in the morning. At 4 in the morning, my foster father started reading the Quran pretty loudly, and then he goes back to bed. In the morning, my foster parents are gone. My foster siblings are all sleeping. I got up at 7, but I don’t know how far I am from my high school, what buses/train will take me there, and still don’t know anything about anything about my new home.

The 2016 Summer Olympics included 28 sports, with five additional sports due to be added to the 2020 Summer Olympics. The 2014 Winter Olympics included seven sports. The number and kinds of events may change slightly from one Olympiad to another. Each Olympic sport is represented by an international governing body, namely an International Federation (IF). The International Olympic Committee (IOC) establishes a hierarchy of sports, disciplines, and events. According to this hierarchy, the Olympic sports can be subdivided into multiple disciplines, which are often assumed to be distinct sports. Examples include swimming and water polo (disciplines of aquatics, represented by the International Swimming Federation), or figure skating and speed skating (disciplines of skating, represented by the International Skating Union). In their turn, disciplines can be subdivided into events, for which medals are actually awarded. A sport or discipline is included in the Olympic program if the IOC determines it is widely practiced around the world, that is, the number of countries that compete in a given sport is the indicator of the sport's prevalence. The IOC's requirements reflect participation in the Olympic Games as well--more stringent toward men (as they are represented in higher numbers) and summer sports (as more nations compete in the Summer Olympics). Is this statement correct \\"does the summer olympics have more sports than the winter olympics\\"?","response":"Yes, that's right! The Summer Olympics have more sports than the Winter Olympics. Summer Olympics usually have around 28 to 33 sports, while Winter Olympics have around 7 sports. Summer Olympics are played in warm weather, and Winter Olympics are played in cold weather, so they have different types of games."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: You are considering whether to buy a product.

They were concentrated in Babylonia and the Land of Israel. Their legal discussions and debates were eventually codified in the Gemara. The \\"Amoraim\\" followed the \\"Tannaim\\" in the sequence of ancient Jewish scholars. The \\"Tannaim\\" were direct transmitters of uncodified oral tradition; the \\"Amoraim\\" expounded upon and clarified the oral law after its initial codification. - Jose the Galilean ( Hebrew : , Yose HaGelili ) , d. 15 Av , was a Jewish sage who lived in the 1st and 2nd centuries of the common era . He was one of the Tannaim , the rabbis whose work was compiled in the Mishna . Jose was a contemporary and colleague of Rabbis Akiva , Tarfon , and Eleazar ben Azariah . Neither the name of his father nor the circumstances of his youth are known , though his name ( \`\` HaGelili '' ) indicates that he was a native of Galilee . He suffered from the prejudice commonly held against the Galileans by the Judeans ; on one occasion a woman who wanted to make a point with him began by calling him a \`\` stupid Galilean '' . When he entered the academy at Yavne , he was entirely unknown . It is also noted that he was extremely modest and addressed Tarfon as \`\` my master '' . He was , nevertheless , a thorough scholar even then , and his arguments nonplused both Tarfon and Akiva . His first appearance at Yavne thus obtained for him general recognition , and the two rabbis considered him not as a pupil , but as a colleague . Akiva was obliged to endure more than one sharp criticism from Jose , who once said to him : \`\` Though thou expound the whole day I shall not listen to thee '' . Tarfon expressed his high esteem of Jose by interpreting Daniel viii. 4 - 7 as though it contained an allusion to him : \`\` I saw the ram , that is , Akiva , and saw that no beast might stand before him ; and I beheld the he - goat , that is , Jose the Galilean , come , and cast him down to the ground . '' As a matter of fact , Jose was the only one who opposed Akiva successfully , and the latter frequently abandoned his own interpretation in favor of his opponent 's . Jose frequently showed a tendency to revert to the older Halakha , explaining the text according to its literal meaning Generally , though , his halakic exegesis differed little from that of Akiva , and both often employed the same rules of interpretation He taught that poultry may be cooked in milk and eaten , as was done in his own native... - Av (\\"Av\\" \\"\\" \\"Abba\\"; from Akkadian \\"abu\\"; \\"father\\") is the eleventh month of the civil year and the fifth month of the ecclesiastical year on the Hebrew calendar. The name is Babylonian in origin and appeared in the Talmud around the 3rd century. This is the only month which is not named in the Bible. It is a summer month of 30 days. Av usually occurs in JulyAugust on the Gregorian calendar. - Tannaim (, singular , \\"Tanna\\" \\"repeaters\\", \\"teachers\\") were the Rabbinic sages whose views are recorded in the Mishnah, from approximately 10-220 CE. The period of the \\"Tannaim\\", also referred to as the Mishnaic period, lasted about 210 years. It came after the period of the \\"Zugot\\" (\\"pairs\\"), and was immediately followed by the period of the \\"Amoraim\\" (\\"interpreters\\"). - Rabban Gamaliel II (also spelled Gamliel) was the first person to lead the Sanhedrin as Nasi after the fall of the second temple, which occurred in 70 CE. Gamliel was appointed nasi approximately 10 years later. Gamaliel II was the son of Shimon ben Gamaliel, one of Jerusalem's foremost men in the war against the Romans, and grandson of Gamaliel I. To distinguish him from the latter he is also called Gamliel of Yavne. - The Sanhedrin (Hebrew: \\"sanhedrîn\\", Greek: , \\"synedrion\\", \\"sitting together,\\" hence \\"assembly\\" or \\"council\\") was an assembly of twenty-three to seventy-one men appointed in every city in the Land of Israel. In the Hebrew Bible, Moses and the Israelites were commanded by God to establish courts of judges who were given full authority over the people of Israel, who were commanded by God to obey every word the judges instructed and every law they established. Judges in ancient Israel were the religious leaders and Teachers of the nation of Israel. The Mishnah arrives at the number twenty-three based on an exegetical derivation: it must be possible for a \\"community\\" to vote for both conviction and exoneration. The minimum size of a \\"community\\" is 10 men (10 vs 10). One more is required to achieve a majority (11 vs 10), but a simple majority cannot convict, and so an additional judge is required (12 vs 10). Finally, a court should not have an even number of judges to prevent deadlocks; thus 23 (12 vs 10 and 1). This court dealt with only religious matters. - The Gregorian calendar is internationally the most widely used civil calendar. It is named after Pope Gregory XIII, who introduced it in October 1582. - Halakha (; also transliterated as halacha, halakhah, halachah or halocho) is the collective body of Jewish religious laws derived from the Written and Oral Torah. It includes the 613 \\"mitzvot\\" (\\"commandments\\"), subsequent Talmudic and rabbinic law and the customs and traditions compiled in the \\"Shulchan Aruch\\" (literally \\"Prepared Table\\", but more commonly known as the \\"Code of Jewish Law\\"). - Ezra ('; fl. 480440 BCE), also called Ezra the Scribe and Ezra the Priest in the Book of Ezra, was a Jewish scribe and a priest. According to the Hebrew Bible he was a descendant of Seraiah (Ezra 7:1) the last high priest to serve in the first temple (kings 2 25:18), and a close relative of Joshua the first High Priest of the second temple (chronicles 1 5:40-41. see also Ezra 3:2). He returned from the Babylonian exile and reintroduced the Torah in Jerusalem (Ezra 710 and Neh 8). According to 1 Esdras, a Greek translation of the Book of Ezra still in use in Eastern Orthodoxy, he was also a high priest. Rabbinic tradition holds that he was only a common priest. - The Shulchan Aruch (, literally: \\"Set Table\\") also known by various Jewish communities but not all as \\"the Code of Jewish Law.\\" There are various legal codes in Judaism but the Shulchan Aruch is the most widely consulted. It was authored in Safed (today in Israel) by Yosef Karo in 1563 and published in Venice two years later. Together with its commentaries, it is the most widely accepted compilation of Jewish law ever written. - Eleazar ben Azariah, was a 1st-century CE Jewish tanna, i.e. Mishnaic sage. He was of the second generation and a junior contemporary of Gamaliel II, Eliezer b. Hyrcanus, and Joshua b. Hananiah, and senior of Akiva. He was a kohen and traced his pedigree for ten generations back to Ezra, and was very wealthy. These circumstances, added to his erudition, gained for him great popularity. When Gamaliel II, in consequence of his provoking demeanor, was temporarily deposed from the patriarchate, Eleazar, though still very young, was elevated to that office by the deliberate choice of his colleagues. He did not, however, occupy it for any length of time, for the Sanhedrin reinstated Gamaliel. He was retained as vice-president (\\"ab bet din\\"), nevertheless, and it was arranged that Gamaliel should lecture three (some say two) Sabbaths, and Eleazar every fourth (or third) Sabbath. - Zugot \\"Pairs\\" (\\"tqufath hazzughoth\\") refers to the hundred-year period during the time of the Second Temple (515 BCE 70 CE), in which the spiritual leadership of the Jews was in the hands of five successive generations of \\"zugoth\\" (\\"pairs\\") of religious teachers.

With quarterback Jeff Garcia back in the lineup, the Buccaneers drove into San Diego territory early in the first quarter. At the 36-yard line, an Antonio Bryant fumble was recovered by San Diego. Philip Rivers quickly led San Diego down the field for their first score. On the ensuing kickoff, Clifton Smith returned the ball 72 yards to the San Diego 11-yard line. Four plays later, B. J. Askew tied the score at 7-7. Trailing 17-7 late in the second quarter, Tampa Bay drove to the San Diego 31, where Matt Bryant kicked a field goal with 22 second left in the half. A quick 25-yard pass by Rivers, however, allowed Nate Kaeding to kick a 57-yard field goal, and take a 20-10 lead into halftime. Tampa Bay took the second half kickoff, and Garcia led the Buccaneers on a long scoring drive. After a scramble to the 7, Garcia scrambled once more for a 7-yard touchdown run. On their next possession, Garcia connected deep to a wide-open Antonio Bryant for a 71-yard touchdown. The third quarter ended with Tampa Bay leading 24-20. The fourth quarter saw Tampa Bay's hope fizzle. Two touchdowns by the Chargers, and a Garcia interception saw the Buccaneers trailing 34-24 with time running out. With less than 7 minutes to go, Garcia found himself scrambling again, this time for a 7-yard first down run. Quentin Jammer slammed into Garcia's helmet, and Garcia began to bleed visibly from him nose and forehead. Driving across midfield with just over 3 minutes to go, Garcia was intercepted by Antoine Cason, who returned the ball 59 yards for the game-icing touchdown. With the loss, their first home defeat of the season, the Buccaneers failed to secure a playoff berth.

Read articles published by different news outlets, and try to include perspectives that challenge your own beliefs. Try to gather your own information rather than instinctively agreeing or disagreeing with what someone else thinks. For example, your parents might have an opinion about a news story. Instead of just agreeing with them because they’re your parents, you might search online to find articles on the subject from multiple news bureaus. After reading a few perspectives on the topic, you can form your own opinion based on what you’ve learned. Before getting too concerned about what someone thinks, consider their expertise and the way they express their opinion. If your teacher wrote their graduate school thesis on a particular historical event, you’ll want to value what they think over someone less informed. In addition to considering the source, think about its package: is someone informed about a subject speaking to you in a clear, thoughtful way? Or are they just hurling insults and criticizing your opinion just for the sake of disagreeing with you? You may also consider whether someone might have a personal motivation for feeling one way or another. Don’t be afraid to have an opinion that goes against the norm, especially if you've put time and thought into forming that opinion. Balance evidence with your gut instincts instead of trying to conform and satisfy others. Respect what others think, and accept that not everyone will think the same way you do. For example, if you prefer dogs over cats, don't pretend to like cats more just to please your friends who think cats are better. You should form your own opinion, even if all of your friends prefer cats. It can be healthy to challenge your core beliefs, but you should avoid compromising them just for the sake of popularity. For instance, if you were raised in a religious tradition, you might find that a healthy dose of doubt will deepen your faith in the long run. But that doesn’t mean you should change your beliefs just because someone criticizes them out of ignorance. Also, keep in mind that it is okay to disagree with people. You can express your opinion in a non-challenging manner and listen respectfully to their opinion as well. However, it is important to consider your goal for the conversation before moving forward.","response":"To form well-rounded opinions on news topics, seek multiple sources and perspectives, including those that challenge your beliefs. Avoid blindly agreeing with others and consider the expertise and motivations of those expressing opinions. Value well-reasoned discussions over hostility, and be willing to hold opinions that go against the norm. Respect differing views and engage in non-challenging conversations, while maintaining your core beliefs. Disagreements are a natural part of discourse and should not be feared."},{"question":"Write a \\"A.\\" movie review (Choose your answer from: A. negative B. positive).","response":"B.

This answer is correct because it properly describes the process of making a locket using a shotgun shell. First, you gather a shotgun shell you want to use. Next, you remove the cap from the shell. Then, you make the lid and expand the body of the cap. Lastly, you will make the ring to complete the locket. The other option is incorrect because it mentions gathering a \\"shotgun paper\\" instead of a \\"shotgun shell.\\" This is a typo and does not make sense within the context of making a locket using a shotgun shell.

He was amazed by the beauty of Namib Desert, which is located mostly in Namibia. He kind of enjoyed the hot surface of the desert. Next to Namib desert is the grasslands of Botswana. He noticed that the surface temperature was much lower there. and a hint : Surface temperature differences in turn cause pressure differences. A hot surface warms the air above it causing it to expand and lower the density and the resulting surface air pressure. The resulting horizontal pressure gradient moves the air from higher to lower pressure regions, creating a wind, and the Earth's rotation then causes deflection of this air flow due to the Coriolis effect. The simple systems thus formed can then display emergent behaviour to produce more complex systems and thus other weather phenomena. Large scale examples include the Hadley cell while a smaller scale example would be coastal breezes. Please answer this question : Which place would have lower surface air pressure, Namibia or Botswana? The answer is:","response":"Namibia would have lower surface air pressure as compared to Botswana. This is because the hot surface of the Namib Desert in Namibia warms the air above it, causing the air to expand and lower in density. Consequently, the surface air pressure decreases. In contrast, the surface temperature in the grasslands of Botswana is comparatively lower, leading to higher air density and higher surface air pressure. The horizontal pressure gradient created due to these differences in surface air pressure causes the air to move from the higher pressure areas in Botswana towards the lower pressure areas in Namibia, forming winds. The Earth's rotation and the Coriolis effect contribute to the deflection of this air flow, resulting in weather phenomena, such as the Hadley cell and coastal breezes."},{"question":"Choose your answer: is the following review positive or negative?

Question: How may I be feeling right now ?","response":"Based on the information provided, it seems like you might be experiencing a combination of emotions. First of all, your use of the phrase \\"don't let the bad things get to me\\" implies that you might be feeling stressed or challenged by certain negative aspects in your life. This could be anything from personal issues to work/school-related stresses. Working hard at school amplifies this inference because it suggests you are under academic pressure. This could be making you feel hard-pressed, anxious, or possibly overwhelmed. Furthermore, your comment about \\"ups and downs, old moods and new humbling heights\\" suggest a fluctuation in your emotional state. It indicates you might have been experiencing feelings of melancholy or nostalgia, possibly linked to the 'old moods.' At the same time, 'new humbling heights' might suggest moments of accomplishment, joy, or optimism. Encountering 'new heights' means you are achieving or experiencing new things which may inspire pride or self-fulfillment, but the fact that these are 'humbling' suggests that they also create a feeling of gratitude or perspective. Your reference to keeping 'things light and easy. like Mexico' indicates a desire for relaxation or a need to escape from stress, likely caused by your academic commitments or other burdens. You seem to associate Mexico with positive emotions, possibly because of its reputation for sunny weather, relaxing beaches, or perhaps personal positive experiences/memory associated with it. In summary, you are seemingly going through an emotional roller coaster ride right now, experiencing stress possibly from academic requirements, a certain degree of nostalgia or melancholy linked to 'old moods,' and momentary pleasures and optimism symbolised by 'new humbling heights.' You also appear to seek relaxation or lightness, as indicated by your comment about Mexico. It’s essential to remember that it's normal for emotions to fluctuate, especially during challenging times. Using relaxation techniques, seeking support from friends or family, and taking time for self-care can all help manage these emotions."},{"question":"Premise: \\"Boy dressed in black is doing a skateboarding jump with a crowd watching.\\" Hypothesis: \\"Nobody is in black.\\" Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?

Doménikos Theotokópoulos (Greek: Δομήνικος Θεοτοκόπουλος [ðoˈminikos θeotoˈkopulos]; October 1541 – 7 April 1614), most widely known as El Greco (\\"The Greek\\"), was a Greek painter, sculptor and architect of the Spanish Renaissance. \\"El Greco\\" was a nickname, a reference to his Greek origin, and the artist normally signed his paintings with his full birth name in Greek letters, Δομήνικος Θεοτοκόπουλος, Doménikos Theotokópoulos, often adding the word Κρής Krēs, Cretan. El Greco was born in the Kingdom of Candia, which was at that time part of the Republic of Venice, and the center of Post-Byzantine art. He trained and became a master within that tradition before traveling at age 26 to Venice, as other Greek artists had done. In 1570 he moved to Rome, where he opened a workshop and executed a series of works. During his stay in Italy, El Greco enriched his style with elements of Mannerism and of the Venetian Renaissance taken from a number of great artists of the time, notably Tintoretto. In 1577, he moved to Toledo, Spain, where he lived and worked until his death. In Toledo, El Greco received several major commissions and produced his best-known paintings. El Greco's dramatic and expressionistic style was met with puzzlement by his contemporaries but found appreciation in the 20th century. El Greco is regarded as a precursor of both Expressionism and Cubism, while his personality and works were a source of inspiration for poets and writers such as Rainer Maria Rilke and Nikos Kazantzakis. El Greco has been characterized by modern scholars as an artist so individual that he belongs to no conventional school. He is best known for tortuously elongated figures and often fantastic or phantasmagorical pigmentation, marrying Byzantine traditions with those of Western painting. The answer to this question is:","response":"Theotokópoulos"},{"question":"Answer the following question: Everybody raised a drink and cheered, they were doing what?

What might be the first step of the process?","response":"The first step of the virus infection process is the entry of the virus into the human or animal body. This usually occurs through one of the following routes: 1. Respiratory transmission: In this mode of transmission, the virus is present in tiny droplets expelled when an infected person talks, coughs, or sneezes. These droplets can be inhaled by another person, allowing the virus to enter the respiratory system. For example, the influenza virus and the SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic primarily spread through respiratory transmission. 2. Direct contact: Viruses can also be transmitted through direct skin-to-skin contact with an infected individual. For example, viruses causing skin infections like herpes simplex virus can transmit via direct contact. 3. Indirect contact: In this case, viruses are present on contaminated surfaces or objects (called fomites), which can be touched by another person. This contaminated surface can later come into contact with a person's eyes, mouth, or nose, and thereby facilitate viral entry. 4. Vector-borne transmission: In some cases, viruses are transmitted to humans or animals by a vector, which is typically a blood-sucking insect, such as a mosquito. For example, the Zika virus and dengue virus are transmitted by the Aedes mosquito vector. 5. Fecal-oral transmission: Some viruses can survive in an infected person's feces and contaminate food or water supplies. If another person ingests the contaminated substance, the virus can enter their body via the digestive system. Examples include norovirus, which causes gastroenteritis, and hepatitis A virus, which can cause liver disease. 6. Bloodborne transmission: Viruses can also enter the body through contact with infected blood, semen, vaginal fluids, or other bodily fluids. This can happen through shared needles, during medical procedures, or sexual contact. Examples include HIV and hepatitis B and C viruses. Once the virus gains entry into the body through any of these transmission routes, it begins the infection process by targeting the specific cells or tissues it is equipped to infect. For instance, respiratory viruses attach to cells lining the respiratory tract, while gastrointestinal viruses infect the cells of the digestive tract. The virus then binds to specific receptors on the cell's surface, using viral surface proteins like spikes or glycoproteins, which allow it to gain entry by fusing with the cell membrane or by being engulfed by the cell. After entering a cell, the virus hijacks the host cell's machinery to replicate its genetic material, produce viral proteins, and assemble new virus particles. Once a sufficient number of virus particles have been produced, they are either released back into the surrounding environment, where they can infect nearby cells or tissues, or enter the bloodstream or lymphatic system to distribute throughout the body and reach other target organs. As the viral infection progresses and spreads, the host's immune system responds by activating various defense mechanisms, including the production of antibodies and the recruitment of immune cells to the site of infection. These immune responses help to eliminate the virus, although they can also contribute to the symptoms and tissue damage associated with viral illnesses. In some cases, the immune response fails to control the infection, resulting in severe or even fatal outcomes. However, in many cases, the immune system successfully clears the virus from the body, leading to recovery and the establishment of immunity to future infections."},{"question":"How does the sentence end?

Choices: - the debris bowl - the flow bowl - the land bowl - the dust bowl A: The answer is:","response":"The Dust Bowl The Dust Bowl was a severe environmental and agricultural disaster that took place during the 1930s in the central United States, specifically the Great Plains region. This devastating event taught people that soil could be lost through plowing and growing crops, which led to widespread soil erosion. As a consequence, new methods and practices were developed and encouraged to prevent further soil erosion and land degradation in the future. The Dust Bowl was caused by a combination of factors, including drought, inappropriate farming practices (such as deep plowing), and economic depression. The severe drought during the 1930s led to a lack of moisture in the soil, making it much more susceptible to wind erosion. Additionally, deep plowing of the native grasses, which helped to hold the soil together, left the topsoil exposed and vulnerable to being blown away by strong winds. As massive dust storms began to roll across the Great Plains, millions of tons of precious topsoil were lost, leading to severe agricultural, economic, and environmental consequences. Crop yields plummeted, and many farmers were forced to abandon their lands and migrate in search of better opportunities. This mass exodus of families during the Dust Bowl era, famously depicted in John Steinbeck's novel \\"The Grapes of Wrath,\\" deeply affected rural communities throughout the affected region. The Dust Bowl prompted the U.S. government and agronomists to take action in the hopes of preventing such a catastrophe from happening again. New farming practices and methods were developed and promoted to help prevent soil erosion and conserve the land. These included contour plowing, crop rotation, planting cover crops, and using windbreaks (rows of trees) to reduce wind speeds and protect the soil. The establishment of the Soil Conservation Service (now known as the Natural Resources Conservation Service) in 1935 was a direct response to the Dust Bowl, and this agency continues to work today to help farmers and landowners implement sustainable land management practices."},{"question":"Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: In a very strange experiment by Andy Warhol, Empire is literally one continuous shot of New York's Empire State Building for eight hours and five minutes.

But the folks who put Truman Capote’s Breakfast at Tiffany’s on Broadway wanted the late author cremated remains at the play premier’s after party, since Capote himself couldn't make it. They even went so far as to offer the ashes—and their owner—a flight from Los Angeles to New York for the show. Odd guest: In honor of the late writer, producers of Broadway's 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' tried to fly Truman Capote's ashes in for their New York premier A source of the New York Post confirmed the bizarre offer. ‘We did try to get him here,’ the source said. ‘We thought it would have been poignant for the entire company.’ Former wife of Johnny Carson, Joanne Carson, keeps the In Cold Blood author’s remains in the Bel Air bedroom where he died in 1984. The two were close friends up until his death and Carson has seen the ashes argued over, stolen, returned, and nearly stolen again over the years. Old friends: Joanne Carson (here with then husband Johnny in 1969) possesses Capote's remains in her Bel Air home The ashes were famously boosted during Carson’s 1988 Halloween party, along with 200,000 worth of jewelry. However, they were mysteriously returned shortly thereafter. That’s when Capote’s longtime partner questioned whether the ashes were those of his dead lover at all. Someone again attempted to steal the remains at a showing put on by Carson of the play Tru, which is adapted from Capote’s works. Broadway turn: The beloved book was first a film starring Audrey Hepburn (right) as Holly Golightly and saw its big stage debut March 20 with actress Emilia Clarke (left) in the role It was the history of theft that doomed Capote's post-mortem trip to the theater, or so says the Post's source. ' Ultimately, the risk of theft was just too high.' In spite of the drama surrounding them, Carson has referred to her cremated friend’s remain as ‘her sanity’ over the years. And Carson claims Capote always wanted to see ‘Holly Golightly open on Broadway.’ ||||| Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) For the “Breakfast at Tiffany’s” opening on Broadway this week, the production tried to bring in one secret surprise guest: the ashes of late author Truman Capote. Reps for the show — starring “Game of Thrones” star Emilia Clarke, and based on Capote’s 1958 novella — even offered complimentary first-class round-trip airfare for the ashes and their owner, Johnny Carson’s ex Joanne Carson, to travel from Bel Air to New York and appear at an Edison Ballroom after-party. But given people’s past predilection for trying to steal Capote’s remains, it was too risky. “[Joanne] Carson was Capote’s closest confidante in his later years,” said a source, “and she keeps a portion of his cremated remains in an urn in her Bel Air home, in the room in which he died in 1984.” The ashes were infamously stolen from Carson’s house during a 1988 Halloween party — along with 200,000 in jewels — and then the remains were just as mysteriously returned in the middle of the night. Meanwhile, Capote’s late, longtime lover Jack Dunphy openly disputed whether the ashes Carson kept were even Capote’s at all. Adding to the intrigue, the same ashes were the target of another thief years later, when Carson brought them to a bash she hosted for a play about Capote, “Tru.” That culprit, says a source, was caught “before he could make it out the door” with a piece of the acclaimed novelist. “We did try to get him here,” confirmed a “Breakfast” rep of Capote’s ashes. “Joanne says he always wanted to [see] Holly Golightly open on Broadway, and we thought it would have been poignant for the entire company. I think ultimately the risk of theft was just too high, but he was certainly there in spirit.” Joanne has said of Capote, “His ashes were my sanity for . . . years. Truman often referred to me as his very own Holly Golightly come to life. He always told me you could be anything you wanted but, whatever happens, never be boring.” The star-studded black-and-white-themed after-party for “Breakfast” was hosted by Debbie Harry and Interview magazine. ||||| What is a summary?","response":"Broadway producers wanted Truman Capote's cremated remains to attend the premier of \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's,\\" offering a flight from Los Angeles to New York for the ashes and their owner, Joanne Carson.

It seems that from the given information, it is reasonable to assume that \\"He got a head injury.\\" The statement describes a scenario where someone had stealthily approached him from behind and struck him down with a blow to the head. In general, when someone experiences a forceful blow to the head, it is likely to result in some form of head injury. A head injury can range from mild to severe, depending on the force of the impact and other factors. It could be a simple bruise or contusion, a concussion, a skull fracture, or even more serious traumatic brain injuries. The severity of the injury will depend on various factors, such as the force of the impact, the location of the strike, the person's age and health, and any pre-existing medical conditions. It is essential to promptly assess and treat a person who has experienced a blow to the head, as head injuries can often have severe and long-lasting effects. These effects can include physical symptoms like headaches, dizziness, or loss of consciousness, as well as cognitive and emotional consequences such as memory problems, mood changes, or difficulty concentrating. Preventing head injuries is crucial, and certain precautions can be taken to avoid these types of accidents. Some ways to protect oneself and others are to wear appropriate safety gear, especially helmets when engaging in activities that may pose a risk of head injury; to be cautious and aware of one's surroundings, particularly in situations where others may be unaware of your presence; and to implement safety measures and procedures in both personal and professional environments.

Premise: A sitting lady has on white gloves and is working with some sort of dirty material. This premise describes a situation where a lady is seated, wearing white gloves, and is engaged in working with an unidentified dirty material (most likely due to the nature of the activity which leads to getting her gloves dirty). The use of white gloves might suggest that the lady is taking extra precautions to prevent dirt or debris from affecting her hands, ensuring they stay clean during the activity. Hypothesis: A lady is watching TV This hypothesis proposes an entirely different scenario where a lady is watching TV. Watching TV is a passive activity where a person typically relaxes and engages in mental input rather than physically working with materials as described in the premise. Given the premise, we cannot reasonably conclude that the lady is watching TV. The premise is focused on the lady working with dirty materials, an active task which requires her attention and physical engagement, while the hypothesis presents a situation where the lady is passively consuming content. These two scenarios do not align. It is essential to note that it might be possible for someone to watch TV while engaged in another activity, but the specific details provided in the premise do not naturally lead to the conclusion that the lady is watching TV. Instead, it would be more reasonable to focus on understanding the nature of the task she is performing while wearing white gloves and working with dirty materials, as that information would provide more insight into the correlation between her actions and the provided details. In conclusion, based on the provided premise, we cannot logically deduce the hypothesis that the lady is watching TV, as the key aspects of both situations are not correlated.

Little is known for certain of Josquin's early life. Much is inferential and speculative, though numerous clues have emerged from his works and the writings of contemporary composers, theorists, and writers of the next several generations. Josquin was born in the area controlled by the Dukes of Burgundy, and was possibly born either in Hainaut (modern-day Belgium), or immediately across the border in modern-day France, since several times in his life he was classified legally as a Frenchman (for instance, when he made his will). Josquin was long mistaken for a man with a similar name, Josquin de Kessalia, born around the year 1440, who sang in Milan from 1459 to 1474, dying in 1498. More recent scholarship has shown that Josquin des Prez was born around 1450 or a few years later, and did not go to Italy until the early 1480s.Around 1466, perhaps on the death of his father, Josquin was named by his uncle and aunt, Gille Lebloitte dit Desprez and Jacque Banestonne, as their heir. Their will gives Josquin's actual surname as Lebloitte. According to Matthews and Merkley, \\"des Prez\\" was an alternative name.According to an account by Claude Hémeré, a friend and librarian of Cardinal Richelieu whose evidence dates as late as 1633, and who used the records of the collegiate church of Saint-Quentin, Josquin became a choirboy with his friend and colleague the Franco Flemish composer Jean Mouton at Saint-Quentin's royal church, probably around 1460. Doubt has been cast on the accuracy of Hémeré's account, however. Josquin may have studied counterpoint under Ockeghem, whom he greatly admired throughout his life: this is suggested both by the testimony of Gioseffo Zarlino and Lodovico Zacconi, writing later in the 16th century, and by Josquin's eloquent lament on the death of Ockeghem in 1497, Nymphes des bois/Requiem aeternam, based on the poem by Jean Molinet. All records from Saint-Quentin were destroyed in 1669; however the collegiate chapel there was a center of music-making for the entire area, and in addition was... A:","response":"The person who possibly acquired his later connections with the French royal chapel through early experiences at Saint-Quentin is Josquin des Prez. Josquin des Prez, often referred to simply as Josquin, was a French composer during the Renaissance. He is also known under alternative names, such as Josquin Lebloitte, as his uncle and aunt named him in their will. He was born around 1450 in the area controlled by the Dukes of Burgundy, possibly in Hainaut (now Belgium) or just across the border in France. Evidence shows Josquin des Prez was classified legally as a Frenchman several times in his life. According to an account by Claude Hémeré, a librarian of Cardinal Richelieu, Josquin became a choirboy at Saint-Quentin's royal church probably around 1460. His friend and colleague, the Franco Flemish composer Jean Mouton was also based in Saint-Quentin around this time. Although there has been doubts about the accuracy of Hémeré's account, it suggests that the experiences and connections Josquin made in Saint-Quentin may have significantly influenced his later involvement with the French royal chapel. Furthermore, Josquin may have studied counterpoint under Ockeghem, who he greatly admired.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process The answer is:","response":"- indirectly impacting a step of the process A lack of rainfall is not directly related to the photosynthesis process, which involves sunlight, chloroplasts, enzymes, water, oxygen, hydrogen, and electrons. However, the absence of rainfall can indirectly impact the process by causing water stress in plants. Water is a crucial element for photosynthesis, as it provides the hydrogen needed for the production of glucose, as well as acting as a medium for other necessary nutrients needed for plant growth. When there is less sunlight, the rate of photosynthesis may slow down, as sunlight is the primary energy source for this process. Without enough sunlight, the plant cannot produce enough energy to facilitate the process of breaking down water and converting NADP into NADPH, ultimately reducing the overall efficiency of photosynthesis. The absence of rainfall, on the other hand, can lead to reduced water availability for the plant. If a plant does not receive an adequate amount of water, it may partially or completely close its stomata (tiny openings on the surface of the leaves) to minimize water loss through transpiration. When the stomata close, it also limits the diffusion of carbon dioxide into the plant, another essential component for the photosynthesis process. As a result, photosynthesis becomes less efficient, negatively impacting the plant's overall growth and survival. In summary, a lack of rainfall does not directly impact any specific step of the photosynthesis process, but it can indirectly affect the process by causing water stress in plants and reducing the efficiency of photosynthesis due to limited water availability and closed stomata, further exacerbating the issue caused by less sunlight."},{"question":"a powerful earthquake struck the northern coast of chile overnight , killing three people and sending scores of people fearing tidal waves to higher ground , preliminary reports indicated sunday .

Contrary to previous concerns, Turkey confirms that no significant influx of Iraqi refugees has reached the Turkish border thus far. Over the past few years, the challenging socio-political landscape in Iraq has led to a growing number of Iraqis seeking a more stable and secure life elsewhere. With Turkey being a neighboring country, it has long been expected that a considerable number of displaced individuals would eventually make their way to the Turkish border. However, the latest statement from the Turkish government suggests that this anticipated surge in refugees has not yet occurred. This news has come as a relief to both the Turkish authorities and the international community, as any significant increase in refugees would put further strain on Turkey's already over-taxed immigration and social resources. Although the absence of a large-scale refugee flow is a positive development, the Turkish government remains vigilant and prepared for any potential changes in the situation. The government continues to monitor the circumstances surrounding the refugees and maintain regular communication with their Iraqi counterparts for updates and coordination, ensuring the well-being of displaced individuals. Furthermore, Turkey remains committed to assisting Iraqi refugees and other affected people in need of support. The Turkish government has previously pledged humanitarian aid to various countries, including Iraq, and continues to provide refuge to thousands of displaced individuals from across the region. While the current absence of a widespread Iraqi refugee flow is a crucial reprieve for Turkey, it is also a reminder of the ongoing crises affecting countries in the region.

The University and College Union (UCU) has recently been in dispute with employers over proposed changes to the USS pension scheme, and the most sustained period of industrial action in the sector’s history has highlighted the fears staff have for the security of their futures post-retirement. Such unprecedented strike action needs to be situated within the wider context of a public sector undergoing transformation: while the concept remains contested, the influence of “neoliberal” ideas on universities can most clearly be seen in Success as a Knowledge Economy – the government white paper that preceded the 2017 Higher Education and Research Act – which states: “Competition between providers in any market incentivises them to raise their game, offering consumers a greater choice of more innovative and better quality products and services at lower cost. Higher education is no exception.” Yet what might “raising our game” mean for academic staff? The university has been described as an “anxiety machine”: the creeping marketisation of the sector along with pressure to recruit students (now “consumers”), increasing managerialism, and the implementation of processes of audit – such as the REF and TEF – to evaluate performance have arguably contributed to a progressively anxious landscape in which to labour. In 2016/17, 34% of academic staff were employed on fixed-term contracts – a figure likely to be disputed by the UCU, since in 2016 it estimated the extent of casualisation in the sector to be closer to 54% once atypical contracts had been taken into consideration.

A U.S. interagency group traveled to Saudi Arabia twice, in 1999 and 2000, to get information from the Saudis about their understanding of those finances. The group eventually concluded that the oft-repeated assertion that Bin Laden was funding al Qaeda from his personal fortune was in fact not true. The officials developed a new theory: al Qaeda was getting its money elsewhere, and the United States needed to focus on other sources of funding, such as charities, wealthy donors, and financial facilitators. Ultimately, although the intelligence community devoted more resources to the issue and produced somewhat more intelligence, it remained difficult to distinguish al Qaeda's financial transactions among the vast sums moving in the international financial system. The CIA was not able to find or disrupt al Qaeda's money flows. The NSC staff thought that one possible solution to these weaknesses in the intelligence community was to create an all-source terrorist-financing intelligence analysis center. Clarke pushed for the funding of such a center at Treasury, but neither Treasury nor the CIA was willing to commit the resources. Within the United States, various FBI field offices gathered intelligence on organizations suspected of raising funds for al Qaeda or other terrorist groups. By 9/11, FBI agents understood that there were extremist organizations operating within the United States supporting a global jihadist movement and with substantial connections to al Qaeda. The FBI operated a web of informants, conducted electronic surveillance, and had opened significant investigations in a number of field offices, including New York, Chicago, Detroit, San Diego, and Minneapolis. On a national level, however, the FBI never used the information to gain a systematic or strategic understanding of the nature and extent of al Qaeda fundraising. Treasury regulators, as well as U.S. financial institutions, were generally focused on finding and deterring or disrupting the vast flows of U.S. currency generated by drug trafficking and high-level international fraud. Large-scale scandals, such as the use of the Bank of New York by Russian money launderers to move millions of dollars out of Russia, captured the attention of the Department of the Treasury and of Congress. Before 9/11, Treasury did not consider terrorist financing important enough to mention in its national strategy for money laundering. Do you have any questions?","response":"Yes, I have a few questions to help me understand the situation better: 1.

If you don’t use a muscle, it will get smaller and weaker—so use it or lose it. Paragraph: David got five exercise tips from his personal trainer, tip A, tip B, tip C, tip D, and tip E. Tip A involves weight lifting, but tip B does not involve weight lifting. Tip C involves running, but tip D does not involve running. Finally, tip E does not involve any exercise at all.

Certain areas, such as California and Japan, are more _ earthquakes than others. Although the chance of being caught in \\"The Big one\\" is remote, it's wise to be prepared if you live in a region where earthquakes are common. Educate your family about earthquakes before a big one strikes. For example, they need to know to take shelter in a doorway or under a strong object if indoors, and never to run outdoors if they are inside. If outside, they need to know to stay away from power lines and buildings where objects could fall. Teach family members how to turn off gas or water lines or electrical power that may need to be shut off after a quake if severe damage occurs. Develop a plan. Where will your family meet in the event of a disaster? What if some people are at work or school? How will you know if they are safe? Where will you all meet up? Pack a preparedness kit and keep it in a safe location. In a major earthquake, it's possible that you won't be able to get into your house.

Melissa made 4 times as many muffins as Sasha, and Tiffany made half of Sasha and Melissa's total number of muffins. If one muffin sold for 4, how much money did Sasha, Melissa, and Tiffany contribute to the fundraiser? Your thoughts:","response":"Let's break it down step by step: 1. Sasha made 30 chocolate muffins. 2. Melissa made 4 times as many muffins as Sasha. This means Melissa made = 4 * 30 = 120 muffins. 3. Tiffany made half of Sasha and Melissa's total number of muffins. First, let's find the total number of muffins made by Sasha and Melissa = 30 (Sasha's) + 120 (Melissa's) = 150 muffins. Now, Tiffany made half of this total, so she made = 150 / 2 = 75 muffins. 4. Now we need to find the total amount of money they raised through muffin sales. Each muffin sold for 4. The total number of muffins made by all three of them is = 30 (Sasha's) + 120 (Melissa's) + 75 (Tiffany's) = 225 muffins. The total amount of money raised is = 225 muffins * 4 per muffin = 900.

Sit so that your feet are on the foot rests and knee pads are outside of your legs. Use your strength to push the pads from a closed to an open position, away from your body. Bring the weight slowly back to a stop. Do this in sets of ten at a manageable weight. Be sure to emphasize good form. Weights too high or too many reps can lead to injury. Gyms may have machines that slightly vary. If you have any questions about how to use a hip abductor machine, ask a gym employee for help. Jogging is great for overall health but can cause wear and tear to your joints, especially knees, hips, and ankles. Use cardio machines at the gym to get the same benefits of cardio, without all the problems. Use an elliptical machine. This is a low impact exercise that will increase the range of motion in your hips. Simply follow the instructions and start striding at a comfortable resistance level. This will promote the same range of motion as jogging without the impact of hitting the ground. Stationary bikes are among the best exercise options for hip problems. They're great for increasing your range of motion, keeping joints mobile, and building up strength as you progress to longer, more difficult workouts. Tread climbers work much like walking. You will have to stretch your hips to maintain a natural walking stride. Similarly, a stair climber will stretch and strengthen your hips muscles. The incline of the stair climber will force you to stretch and stabilize your muscles. Both of these should be done with caution and after consultation with your doctor or physical therapist. Cardio and machines are great but there are few strength training equivalents to free weights. Weight training can be a little more difficult than other strengthening exercises, but if done properly and safely yields great results. Use bench step up exercises to build strength. Find a dumbbell weight that you are comfortable with. Hold a dumbbell in each hand down to your side. Stand in front of a bench lengthwise. Step up with your right foot, holding your left leg to the side. Hold for three seconds then repeat with the other foot. Bent knee deadlifts get the benefits of the Olympic dead lift without the same strain. Again, find a light dumbbell and hold one in each hand. Stand with your feet shoulder length apart, holding each dumbbell with your palms facing in. Keeping your head up, shoulders back and knees slightly bent, bend forward slightly, lowering the dumbbells along your legs. Keep your body weight above your heels and slowly return to a starting position. Use dumbbell lunges to stretch your hips. Keep a dumbbell in each hand and stand upright. Step forward with your right foot, keeping your left leg stationary behind. Lower your upper body down while maintaining your balance. Using the heel of your forward foot, return to your starting position.

Because the trust is revocable, you can change your mind at any time (unless you become incapacitated). The only cost you will incur is the cost of retitling property back to your own name. Realize that the mortgage follows the property into the trust. Your ownership interest in any business is probably quite valuable. You should consider leaving those interests to people in your revocable trust. For example, you might leave the following: You can transfer the assets and business name of a sole proprietorship to the revocable trust. You might be able transfer your ownership interest in a partnership to the trust, although you should check the partnership document first. Some partnership documents limit your ability to make this transfer. You might also be able to transfer shares in a closely held company to your revocable trust.

A study published in Lancet has found that as many as 1 million children under age 15 are hit with TB each year, reports the Wall Street Journal. That's double the previously established estimate, and some two-thirds of all cases go undiagnosed. The Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School researchers were also able to for the first time put a number on the instances of what Reuters terms a \\"drug-resistant 'superbug' strain\\" of TB: MDR-TB. As many as 32,000 kids across the globe become sick with that form each year. Reuters notes that researchers have historically focused more on TB in adults, for a duo of reasons: Adults are more likely to pass on the disease; and the diagnosis methods used on adults don't always work on kids, in part because up to 30% of children who develop TB do so somewhere other than their lungs. But the attention is shifting to children in part because of what they can reveal about the transmission of the disease among adults: TB develops much more rapidly in children, signalling the presence of the disease in their adult family members or community. \\"These 1 million children are missed opportunities for preventing TB every year,\\" says the co-senior author of the study.","response":"Title: World TB Day Sheds Light on Alarming Increase of Tuberculosis Among Children Introduction World Tuberculosis (TB) Day is a poignant reminder of the ongoing battle against this deadly disease. This year, the day is marked by some disheartening new findings on the prevalence of TB among children. According to a study published in Lancet, as many as 1 million children under the age of 15 are affected by TB each year. This figure is double the previously estimated number and highlights the fact that nearly two-thirds of all cases go undiagnosed. 1. The Situation Researchers from Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School have brought to light the concerning issue of undiagnosed TB in children, revealing that many are suffering from the disease worldwide. In addition, the study has identified the presence of a drug-resistant strain of tuberculosis known as MDR-TB, which affects over 32,000 children every year. 2. Reasons for Underdiagnosis Historically, researchers have primarily focused on TB in adults for two main reasons: adults are more likely to transmit the disease, and diagnostic methods used for adults are not always effective for children. This is because up to 30% of children who develop tuberculosis do so in areas other than their lungs, making diagnosis more difficult. 3. Changing Focus Now, attention is shifting towards children as they can reveal important insights about the transmission of TB among adults. Tuberculosis develops much more rapidly in children, which often signals the presence of the disease in their adult family members or community. By focusing on children, researchers hope to shed light on how the disease is transmitted in adults and ultimately curtail the spread of TB. 4. Prevention and Opportunities With the discovery that 1 million children are affected by tuberculosis each year, researchers emphasize the missed opportunities for prevention. By identifying and treating the disease in children, it can not only help them recover but also hinder the disease's transmission to their adult family members and the community. Conclusion The findings in the Lancet study underscore the importance of addressing tuberculosis in children, both for the youngsters' health and to better understand the transmission of the disease among adults. As World TB Day approaches, it is crucial to recognize these revelations and make a concerted effort to diagnose, treat, and prevent the spread of tuberculosis in children worldwide."},{"question":"Based on the premise \\"Take time off from the city bustle for a stroll through the Jardin des Tuileries, named after a 13th-century tile works and now beautifully re-landscaped as part of a renovation plan for the Musee du Louvre to the east.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"Jardin des Tuileries has been relandscaped beautifully. \\" is true (see options)?

Stream of consciousness reasoning: Humans, being terrestrial creatures, have lungs and a respiratory system designed for breathing oxygen from the air. Fish, on the other hand, have gills that allow them to extract oxygen from water. The two respiratory systems are fundamentally different and cannot be easily interchanged. While there are breakthroughs in science and technology, such as underwater breathing apparatuses like scuba gear, and experiments on artificial gills, these are not natural modifications to the human body. Genetic modifications could theoretically alter a human's respiratory system to function underwater, but such a change may also lead to incapability of breathing air, making it impractical.

These fields, appearing as enormous, rolling amber waves, are the lifeblood of many small farming communities scattered across the state. The individual grains of wheat, the ubiquitous crop of this region, sway like a symphony in motion, their tasseled heads heavy under the wealth of the nutritious kernels that lay hidden within their silken folds. It’s a sight of captivating, timeless beauty—an emblem of hard work, perseverance, and the bountiful gifts of nature. In these parts, the cycle of life under the changing hues of the state's wide, open sky is mirrored by the wheat's lifecycle, transitioning from the emerald green of fresh sprouts, the golden hues of ripe crops, to the rich brown of harvested fields, each phase carrying its own unique, palpable allure. Indeed, the influence of this pivotal staple grain extends beyond the confines of these fields, finding its way into the state’s economy, culture, and way of life, ticking off the seasons with its ever-changing palette and making time seemingly stand still with its rhythmic swaying. Growing wheat, while a task demanding constant effort, patience, and dedication from the farming families, tells a story much larger than simple agricultural practice. It subtly speaks to generational bonds, shared heritage, and the state's rich history and unyielding spirit. Each stalk standing proudly in the expansive fields attests to the resilience of the people who tend their land against all odds, their sweat seeping into the soil, fostering growth, and ultimately, putting food on millions of tables. Therefore, there is an innate beauty when these three entities, the field, state, and wheat, are mentioned in a single sentence. They create an imbued sense of mutual coexistence and interdependence, monumentally shaping life as it unfolds in the sprawling expanses of wheat fields that lie under the fascinatingly vast sky of a great American state."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which team had people with crescent shaped cells in their blood? Doctor Jones studied two teams of workers. Team one had healthy people with normal red blood cell levels, but team two had people with sickle-cell anemia. the differences in health parameters were amazing and obvious. Hint: The primary role of red blood cells in the circulatory system is to transport oxygen to the tissues. The actual carrier of oxygen molecules is the protein hemoglobin, which binds to the oxygen and moves it throughout the body, releasing it in areas where the concentration of dissolved oxygen is low. A certain mutation in the gene for hemoglobin causes a slight change in the structure of this crucial protein, resulting in a disease called sickle-cell anemia. For people with this mutation, the hemoglobin produced by their red blood cells has a tendency to clump together, distorting the shape of the red blood cells and giving rise to the crescent-shaped cells seen above. By understanding the changes in structure that are the underlying cause of this disease, we have developed various ways to treat and manage this illness.

Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning? Options: - Fill a bowl with apple cider vinegar and a bit of water. The vinegar will attract them and the water will kill them. - Fill a bowl with apple cider vinegar and a bit of soap. The vinegar will attract them and the soap will kill them.","response":"The second option is the better one because it makes more sense. Fruit flies are attracted to the apple cider vinegar because it smells like yummy, rotting fruit, which they love. But just vinegar and water won't kill them - they might be able to just float there or fly away when they're done. On the other hand, adding a bit of soap to the vinegar changes the game. Soap reduces the surface tension of the water and vinegar mixture. Surface tension is like a magic invisible blanket that normally lets bugs walk on water without falling in. When the soap is added, the magic blanket disappears. So, when the fruit flies land on the yummy vinegar, they would sink into the liquid because there is no surface tension to support them, and they'd drown. Therefore, the latter option is more effective."},{"question":"Question 1: Which are the major highways in California and how are they compared to the major highways in Maine? Question 2: Which are the major highways in California and how are they compared to the major highways in Pennsylvania? Available choices: 1). no 2). yes Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","response":"The questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing, but they share a similar base question. Both questions are inquiring about the major highways in California and comparing them to the major highways in another state. In question 1, the comparison is with Maine, while in question 2, the comparison is with Pennsylvania. To answer each question in detail: Question 1: Which are the major highways in California, and how do they compare to the major highways in Maine? Major highways in California: 1. Interstate 5 (I-5) is the main north-south highway that runs from the Mexican border to the Oregon border, passing through major cities like San Diego, Los Angeles, and Sacramento. 2. Interstate 80 (I-80) is a vital east-west highway running from San Francisco to the California-Nevada border, passing through Sacramento. 3. U.S. Route 101 (US-101) runs along the California coastline, stretching from Los Angeles to the Oregon border. Major highways in Maine: 1. Interstate 95 (I-95) is the primary north-south highway in Maine, passing through the state's largest city, Portland, and extending from the New Hampshire border to the Canadian border. 2. U.S. Route 1 (US-1) is a scenic coastal highway that runs along the eastern United States, passing through Maine from the New Hampshire border to the Canadian border. In comparison, California has a more extensive network of highways, many of which are larger and serve more densely populated areas. California highways tend to be busier due to the state's larger population. Maine, on the other hand, has fewer major highways, which are generally less congested. Moreover, Maine's highways serve more rural areas and provide more scenic routes. Question 2: Which are the major highways in California, and how do they compare to the major highways in Pennsylvania? Major highways in California have already been listed above. Major highways in Pennsylvania: 1. Interstate 80 (I-80) is the main east-west highway, running across the state from the Ohio border to the New Jersey border, passing through cities like Erie, State College, and Hazleton. 2. Interstate 76 (I-76), also known as the Pennsylvania Turnpike, is another important east-west highway that runs from the Ohio border to the New Jersey border, passing through cities like Pittsburgh, Harrisburg, and Philadelphia. 3. Interstate 81 (I-81) is a north-south highway that runs through eastern Pennsylvania, passing through cities like Scranton, Wilkes-Barre, and Harrisburg. California and Pennsylvania both have extensive highway networks that serve major metropolitan areas. However, California's highways have more traffic due to its higher population density, and its highways are spread over a larger land area. Pennsylvania's highways, on the other hand, are generally less congested but also serve key population centers like Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. In conclusion, questions 1 and 2 share a similar base question about California's major highways, but they are different in that they require comparisons to different states - Maine and Pennsylvania."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Combine facts and answer this: The Devil's Disciple is a 1959 film adaptation of a 1897 play whose author had this nationality?

Longacre is best known for designing the Indian Head cent, which entered commerce in 1859, and for the designs of the Shield nickel, Flying Eagle cent and other coins of the mid-19th century. Longacre was born in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, in 1794. He ran away to Philadelphia at age 12, where he became an apprentice in a bookstore. His artistic talent developed and he was released to apprentice in an engraving firm. He struck out on his own in 1819, making a name providing illustrations for popular biographical books. He portrayed the leading men of his day; support from some of them, such as South Carolina Senator John C. Calhoun, led to his appointment as chief engraver after the death of Christian Gobrecht in 1844. In Longacre's first years as a chief engraver, the Philadelphia Mint was dominated by Mint Director Robert M. Patterson and Chief Coiner Franklin Peale. Conflict between Longacre and the two men developed after Congress ordered a new gold dollar and double eagle, with both to be designed by Longacre. Peale and Patterson nearly had Longacre fired, but the chief engraver was able to convince Treasury Secretary William M. Meredith that he should be retained. Both Patterson and Peale left the Mint in the early 1850s, ending the conflict. In 1856, Longacre designed the Flying Eagle cent. When that design proved difficult to strike, Longacre was responsible for the replacement, the Indian Head cent, issued beginning in 1859. Other coins designed by Longacre include the silver and nickel three-cent pieces, the Shield nickel, the pattern Washington nickel, and the two-cent piece. In 1866–1867, he redesigned the coins of Chile. Longacre died suddenly on New Year's Day 1869; he was succeeded by William Barber.

I didn’t particularly love it but it was interesting enough at the least to hold my attention. We got to class and the teacher pulled up a list of instructions on the projector. She had each of us follow the instructions and she gave us 20 minutes to complete all of them. It may even have been a bit of a race too, to see who finished it first. This becomes a lot more evident in a second. I can’t recall the exact details of the instructions, except that clearly it had to do with art such as having to draw a bunch of things. Anyways, we all went one by one down the instructions getting increasing nervous as to try to be the first one to finish. The class goes quiet while we work. Then I get to the last instruction which reads something along the lines of: “Step 15: Skip steps 1–14 and put your pencil down.” You gotta be freaking kidding me. We’re all so confused and mad at ourselves for not reading the whole of the instructions first. She turned this into a lesson for how we need to learn to read all the instructions first and then start, which was pretty clever. She got us! I remember this vividly to this day. But I look back now on this “prank” and I realize that she was kind of…wrong. Sure if the instructions are short like 15 steps it might be good to glance through before you start.

Such activities can involve both theoretical knowledge and practical skills. Here is a comprehensive and detailed example of a task that tests someone's physical reasoning ability: Task: Design and build a Rube Goldberg machine that gets a small ball into a cup placed 2 meters away. Rationale: A Rube Goldberg machine is a complex contraption designed to perform a simple task through a series of chain reactions. This task requires the participant to understand and apply various principles of physical reasoning, such as gravity, inertia, kinetic and potential energy, levers, and pulleys, in designing and constructing the machine. The following steps elaborate on how a participant can complete the given task and the physical reasoning principles involved: 1. Conceptualization: The participant begins by conceptualizing the layout of the Rube Goldberg machine, taking into account the available materials and space constraints. They must consider how to convert the potential energy of the initial input (e.g., a push, pull, or drop) into kinetic energy and how to use this energy to initiate a series of events that ultimately results in the ball landing in the cup. 2. Design: In this phase, the participant sketches out the different components of the machine and the sequence of reactions. They may incorporate simple machines such as levers, pulleys, and inclined planes to amplify or redirect forces. For example, a lever's mechanical advantage can be used to lift a heavier object or extend the range of motion. The participant must also consider other physical phenomena, such as friction and air resistance, which could affect the machine's performance. 3. Construction: The participant sets up the Rube Goldberg machine according to their design, assembling the components and arranging them in the correct order. This process requires understanding the mechanical properties of the materials involved and implementing the physical principles discussed in the design phase. Practical skills, such as cutting, gluing, and fastening, will come into play as well. 4. Testing and optimization: Once the machine is constructed, the participant tests it to see if it achieves the desired outcome (i.e., getting the ball into the cup). If the machine fails or does not perform as expected, the participant must analyze the reasons for these shortcomings and use their knowledge of physical reasoning to make modifications and improvements. This iterative process continues until the Rube Goldberg machine successfully completes the task. A participant's performance in this task is a good indicator of their ability to perform physical reasoning, as it involves understanding and applying fundamental physical principles, problem-solving, and practical skills in designing, building, and optimizing a complex physical system."},{"question":"Aţi menţionat faptul că au existat penalităţi contractuale impuse din cauza întârzierilor în ceea ce priveşte Sistemul de Informaţii privind Vizele.

A:","response":"\\"Loose\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it directly addresses the situation described in the question. The context provided is that Sarah asked someone to make sure that the bundle was tight, indicating she wanted the contents secure and held together well. When some contents fall out, this reveals that the bundle was not tight enough to hold everything inside. Therefore, \\"loose\\" is the appropriate answer as it describes the opposite of tightness, which is the main concern in the question. Here's a brief analysis of why the other options are not appropriate: 1. Broad: This term refers to width or extent, and doesn't relate to securing a bundle. 2. Slack: While this can mean not tight or tense, it's more often used to describe a lack of effort or work. In the context of the question, \\"loose\\" better conveys the intended meaning. 3.

How to freeze tomatoes Select your tomatoes. Pick tomatoes that are firm, yet not hard. Avoid tomatoes with bug spots, bruises and other damage.","response":"The most logical next event after selecting your tomatoes would be to prepare them for freezing. Here is a step-by-step guide to help you freeze tomatoes successfully: Step 1: Clean the tomatoes Before freezing, it is essential to clean your tomatoes thoroughly to remove any dirt, bacteria, or residue. Gently wash the tomatoes under running water and use a soft cloth or vegetable brush if necessary. After washing, dry them completely with a clean towel or paper towel to remove excess moisture. Step 2: Blanch the tomatoes (optional) Blanching is the process of boiling tomatoes for a short period followed by an immediate transfer to an ice-water bath. This step helps in making it easier to peel the skin off once they are frozen. To blanch tomatoes, follow the steps below: 1. Bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil. 2. Cut a small \\"X\\" at the bottom of each tomato using a sharp knife. This will facilitate the peeling process after blanching. 3. Place the tomatoes in the boiling water for 30-60 seconds or until the skin starts to loosen. 4. Use a slotted spoon to quickly transfer the tomatoes to an ice water bath to halt the cooking process. 5. Once cooled, gently peel the skin off the tomatoes. If you prefer to leave the skin on, you can skip the blanching process. Step 3: Remove stems and core the tomatoes Using a small, sharp knife, carefully cut out the stem and core from the top of each tomato. This step ensures the removal of the tough and undesirable portions of the tomato. Step 4: Cut the tomatoes (optional) Depending on your preference and intended use, you can choose to freeze the tomatoes whole, halved, quartered, or chopped. Cut the tomatoes in the desired size and shape, and make sure to remove any excess seeds and juice. If you plan on using the tomatoes primarily for sauces or stews, you may consider crushing or pureeing them. Step 5: Arrange tomatoes on a baking sheet To prevent the tomatoes from sticking together when frozen, spread them out on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat in a single layer. Make sure the tomatoes are not touching to allow for even freezing. Step 6: Pre-freeze the tomatoes Place the baking sheet with tomatoes in the freezer for a few hours or until they are firm and solid. This process is known as flash freezing and helps in maintaining the quality and texture of tomatoes when defrosting. Step 7: Transfer to airtight containers or freezer bags Once the tomatoes have been pre-frozen, transfer them to airtight containers or heavy-duty freezer bags. Label the bags with the date, type of tomato, and any other relevant information. Ensure you squeeze out any excess air to prevent freezer burn and to save space. Step 8: Store in the freezer Place the airtight containers or freezer bags in the freezer. Frozen tomatoes can be stored for up to six months to a year, although it is recommended to use them within six months for optimal quality and flavor. Now your tomatoes are ready to be frozen and used in a variety of dishes in the future. Remember, when defrosting and using the tomatoes, they may no longer have the firm texture that they had before freezing. Thus, frozen tomatoes are best used in cooked dishes such as sauces, stews, soups, or casseroles."},{"question":"Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: The accident at Lake Sherwood was in our backyard.

Most historians describe the contacts between the Mongol Empire and the Western Europeans as a series of attempts, missed opportunities, and failed negotiations. Christopher Atwood, in the 2004 Encyclopedia of Mongolia and the Mongol Empire, summed up the relations between Western Europe and the Mongols: \\"Despite numerous envoys and the obvious logic of an alliance against mutual enemies, the papacy and the Crusaders never achieved the often-proposed alliance against Islam.\\"A few other historians argue there was an actual alliance, but do not agree on the details: Jean Richard wrote that an alliance began around 1263. Reuven Amitai stated that the closest thing to actual Mongol-Frankish military coordination was when Prince Edward of England attempted to coordinate activities with Abaga in 1271. Amitai also mentioned the other attempts towards cooperation, but said, \\"In none of these episodes, however, can we speak of Mongols and troops from the Frankish West being on the Syrian mainland at the same time.\\" Timothy May described the alliance as having its peak at the Council of Lyon in 1274, but that it began to unravel in 1275 with the death of Bohemond, and May too admitted that the forces never engaged in joint operations. Alain Demurger, in his own book The Last Templar, said that an alliance was not sealed until 1300.There also continues to be debate about whether or not an alliance would have been a wise idea, and whether the Crusaders at that point in history were even relevant to the Persian-Mongol conflict. The 20th-century historian Glenn Burger said, \\"The refusal of the Latin Christian states in the area to follow Hethum's example and adapt to changing conditions by allying themselves with the new Mongol empire must stand as one of the saddest of the many failures of Outremer.\\" This was similar to the view of Steven Runciman, who argued, \\"Had the Mongol alliance been achieved and honestly implemented by the West, the existence of Outremer would almost certainly have been prolonged.

Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning?","response":"When patching a hole in drywall, you need to mud and tape the seams to make the wall smooth and strong again. Let me explain it in a simple way like I am talking to a five-year-old: 1. First, you need some mud, which is like thick, creamy stuff that helps stick things together. You'll also need tape, which is like a special kind of paper that helps cover the seams. 2. Start by applying the mud around the edges of the hole with a special tool called a \\"putty knife.\\" It's like a little spatula you use to spread the mud smoothly. 3. Then, you put the tape over the mud, making sure it covers the entire seam where the new piece of drywall meets the old one. This tape will help keep everything together and hide the seam. 4. Now you need to add more mud over the tape. This time, use a bigger putty knife to spread the mud so it covers a larger area and blends in with the rest of the wall. Be sure to keep it smooth! 5. Let the mud dry for some time. It might take a day to dry completely. Once it's dry, you might need to add more mud and make it smoother. 6. When the mud is completely dry, you can use a special paper called \\"sanding paper\\" to make it all nice and smooth. Then, you can paint it, and you won't even be able to see where the hole was!

Options: - dribbling - full of air - bouncing around court - punctured - round Explain why a human would choose \\"round\\" to answer the question above: A:","response":"A human would choose \\"round\\" as the correct option because this characteristic of both the basketball and rim directly contributes to the unpredictable nature of rebounds. Firstly, both the basketball and the rim are round, which leads to a complex, non-linear interaction between the two. Since basketball is not a perfect sphere and the rim is not completely smooth, the collision between the two during a shot is not an easily predictable event. The exact point and angle of impact determines the direction and speed of the rebound, leading to a multitude of possible outcomes. Secondly, the round shape of the basketball causes it to bounce off in different directions when it hits the rim or the backboard. This is due to the distribution of forces upon impact. If you think of a round ball hitting the round rim, it's easy to imagine the numerous possible angles of deflection. In contrast, if either the ball or the rim was a different shape, let's say square for instance, the rebounding paths would be far more predictable and limited. Moreover, the rotation of the ball as it is shot, which adds a significant degree of unpredictability, can also be attributed to its roundness. If a spinning ball hits the rim, it’s going to rebound in a different direction than a ball that hits the rim without spin. The exact effect of the spin is highly dependent on the precise angle and speed of the ball at the moment it hits the rim. Next, the roundness of both the rim and the ball also make the physical calculations regarding rebounds highly complex. Factors such as the angle of the shot, the speed of the ball, its rotation, the exact point of impact on the rim, and even environmental conditions like air pressure and humidity, all influence the trajectory and final resting place of the rebound. This makes every rebound unique and hard to predict, because there are an almost infinite number of variable combinations during each shot at the rim. In conclusion, rebounds in basketball are unpredictable primarily because of the round characteristic of both the ball and the rim, which create a complicated and unique series of physical interactions during every shot. None of the other options listed ('dribbling', 'full of air', 'bouncing around court', 'punctured') directly influence the unpredictability of rebounds in the same fundamental way as the 'round' shape of the ball and rim."},{"question":"Stream of consciousness rationale: The relevant information is: The third and final film in the trilogy, titled Gojira: Hoshi wo Kū Mono (GODZILLA-星 を 喰う 者), translation vary from Godzilla: Planet Eater to Godzilla: Eater of Stars, is scheduled to be released in November 2018.

The pricey prostitute claims in her new tell-all tome that prosecutors forced her to continue to turn tricks after she agreed to wear a wire to help snare “Hockey Mom Madam” Anna Gristina in 2008. “They wanted me to keep breaking the law so they could get more information,” writes Woodard, 37, who also detailed her rough sex-for-hire with disgraced ex-Gov. Eliot Spitzer. “They encouraged me to keep working for Anna as a call girl,” she writes of her covert gig. “It was like sex slavery at the behest of the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office. “The ADA told me to work in order to garner information for him and then turn over to his office the money and any gifts that clients gave me. I actually did this,” she writes. “Technically, this ADA was my pimp.” The Post first revealed steamy details of Woodard’s book, “Call Girl Confidential,’’ written as Rebecca Kade, including claims she serviced a violent Spitzer, who grabbed her by the throat and choked her. While servicing Spitzer, Woodard was working for madam Kristin Davis. The DA’s office approached Woodard to go undercover after Davis was busted in 2008 and Woodard had already begun working for Gristina, who had sexy glamour shots taken of her and other girls to entice high-rolling johns. Woodard does not name the ADA, who was working under former DA Robert Morgenthau when the secret probe was launched, but gave several clues to his identity. Sources with knowledge of the investigation confirmed to The Post that she is referring to former ADA Mark Crooks, who worked the Official Corruption Unit under Morgenthau and his successor, Cy Vance, until taking a job as an assistant federal prosecutor in Maryland. “I highly doubt District Attorney Morgenthau was aware of the ADA’s shenanigans,” Woodard writes. “God knows if somebody pocketed the money [earned through the prostitution]. [And] this cowboy still has a job in law enforcement, in another state, at an even higher level” as “an assistant US attorney.” A spokesman for the Manhattan DA’s office declined comment. Crooks did not return messages left at his Maryland home. Woodard’s book paints her DA handlers as bumbling fools when it came to surveillance. At one point, Woodard was being prepped to record Gristina’s “money man,” accountant Jonas Gayer, during a meeting at his East Side apartment, and prosecutors wanted to run the wire around her waist and up her chest. “ ‘Are you kidding me?’ I nearly screamed,” Woodward writes. “ ‘It’s not going to work to wire my body, because the very first thing he’s going to do is feel me up.’ ” Prosecutors wound up buying her a 1,000 Chanel bag to hide the wiretap transmitter. Woodard — who claims she was raking in as much as 24,000 for some jobs — says she didn’t tell prosecutors about all her gigs. “Obviously, if I did this with every client I saw, I would have been broke, so I didn’t tell him about everybody,” she writes. After one particularly close call while wearing a wire to record Gristina and suspecting the madam was on to her, Woodward writes that she wanted out. “The ADA stared at me, and his face was turning red,” Woodard recounts. “He stormed out of the room . . . I never heard from him again.” Woodward finally landed a public defender, former prosecutor Seema Iyer, who was “flabbergasted” to hear how the ADA acted, Woodard claims. “[Iyer] made big trouble and said I could bring a lawsuit against the city,’’ she writes. But all of Woodard’s undercover work was for naught, she says. After the ADA left the office and another took over the case, “The new ADA said that all the work I did under the first ADA was thrown out because it would be inadmissable in court.” She writes that she was asked again to wear a wire, with prosecutors saying they’d arrest her for prostitution if she didn’t. “It was blackmail,” she writes. “I felt like he was trying to intimidate me into going back to work for them under these threats.’’ In 2011, she agreed to meet with another ADA, Gristina prosecutor Charlie Linehan, just “to talk,’’ she says. Linehan asked Woodard to wear a wire to help snare a rich financier who “had once asked me to procure a young boy for him,” Woodard writes. The man was “high-profile on Wall Street, in Davos, on Paternoster Square [and] had an image to protect in Manhattan and the Hamptons.’’ Linehan pressed her to threaten him that she’d “go to the media with the story that he got a b—job from an 11-year-old kid.” Woodard ambushed the man in his workplace lobby — but couldn’t get him to say anything damning. Additional reporting by Laura Italiano What was this article about?","response":"The article is about a high-end prostitute, Rebecca Woodard, who claims that the Manhattan District Attorney's Office forced her to continue working in the sex trade after she agreed to wear a wire to help catch Anna Gristina, dubbed the \\"Hockey Mom Madam\\", in 2008. In her tell-all book, \\"Call Girl Confidential\\", Woodard details her experiences with well-known clients such as former New York Governor Eliot Spitzer and her undercover work for the DA's office. She alleges that the Assistant District Attorney (ADA) made her continue engaging in illegal activities to gather more information for their investigation, essentially acting as her pimp. Among other instances, Woodard recounts instances of incompetence and intimidation from the ADA, who would later leave the office, leading to all her undercover work being deemed inadmissible in court."},{"question":"Herb není příklad pro děti.

For your first question, studying in New Zealand and working in Australia at the same time would be tough, because they are two different countries. It's like trying to be in your classroom and the playground at the same time – kind of impossible, right? You need special permission, like visas, to study and work in two different countries, and even if you got those, the countries are still too far apart to travel between every day. For your second question, it's about how people were treated a long time ago in a far away place called Saudi Arabia. This can be hard to explain because it's complicated, and the treatment of Jews and Christians there has changed over time. It's like treating a friend – sometimes you might share your toys with them and sometimes you might not. But historically, there have been times when they were not treated as well as we would hope. Given these answers, each question is very different if we choose options 'no' and 'yes' respectively. So, the answer to your question whether the answers would be the same is 'no.'

Pick your answer from: A. no. B. yes. Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","response":"A single answer ('A. no' or 'B. yes') cannot adequately address the two distinct questions presented, as each requires a different and detailed response. Therefore, the answer to whether these two questions would have the same answer is no. Below I provide detailed answers to each question. Question 1: Baby and honey? The terms \\"baby\\" and \\"honey\\" can both be used as terms of endearment, and their meanings are context-dependent. In this context: \\"Baby\\" typically refers to a very young child, usually a human infant (less than a year old). The term can also be used to describe the offspring of certain animals, usually mammals, such as puppies, kittens, or calves. \\"Honey\\" is a sweet food substance made by bees from the nectar of flowers. Bees store honey in a network of hexagonal beeswax cells called a honeycomb. Humans have harvested honey for thousands of years, as it is a natural sweetener and has other uses, such as in baking, cooking, and even as a natural remedy for certain ailments. In the context of terms of endearment, both \\"baby\\" and \\"honey\\" are often used to express affection or love towards a romantic partner or a very close friend or family member. These terms are usually used informally in conversation and are meant to convey warmth and closeness. Question 2: I want to study for about 8 to 10 hours, but my mind tells me to play. What to do, and it's my class 10th ICSE board examination? Balancing study and play during the exam preparation period is important for maintaining your mental well-being and academic success. Here are some tips to help you manage your time and focus effectively: 1. Create a study schedule: Set specific study hours each day and allocate time for each subject. Break down the time into smaller study intervals (e.g., 1-hour slots) and assign achievable goals for each interval. Include breaks and recreational activities in your schedule to avoid burnout. 2. Prioritize subjects: Identify areas or subjects where you need extra focus and allocate more time to cover those topics. Start with difficult topics and progress to easier ones to gain momentum and confidence. 3. Use a timer: Use a timer to help you stay on track with your study intervals. When the timer goes off, switch to a short break or a brief period of play, exercise, or relaxation. This will help refresh and reset your mind for the next study session. 4. Minimize distractions: Turn off or silence electronic devices that might distract you. Find a quiet and comfortable study space, and let your friends and family know when you are studying so they can help you stay focused. 5. Set playtime limits: Enjoy recreational activities in moderation by setting time limits. Engaging in physical or creative activities can actually help relieve stress and improve your cognitive abilities, but remember to stick to your planned schedule. 6. Stay organized: Keep your study materials and notes organized to facilitate effective learning. Maintain a daily or weekly to-do list to help you keep track of your progress. 7. Take care of yourself: Prioritize your physical and mental well-being by getting enough sleep, eating nutritious meals, and engaging in physical activity regularly. 8. Seek support: Reach out to classmates, teachers, or tutors for study assistance or encouragement when needed. This will help expand your knowledge and improve your learning experience. By incorporating these tips, you can strike a balance between study and play while ensuring that you give your best effort to your class 10th ICSE board examination."},{"question":"Consider the question.

Answer:","response":"The Slashdot Effect, often referred to as \\"slashdotting,\\" is a phenomenon that occurs when a highly popular website, such as Slashdot, links to a smaller or less-known website. This action results in a sudden and massive increase in traffic to the smaller website. The subsequent surge in visitors can cause the site to become slow, unresponsive, or even crash due to the unforeseen load on its servers. The term \\"Slashdot Effect\\" was coined after Slashdot, a technology-driven news website that gained prominence in the late 90s, and early 2000s for featuring and discussing various topics related to science, technology, and programming. Although the term is linked to Slashdot, similar effects have been observed with traffic surges resulting from links on other popular websites or metablogs. One such website is Fark, a community-driven news aggregator that focuses on offering its members a daily collection of news articles, current events, and other interesting content from various websites across the internet. Fark was created by Drew Curtis in 1999. This online platform curates the news submitted by its users and then allows the community to engage in discussions, share thoughts, and post comments on the featured content. Fark has a dedicated user base, with many members visiting the site on a daily basis to keep up to date with the latest happenings and join in on the active conversations. Fark's popularity has made it a prime candidate for causing traffic surges to smaller websites when it links to them. When this happens, the website receiving the surge in traffic may experience the same consequences observed in the Slashdot Effect, such as slow loading times or potential server crashes. In conclusion, the Slashdot Effect, or \\"slashdotting,\\" is a phenomenon where a smaller website experiences a significant increase in traffic after being linked by a popular site like Slashdot or Fark. Fark, a community-driven news aggregator that allows members to discuss various news articles and other items of interest, was created by Drew Curtis in 1999. Similar to Slashdot, Fark's popularity can lead to a significant effect on smaller websites when they are linked, causing challenges for those sites in handling the unexpected influx of visitors."},{"question":"Read the text and determine if the sentence is true: International Data Group, Inc.

Washington, D.C., formally the District of Columbia and commonly referred to as Washington or D.C., is the capital of the United States. Founded after the American Revolution as the seat of government of the newly independent country, Washington was named after George Washington, the first President of the United States and a Founding Father. As the seat of the United States federal government and several international organizations, Washington is an important world political capital. The city is also one of the most visited cities in the world, with more than 20 million tourists annually.The signing of the Residence Act on July 16, 1790, approved the creation of a capital district located along the Potomac River on the country's East Coast. The U.S. Constitution provided for a federal district under the exclusive jurisdiction of the U.S. Congress, and the District is therefore not a part of any state. The states of Maryland and Virginia each donated land to form the federal district, which included the pre-existing settlements of Georgetown and Alexandria. The City of Washington was founded in 1791 to serve as the new national capital. In 1846, Congress returned the land originally ceded by Virginia; in 1871, it created a single municipal government for the remaining portion of the District. Washington had an estimated population of 702,455 as of July 2018, making it the 20th most populous city in the United States. Commuters from the surrounding Maryland and Virginia suburbs raise the city's daytime population to more than one million during the workweek. Washington's metropolitan area, the country's sixth largest, had a 2017 estimated population of 6.2 million residents.All three branches of the U.S. federal government are centered in the District: Congress (legislative), president (executive), and the U.S. Supreme Court (judicial). Washington is home to many national monuments, and museums, primarily situated on or around the National Mall. The city hosts 177 foreign embassies as well as the headquarters...

The hydrogen bonds in liquid water constantly break and reform as the water molecules tumble past one another. As water cools, its molecular motion slows and the molecules move gradually closer to one another. The density of any liquid increases as its temperature decreases. For most liquids, this continues as the liquid freezes and the solid state is denser than the liquid state. However, water behaves differently. It actually reaches its highest density at about 4°C.

The massive text, compiled in the 1200s by friar Vincent of Beauvais and translated into French in the 14th century by Jean de Vignay, attempts to compile all of world history from creation to the present into a single source. “If our twenty-first-century way of understanding everything is to put it on the Internet,” she says, “the medieval way of understanding was to create big encyclopedic texts that try to encompass all of human history and biblical history in an organized way.” Larisa, who recently completed her PhD at the University of Pennsylvania with a focus on 15th-century French manuscript culture, is focusing on the Getty volumes’ unique program of illuminations. The French translation of the Miroir historial exists in some 40 known copies, and while the text remains mostly unchanged from copy to copy, the illuminations vary dramatically, both in how scenes are depicted and in which episodes artists choose to depict. Larisa has decided to focus on the evolution of depictions of India and its inhabitants across these various copies, because the Getty copy, which dates to 1475, contains images that are different from earlier illuminated versions. While other copies don’t dedicate more than one or two illustrations to India, the Getty copy has several that draw upon the medieval tradition of the “monstrous peoples” as well as knowledge of geography, materials, and customs newly gained through trade. This work ties into broader scholarly efforts to shed light on globalization in the Middle Ages. “Scholars of medieval art have generally thought of Western Europe as the center and non-European places as the periphery. There has now been a revision of that view,” says Larisa. “These manuscripts provide an interesting glimpse into how late-medieval Europeans made sense of their world, including...

It's a sport fueled by passion, discipline, and a burning desire to be the best. For some athletes, success is often measured by wins and losses, but for one man - Carlos Condit - it goes beyond that. The \\"Natural Born Killer\\" has made an indelible mark on the MMA landscape with his relentless fighting style and unyielding spirit. In this article, we will explore Condit's unique outlook on the sport and his remarkable journey thus far. Born on April 26, 1984, in Albuquerque, New Mexico, Carlos Condit was introduced to MMA at a young age. His father, Brian, was a well-respected figure in the combat sports community and served as a guiding force in his son's development. Learning from various martial arts styles, including kickboxing, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, and wrestling, Condit cultivated a diverse skill set that would come to define his career. Although his journey to professional fighting began in 2002, it wasn't until his performance in the now-defunct World Extreme Cagefighting (WEC) that he truly made a name for himself. Possessing incredible striking, submission skills, and impressive takedown defense, Condit quickly became a fan favorite. This led him to capture the WEC Welterweight Championship in 2007 - a victory that would propel him into the larger UFC organization. Within the UFC, Condit continued to impress, etching his name in the annals of the promotion's history with jaw-dropping performances against the likes of Martin Kampmann, Dan Hardy, and Dong Hyun Kim. In one of the most memorable fights of his career, Condit defeated Nick Diaz for the interim UFC Welterweight Championship in 2012. Despite his success, it was during this time that Condit's philosophy on the sport truly took form. \\"I started to realize that victories and losses were just moments in time,\\" Condit explains. \\"Yes, they define your career in some ways, but they don't have to define your self-worth as a competitor or as a person.\\" This outlook was tested when the Albuquerque native faced a series of setbacks in the form of injuries and closely contested losses. However, instead of allowing these adversities to deter him, Condit channeled them as motivation and gained invaluable insights about himself and the sport he loves. \\"I learned that you can't get too attached to the outcome,\\" he says. \\"It's the journey and the process that truly matter. You have to see the bigger picture and continuously work on evolving yourself - both inside and outside the cage.\\" This mentality has allowed Condit to approach his fights with a different perspective - one that focuses on the enjoyment, growth, and learning that comes from competition. Consequently, it has also endearingly solidified him as a revered figure within the MMA community. As Condit enters the twilight of his career, his long-standing relationship with the sport has reaped a wealth of personal growth, as well as legions of loyal fans. An embodiment of resilience and determination, the Natural Born Killer has left an undeniable impact on the hearts and minds of those who have followed his remarkable journey. In the end, Carlos Condit's lasting legacy in MMA will not solely be based on the number of wins or losses on his record. What will endure is the undeniable spirit, the passion for the sport, and the unwavering perseverance he displayed throughout his iconic career. And, in doing so, he has beautifully demonstrated that, sometimes, it's not all about winning or losing."},{"question":"The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who uses the alias Rajni Singh? , can you please find it? Consulting detective Sherlock Holmes fakes his own death in Scotland in order to investigate a number of bizarre apparent suicides that he is convinced are part of an elaborate plot by \\"a female Moriarty\\". Returning to his assistant Watson in secret, Holmes notes that all the victims were wealthy gamblers, so disguised as \\"Rajni Singh\\", a distinguished Indian officer, he stalks London's gaming clubs. It is not long before he encounters the villain of the piece, Adrea Spedding. Holmes discovers that she seeks out men short of money, persuades them to pawn their life insurance policies with her accomplices, then kills them. Holmes sets himself up as her next victim, discovering that she uses the deadly spider, Lycosa Carnivora, whose venom causes such excruciating pain that the victims kill themselves. Holmes also finds the footprint of a child nearby. Searching for evidence Holmes and Watson visit eminent arachnologist Matthew Ordway, who may have supplied the deadly creatures. Holmes soon realizes that the man he is speaking to is an impostor, but the villain makes his escape. Searching the premises, Holmes finds the corpse of the real Ordway, as well as his journals, which allude to something or someone from Central Africa immune to the spider venom. This baffles Holmes until he finds the model skeleton of a child. However, Dr. Watson points out that the relation of the skull and the circumference of the chest prove it is not a child, and Holmes deduces that the Central African thing described in the journal is a pygmy. Holmes and Watson continue their investigations at a nearby fairground, where Holmes allows himself to fall into the clutches of Spedding and her gang. Bound and gagged, Holmes is tied behind a moving target in a shooting gallery, at which Lestrade and Watson take pot shots with a .22 rifle.

A solitary figure walks down the street holding an umbrella. We enter the Wax Museum with various tableaux of crimes of the past, and then enter the workshop where Prof. Henry Jarrod (Vincent Price) is working on a sculpture. His business partner, Matthew Burke (Roy Roberts) enters and walks partially upstairs when he is hailed by Jarrod. He tells Jarrod he's there to study the account books. They have a philosophical difference between their approaches to business. Jarrod proposes a buyout arrangement, and Burke either eager or desperate for the money agrees in principle. A potential investor is scheduled to see Jarrod that very evening.Bruce Allison (Phillip Tonge) and Sidney Wallace (Paul Cavanagh) arrive and are given a brief tour of the wax museum. Wallace is impressed, but Jarrod explains that he's never satisfied with certain aspects of the finished products. Wallace explains he's going to Egypt for three months, so no decision on investment can take place prior to his return. Allison and Wallace depart. Burke was eavesdropping from the upstairs room and heard everything. He is impatient for a financial settlement and proposes an insurance fire. The place is insured for 25,000--12,500 each.

He returns to the workroom and continues his fight with the now revived Jarrod. Jarrod works desperately with buckets of water to douse the fire, but it is a losing battle. He is knocked out again by Burke and left... My question: Who is Henry Jarrod's business partner?

Consumers are bombarded with many ads every day. When writing a product description, you have a limited amount of time to get a consumer's attention. Use that time wisely. It is essential that you lead with a statement or question that grabs the reader's attention. Try appealing to the senses right away. In the coffee example, you could say something like, \\"Wake up in the morning to the subtle scent of rich and creamy vanilla.\\" You can also ask your readers to imagine. For example, say something like, \\"Imagine there was a coffee that tasted as good as your favorite desserts.\\" You can also try to appeal to the reader's identity initially. Try something like, \\"When you're drinking a cup of coffee, do you still get that same level of joy you felt when you started to drink coffee?\\" Tone is important when it comes to product descriptions. Different readers will respond to different tones. As you write, make sure you adopt a tone appropriate for the audience at hand. Think about your company's brand. Are you trying to come off as cheeky, fun, and a little sarcastic to appeal to a certain audience? Or are you a more serious business trying to attract customers who are also quite serious? The tone of any coffee advertisement could be one of lighthearted enjoyment, describing the pleasure or life improvement brought by the flavor and caffeine in the coffee. However, a more serious coffee company could focus on bean quality, origin, having a high caffeine content, or being ready quickly for the busy professional. Remember, you want to cover the product as fast as you can. Readers may scroll by if a product is long and wordy. Strive for a few brief and vivid sentences over lengthy descriptions. Things like bullet points can be particularly helpful, if you're able to use them. For example, instead of saying, \\"Our coffee has a smooth, creamy vanilla flavor that will make your house smell like a birthday party\\" you could break down these sentiments into a series of bullet points: \\"Silky smooth vanilla flavor!\\", \\"Fills your house with the scent of a birthday party!\\", \\"Instant relaxation first thing in the morning!\\" Many people read ads on a mobile phone these days. You want to make sure the bulk of your product description, if not all of it, will show up on a mobile phone screen. Short and simple is more memorable than long and complicated. You should also keep images in mind. If this description is being posted alongside an image, the image will take up space on the phone's screen as well. Do not just account for the text.","response":"Create captivating product descriptions by using attention-grabbing statements, appealing to senses and reader identity, adopting the appropriate tone, and keeping descriptions concise and mobile-friendly."},{"question":"Add punctuation to the following sentence: But if you take away my voice said the little mermaid what is left for me","response":"But, if you take away my voice, said the little mermaid, what is left for me?"},{"question":"Given the following reasoning and answer, what was the question?

Below is a detailed explanation of each option: (i) I would have gotten there quicker: If the sign was pointing in the correct direction and following it led to a shorter or faster route than the one you initially took, you may have reached Bangalore sooner than you did. In this case, the sign would have indicated an alternative route that bypassed heavy traffic or took a more direct path. (ii) I would have gotten lost: If the sign was incorrect or misleading, you might have ended up taking the wrong route that led you away from Bangalore. In such a situation, you would have to figure out how to get back on track, which might involve stopping to ask for directions, using a GPS or map, or even retracing your steps to get back to the original route you were on. This option could result in spending more time and energy trying to find your way to Bangalore. (iii) None of the above choices: This possibility suggests that following the sign would not have significantly changed your travel experience or final destination. It might mean that the sign was pointing to a route that was roughly equivalent in terms of travel time and distance as the one you took. In this case, you would still have reached Bangalore, but the journey would not have been notably better or worse than the one you experienced. (iv) I would have ended up in Mysore: This option implies that the sign was not only misleading but would have taken you back to where you had started, which was Mysore. In this scenario, following the sign would have led you in a circle or down a route that required some backtracking. This could be especially frustrating as you would have to find another way to get to Bangalore and spend more time and effort than initially intended. Ultimately, the outcome of following the sign depends on the accuracy of the sign and the specifics of the situation.

The hecklers then marched out of the theater in Hamilton as the 77-year-old comedian asked his audience not to react. Cosby is facing growing sexual assault allegations from more than 15 women, with some claims dating back decades. He has denied the allegations through his lawyer, has never been charged and has never publicly spoken of them publicly. The walk-out during Friday's show came a day after a man at Cosby's performance in London, Ontario, called the comedian 'a rapist'. Scroll down for video.

Ticket-holders watch as protesters demonstrate outside of the Hamilton Place Theatre. Protesters outside the Hamilton Place where comedian Bill Cosby is performing in Hamilton, Ontario. Warning: A sign posted outside of the Hamilton Place Theatre ahead ofBill Cosby's show. Scores of demonstrators brave the cold to protest against a show by Bill Cosby on Friday night. It also took place just minutes after Cosby acknowledged the controversy that has followed him on the tour, with protesters camping outside the venues with sandwich boards. 'Whatever happens here tonight if there's some sort of outburst, we just have to remain calm and things will be taken care of. It oughtn't last that long,' he told the audience. 'I want to thank all of you here tonight because you stayed with what you believed in.' An announcement at the start of the show warned the audience there might be attempts to disrupt the show and urged ticket holders to remain calm until the matter 'is resolved'. Security at the venue was tight — bags were searched and police officers and private security guards were posted along the aisles of the theatre. The three shows in Canada were Cosby's first since November when he had a string of performances canceled over the accusations. Many protesters took aim at the venues that agreed to let Cosby perform in light of the scandal plaguing him. Touch down: Bill Cosby gets off his private jet and arrives in Hamilton, Canada, on Friday afternoon. Cold arrival: Cosby landed in Hamilton a few hours before the performance, which was his last of three. During a rare moment in Thursday night's show at the same venue, Cosby alluded to his sexual assault scandal. As he saw a woman getting up from the front row of the theater, Cosby asked where she was going. She said she was getting a drink and politely asked if he wanted her to bring anything back for him, according to National Post reporter Richard Warnica who attended the event. He said no, that he had his own bottle of water and then said 'You have to be careful drinking around me.' The statement refers to a theme in several of his accusers' stories - that he drugged their drinks before raping them. Warnica says the crowd erupted in loud gasps, but that their shock soon turned to support as they laughed and gave a round of applause for the comment. Thursday night's show was the second in a three-stop comedy tour of Canada. Both nights have been the subject of protests outside the venues, as ticket-holders were heckled by demonstrators holding signs like 'rape is not joke'. Both of Cosby's show s in Canada have been the subject of protests this week. Above, some of the demonstrators outside of his show Thursday night. Before the show started, Warnica tweeted a photo of a piece of paper handed out to those walking into venue Budweiser Gardens. The slip of paper warns 'disruptive behavior will not be tolerated and will result in removal, possible legal action and banning from the venue'. One man was kicked out of Thursday night's event for yelling 'you are a rapist'. Dale Carruthers, a journalist who tried to film the man being escorted out by security, was also kicked out. Cosby's publicist later confirmed the heckler in a statement, describing the situation as 'one outburst' in a crowd of 'loyal, patient and courageous' fans. The statement ends with Cosby saying 'I'm far from finished'. Warnica says that while the venue was not full, it was far from empty and the crowd seemed to enjoy Cosby's performance. He received a standing ovation for a second night in a row. Heckled: Canadians attending both events in Kitchener and London have been heckled by the crowds demonstrating outside the event.

Usually, the parties decide whether to have the case decided by a judge or jury. In some cases, you may want to ask for a judge and not request a jury.If you are representing yourself, a trial before a judge is likely to be more informal, and you will not have to worry about the jury’s impression of you in the courtroom. You should ask for a jury if your case has “emotional appeal” and you think the jury may be sympathetic to your cause. However, keep in mind that this can backfire if someone on the jury doesn’t like you. Keep in mind that the trial will have all of the same “parts,” regardless of whether you are in front of a judge or a jury. The “opening statement” is a type of speech given at the start of trial. It is your first opportunity to introduce yourself and your case. If you filed the lawsuit (and therefore are the plaintiff), you will give your opening statement first, followed by the defendant. In your opening statement, you should give an overview of what your case is about and what your evidence will prove. You should begin proving your case by telling the jury what evidence is in your favor and what happened to you. Keep in mind that you cannot state your own opinions in an opening statement, and if you do so you could be reprimanded by the judge. During the presentation of the case, you will call your own witnesses, and “examine” them (this is called direct examination). You will also have the opportunity to ask questions of your opponent’s witnesses (this is called cross examination). To prepare for calling and examining your witnesses, make sure that they all agree to be present at the trial. For direct examination, you should prepare a notebook with an outline of what you want to ask the witnesses. Ask questions that will encourage the witnesses to talk, instead of “yes” and “no” questions. To get comfortable with questioning witnesses, you can meet with them to practice beforehand. For cross examination, realize that you probably won’t get that much useful information, and limit or completely forgo examining the opposing witnesses. Only cross examine the opposing witnesses if you can get evidence from them that supports your version of events or discredits their trustworthiness as a witness. Always be kind and polite to any witnesses, even during cross examination. Arguing with or badgering a witness (even an opposing witness) looks bad to the jury, and could get you in trouble with the judge. A closing argument is delivered at the end of a trial, after all of the evidence has been presented and all witnesses have been called. A closing argument is the last chance you will have to address the judge or the jury. Closing arguments are usually between 10 and 20 minutes, but, if the case is extremely complicated, they can be much longer, in some cases up to one hour. Unlike an opening statement, which can be written well in advance of the trial, a closing argument will be based on the events of the trial, so to prepare an effective closing argument, make sure that you take notes throughout the trial. To see in-depth information about preparing a closing argument, visit wikiHow’s guide on writing a closing argument. Even after the trial has ended, the losing party can appeal the loss to a higher court. An appeal is a request to a higher court to review and overturn the decision of a lower court. In federal court, appeals are heard by the United States Court of Appeals. In state court systems, the appeals courts go by various names. If you think you might want to appeal the decision in your case, make sure you understand the following: How appeals are decided: generally, the courts of appeal do not want to tell the trial judge that he made the wrong decision, or “overrule” that decision. Therefore, an appeals court will usually only overturn the decision of a lower court if the lower court made a significant error of law.What a “significant error of law” is will be completely different depending on each particular case. What evidence you can present: The courts of appeals do not look at any new evidence that may have been discovered after the case was decided (either by the judge or the jury). Instead, the court will look at the documents from the case, a “brief” by both parties discussing why each one believes that they have the correct view, and in some cases, will listen to both parties argue your case in front of the court (this is referred to as “oral argument). The consequences of an unsuccessful appeal: if a party unsuccessfully appeal the court’s order, the higher court will “affirm” the lower court’s ruling (or the jury’s), and the current judgment will stand.

What is a summary of what this article is about?","response":"This article is all about trials and the different things that can happen during them. It shares that a trial can be decided by either a judge or a jury, and the people involved will usually choose which one. It's sometimes better to have a judge decide if you're representing yourself because it can be less formal, and you won't have to worry about what a jury thinks of you. But a jury might be better if your case is emotional and you think they might feel sympathy for you. The article also explains what an \\"opening statement\\" is. It's a kind of speech given at the start of the trial to explain what the case is about and what the evidence will show. After this, both sides get to ask questions to witnesses to prove their point. Preparation and respect towards witnesses is very important. A \\"closing argument\\" is another speech made once all the evidence has been shown and all the witnesses have talked. It's the last chance to convince the judge or jury. Lastly, the article talks about appeals. After a trial, the person who loses can ask a higher court to look at the case again. But the article warns that this can be hard because the higher court usually only changes the decision if a big mistake was made. And, they don't look at any new evidence but just the documents from the case. If the appeal doesn't work, then the original decision stands."},{"question":"Sentence from a movie review: lush and beautifully photographed ( somebody suggested the stills might make a nice coffee table book ) , but Select your answer: was the movie seen positively or negatively based on the preceding review?

NBC 7's Steven Luke has the details. (Published Wednesday, July 1, 2015) Five months after showing up in a San Diego-area emergency room without any recollection of her name, age, family, or friends, a woman who calls herself “Sam” has finally rediscovered who she is as she continues to battle cancer. Ashley Manetta, 53, never married and has sisters in Colorado and Maryland. She was born in Pennsylvania, lived in Flagstaff, Arizona, and several years ago found her way to Southern California, where she lived in La Jolla, Vista, and Carlsbad. The woman’s plight captured attention worldwide after NBC 7's post went viral with a Facebook reach of 21.2 million people as of Wednesday afternoon. Facebook users shared the post nearly 200,000 times, leading to thousands of tips and suggestions. Manetta’s nephew watched the NBC 7 story online and immediately called his mom to tell her about the mystery woman: Aunt Ashley. The FBI took the tip to Manetta and her friend Debbie Rough, her nurse from Tri City Medical Center in Oceanside, who championed the initial search for relatives. The phone call led to tears and details of her forgotten past. “It was extremely emotional. We were all sobbing. They’re so sorry I had to go through what I did during this time without them,” Manetta said. The FBI did not officially confirm Manetta's identity, but investigators felt comfortable with the information they've provided to help facilitate a reunion. Manetta's family did not provide independent verification of her identity. Woman With Amnesia, Cancer Searches for Identity NBC 7's Steven Luke reports on a woman found in Carlsbad with a rare form of amnesia and Stage 3 ovarian cancer. Her story has been shared all around the world. (Published Tuesday, June 30, 2015) Carlsbad firefighters responded to an emergency call on February 1 and found her in dire shape. Her blood pressure was so low she was barely conscious. She couldn’t tell paramedics anything about herself. Doctors at Tri City Medical Center diagnosed her with ovarian cancer, telling her the antibodies from the tumor possibly caused “retrograde amnesia.\\" Carlsbad police and the FBI got involved in an effort to help identify her. They said more pressing responsibilities kept them from devoting the many hours needed to solve the case. Searches of their fingerprint database turned up empty. “He [the FBI agent] said you must be a good girl, otherwise we’d have records of you,” Manetta said. FBI agents posted Manetta’s picture and story to the Interpol website in an effort to attract global attention. She spoke with an English or Australian accent and had vivid dreams about time spent in Perth. \\"Apparently I have a long time of visiting Australia for extended trips. I’ve been going there throughout my life,” Manetta said. The family lost track of her in 2013, around the same time she showed up in Southern California and attended St. Patrick Catholic Church in Carlsbad. Mystery Woman Update: Carlsbad Woman Recalls Meeting \\"Sam\\" NBC 7's Steven Luke has new information about a mystery woman with cancer who showed up in a Carlsbad hospital, unable to remember her name or past. (Published Wednesday, July 1, 2015) The FBI said NBC 7’s Facebook post and subsequent stories generated numerous tips, which helped put the pieces of the puzzle together. Manetta plans to fly back to Maryland and live with one of her older sisters. “She was just telling me she has a four-bedroom, large house and a lovely king-size bed waiting for me.\\" Manetta thanks the millions of people around the world who watched her story and prayed and tried to help with leads and suggestions. The story has seemed almost too remarkable to be true. The FBI can’t confirm or deny the circumstances, but feels comfortable with the information they’ve provided to help facilitate a reunion. Manetta’s close friends and the nurse who championed her story call her a genuine and sweet human being. They believe she has the genuine faith in God which was the first thing she remembers feeling in the emergency room. “I had peace where there should be none and I believed He would bring me back together with people that that were family and I trusted Him,\\" she said. Ashley Manetta will need to continue with chemotherapy to treat the aggressive cancer, but with family and faith she says “she knows where she is going” and now, finally, where she came from too. ||||| Image copyright Reuters Image caption Thousands of people tried to help \\"Sam\\" solve the mystery of her identity A woman whose case sparked a social media hunt after she was found on a US street with amnesia has been identified by her family. \\"Sam\\", as she was known by thousands following her story, has been named as Ashley Menatta, 53, of California. About five months ago she was found in Carlsbad, Southern California, unwell and with no memory of who she was. Her nephew identified her from a US NBC 7 television show about her, according to NBC 7 and Sam's Facebook page. He called his mother who then alerted the authorities. NBC 7 says Ashley Menatta was born in Pennsylvania and had lived in Flagstaff, Arizona. Several years ago, she moved to Southern California where she lived in La Jolla, Vista and Carlsbad. She reportedly loved travelling and never married. Her sisters, in Colorado and Maryland, are said to have lost track of her in 2013. Ms Menatta described an \\"extremely emotional\\" reunion with her family. \\"We were all sobbing,\\" she said. \\"They're so sorry I had to go through what I did during this time without them.\\" 'Great news' Ms Menatta was found \\"barely conscious\\" by emergency services in Carlsbad in February this year. She told reporters she had been diagnosed with stage three ovarian cancer after the authorities found her, and doctors removed a tumour the size of a volleyball. Doctors told her she was likely suffering from \\"retrograde amnesia\\" - a type of memory-loss brought on during the onset of a disease. Her slight Australian accent led many people, including US authorities, to suspect she may originally have been from Australia. She also had strong memories of swimming at a beach in Perth, in Western Australia, and visiting other Australian holiday spots. Australian consular officials had offered assistance in solving her case. Her Facebook page, set up with assistance from a former nurse who got involved in the case, said prayers had been answered. \\"Well, we have some great news,\\" the post said. \\"'Sam' (Ashley is her name) and I want to thank you all who have been sharing, searching, emailing, posting, private messaging, calling, texting, twittering, NBC Channel 7 in San Diego, Australian News, England News, police, Missing Australians, Australian Missing Persons Register, FBI, interpol, and everyone else!!!! \\"We could not have done this with out all of your help!\\" ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","response":"A woman named Ashley Manetta was found in California without any memory of who she was.

On the said afternoon, European leaders had gathered at the Élysée Palace, the official residence of the President of France, for a meeting. Following a delightful lunch, they stepped outside and assembled on the stairs of the palace. The conversation that took place revolved around the concept of solidarity amongst EU member countries. The leaders, clearly aware of the challenges that they and their nations were facing, were seen exchanging thoughts and ideas on how to contribute towards fostering solidarity. This sentiment, often perceived as the glue that holds the European Union together, refers to the commitment of all the member states to act cooperatively in the interest of the common good. As Europe faces a multitude of challenges such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, migration, economic growth, and political issues, the importance of solidarity among member countries cannot be understated. These obstacles call for unified action, mutual support, and the relentless pursuit of shared benefits. In this context, the faint smiles and muted atmosphere that the leaders displayed might indicate their recognition of the complex and oftentimes conflicting interests within the member countries. The situation also highlights the political realities, as well as the need for careful diplomacy and negotiation, when finding common ground to make progress in the best interest of the entire European continent. In summary, the European leaders' gathering at the Élysée Palace reflects the ongoing efforts to strengthen solidarity among the European Union member states, as they face significant and diverse challenges.

Jacksonville, on the other hand, has decreased their usage of fossil fuels used to produce electricity to low levels due to recent policy changes enacted by their state's government. Which city, Seattle or Jacksonville, will contribute more to global warming? A:","response":"To determine which city, Seattle or Jacksonville, will contribute more to global warming, the first step is to analyze the amount and type of emissions produced by each city's electricity production. Step 1: Understand the emissions produced by each city Seattle primarily relies on burning fossil fuels, which includes emitting greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2), and other pollutants that contribute to global warming. Jacksonville, on the other hand, has implemented policies that have reduced their usage of fossil fuels, thereby reducing their emission production. Step 2: Determine the proportions of fuel sources and their impact on emissions It's essential to compare the proportion of electricity generated using fossil fuels in Seattle and Jacksonville. Depending on the percentage of clean energy sources like solar, wind, or hydroelectric in each city, their contribution to global warming may vary. For instance, if Seattle still uses a high percentage of alternative energy sources, the difference in emissions between the two cities may not be substantial. Step 3: Consider other factors that affect emissions Factoring in population size, energy consumption per capita, and economic sectors' energy demands can provide a clearer understanding of which city contributes more to global warming. Step 4: Source the data and compare emissions Utilize official data sources like the U.S. Energy Information Administration to find reliable, up-to-date energy production and emissions data for both Seattle and Jacksonville. Analyzing this information side by side should provide us with a quantifiable comparison of their contribution to global warming. Step 5: Draw a conclusion After comparing the data, we can conclude which city, Seattle or Jacksonville, contributes more to global warming based on their energy production and emission levels. Since Seattle still produces a large amount of its electricity by burning fossil fuels, while Jacksonville has significantly reduced its reliance on fossil fuels due to policy changes, it's highly likely that Seattle will contribute more to global warming than Jacksonville.

NLAP was created in 1968. A decade later, the agency used a 50,000 LSC grant to buy a building at 438 King St. in Charleston and 33,000 to buy a building at 201 King St. in Georgetown, according to Erlenborn's letter to Kaynard. In 1980, NLAP used 63,000 in LSC funds to buy property at 607 Main St. in Conway, the letter said. On Nov. 14, 2001, NLAP transferred title of the King Street building in Charleston to the Charleston County Bar Association, according to county property records. The local bar paid 5 for the building, which sits between a redeveloped office building and an antique shop. The local bar said it would maintain the building for \\"legal services to indigent residents of Charleston County and coastal South Carolina,\\" the records said. The King Street building appears to be vacant. Notices at the entrance direct visitors to the equal justice center on West Montague Avenue in North Charleston. E. Douglas Pratt-Thomas, president of the local bar, was not available for comment. Charleston County has not appraised the King Street property because it is tax-exempt. But Randall Goldman, managing partner of Patrick Properties, which owns buildings from 440 to 456 King St., said he estimates 438 King St. would sell for between 700,000 and 900,000. \\"That building, which was purchased solely with federal legal aid dollars, should be used to provide legal services for poor people in South Carolina,\\" Kleiman said.

Are Cynodon and Claytonia both species of plants? Answer:","response":"Yes, Cynodon and Claytonia are both species of plants. To provide a better understanding, let's take a closer look at each one: 1. Cynodon: Cynodon is a genus of plants belonging to the family Poaceae, which is commonly known as the grass family. This genus comprises nine species, with the most well-known one being Cynodon dactylon, commonly known as Bermuda grass or couch grass. Bermuda grass is a widespread and economically important grass species, particularly in warmer climates. It is highly adaptable and can tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions, making it an ideal choice for lawns, golf courses, and sports fields. Cynodon species are perennial grasses, meaning they live for multiple years and do not need to be replanted each season. These grasses have a creeping growth habit, spreading through both above-ground stolons and below-ground rhizomes. This helps them create a dense and carpet-like turf, which is both visually appealing and resilient to wear and tear. 2. Claytonia: Claytonia is a genus of plants belonging to the family Montiaceae, which is part of the larger group known as the order Caryophyllales. Claytonia comprises roughly 30 species, with the best-known being Claytonia perfoliata, commonly known as miner's lettuce or winter purslane. Miner's lettuce is a small, low-growing herbaceous plant native to western North America. It is often found in damp, shady areas, such as woodland understories and along stream banks. Claytonia species are annuals or perennials with fleshy, succulent leaves, and attractive flowers that are typically white, pink, or yellow. Miner's lettuce, for example, has rounded, disk-like leaves that clasp the stem, giving it a distinct appearance. The leaves and stems are edible and have a mild flavor, which has made them a popular ingredient in salads and other dishes. In conclusion, both Cynodon and Claytonia are indeed species of plants, albeit belonging to different families and having different characteristics. While Cynodon is a grass genus with species such as Bermuda grass known for their turf-forming capabilities and resilience, Claytonia is a genus of flowering plants with species like miner's lettuce known for their attractive appearance and edible qualities."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose two brothers died in 1823? from the following article ? George Frederic Watts was born in 1817, the son of a London musical instrument manufacturer. His two brothers died in 1823, and his mother in 1826, giving Watts an obsession with death throughout his life. Watts was apprenticed as a sculptor at the age of 10, and by his mid-teens was proficient enough as an artist to be earning a living as a portrait painter. At the age of 18 he gained admission to the Royal Academy schools, although he disliked their methods and his attendance was intermittent. From 1837, Watts was successful enough to devote himself full-time to painting.In 1843 Watts travelled to Italy where he remained for four years. On his return to London he suffered from melancholia, and painted many notably gloomy works. His skills were widely celebrated, and in 1856 he decided to devote himself to portrait painting. His portraits were extremely highly regarded, and in 1867 he was elected to the Royal Academy, at the time the highest honour available to an artist, although he rapidly became disillusioned with its culture. From 1870 onwards he became widely renowned as a painter of allegorical and mythical subjects; by this time, he was one of the most highly regarded artists in the world.

The second night of filming involved us getting establishing shots of the location. The third night of filming involved us mainly shooting Rosie’s script. And the fourth night of shooting involved us mainly shooting Bell’s script and getting any other shots we needed to get. Perhaps we didn’t need an entire night of filming just to get establishing shots and filler shots, but it certainly made it a lot easier having multiple shots to choose from. For the two nights of shooting we certainly didn’t get that much coverage, which meant in the edit we were somewhat stuck using certain shots because we didn’t have other options. This was mainly because of time limitations with actors and batteries on cameras dying and such.

It suggests that a person should make thoughtful decisions and avoid making choices that could lead to negative consequences or perceptions.

The focus of the first sentence is on avoiding general foolish behavior, whereas the second sentence addresses a specific action – believing in information that is known to be incorrect. Given this analysis, the relationship between the two sentences can be considered indirect rather than a direct entailment.

Surrounded by a large entourage as he was led to the red carpet, Tyler stopped to bare a Cheshire Cat's grin as he looked at the four lovely Playboy Bunnies waiting to pose for pictures with him. The rock star and the equally iconic home that has hosted thousands of parties seemed made for each other, but this was Tyler's first visit ever to the Holmby Hills grounds. How was that possible that in all the years of Aerosmith's success, the frontman had never been to one of the famous Halloween parties or a Midsummer Night's Dream? \\"I was too busy in someone's bathroom getting high,\\" Tyler told Rolling Stone. \\"I was too busy on tour, I was too busy writing songs. We were just busy.\\" While he had never been to the house that Hef built, Tyler has crossed paths with the famed Lothario, Hugh Hefner. And Tyler is a big fan. \\"I love people that are committed to their crimes of passion and he is the gentleman of all time,\\" Tyler told us. \\"He's been on every man's mind around the world at least a hundred times in their lifetime for what he did. So he signifies the joys of womanhood and not the degradation . . . and even women love Playboy.\\" What finally brought Tyler to the mansion after more than 40 years in the spotlight was Rock 'n' Roll Fantasy Camp, a program that allows people to live out their rock and roll dreams and spend four intense days training with counselors to play with Tyler or other superstars, such as Kiss' Gene Simmons, who will be the headliner at an upcoming event in Las Vegas from October 10 through 14. Tyler got involved with the camp last year through Mark Hudson, a counselor in the program who co-wrote Aerosmith's \\"Livin' On The Edge.\\" \\"We spoke last year, I was doing a book, and they asked me here and I said I would, and I spoke in front of the whole camp. It's called just being a mentor, if not to incite a riot,\\" he says. Tyler had a challenge for this week's campers, who joined him on stage at the mansion last night. \\"I just dared them all to learn an Aerosmith song to see how good they can do it,\\" he says. \\"If they do it good, which I'm sure they will, I'm gonna pick the best group of them all, we're gonna pick straws and the best one out of that gets to ride around in my car and hear the new Aerosmith album.\\" When Tyler says, while speaking of the upcoming record, \\"I'm on fire, as you can tell,\\" he is not exaggerating. Despite being pulled away by several handlers, he doesn't want to stop talking about the new music, which is now in the mixing stages. \\"It's one of the best Aerosmith albums ever,\\" he says. \\"I'm one of the worst judges of my own music because I'm very harsh, highly critical. [But] we waited until we had at least four really good songs that were representative and we got 19.\\" See the full story at RollingStone.com. Copyright © 2011 Rolling Stone.

He expresses admiration for Hugh Hefner, founder of Playboy.

There was a huge corporation in which I had a contract with. I was called in, to help them uncover what they considered “a very serious series of incidents”. Their own “in house” attempts were fruitless. It turned out, they had an over-sized engineering department, and that it had been announced that this would be scaled back due to completion of contracts. Someone though, within the engineering department, was sabotaging the continued work, slowing the completion. I was to go undercover, posing as a visiting engineer from a distant plant, and find out who the perpetrator/s were, as they wished to file legal action. So, this is at the corporate headquarters, in the late 1980’s. These people were making 6 figure incomes easily. That being said, you kind of expect a bit more of a dignified behavior here than you would with a construction laborer or dishwasher. I completed my job in four days, giving them the evidence and name of the lone individual respsonsible for the sabotage. What exactly was he doing? He carried rubber gloves in his back pocket, and he would periodically use the restroom, and remove his feces from the toilet and smear it all over the walls, covering as much surface as he could. He would also visit restrooms in different departments and do the same. This would cause the unionized individuals, who only had that restroom to use in their area, to walk off their work stations. Seriously, a butt-hurt guy fearing a layoff, so he decided to smear his shit all over the place before it even happened. He readily confessed when confronted by HR, further destroying his work record/career. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

Choose your answer. Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? Pick your answer from: +no; +yes;","response":"To answer these questions, I will first gather information on the cost of materials and labour, and then the overall cost of manufacturing an iPhone. After addressing these questions, I will then evaluate if they can be considered paraphrases of each other. 1. Find the cost of materials used in the iPhone. 2. Find the cost of labor associated with the production of the iPhone. 3. Calculate the total cost of materials and labor. 4. Investigate the overall cost of manufacturing an iPhone, taking into account other factors beyond materials and labor, such as research and development, marketing, shipping, and other expenses. Step 1: According to reports, the estimated bill of materials for an iPhone 12 is around 373, which includes the cost of components such as display, memory, battery, camera, and other parts. Step 2: The labor cost per iPhone is challenging to pinpoint due to many variables, such as the workers' wages, the location of the production plants, and the complexity of assembly. For instance, wages may differ significantly between factories in China and other countries. However, previous estimates indicated the cost of labor per iPhone to be around 12. Step 3: Adding the material costs (373) and labor costs (12), we get an approximate total of 385 for the cost of materials and labor for a new iPhone. Step 4: The overall cost of manufacturing an iPhone is more complicated to estimate, as it includes expenses beyond materials and labor. These include, as mentioned earlier, research and development, marketing, shipping, and other costs. It is difficult to provide an exact amount, but these additional factors should be acknowledged when considering the actual cost of manufacturing an iPhone. Now, to address the question of whether the two questions are paraphrases of each other: The first question focuses solely on the costs of materials and labor, while the second question refers to the overall cost of manufacturing an iPhone, which extends beyond materials and labor, as I have explained in step 4. Based on this distinction, my answer is: + no;"},{"question":"Keywords: city, commander, statue What is a sentence that includes all these keywords?","response":"In the heart of the bustling city, a magnificent statue stands tall, commemorating the achievements of a legendary commander who fearlessly led his troops to numerous victories, leaving an undeniable mark on the annals of history."},{"question":"barbados cruised into the final of the red stripe bowl cricket tournament , beating champions guyana by five wickets in the semifinal match played in jamaica .

George Edward Foreman (born January 10, 1949) is an American former professional boxer who competed from 1969 to 1977, and from 1987 to 1997. Nicknamed \\"Big George\\", he is a two-time world heavyweight champion and an Olympic gold medalist. Outside the sport he is an ordained minister, author, and entrepreneur. After a troubled childhood Foreman took up amateur boxing and won a gold medal in the heavyweight division at the 1968 Summer Olympics. In 1987, after 10 years away from the ring, Foreman surprised the boxing world by announcing a comeback at the age of 38. In his autobiography, he wrote that his primary motive was to raise money to fund the youth center he had created, which had required much of the money he had earned in the initial phase of his career. Another stated ambition was to fight Mike Tyson. For his first fight, he went to Sacramento, California, where he beat journeyman Steve Zouski by a knockout in four rounds. Foreman weighed 267 lb (121 kg) for the fight and looked badly out of shape. Although many thought his decision to return to the ring was a mistake, Foreman countered that he had returned to prove that age was not a barrier to people achieving their goals (as he said later, he wanted to show that age 40 is not a \\"death sentence\\"). He won four more bouts that year, gradually slimming down and improving his fitness. In 1988, he won nine times. Perhaps his most notable win during this period was a seventh-round knockout of former Light Heavyweight and Cruiserweight Champion Dwight Muhammad Qawi. Having always been a deliberate fighter, Foreman had not lost much mobility in the ring since his first \\"retirement\\", although he found it harder to keep his balance after throwing big punches and could no longer throw rapid combinations. He was still capable of landing heavy single blows, however. The late-round fatigue that had plagued him in the ring as a young man now seemed to be unexpectedly gone, and he could comfortably compete for 12 rounds. Foreman attributed this to his new, relaxed fighting style (he has spoken of how, earlier in his career, his lack of stamina came from an enormous amount of nervous tension). By 1989, while continuing his comeback, Foreman had sold his name and face for the advertising of various products, selling everything from grills to mufflers on TV. For this purpose his public persona was reinvented, and the formerly aloof, ominous Foreman had been replaced by a smiling, friendly George. He and Ali had become friends, and he followed in Ali's footsteps by making himself a celebrity outside the boundaries of boxing. Foreman continued his string of victories, winning five more fights, the most impressive being a three-round win over Bert Cooper, who went on to contest the Undisputed Heavyweight title against Evander Holyfield.

Becky Evans. PUBLISHED:. 05:01 EST, 27 December 2012. |. UPDATED:. 05:42 EST, 28 December 2012. Appeal: Jo Swinson co-founded the Campaign for Body Confidence. Magazines have been urged to ditch New Year ‘miracle diets’ that promise to help readers shed the pounds they have piled on over the festive season. Jo Swinson, the Minister for Women and Equalities, claims such diets – which offer tips on how to lose up to a stone in a matter of days – encourage ‘dangerous’ behaviour and ‘self-hate’. In an open letter to women’s, men’s, health and celebrity magazines, she implored editors to stop focusing on short-term solutions and instead encourage sustainable healthy lifestyles. The Lib Dem MP said: ‘As editors you owe more to your readers than the reckless promotion of unhealthy solutions to losing weight. ‘If your aim is to give practical, sensible advice about losing weight – not how to drop a stone in five days – you should encourage reasonable expectations, instead of dangerous ones, along with exercise and healthy eating.’ Speaking on Five Live yesterday, Miss Swinson, who chairs the All Party Parliamentary Group on Body Image, said: ‘There’s a real difference between having a crash diet and getting healthier.’ She added: ‘It is irresponsible for magazines to offer “tips, tricks and simple steps” so that people can be thin. Not healthy or vibrant, just thin.’ 'Magazines should reflect ‘real diversity’ rather than showing only slim, young models.' Editors, she added, ‘need to be updating the type of January article that they’re putting in their magazines to have a more positive body image rather than the sort of self-hate perpetuated by the fad diet articles’. Ms Swinson co-founded the Campaign for Body Confidence in 2010 with fellow MP Lynne Featherstone. It promotes diversity of women's bodies in the media, as well as body confidence education in schools and honesty in advertising. The group's founders believe the 'pressure to conform to impossible stereotypes' is damaging to both men and women and increases low-self-esteem, depression and eating disorders. Weight Watchers, which was recently named the NHS' most effective weight loss provider, welcomed the letter. A spokeswoman said: 'We’re delighted that the government is taking measures to prevent the promotion of irresponsible and unhealthy fad diets. Weight Watchers is not a diet, it’s a healthy lifestyle.' She said they encourage a 'healthy and sustainable weight loss' of no more than 2lbs a week.

Understand the Hypothesis: The hypothesis states \\"Two men are working in a kitchen.\\" This statement implies that there are two males in a kitchen and they are engaged in work. 3. Compare the Premise and Hypothesis: In these two statements, although the activity and location are the same, the gender of the individuals is different. 4. Decision: Since the premise does not provide any information about men working in a kitchen, it cannot be logically inferred that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true. The principle of logical inference dictates that you can only draw conclusions which are guaranteed to be true based on the provided premises. In this case, having information about women working in the kitchen does not offer any concrete information or evidence about men working in the kitchen.

Their decomposing abilities are not limited to trees and legumes, but also include many other forms of organic matter like dead plants, animals, leaves, wood, and litter. Fungi produce enzymes that help break down complex organic molecules like cellulose, lignin, and chitin, releasing vital nutrients back into the soil, which can then be used by plants and other organisms. Given the wide range of organic matter that fungi can decompose, it would be inaccurate to state that they are solely capable of decomposing dead legumes.

Bellamy is convinced of his guilt but Anne is less sure. Much of her practice is with troubled young people and she feels there is more to the story than the police evidence. Anne visits Harry in prison. He is depressed and distrustful but finally agrees to talk to her. Harry's story is that he took a Bentley Continental car to impress a girl but when she went off with another boy decided to take the car for a spin before dumping it. Swerving to avoid another car he burst a tyre but could not find any tools in the boot to change the wheel. He asked the driver of a car parked in the copse nearby for help but he was occupied with his girl and refused. Harry was spotted by a policeman on a bike who stopped to help. He flagged down a lorry to ask to borrow a jack. The lorry stopped but the passenger immediately produced a gun and shot the policeman. Harry managed to grab the gun off the killer as the lorry drove away. Shortly after, a police car arrived and Harry was arrested. Anne believes Harry's story and tries to persuade Bellamy of Harry's innocence. She interviews Harry several times and begins to follow up some aspects of his story. She visits the gang that Harry hung out with in a café in Battersea and they agree to help her by trying to find the couple in the parked car. She also visits Taplow, the man whose car was stolen, several times and finds his account unconvincing. One of the boys from the cafe agrees to take a job at Taplow's frozen food depot to do some investigating there. contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who could not find any tools to change the wheel of a tire?, what is it ?","response":"The full name of the person who could not find any tools to change the wheel of a tire in the article is Harry Jukes."},{"question":"Choose the next sentence.Washington (CNN) -- Rep.

In this task, you are given a short passage that conveys a stereotype or an anti-stereotype. A stereotype is an over-generalized belief about a particular group of people(based on race, ethnicity, gender, age, abilities, etc.). An anti-stereotype is an idea that goes against a common stereotype. You are expected to classify the passage into two classes: stereotype or anti-stereotype. Passage: Jacques cooked rice for nearly every meal. Output:","response":"Part #1: Identify the short passage. Usage: \\"Jacques cooked rice for nearly every meal.\\" This part of the definition lists the sample input you are given in the task. The short passage contains a statement or an idea that conveys a stereotype or an anti-stereotype about a particular group of people. Part #2: Identify if the passage conveys a stereotype or an anti-stereotype. Usage: Stereotype or Anti-stereotype. In this part of the definition, you need to classify the given passage into either one of these categories. Part #3: Classify the passage based on the over-generalized belief about a particular group of people. Usage: Stereotype. \\"Jacques cooked rice for nearly every meal\\" can be classified as a stereotype if it implies that a particular ethnic group usually cooks and consumes rice as their primary food source. Part #4: Classify the passage based on ideas that go against a common stereotype. Usage: Anti-stereotype. The passage will be an anti-stereotype if it portrays an idea or action that goes against the general belief about a specific group of people. For example, if a passage says \\"Tom, a 70-year-old man, became a professional skateboarder,\\" it would be an anti-stereotype since older people are generally not associated with skateboarding. In this example, the output would likely be \\"Stereotype,\\" as the passage could imply that Jacques belongs to an ethnic group that stereotypically cooks rice for nearly every meal."},{"question":"Larry Martin Hagman (September 21, 1931 November 23, 2012) was an American film and television actor, director and producer best known for playing ruthless oil baron J.R.

Ewing played Major Anthony \\"Tony\\" Nelson in \\"I Dream of Jeannie\\" is incorrect. According to the information provided, Larry Martin Hagman was an American actor who portrayed two different roles in two separate television shows. In the 1980s primetime television soap opera \\"Dallas,\\" Larry Hagman played the character J.R. Ewing, a ruthless oil baron. J.R. Ewing was notably one of the central characters on the show, and his manipulative and cunning ways made him an iconic villain. On the other hand, during the 1960s sitcom \\"I Dream of Jeannie,\\" Larry Hagman portrayed the character Major Anthony \\"Tony\\" Nelson. Major Nelson was an astronaut who discovered a magical genie, played by actress Barbara Eden. This character was quite different from J.R. Ewing, as he was more of a well-meaning, befuddled character who often found himself in humorous situations. Therefore, it would be accurate to conclude that Larry Martin Hagman played both J.R. Ewing in \\"Dallas\\" and Major Anthony \\"Tony\\" Nelson in \\"I Dream of Jeannie\\". However, the characters of J.R. Ewing and Major Nelson are not interchangeable, and the conclusion that J.R.

Barbara, 44, who came to The City in 1970, have been trying to pick herself up from the bottom, where she and her children started out with just the clothes on their backs-through the kindness of others they got by. They were last homeless in 1999. Since then, Barbara has worked hard to keep from returning to the streets and the shelters, taking advantage first of transitional housing, then a rent assistance, and studying for a job as a nursing assistant and a home health aide. However the cost for housing has made it difficult for her to _ . She can't afford proper housing. Even an improper shelter costs as much as 1,200 for rent. She has to spend every night in a dining room. In this respect, she is not alone. There are hundreds of thousands of San Franciscans who are in the same boat with her. Since 2000, she's been providing health care in the homes of charity , and relying on an assistance program to pay the rent for her two-bedroom apartment in the Lower Height.

Think carefully first, then make a decision:","response":"First, we need to find out how much sand Tony needs to fill the sandbox, and how many trips he will take to fill it. The volume of the sandbox can be calculated by multiplying its dimensions: 2 ft (depth) × 4 ft (width) × 5 ft (length) = 40 cubic feet Since a cubic foot of sand weighs 3 pounds, we need: 40 cubic feet × 3 pounds/cubic foot = 120 pounds of sand Each trip carries 2 pounds of sand, so the number of trips Tony takes is: 120 pounds / 2 pounds/trip = 60 trips Every 4 trips, Tony drinks 3 ounces of water.

No; The given paragraph states that if confirmed as rabies, the case could be the first occurrence of the infection acquired in the UK (United Kingdom) since 1902. It does not provide any information about the prevalence or occurrence of rabies in America. Thus, we cannot conclude that the sentence \\"rabies is an infection that happens in America\\" is true based on the information provided in the paragraph. Moreover, rabies is a viral infection that affects the central nervous system of mammals, including humans, and is found in many parts of the world, not limited to America. It is typically transmitted through the bite of an infected animal, such as dogs, bats, raccoons, skunks, and foxes. While rabies is prevalent in some regions of North, Central, and South America, it is also found in Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Middle East, among other areas. Public health efforts, including vaccination programs for domestic animals and wildlife, post-exposure prophylaxis, and raising public awareness, have helped control and prevent the spread of rabies in several regions. In the United States, rabies cases have decreased significantly since the 20th century thanks to effective vaccination programs for domestic animals and other measures. However, rabies still poses a risk in certain areas, particularly due to wildlife reservoirs. The presence of rabies in the Americas does not imply that rabies is exclusive to this region. It is an infection that occurs in many parts of the world, and global efforts to control and eliminate rabies continue to be an important public health concern."},{"question":"Compression is useful because it helps reduce resource usage, such as data storage space or transmission capacity. Because compressed data must be decompressed to use, this extra processing imposes computational or other costs through decompression; this situation is far from being a free lunch. Data compression is subject to a space–time complexity trade-off. For instance, a compression scheme for video may require expensive hardware for the video to be decompressed fast enough to be viewed as it is being decompressed, and the option to decompress the video in full before watching it may be inconvenient or require additional storage. The design of data compression schemes involves trade-offs among various factors, including the degree of compression, the amount of distortion introduced (when using lossy data compression), and the computational resources required to compress and decompress the data. Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What must compressed data be to be inconvenient?","response":"Compressed data can be inconvenient in several scenarios, depending on the specific requirements and limitations of the system or user. Some of these inconveniences are: 1. High computational cost: If the compression algorithm being used is too complex or requires significant processing power to compress or decompress the data, it may lead to slow performance or high resource utilization. This can be especially inconvenient for systems with limited processing capabilities or when real-time processing is required. 2. Loss of data quality: When using lossy data compression, some degree of distortion or loss of quality may occur as part of the compression process. This might be inconvenient or unacceptable if high fidelity or accurate reproduction of the original data is required. 3. Large file sizes: Compression algorithms do not always guarantee reduced file sizes. In some cases, the compressed data may be larger than the original data or may not be compressed significantly, which can be inconvenient if the primary goal is to save storage space or bandwidth. 4. Incompatibility: If the compressed data format is not widely supported or requires specific software for decompression, it can be inconvenient for users who need to access or share the data across different platforms. 5. Security and privacy concerns: Some compression techniques may have vulnerabilities that put the security and privacy of the data at risk. For example, encryption should be applied before compression, as compression algorithms can potentially leak information about the underlying data. This can be inconvenient if secure and private storage or transmission of data is essential. In summary, compressed data can become inconvenient when it leads to high computational costs, loss of data quality, insignificant reduction in file size, compatibility issues, or security and privacy concerns."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

Answer the above question based on the context below: The 1896 French colonisation of Madagascar brought an end to the rule of the Merina sovereigns. The Rova of Antananarivo was converted into a museum the following year, and the Fitomiandalana tombs were excavated and moved to a new location behind the tombs of Radama I and Rasoherina. The bodies of sovereigns previously interred in the royal tombs at Ambohimanga were exhumed and transferred to the tombs in the Rova grounds, a sacrilegious move that degraded the status of Ambohimanga as a site of sacred pilgrimage. According to Frémigacci (1999), French colonial administrator General Joseph Gallieni undertook this desacralisation of the Rova in an attempt to break popular belief in the power of the royal ancestors. By the same token, his actions relegated Malagasy sovereignty under the Merina rulers to a relic of an unenlightened past. The desecration of the two most sacred sites of Merina royalty represented a calculated political move intended to establish the political and cultural superiority of the colonial power.Following independence the Rova compound remained largely closed to the public throughout the First (1960–1972) and Second (1975–1992) Republics except on special occasions. In 1995, three years into the Third Republic (1992–2010), the Rova compound was destroyed by fire.

Walter M. Kimbrough, president, Dillard University If a college requires coed Greek houses, national organizations will withdraw, leaving the campus with local groups that are the responsibility of the institution. Lise Eliot, author, \\"Pink Brain, Blue Brain\\" College campuses are already segregated by sex, with students often picking their field of study based on gender conformity. Single-sex Greek life exacerbates this trend. Eliza Mott, student, Princeton University Making frats coed will make them a safer place for women and increase the level of maturity of relationships across gender boundaries. Will Morrow, student, Trinity College Trinity College’s experience in recent years serves as a testament to the speciousness of the merits of coed Greek organizations. What is a short summary of the above article?","response":"The topic is about whether or not college fraternities and sororities should be coed, meaning should they include both boys and girls. Walter Kimbrough warns that if a college pushes for coed Greek houses, national groups might quit, leaving the college to deal with local groups. Lise Eliot mentions that many students choose what they want to study based on what seems suitable for their gender, and having groups only for boys or girls can make this thought stronger. On the other hand, Eliza Mott believes that making frats include boys and girls can keep women safer and improve understanding between boys and girls. However, Will Morrow points to his school, Trinity College, as an example that mixing boys and girls in these groups maybe isn't the best idea. So, some people think it might be better to include both boys and girls in these groups, while others think it might not work so well."},{"question":"Generate a short movie review that has \\"(a).\\" sentiment (Options are: (a). negative. (b). positive.).","response":"Task: Generate a short movie review with a negative sentiment. Step 1: To generate a negative review, I'll need to think about common elements that people dislike in movies. This could be things like poor acting, a confusing storyline, and lack of character development. Step 2: I'll need to craft the review in such a way that it relays these negative aspects without sounding overly harsh or intolerant. This requires using respectful language, even when criticizing the film. Step 3: The review should be concise but with enough details to support my negative sentiment - I need to ensure that I give specific reasons as to why my review is negative. Here's the short snippet: \\"Unfortunately, 'The Final Act' leaves much to be desired. Despite its promise of an epic conclusion, it fails to deliver due to a convoluted storyline that seems uninterested in explaining itself. The character development is pitiful, barely scratching the surface of the characters' potentials. Coupled with performances that range from passable to unconvincing, the movie ultimately feels like a letdown. Visual effects and cinematography struggle to salvage the film, but ultimately can't compensate for the lack of a compelling narrative. 'The Final Act' is, regrettably, an unsatisfying finale that leaves a bitter aftertaste.\\" Justification: - I mentioned specific elements that were disappointing like the storyline and character development to provide a grounded reason for the negativity. - I used respectful language such as \\"leaves much to be desired\\" and \\"regrettably\\" to maintain a professional tone. - Even within a negative review, I acknowledged positive attempts (visual effects and cinematography) to portray a balanced view. - I provided a general concluding statement that encapsulates the overall sentiment of the review - \\"an unsatisfying finale that leaves a bitter aftertaste\\".

He rides into Rio Arriba, where four men, Alfonso Parral (Lee Van Cleef), Bill Zachary (Stephen Boyd), Ed Taylor (Albert Salmi) and Lujan (Henry Silva), are in jail awaiting execution. Sheriff Eloy Sanchez (Herbert Rudley) allows Douglas to see the men. In town, Douglas meets Josefa Velarde (Joan Collins) whom he met five years previously in New Orleans. She has been looking after her late father's ranch. Douglas reveals he has a daughter (Maria Garcia Fletcher). Other townspeople include Gus Steimmetz, his daughter Emma (Kathleen Gallant) and her fiance (Barry Coe). The executioner, Simms, arrives, and aside from a brief drink with Douglas, seems to show little interest in socializing or advance planning for his task.

The second choice jumps ahead to the ingredients without logically following the original paragraph. Though this step might occur later in the recipe, it wouldn't typically come immediately after greasing the pan.

The overall performance of this app has been consistently poor, and it has become more of a source of inconvenience rather than a helpful tool. To begin with, the app's installation process was unintuitive and filled with unnecessary steps. I was hopeful that, once installed, the app would be more user-friendly, but my optimism was short-lived. It is evident that the developers put little thought into an efficient user experience, as the app's interface is cluttered, disorganized, and hard to navigate. Frequent crashes and unresponsive features have only worsened my experience with the com.google.android.gms app. Oftentimes, a simple attempt to access a menu or an in-app setting would lead to an unresponsive screen, followed by a complete app crash. This level of instability has proven to be extremely frustrating and time-consuming, as I have had to relaunch the app multiple times just to complete a simple task. Additionally, the app proved to be a significant drain on my device's battery life and performance. Even when running in the background, it consumed a considerable amount of battery, causing my device's battery to deplete much faster than usual. Furthermore, the app's impact on my device's performance was highly noticeable, causing it to lag and freeze repeatedly. Lastly, I cannot overlook the lack of effective customer support for this app. When I encountered issues and sought assistance, I was greeted by unhelpful and unresponsive support channels. It was as if the developers had no interest in resolving issues for their users, which made me feel even more undervalued as a customer. In conclusion, I cannot recommend the com.google.android.gms app to anyone in its current state. The app's poor performance, instability, high battery consumption, and unresponsive customer support make it severely lacking in all aspects. Users would be better off seeking alternative solutions, as this app fails to deliver a competent and positive experience."},{"question":"As Julie kept asking question after question, all I could think of was how desperately I needed a normal, healthy relationship.

See options at the end They struggled to feed the crowd cake at the wedding because the Choose from: (a). cake was small.; (b). crowd was small.;","response":"The sentence will end with option (a). cake was small. The complete sentence will be: \\"They struggled to feed the crowd cake at the wedding because the cake was small.\\" In this scenario, the wedding organizers or hosts are facing a problem, as they are unable to adequately serve cake to all the guests present at the wedding. The reason for this struggle is the fact that the size of the cake is not sufficient to feed the crowd. This might have occurred because the organizers underestimated the number of attendees or there was a miscommunication with the cake provider, which resulted in a smaller cake than initially planned. On the other hand, option (b) - \\"the crowd was small\\", would imply that there was no struggle in feeding the crowd since there were fewer guests. However, the sentence specifically states that \\"they struggled...\\", indicating a problem, which makes option (a) the more suitable choice to complete the sentence. In order to rectify the issue with the small cake, the wedding organizers could consider a few solutions: 1. Divide the cake into smaller servings: This could allow more guests to at least have a taste of the wedding cake, even if the slices are not as generous as hoped for. 2. Order additional cake or desserts: If time and resources allow, the organizers can try to order more cake from a local bakery or even purchase supplementary desserts, such as cupcakes, pastries, or cookies, to satisfy the guests' sweet cravings. 3. Apologize for the inconvenience and explain the situation: Communication can go a long way. The hosts can explain the mishap to the guests and apologize for any inconvenience caused. Most people are understanding and forgiving, especially if they are aware of the circumstances behind the issue. 4. Make alternative arrangements: In case no extra cake or dessert can be procured, the organizers could shift the focus to other aspects of the wedding celebration, like extending the time for dancing or entertaining guests through games, skits, or speeches. With a combination of quick thinking and creativity, the wedding organizers can work around the challenge posed by a small cake, ensuring that all those attending the wedding are still able to enjoy the celebrations."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: What is the missing first step of the following process: - The recyclable materials go to a recycling center - The recycling center further separates the materials - Large equipment compacts the materials into bales - The recyclable materials are shipped to other recycling centers - The other recycling centers further process the materials that center specializes in - The materials are purchased by manufacturers - The manufacturers process the recycled materials the same way they would use new materials - The recycled materials are incorporated into new products. Answer:","response":"The missing first step of the following process is: Collection and sorting of recyclable materials from households, businesses, and public spaces. Before recyclable materials can go to a recycling center, they need to be collected and sorted. This step is crucial in the recycling process, as it ensures that only the correct materials are sent to the recycling centers for further processing. Collection and sorting of recyclable materials can happen in several ways: 1. Curbside recycling programs: In many communities, local waste management companies provide designated bins for residents to place their recyclable materials. These bins are then collected on a regular basis, and the recyclable materials, such as paper, plastic, metal, and glass, are taken to a material recovery facility (MRF) for initial sorting. 2. Drop-off recycling centers: Some areas may not have curbside recycling programs, or residents may have items that cannot be placed in curbside bins. In such cases, residents can take their recyclable materials to local drop-off recycling centers, where they can deposit items into designated containers for each type of material. 3. Deposit-return systems: In some regions, beverage containers are subject to a deposit-return system, where consumers pay a small deposit when purchasing beverages in bottles or cans. Consumers can later return these containers to designated collection points, such as supermarkets or bottle return centers, to receive their deposit back. These containers are then collected and processed for recycling. 4. Commercial recycling: Businesses, institutions, and industries generate a significant amount of recyclable waste, such as cardboard, office paper, metal, and plastic. Many of these materials can be collected through specialized commercial recycling programs, which often involve separate bins or containers at the workplace, or through contracted waste management services that specialize in commercial recycling. Once the recyclable materials have been collected, they are transported to a material recovery facility (MRF) for initial sorting. At the MRF, materials are separated by type, often using a combination of manual labor and automated sorting equipment, such as conveyor belts, air classifiers, and optical scanners. This sorting process ensures that each type of recyclable material is separated and sent to the appropriate recycling center for further processing, beginning the sequence described in the original question."},{"question":"What is the sentiment of the following movie (choose your answer from the options) review sentence? is unusual , food-for-thought cinema that 's as entertaining as it is instructive Pick from: a). negative; b). positive; The answer is:","response":"b). positive"},{"question":"Do you have a license to carry it?

Question 2: How can you look at someone's private Instagram account without following them? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","response":"Answer 1: Is it possible to view someone's private Instagram account? In general, it's not possible to view someone's private Instagram account without their permission or unless you're an approved follower. Private profiles on Instagram have their privacy settings restricted to protect user content from being accessed by unknown users. When an Instagram account is set to private, the user must approve any follow requests from other users who want to see their content. This is a security measure implemented by Instagram to protect the privacy of its users. However, there are some workarounds or unethical practices that people might employ to view private Instagram profiles without permission. These methods are not recommended, as they likely violate Instagram's terms of service and could lead to account suspension or other consequences for the user who is attempting to view a private profile without authorization. It's always best to respect people's privacy and not try to view their private accounts without their consent. If you want to see someone's content, the best approach is to send them a follow request and wait for approval. Answer 2: How can you look at someone's private Instagram account without following them? There is no legitimate way to view someone's private Instagram account without following them. The whole purpose of setting an account to private is to control access to the content and protect the user's privacy. So by default, it is not possible to view a private Instagram profile without permission from the account holder. Here are some ways people might attempt to access a private account without permission, but keep in mind that these methods are not recommended, and engaging in such practices can result in consequences such as account suspension or, in some cases, legal ramifications: 1. Using a Private Instagram Viewer: Several dubious third-party apps and websites claim to allow users to view private Instagram profiles without following them. However, these apps often violate Instagram's terms of service and may not be safe to use, as they may lead to a user's account being hacked. 2. Creating a fake account: Some people might create a fake account to send a follow request to a private profile in an attempt to gain access. This method violates Instagram's community guidelines and is considered unethical. These workarounds are not recommended, and the best way to view a private Instagram account is to send a follow request from your legitimate account and wait for approval. In conclusion, the answer to both questions is not the same. While it is possible to view someone's private Instagram profile through unethical means, it is not recommended to attempt any such methods that violate Instagram's terms of service and community guidelines. Respecting people's privacy is essential, and the proper way to view a private Instagram account is by sending a follow request and waiting for the user's approval."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Build a movie plot around this: What is Montone's profession? a sergeant Answer:","response":"Title: \\"Sergeant Montone: Duty Above All\\" Plot: Sergeant Montone is a respected figure in a small town's local police department.

Also known as a \\"conflux\\", it refers either to the point where a tributary joins a larger river, (main stem), or where two streams meet to become the source of a river of a new name, such as the confluence of the Monongahela and Allegheny rivers in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania creating the Ohio River. - A drainage basin or catchment basin is an extent or an area of land where all surface water from rain, melting snow, or ice converges to a single point at a lower elevation, usually the exit of the basin, where the waters join another body of water, such as a river, lake, reservoir, estuary, wetland, sea, or ocean. Thus if a tributary stream joins a brook that in turn joins a small river which is a tributary of a larger river, there is a series of successively larger (and lower elevation) drainage basins. For instance, the Missouri and Ohio rivers are within their own drainage basins and also within the drainage basin of the Mississippi River. - A sea is a large body of salt water that is surrounded in whole or in part by land. More broadly, \\"the sea\\" is the interconnected system of Earth's salty, oceanic watersconsidered as one global ocean or as several principal oceanic divisions. The sea moderates Earth's climate and has important roles in the water cycle, carbon cycle, and nitrogen cycle. Although the sea has been traveled and explored since prehistory, the modern scientific study of the seaoceanographydates broadly to the British \\"Challenger\\" expedition of the 1870s. The sea is conventionally divided into up to five large oceanic sectionsincluding the International Hydrographic Organization's four named oceans (the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, and Arctic) and the Southern Ocean; smaller, second-order sections, such as the Mediterranean, are known as \\"seas\\". - Oka is a river in central Russia, the largest right tributary of the Volga. It flows through the regions of Oryol, Tula, Kaluga, Moscow, Ryazan, Vladimir, and Nizhny Novgorod and is navigable over a large part of its total length, as far upstream as to the town of Kaluga. Its length exceeds . The Russian capital Moscow sits on one of the Oka's tributariesthe Moskva River. - The Mississippi River is the chief river of the largest drainage system on the North American continent. Flowing entirely in the United States (although its drainage basin reaches into Canada), it rises in northern Minnesota and meanders slowly southwards for to the Mississippi River Delta at the Gulf of Mexico. With its many tributaries, the Mississippi's watershed drains all or parts of 31 U.S. states and 2 Canadian provinces between the Rocky and Appalachian Mountains. The Mississippi ranks as the fourth longest and fifteenth largest river in the world by discharge. The river either borders or passes through the states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana. - Saint Petersburg is Russia's second-largest city after Moscow, with five million inhabitants in 2012, and an important Russian port on the Baltic Sea. It is politically incorporated as a federal subject (a federal city). Situated on the Neva River, at the head of the Gulf of Finland on the Baltic Sea, it was founded by Tsar Peter the Great on May . In 1914, the name was changed from Saint Petersburg to Petrograd, in 1924 to Leningrad, and in 1991 back to Saint Petersburg. Between 17131728 and 17321918, Saint Petersburg was the imperial capital of Russia. In 1918, the central government bodies moved to Moscow. - An estuary is a partially enclosed coastal body of brackish water with one or more rivers or streams flowing into it, and with a free connection to the open sea. - A waterway is any navigable body of water. A shipping route consists of one or several waterways. Waterways can include rivers, lakes, seas, oceans, and canals. In order for a waterway to be navigable, it must meet several criteria: - Novosibirsk is the third-most populous city in Russia after Moscow and St. Petersburg. It is the most populous city in Asian Russia, with a population of 1,473,754 as of the 2010 Census. It is the administrative center of Novosibirsk Oblast as well as of the Siberian Federal District. The city is located in the southwestern part of Siberia on the banks of the Ob River adjacent to the Ob River Valley, near the large water reservoir formed by the dam of the Novosibirsk Hydro Power Plant, and occupies an area of . - Eurasia is the combined continental landmass of Europe and Asia. The term is a portmanteau of its constituent continents. Located primarily in the Northern and Eastern Hemispheres, it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Pacific Ocean to the east, the Arctic Ocean to the north, and by Africa, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Indian Ocean to the south. The division between Europe and Asia as two different continents is a historical and cultural construct, with no clear physical separation between them; thus, in some parts of the world, Eurasia is recognized as the largest of five or six continents. In geology, Eurasia is often considered as a single rigid megablock. However, the rigidity of Eurasia is debated based on the paleomagnet data. - A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, sea, lake or another river. In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague. - Lama River ( Russian : ) is a river in the Moscow and Tver Oblasts in Russia , a tributary of the Shosha River . The river is 139 kilometres ( 86 mi ) long . The area of its drainage basin is 2,330 square kilometres ( 900 sq mi ) . The Lama River freezes up in November and stays under the ice until late March or early April . Historically , the river was a part of the important waterway from the Volga River to the Moskva River . The city of Volokolamsk that has been standing on the Lama River since the 12th century was previously known as Volok Lamsky ( literally - Drag of Lama ) after the process of a watercraft portage . - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - An ocean (the sea of classical antiquity) is a body of saline water that composes much of a planet's hydrosphere. On Earth, an ocean is one of the major conventional divisions of the World Ocean, which covers almost 71% of its surface. These are, in descending order by area, the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic Oceans. The word \\"sea\\" is often used interchangeably with \\"ocean\\" in American English but, strictly speaking, a sea is a body of saline water (generally a division of the world ocean) partly or fully enclosed by land. - Canals and navigations are human-made channels for water conveyance (supply), or to service water transport vehicles. In the vernacular, both are referred to as 'canals', and in most cases, the engineered works will have a series of dams and locks that create areas of low speed current flow. These areas are referred to as\\" 'slack water levels',\\" often just called 'levels'. The main difference between them is that a navigation parallels a river and shares part of its waters, its drainage basin and leverages its resources by building dams and locks to increase and lengthen its long stretches of \\"deep enough\\" slack water levels while staying in its valley. In contrast, a canal cuts across a drainage divide atop a ridge (however humble), generally requiring an external water source above the highest elevation. Many canals have been built at elevations towering over valleys and others water ways crossing far below. Cities need a lot of fresh water and many canals with sources of water at a higher level can deliver water to a destination where there is a lack of water. The Roman Empire's Aqueducts were such water supply canals. - Volokolamsk is a town and the administrative center of Volokolamsky District in Moscow Oblast, Russia, located on the Gorodenka River, not far from its confluence with the Lama River, northwest of Moscow. Population: - The Volga is the longest river in Europe. It is also Europe's largest river in terms of discharge and watershed. The river flows through central Russia and into the Caspian Sea, and is widely regarded as the national river of Russia. - The Moskva River (\\"Moskva-reka\\") is a river of western Russia. It rises about west of Moscow, and flows roughly east through the Smolensk and Moscow Oblasts, passing through central Moscow.
