It's certainly a popular argument with fans of the British monarchy -- that the institution raises Britain's profile overseas and helps to boost tourist visits. The Daily Mail newspaper clearly hopes for such an effect from the recent arrival of the third in line to the British throne. \\"Royal baby could cause tourism surge as well-wishers flock to UK,\\" the paper trumpeted just after the birth of the new Prince of Cambridge. \\"As London wakes up to the aftermath of a giant party on the Mall and the announcement that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have a son, there are hopes that the birth of the new royal baby will spark a tourism boom as well-wishers flock to the UK to share in the joy,\\" Britain's second best-selling paper went on in its picture-rich splash. \\"The spell cast by the monarchy's 1,000-year history, combined with the international media frenzy around the royal baby, is extremely powerful at drawing people to England,\\" Lady Cobham, chair of the tourist body VisitBritain, is quoted as saying. Not alone. The Daily Mail wasn't alone in predicting such an effect. \\"Hotels and attractions\\" in London were set to capitalize on the \\"royal baby boom,\\" observed the International Business Times. And that boom was apparently resonating beyond London. \\"Royal Baby to spark rise in tourist visits,\\" read an Edinburgh Evening News headline. \\"Royal attractions in Edinburgh are expecting a surge in visitor numbers as tourists flock to share in the baby joy,\\" the article said. Yet further afield (although still in a Commonwealth country) the travel editor of the Star, in Toronto, was not \\"necessarily gung ho\\" about the royal family but he still devoted a blog post to the \\"bounce\\" it was sure to give British tourism. On social media, \\"A British Royal baby could spark a major boost to the UK tourism industry,\\" was a typical comment from Airwise News. Where's the evidence? Looking for evidence for the widely touted princeling-tourism connection, the evidence becomes less clear. Certainly tourists flocked to Buckingham Palace in advance of the birth, awaiting confirmation of the baby's arrival. \\"Our holiday was booked months ago, so we did not expect to be over here while the baby was happening [but we've] been told to bring back as many newspapers and souvenirs with the baby on as possible,\\" Matthew and Donna Harold, from Michigan, told the Telegraph. A scan of social media reveals the odd international prince-fixated quote, such as this from a tweeter in Fort Lauderdale, Florida: \\"Dear Kate Middleton, Please wait to have the Royal Baby until Thursday. Thank you, Annie Harley, an American Tourist.\\" But are there any hard numbers to support the idea of a baby-born tourist surge? The Mail did cite a statistical precedent. In 2012, it said, the Queen's Diamond Jubilee year, tourist visits (at 31 million) were at their highest level since the beginning of the economic downturn in 2008. However, even if hotels near Kensington Palace are throwing caution to the wind with \\"Tot-ter Around Kensington\\" shop-and-stay packages and converting luxury suites into five-star nurseries for the occasion, that still doesn't turn correlation into cause. Negative effect? If anything, the numbers point the other way. A recent story in the Guardian refers to a document obtained under Freedom of Information legislation from Visit Britain on the marriage between Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson in 1986. \\"We find that across the year as a whole there were 4% fewer visitors to Britain than in 1985, but that in July [1986] there were 8% fewer than in July of 1985,\\" the document says. \\"[S]uch as it is, the evidence points to royal weddings having a negative impact on inbound tourism.\\" Graham Smith, chief executive office of the campaign group Republic, concurs. The argument that royal births, weddings and anniversaries benefit tourism is \\"a complete fiction,\\" he tells CNN. \\"There's not a shred of evidence for it. People don't make holiday decisions on the basis of who's living in what castle. \\"Tourists are here for our culture, our common language. They may come and look at palaces but the fairy tale side of it is there regardless of whether the monarchy is or not. \\"People have nothing [substantive] to say in defense of the monarchy so come up with a financial argument.\\" Culture and heritage. \\"We know that visitors drawn to Britain by the appeal of our culture and heritage spend over Â£4.5 billion annually and support around 100,000 jobs,\\" a VisitBritain official tells CNN. \\"This in part can be attributed to attractions and events with a connection to Britain's monarchs past and present.\\" Kate and William's wedding in 2011, VisitBritain says, \\"brought record numbers of visitors for the summer opening of Buckingham Palace. More than 600,000 people passed through the gates to see the Duchess of Cambridge's wedding dress. \\"That smashed the previous attendance figure set in 1994 and was an increase of almost 50%\\" on the previous year, says VisitBritain. Such figures are compelling. But whether anybody actually booked tickets to Britain for the birth of George Alexander Louis or any other royal event, as so many people in Britain and beyond seem to think, is far less certain.","response":"- Royal baby's birth sparks debate over its potential impact on British tourism. - Media outlets and tourism bodies predict increase in tourist visits due to the new royal family member. - Some argue there's no clear historical evidence supporting the theory that royal events increase tourism.

Just after he bought the house with his ill gotten gains from his band's over-hyped, over-marketed, and over-bought sophomore Disc, he drove me out to see it in his beautiful but nauseating '70 Datsun 240 Z. All the smog combined with the pinball effects of winding up the hill at teeth-numbing speeds had me puking for an hour after we got there. I took the last turn at the top of the hill and watched the rising sun crest over the black blocks of the city, her angel wings soiled and cheapened with the soot of 12 million get-away drivers.

I parked between a blue hatchback and Rick's favorite toy: a 350 horsepower Impreza he had smuggled here from Japan.

Question: suppose more sunshine for the plants happens, how will it affect the magma condenses more. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer to this question is:","response":"no effect Reasoning: 1. Sunshine affects the growth of plants, which is an independent process from magma formation and condensation. Increased sunshine will cause plants to grow faster and more efficiently due to the enhanced process of photosynthesis, but it does not have a direct impact on the formation of magma. 2. Magma formation and condensation are primarily influenced by processes and factors occurring deep within the Earth's crust and mantle. These factors include temperature, pressure, tectonic activity, and the movement of mantle material. Changes in these factors can affect how magma condenses and solidifies, but they are largely unrelated to the amount of sunshine for plants. 3. While it is true that processes occurring on the Earth's surface, such as weathering and erosion, can eventually influence the composition of the mantle and crust, these surface processes are not significantly affected by sunshine for plants. Thus, the increased sunshine for plants does not directly impact the way the magma condenses."},{"question":"Brendan Rodgers has vowed to make Liverpool stronger and insisted there are no regrets about sanctioning Luis Suarez’s sale to Barcelona. Suarez’s £75million move was confirmed on Wednesday but his four-month stadium ban for biting Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup means he could not be unveiled by head coach Luis Enrique and sporting director Andoni Zubizaretta. While Enrique and Zubizaretta were fielding questions in Spain about the Uruguay striker’s character flaws, a shadow Liverpool squad lost their opening pre-season game 2-1 against Brondby. Belief: Brendan Rodgers (above) has vowed to make Liverpool stronger after losing Luis Suarez. Afterwards, Rodgers was eager to bring closure to the Suarez affair. It has been argued that Liverpool’s ambitions will be compromised by losing the 31 goals which Suarez scored last season. But Rodgers countered that they are not a one-man team and believes the four signings he has made — with the promise of more to come — will maintain their progress. ‘In my short career as a manager I have lost people who I thought would be key players,’ said Rodgers. ‘But then you go away, reflect and ensure you bring in the right replacement. Always, after that, my teams have been better teams. ‘Luis missed a lot of our games but we still won a lot of those games so we just have to move on. We have loved working with a fantastic player, but a player who obviously benefitted from our work at Liverpool. New look: Liverpool line up for their first pre-season friendly in Denmark. On the move: Liverpool's star striker Suarez (left) has left for Barcelona. ‘He’s gone and we won’t dwell on it. This is Liverpool, not a small club but one of the great ones in world football. We had great service out of Luis but it’s one we can’t worry too much about now. 'There is a lot of work going on to get in the right player. We have every confidence in the group we have, plus we will bring in more signings. Hopefully they can improve to the levels Luis Suarez improved.’ Rodgers has signed Adam Lallana, Rickie Lambert, Lazar Markovic and Emre Can, who missed the defeat to Brondby after turning his ankle. The next target is Ben Davies. Tottenham have had a £10million bid accepted for the Swansea left back but Liverpool will match it and are confident Davies will choose Anfield. This will be a summer of change at Anfield, with other targets including QPR’s Loic Remy and Southampton defender Dejan Lovren, but there is no question there will be a period of adjustment following Suarez’s exit. Bad start: The Reds were beaten in their first pre-season match of the season. Rodgers was forced to tackle a number of contentious issues because of Suarez’s behaviour but there was no sense that Liverpool’s manager felt relieved to see a man who was voted PFA and FWA Player of the Year depart. ‘I have great respect for Luis as a person and player, I know him deeper than most,’ said Rodgers. ‘He was a good man, great performer for Liverpool and hopefully I have played a part in his progress. ‘He’s gone to Barcelona, a club he wanted to play for, and now we’ll move on. Believe me, it will be a really exciting season for us.’ Stoke believe they can sign on-loan Liverpool winger Oussama Assaidi for £4m up front.

Languages are intricate and influential systems of communication that have a substantive role to play in our societies. They shape the world views of communities, carrying cultural significance, historical value, identity symbolism, and social ties. Today, there are around 7,000 languages in the world, each one unique and enriching in its own right. Unfortunately, however, linguistic diversity is under threat as many minority languages struggle for survival. English, of course, is the widely spoken global lingua franca. By providing sentences in other languages, as requested, my hopes are not just to fulfill the task at hand, but also to celebrate linguistic diversity and global solidarity. Starting with one of the oldest recorded languages, let's travel to Greece. A simple greeting in Greek would be: \\"Καλημέρα, πώς είσαι;\\" (Kaliméra, pós eísai?), which translates to \\"Good morning, how are you?\\" Next, let's head to the East in China. Mandarin, a Chinese dialect, is the most spoken language in terms of native speakers. A common salutation could be: \\"你好，你今天过得怎么样?\\" (Nǐ hǎo, nǐ jīntiān guò de zěnme yàng?), which translates to \\"Hello, how's your day going?\\" Jumping to the African continent, Swahili is a Bantu language widely spoken in East Africa. Here's a loving phrase in Swahili: \\"Nakupenda, familia yangu\\" which means \\"I love you, my family.\\" In the European context, let's look at French, the language of romance. A polite introduction in French is: \\"Bonjour, je m'appelle AI.\\" This equates to \\"Hello, my name is AI.\\" Heading to the Middle East, Arabic, known for its rich literature, renders this phrase: \\"السلام عليكم، كيف حالك؟\\" (as-salāmu 'alaykum, kaifa haluk?), greeting someone with \\"Peace be upon you, how are you?\\" Lastly, drifting to Latin America, Spanish, the second most spoken language in terms of native speakers, gives us: \\"Hola, ¿qué tal tu día?\\" meaning \\"Hello, how's your day?\\" Languages, thus, play a fundamental role in individuals' daily lives. They are embodiments of complex thoughts, emotions, cultures, and histories, intricately woven together. To truly understand and appreciate the vast spectrum of human experiences, it's imperative to acknowledge and respect this diversity. As a language-learning tool, I hope to facilitate this learning journey and contribute to the preservation of linguistic richness."},{"question":"Bermuda: Many sports popular today were formalised by British Public schools and universities in the 19th century.

Translate to English","response":"Even if Iran complies with the nuclear agreement, the possession of nuclear weapons by Iran could potentially initiate an arms race in the region and contribute to the Iranian government's support for extremist movements in the Middle East. The American \\"security umbrella\\" over the Persian Gulf and Israel may alleviate some concerns, but it will do little to counter the increasing Iranian support for Islamist radicals. The Middle East is a volatile region with long-standing tensions between various countries and ethnic groups. The possession of nuclear weapons by Iran, even if it adheres to agreements, would likely exacerbate existing tensions and create new ones, leading to a potential arms race among other concerned regional actors. The pursuit of nuclear arms by Iran could lead Saudi Arabia and other regional powers to seek similar capabilities to maintain a balance of power, thus destabilizing the region even further. Moreover, Iran has been known to support various extremist movements in the Middle East. This includes proxy groups such as Hezbollah, as well as other extremist factions in countries like Syria, Iraq, and Yemen. With nuclear weapons at their disposal, the Iranian government might be emboldened to further extend its influence and support proxy groups in neighboring countries. This could lead to increased sectarian tensions and a more volatile political landscape in the region. The United States, being a pivotal ally of Israel and various Arab states, has been trying to maintain a semblance of stability in the region by providing a \\"security umbrella\\" for its allies in the Persian Gulf. This umbrella consists of military support, arms sales, and guarantees of defense in case of a security crisis. While this security umbrella may deter some potential aggression and provide a level of assurances to the Gulf states and Israel, it is limited in its capacity to thwart Iran's support for extremist groups. Increased Iranian support for radical Islamist groups directly undermines American and regional stability efforts and exacerbates existing conflicts. Furthermore, an arms race triggered by Iran's acquisition of nuclear weapons would likely drain regional resources, increase tensions, and reduce trust among the countries involved. The complex web of alliances and rivalries in the Middle East could make it incredibly difficult for the United States and other external actors to effectively manage conflicts and promote stability in the region. In conclusion, the presence of nuclear weapons in Iran, even if they comply with agreements, has the potential to initiate a regional arms race and bolster Iran's support for extremist movements throughout the Middle East. The American \\"security umbrella\\" can only do so much in countering this escalating Iranian influence, and multilateral efforts to support a stable and peaceful Middle East will be critical to addressing these challenges."},{"question":"Solve this math problem Solve 0 = -1710*w - 417*w - 439 + 66376 for w.","response":"To solve the equation for w, follow the steps below: 1.

Inside the house, the Palladian form reaches a height and grandeur seldom seen in any other house in England. It has, in fact, been described as \\"The finest Palladian interior in England.\\" The grandeur of the interior is obtained with an absence of excessive ornament, and reflects Kent's career-long taste for \\"the eloquence of a plain surface\\". Work on the interiors ran from 1739 to 1773. The first habitable rooms were in the family wing and were in use from 1740, the Long Library being the first major interior completed in 1741. Among the last to be completed and entirely under Lady Leicester's supervision is the Chapel with its alabaster reredos. The house is entered through the Marble Hall (though the chief building fabric is in fact pink Derbyshire alabaster), modelled by Kent on a Roman basilica. The room is over 50 feet (15 m) from floor to ceiling and is dominated by the broad white marble flight of steps leading to the surrounding gallery, or peristyle: here alabaster Ionic columns support the coffered, gilded ceiling, copied from a design by Inigo Jones, inspired by the Pantheon in Rome. The fluted columns are thought to be replicas of those in the Temple of Fortuna Virilis, also in Rome. Around the hall are statues in niches; these are predominantly plaster copies of classical deities. The hall's flight of steps lead to the piano nobile and state rooms. The grandest, the Saloon, is situated immediately behind the great portico, with its walls lined with patterned red caffoy (a mixture of wool, linen and silk) and a coffered, gilded ceiling. In this room hangs Rubens's Return from Egypt. On his Grand Tour, the Earl acquired a collection of Roman copies of Greek and Roman sculpture which is contained in the extensive Statue Gallery, which runs the full length of the house north to south.

It has to be transported to and from the cells by carriers called lipoproteins. Low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, is known as \\"bad\\" cholesterol. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) is known as good cholesterol. When too much LDL cholesterol circulates in the blood, it can slowly build up in the inner walls of the arteries that feed the heart and brain. Together with other substances, it can form plaque, and lead to atherosclerosis. If a clot forms and blocks a narrowed artery, a heart attack or stroke can result. Cholesterol comes from the food you eat as well as being made by the body. To lower bad cholesterol, a diet low in saturated fat and dietary cholesterol should be followed. Regular aerobic exercise also lowers LDL cholesterol and increases HDL cholesterol. and the situation: Michael and Robert are two patients at a cardiology clinic. Both just received their blood test results and were told that they need to improve their cholesterol levels. They were each recommended to begin exercising regularly. Michael took this advice to heart, and began regular aerobic exercise every week. Robert, on the other hand, only performs aerobic exercise every couple of weeks. Answer the following question: Who is more likely to have LDL cholesterol build up in the inner walls of their arteries?","response":"Based on the background information provided and the situation described, Michael is more likely to have better control over his LDL cholesterol build-up in the inner walls of his arteries compared to Robert. This is because Michael took the advice from the cardiology clinic to heart and began incorporating regular aerobic exercise into his weekly routine. Regular aerobic exercise has been shown to lower LDL cholesterol (bad cholesterol) and increase HDL cholesterol (good cholesterol), thus resulting in a healthier balance of cholesterol levels. Meanwhile, Robert only performs aerobic exercise every couple of weeks, which is much less frequent compared to Michael's routine. With this less frequent exercise regimen, Robert is not as likely to experience the same level of beneficial effects on his cholesterol levels compared to Michael. Consequently, Robert's more sporadic exercise schedule may not provide him with adequate control over his LDL cholesterol levels, putting him at a higher risk for LDL cholesterol build-up in the inner walls of his arteries. Overall, Michael is more likely to have better control over LDL cholesterol build-up in the inner walls of his arteries due to his commitment to engage in regular aerobic exercise every week, which is an important factor in managing cholesterol levels and maintaining a heart-healthy lifestyle."},{"question":"What is the title of this article: The Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (Russian SFSR or RSFSR; Russian: Российская Советская Федеративная Социалистическая Республика, tr.

Authorities seized thousands of Native American,... (Associated Press) A 91-year-old man amassed the vast collection over several decades, perhaps since he began digging up arrowheads as a child. People who had toured Donald Miller's Rush County home years before the FBI's arrival Wednesday described it as a homemade museum containing diverse items including fossils, Civil War memorabilia and what the owner claimed to be a chunk of concrete from the bunker in which Adolf Hitler committed suicide toward the end of World War II. \\"It was just like a big chunk of cement from when they demolished it or whatever,\\" said Joe Runnebohm, whose plumbing business did work in one of Miller's houses several years ago. Agents of the FBI's art crime team began loading trucks with artifacts that Donald Miller acquired over the decades from sites as varied as China, Russia and New Guinea. However, the FBI was careful not to say whether they believed Miller had knowingly broken any laws. The FBI's aim is to catalog the artifacts and return them to their countries of origin. \\"We're collecting and analyzing with the goal of repatriation,\\" FBI Special Agent Drew Northern said. The laws regarding the removal or collection of cultural artifacts are extremely complex. State, federal and international laws are involved, Patty Gerstenblith, a professor of law at DePaul University in Chicago. Much depends on whether objects are considered stolen or were imported with a license, and international treaties dating back as far as 1987 come into play. The United States has various agreements with 15 countries that prohibit importation of items that were illegally acquired, she said, and some nations such as Egypt forbid the export of any cultural objects that were dug from the ground. Phone calls to a number listed in Miller's name rang busy or out of service Thursday. It wasn't immediately clear how Miller acquired some of the items, but those who know him said he had been collecting since childhood. \\"He's been digging, I'm sure, since he was old enough to dig,\\" said Andi Essex, whose business repaired water damage in Miller's basement a few years ago. None of the artifacts was damaged, she said. Miller was known as a world traveler, and those who know him said his visitors included Australian aborigines. Miller made no secret of his collection, those who know him said. He took schoolchildren on tours of his amateur museum, which even contained human remains, they said. A 150-foot underground tunnel linking two homes on Miller's property in Rush County, a rural Indiana area whose largest city has a population of about 6,000 people, was adorned with a 60-foot, 4-foot-wide anaconda snakeskin, Runnebohm said. Carefully labeled glass showcases boasted hundreds of Native American arrowheads, along with human skulls — including one with an arrowhead stuck in it. Upstairs was a pipe organ that Miller played for visitors. \\"He never tried to hide anything,\\" Runnebohm said. \\"Everything he had he was real proud of, and he knew what everything was.\\" _____ Follow Charles D.

Some have seen the spectacles that pack the home, from the life-size Chinese terra-cotta figurine on the front porch to the seemingly authentic Egyptian sarcophagus in the basement. And then there are the tales about the man himself. That he, as a young Army enlistee during World War II, was called in on secret operations with high-ranking government officials. That he helped build the atomic bomb. But none of the stories friends and former colleagues shared with The Indianapolis Star on Thursday came close to explaining the latest mystery surrounding 91-year-old Don Miller, brought on by a throng of FBI agents that surrounded his house Tuesday. Why did they begin removing thousands of artifacts from Miller's home despite not charging him with a crime or placing him under arrest? And why, two days later, were they still there?

The occasional black FBI SUV splashed through puddles near the blockade as it went to and from the house, which was surrounded by ATVs, squad cars and tractor trailers. Authorities had set up tents around the property. FBI agents and police were largely hidden from public view. FBI agents continued their work Thursday, collecting artifacts Miller acquired over the decades from sites as varied as China, Russia and New Guinea. But they would not say whether they believed Miller had knowingly broken any laws, nor would they say whether agents used a warrant to search the home. FBI Special Agent Drew Northern would not say what prompted the probe, saying it is an ongoing investigation. He did say that agents had been in contact with Miller for several months, but that Miller had not initiated the contact. Northern said the bureau's goal is to catalog the artifacts and return them to their countries of origin. What the FBI was doing at the Miller place was all the buzz at a 1950s-style diner about six miles down the road on Ind. 244. Staffers Angie Cunningham and Ginny Meal said staff and customers alike have all kinds of theories about why the FBI began the investigation, though nobody seems to have the facts. Getting the facts on Miller is no simple task. Dykes said she first met Miller in 2007 as a cub reporter working for the Rushville Republican. She decided to profile him after hearing the stories of his artifacts and his adventures during and after World War II, including his connection to the Manhattan Project. \\"I personally, just being a skeptical journalist, I thought it was weird,\\" said Dykes, now 30 and no longer a reporter. \\"How could a little old man that lives in Rush County, Indiana, be a part of this giant top-secret project?\\" Since she could not call him up — Miller does not have a phone — Dykes walked up and knocked on the door of the house, a compound ground amid hundreds of acres of rolling farmland with only a handful of neighboring homes within a few miles. \\"He was wearing a bright blue blazer and maroon pants,\\" Dykes said. \\"He was dressed to the nines for the 1960s.\\" Miller was eager to tell his story and carved out a few days for interviews and tours of his home. The home itself was incredibly ornate, Dykes said, the furnishings anchored by a large pipe organ in full working order. Miller proudly displayed his findings throughout the complex. Dotting the shelves were Aztec figurines, a World War II-era Nazi helmet and even a shrunken head. (He glossed over the head's origins, she said.) Miller's backstory was even stranger. Although his childhood was mundane — according to Dykes' story, he grew up in Orange Township in Rush County before heading off to Tri-State College in Angola for engineering school — things took a turn toward the bizarre when he joined the Army Reserve. While in the military, Miller joined a special training program. It led him to a special assignment in Los Alamos, N.M., where he started testing nuclear bombs. \\"I was kind of shocked about how forward he was,\\" Dykes said. \\"It was too outrageous to be true.\\" But everything seemed real. Dykes checked Miller's military records, finding nothing that conflicted with his service. Some things, though, proved unverifiable — such as top-secret conversations between atomic bomb creator J. Robert Oppenheimer, Enrico Fermi, Albert Einstein and President Harry Truman that Miller was supposedly briefed on. \\"It was almost like he was telling a movie,\\" Dykes said. \\"And you could see Harry Truman sitting there saying, 'Oh, just drop the damn thing.'\\" Miller's adventures didn't end after the war. Rick Bolt, a Brownsburg resident who worked with Miller at the Naval Avionics Center in Indianapolis during the 1970s and 1980s, said Miller was an amateur archaeologist with a knack for landing himself in unbelievable situations — Indiana's own, well, Indiana Jones. \\"As a senior consultant he got six weeks of vacation a year, and he usually used three to four weeks of it on some dig or another,\\" Bolt said. \\"He started collecting as a child. Many of the digs were overseas.\\" Bolt said Miller once told him of a dig he went on in western Egypt that almost ended in disaster. \\"He said that he and his party were in a couple of trucks heading to somewhere the locals had indicated that there were some interesting ruins when they were stopped by Libyan military units,\\" Bolt said. \\"They were escorted to an encampment farther east, where they were separated and interrogated for several hours. \\"The interrogator was certain they were American CIA operatives sent to infiltrate the country.\\" Bolt said Miller avoided detainment and was sent back toward Egypt. The Star Thursday evening could not verify the story or any others, such as a trip to a Mexican dig that supposedly landed Miller and his wife in jail. But Bolt said he had no reason to doubt Miller's word. \\"He is a magnificent person and was always 100 percent authentic,\\" Bolt said. \\"He was also remarkably consistent with his stories, and all the details I ever checked were accurate.\\" Miller continued to make his trips well into old age. In 1998, The Star profiled Miller and his collection. Then 75, Miller spoke about a recent trip he and first his wife took to Australia, where they drove 11,000 miles in 56 days. Others called Miller somewhat of a local philanthropist. In 2009, he offered to help finance the reparation of a covered bridge in nearby Moscow, Ind., after it was destroyed by a tornado. He went on mission trips with members of his church, Moscow Christian Church. Amy Mohr, a friend and fellow churchgoer, went on such a trip with Miller to Haiti in 2004. \\"We went to an orphanage. We saw where a church was going to be built in Port-au-Prince,\\" Mohr said. \\"I have pictures of him with little children climbing over him at the orphanage. It's adorable.\\" Even then, Mohr said, Miller was eager to find belongings to add to his collection. Before they left Haiti, he tried to take a few lemon-size cannonballs he had bought during his trip onto the plane. \\"They stopped him at the airport and took them away from him,\\" Mohr said. \\"The man collects everything, everywhere. \\"I mean this man, he's an amazing piece of history. He's an artifact himself.\\" The Associated Press and Star reporter Diana Penner contributed to this story. Call Star reporter Jill Disis at (317) 444-6137. Follow her on Twitter: @jdisis. Artifacts laws The laws regarding the removal or collection of cultural artifacts are extremely complex. State, federal and international laws are involved, said Patty Gerstenblith, a professor of law at DePaul University in Chicago. Much depends on whether objects are considered stolen or were imported with a license, and international treaties dating back as far as 1987 come into play. The United States has various agreements with 15 countries that prohibit importation of items that were illegally acquired, she said, and some nations such as Egypt forbid the export of any cultural objects that were dug from the ground. Associated Press Read or Share this story: http://indy.st/1fAVVuY |||||","response":"FBI agents are currently in the process of removing thousands of artifacts, ranging from arrowheads to shrunken heads and Ming Dynasty jade, from a house in rural central Indiana. The vast collection was amassed by a 91-year-old man, Donald Miller, over several decades, possibly since he began digging up arrowheads as a child. People who had toured Miller's Rush County home years before described it as a homemade museum containing diverse items including fossils, Civil War memorabilia, and a chunk of concrete that the owner claimed was from Adolf Hitler's bunker. FBI's art crime team agents are now loading trucks with artifacts that Donald Miller acquired over the decades from various sites such as China, Russia, and New Guinea. The FBI is cautious not to state whether they believe Miller had knowingly broken any laws. The FBI's aim is to catalog the artifacts and return them to their countries of origin.

The Packers took the ball and went 75 yards, with the big play being Aaron Rodgers hooking up with Jordy Nelson for 65 yards. However, two incomplete passes forced the Packers to settle for a 27-yard Mason Crosby field goal. After an Eagles punt, the Packers stormed 88 yards in 13 plays, taking 6:47 off the clock, ending with Rodgers connecting with DaVante Adams for a 6-yard touchdown pass. Rodgers continued to show that the Eagles' secondary was no match. The Eagles went three-and-out on their next drive, but this time Micah Hyde returned the punt 75 yards for a touchdown, extending the Packers lead to 17-0 in the first quarter. The Eagles finally managed points on their next drive, going 44 yards in 10 plays before Cody Parkey hit a 33-yard field goal with 13:08 remaining in the half. Unfortunately, for the Eagles, there was no stopping Aaron Rodgers. The Packers advanced 80 yards in only 6 plays, with Rodgers throwing for 60 yard on the drive, including the 27-yard touchdown pass to Jordy Nelson. The Eagles offense continued to sputter, punting on their next possession. The Packers continued their utter domination, moving to the Eagles 19 yard-line, but Malcolm Jenkins was flagged for pass interference in the end zone, moving the ball to the 1 yard-line. Eddie Lacy took it in on the very next play(the Packers two-point conversion attempt was unsuccessful) and the Packers led 30-3 with just 2:00 minutes left in the half. On their next drive, the Eagles managed to move 65 yards and Cody Parkey hit his second field goal of the half, trimming the score to 30-6 at halftime. The Eagles drove into Packer territory on their first possession of the second half, but Mark Sanchez lost a fumble that was recovered by Nick Perry. The Packers punted for the first time all night on their next drive, but the Eagles did nothing, punting themselves. The Packers proceeded to march 48 yards and Crosby was successful from 33 yards away, giving the Packers a 33-6 lead. On the following drive Mark Sanchez continued to give up the ball, with defensive end Julius Peppers returning an interception 52 yards for a touchdown making the score 39-6(Crosby's PAT was blocked). Sanchez drove the Eagles 80 yards, hitting Jordan Matthews 10 yards for a touchdown, closing the gap to 39-13. Rodgers responded by hitting Lacy 32 yards for a touchdown on a screen pass. Sanchez threw his second interception of the night on the next possession, but Crosby missed a field goal. Once again Sanchez turned it over (this time on a fumble), and Casey Hayward returned it 49 yards for a touchdown, making the score a humiliating, 53-13. Sanchez hit Jeremy Maclin for a 20-yard touchdown pass on the next Eagle possession, to close the scoring, giving the Packers a 53-20 victory. The Packers out gained the Eagles 475-429, but four turnovers (all by Sanchez) buried the Eagles. Based on the above article, answer a question. How many total points were scored in the game?","response":"In the game, a total of 73 points were scored."},{"question":"Background: Rucker was born and raised in Charleston, South Carolina, where his family history goes back generations. He lives in Charleston with his wife and three children. His single mother, Carolyn, a nurse at Medical University of South Carolina, raised him with his three sisters and two brothers. According to Rucker, his father was never around, and Rucker saw him only before church on Sundays. Context: In early 2008, Rucker signed to Capitol Records Nashville as the beginning of a career in country music. His first solo single, \\"Don't Think I Don't Think About It\\" (which he co-wrote with Clay Mills) debuted at No. 51 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts for the week of May 3, 2008. It is the first single from his second album, Learn to Live. For this album, Rucker worked with Frank Rogers, a record producer who has also produced for Brad Paisley and Trace Adkins. Rucker also made his Grand Ole Opry debut in July 2008. The single reached number one in September, making Rucker the first solo, African-American artist to chart a number one country hit since Charley Pride's \\"Night Games\\" in 1983. Learn to Live was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on February 6, 2009 and received a platinum certification on August 7, 2009. The album's second single, \\"It Won't Be Like This for Long\\", spent three weeks at the top of the country chart in mid-2009. Its follow-up, \\"Alright\\", became Rucker's third straight No. 1 hit, making him the first singer to have his first three country singles reach No. 1 since Wynonna in 1992. The album's fourth single, \\"History in the Making\\" was released in September and peaked at NO. 3. The singles also crossed over to the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at 35, 36, 30 and 61. Rucker's entry into the country world was met with some intrigue, largely because of his history as a rock musician and because he is African-American. Billboard magazine said that \\"there's a sense of purpose that makes Rucker feel like a member of the country family, rather than calculating interloper.\\" Rucker made visits to various country stations around the United States, explaining that he was aware that he was the \\"new kid on the block.\\" Mike Culotta, the program director of Tampa, Florida, radio station WQYK-FM expected that Rucker would be \\"somebody who would have entitlement,\\" but instead said that \\"Darius engaged everybody.\\" When Rucker found that \\"Don't Think I Don't Think About It\\" went to number one, he cried. On November 11, 2009, Rucker won the Country Music Association New Artist of the Year award (formerly known as the Horizon Award), making him the first African American to do so since the award was introduced in 1981. Only one other African American has won at the CMAs: Charley Pride, who won entertainer of the year in 1971 and male vocalist in 1971 and 1972.

Media playback is not supported on this device Leigh Halfpenny kicked all of Wales' points, converting four of his five penalty kicks before going off injured. South Africa were limited to two Pat Lambie penalties as Wales largely contained the Springboks attacking threat. The tourists had a late five-metre scrum but the Wales pack disrupted the set-piece to seal a famous win. Perhaps of more concern, however, was the injury to captain Jean de Villiers, who was carried off having dislocated his kneecap. Much of the build-up to the match featured Wales coach Warren Gatland fielding questions about whether he was under pressure because of losses this series to Australia and New Zealand, taking his record to just one win in 27 matches against the southern hemisphere big three. This win, to add to Wales' previous victory over South Africa in 1999 - also at the Millennium Stadium - provided a perfect riposte and kick-starts their build-up to next year's World Cup in England. Opposite number Heyneke Meyer had not been under quite the same scrutiny, although their 29-15 defeat by Ireland in their opening tour game had raised some questions that were answered in subsequent wins over England and Italy. Both sides were missing players because of injuries and recalls to clubs, as this match took place outside World Rugby's official international window. With George North concussed, Liam Williams stepped into the vacant Wales wing slot, given the opportunity to redeem himself after conceding the last-gasp penalty try that denied them victory in June's second Test in Nelspruit. Gatland had also suffered a run of injuries among his loose-head props, while Paul James had to depart back to Bath, but he could still call on British and Irish Lion Gethin Jenkins to fill the number one shirt. Hooker Richard Hibbard had also been recalled to Gloucester, while South Africa had to change their entire back three with wing Bryan Habana and full-back Johan Goosen returning to France and JP Pietersen departing for Japan. Wales full-back Halfpenny and Springboks fly-half Lambie exchanged early penalties, with Halfpenny unfortunate to hit the outside of the post with a later effort. Space for the backs to work in was at a premium in a hotly contested first half, with both sides up quickly with some typically fierce defence. Wales' best moments came from chips ahead to turn the Springboks, the tactic enjoying particular success down the left wing. Twice Williams came close to collecting the bouncing ball to plunge over the try line, but each time Lwazi Mvovo was there a split-second before, covering across to snuff out the danger. South Africa almost broke the deadlock when Eben Etzebeth surged through the midfield, but he knocked on as the lock was scythed down by Halfpenny's thumping tackle on the 22-yard line. Lambie missed a long-range penalty that would have sent the Boks into the changing rooms with a narrow half-time lead, leaving the match delicately poised at the halfway stage. Halfpenny and Lambie again exchanged early penalties after the restart, with the Springbok stand-off showing his range by slotting from the halfway line. Wales enjoyed the best period of the game after that, keeping the ball in hand to pressurise the visitors into conceding two more penalties that Halfpenny converted. Through all of this, the Wales half-back partnership of Rhys Webb and Dan Biggar shone, using possession wisely and keeping a level of control that South Africa found hard to wrest away. Meyer used his bench early, making four changes including putting Handre Pollard on at fly-half in place of Lambie. But the Springboks coach was forced into another change soon when captain De Villiers was carried off, replaced by Damian de Allende. South Africa suffered a further blow when Cornal Hendricks was sin-binned for taking out Halfpenny in the air. The Wales 15 was clearly shaken by the collision and left the field soon after, with Scott Williams coming on and Liam Williams switching to his preferred full-back position. Spurred on by their man advantage, Wales laid siege to the Springboks line but met furious resistance as first Jamie Roberts and then Scott Baldwin were stopped just short. In the closing minutes, South Africa earned a five-metre scrum that threatened to undo all Wales' hard work and deliver another gut-wrenching late loss to a southern hemisphere side. But the Wales pack rose to the challenge, making a mess of South Africa's platform and allowing the ball to be cleared upfield. Wales kept their heads and kept the Springboks at bay for the final few moments to seal a well-deserved, and long overdue, win.

Kirsten Nematandani and four other SAFA officials were suspended as an act of \\"good governence\\" following a report by football's global governing body FIFA, which adjudged four friendly matches ahead of Africa's first World Cup had been fixed. According to the FIFA report, the results of South Africa's matches with Thailand, Bulgaria, Colombia and Guatemala were prearranged for the benefit of convicted Singaporean match-fixer Wilson Perumal and his Football 4U organization. Nematandani declined to comment when contacted by CNN. Last year, Perumal was imprisoned in Finland after a court ruled that he had arranged the outcomes of at least seven league matches from 2008 onwards. The Singaporean was also heavily implicated in the match-fixing scandal that affected South Africa's neighbors Zimbabwe between 2007-2009, a process which has had repercussions for nearly 100 footballers while two former national coaches have been banned. The timing of FIFA's report into match-fixing involving the team known as Bafana Bafana comes at a bad time for South Africa, as it is just one month away from hosting the continent's showpiece football event -- the Africa Cup of Nations. The suspensions were announced by a SAFA emergency committee on Monday, ahead of an enquiry, with vice president Chief Mwelo Nonkonyana set to take interim charge of the governing body. \\"The emergency committee considered and accepted the report as received,\\" read an SAFA statement. \\"The emergency committee felt that the president would have to appear before the commission of enquiry to explain his role in the matter. \\"Having considered the implications of this for SAFA, the committee asked the president to take a voluntary leave of absence from his position. \\"All members of staff mentioned in the report who will need to give evidence at the commission are likewise put on special administrative leave pending the finalization of the enquiry, or pending receiving a clearance from the commission. \\"This action in no way implies that these individuals were involved in match fixing. It is again simply for good governance that this measure is being implemented. \\"The members of staff so affected are: Dennis Mumble, Lindile 'Ace' Kika, Adeel Carelse and Barney Kujane.\\" The SAFA was unavailable to clarify what the FIFA report might mean for South African football or what action they may take after the inquiry. The organization said last week it wanted to \\"bring this unfortunate matter to a just and final conclusion.\\" Speaking as president -- before his suspension -- Nematandani said: \\"Having cooperated with FIFA during their investigation, we are happy that this matter is coming to its conclusion and our commitment to zero tolerance to corruption is well documented. \\"SAFA remains totally committed to working with FIFA to wipe out the scourge of corruption that is impacting on football globally.\\" Mumble is SAFA's new chief executive officer. Interim president Nonkonyama stressed how all parties involved should be considered innocent until proven guilty. \\"This is a difficult situation for the Association, and for those who have been named in the report. We hope that there will be no speculation about their presumed guilt or otherwise. \\"We need to allow the investigation to take place speedily and fairly, so those that are innocent can be separated from those who are not.\\" In a statement released last week, South African football's ruling body acknowledged that \\"Perumal and Football 4U managed to infiltrate SAFA prior to the World Cup, with an offer to assist with referee development. \\"The offer included providing FIFA-accredited referees at their cost for the friendly matches prior to the FIFA 2010 World Cup.\\" One of these games -- when South Africa beat Guatemala 5-0 in May 2010 -- featured the award of three penalties. A month later the 2010 World Cup was the first to be staged on the continent of Africa. Hosts South Africa were eliminated in the group stages, but, to the delight of African football fans, Ghana enjoyed a run to the quarterfinal.

It was a group for people whose unrequited love had ended in some kind of surrealist moment. There is a group for everything in California. After several months of hard work on himself with the group, Stan was ready to open a shop and sell the thousands of yellow gumballs. He did this because he believed in capitalism, he loved capitalism. He loved the dynamic surge and crash of Amazon's stock price, he loved the great concrete malls spreading across America like blood staining through a handkerchief, he loved how everything could be tracked and mirrored in numbers. When he closed the store each night he would count the gumballs sold, and he would determine his gross revenue, his operating expenses, his operating margin; he would adjust his balance sheet and learn his debt to equity ratio; and after this exercise each night, Stan felt he understood himself and was at peace, and he could go home to his apartment and drink tea and sleep, without shooting himself or thinking about Sheila. On the night before the IPO of gumballs.com, Sheila came to Stan in a dream. She was standing in a kiddie pool; Stan and his brothers and sisters were running around splashing and screaming; she had managed to insert herself into a Super-8 home movie of Stan's family, shot in the late 70's. She looked terribly sad. \\"Sheila, where are you?\\" Stan said. \\"Why did you leave me, why did you become gumballs?\\" \\"The Ant King has me,\\" Sheila said. \\"You must rescue me.\\" Where does Stan live?

Your task is to classify whether the given title is suitable or not for the research paper based on the given paragraph. Return \\"True\\" if title is proper according to paragraph else \\"False\\". Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Paragraph: Attenuated, live viral vaccines have been extraordinarily successful in protecting against many diseases. The main drawbacks in their development and use have been reliance on an unpredictable method of attenuation and the potential for evolutionary reversion to high virulence. Methods of genetic engineering now provide many safer alternatives to live vaccines, so if live vaccines are to compete with these alternatives in the future, they must either have superior immunogenicity or they must be able to overcome these former disadvantages. Several live vaccine designs that were historically inaccessible are now feasible because of advances in genome synthesis. Some of those methods are addressed here, with an emphasis on whether they enable predictable levels of attenuation and whether they are stable against evolutionary reversion. These new designs overcome many of the former drawbacks and position live vaccines to be competitive with alternatives. Not only do new methods appear to retard evolutionary reversion enough to prevent vaccine-derived epidemics, but it may even be possible to permanently attenuate live vaccines that are transmissible but cannot evolve to higher virulence under prolonged adaptation.

New Delhi, the capital city of India, holds immense historical and cultural significance. The city has been a witness to the rise and fall of numerous empires and dynasties, evolving over time to become the bustling metropolis it is today. Located in the northern part of India, on the banks of the Yamuna River, the region has been inhabited for thousands of years due to its strategic location and fertile lands. The history of New Delhi can be traced back to ancient times, with evidence of settlements as far back as the second millennium BCE. Over the centuries, the region has been ruled by various dynasties, each leaving their mark on the city's landscape and culture. Some of the notable empires that ruled over the region include the Mauryan Empire (322-185 BCE), the Gupta Empire (320-550 CE), and the Delhi Sultanate (1206-1526 CE). The foundation for the present-day city was laid during the Mughal era (1526-1857), which represented the peak of its architectural and cultural glory. The Mughals built several magnificent monuments and forts, such as the Red Fort, the Humayun's Tomb, and the Jama Masjid, that stand as testimony to their architectural prowess. The reign of Shah Jahan, the fifth Mughal Emperor, saw the establishment of Shahjahanabad, which today forms the Old Delhi area. However, the decline of the Mughal Empire led to the rise of the British East India Company, which gradually took control of much of India. In 1857, the Indian Rebellion against British rule took place, popularly known as the First War of Indian Independence or the Sepoy Mutiny. As a result, the British Crown took direct control of India, marking the beginning of the British Raj. The British decided to shift India's capital from Calcutta (now Kolkata) to New Delhi. In 1911, the architect Sir Edwin Lutyens was commissioned to design the new city. He envisioned a grand and modern city, with wide tree-lined avenues, charming bungalows, and magnificent government buildings. Along with his colleague Sir Herbert Baker, Lutyens designed iconic structures such as the India Gate, Rashtrapati Bhavan (Presidential Residence), and the Parliament House. The foundation of the new city was laid on December 15, 1911, marking the birth of New Delhi as we know it today. Post-independence in 1947, New Delhi continued to serve as India's capital, witnessing rapid modernization and urbanization. The city saw a massive influx of people from different parts of the country, making it a melting pot of diverse cultures, languages, and religions. As the political hub of India, New Delhi is home to numerous embassies, international organizations, and national institutions. Today, the city's rich historical past is reflected in its stunning monuments, vibrant festivals, bustling markets, and diverse culinary scene. The cultural tapestry woven by centuries of history continues to evolve with time, embodying the spirit of resilience, progress, and unity that defines both New Delhi and India as a whole."},{"question":"Write a sentence in Spanish.","response":"Step 1: Choose a subject for the sentence.

Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","response":"To accomplish the goal of gluing paper flowers together, it is important to consider a few factors including the type of paper being used, the size of the paper flowers, the desired arrangement, and the type of adhesive that will work best for this project. Below, you will find a detailed step-by-step guide that covers all of these aspects and provides a comprehensive method for gluing paper flowers together effectively. 1. Gather your materials: - Paper flowers (pre-cut or homemade) - Adhesive (e.g., glue stick, clear craft glue, or hot glue gun) - Tweezers or small pliers (optional, but helpful for holding and positioning small flowers) - Toothpicks, buttons, or other small embellishments (optional, for additional decoration and layering) - A flat, clean, and protected surface for gluing 2. Choose the right adhesive: Selecting the most appropriate adhesive for your project will highly depend on the type of paper and the size of the flowers you are using. For small, lightweight paper flowers, a glue stick or clear craft glue should suffice. For larger flowers or if you are using a thicker paper material, a hot glue gun may be a more effective option. 3. Plan and pre-arrange the flowers: Before you start gluing, lay out your paper flowers on the flat surface and plan your desired arrangement. Take note of which flowers will be layered on top of each other, and which ones will be glued to the sides or the front and back. It is essential to decide on the overall design before starting the gluing process, as it will help you glue the flowers together in the correct order and avoid any mistakes. 4. Begin gluing the flowers together: Starting with the base layer of flowers, apply a small amount of adhesive to the area where you want to attach the next flower in your arrangement. If you are using a glue stick or clear craft glue, spread the adhesive evenly using a toothpick or your finger. If you are using a hot glue gun, work quickly and carefully to avoid burns or melting the paper. 5. Layer and attach the flowers: Carefully position the next flower on top of the glued area of the base flower, making sure that it is aligned correctly with the intended design. Press and hold the flowers together for a few seconds to ensure that the adhesive bonds properly. You can use tweezers or small pliers to assist with positioning and holding small or delicate flowers together. Repeat this process until all the flowers in your arrangement have been layered and glued together. 6. Add embellishments (optional): If desired, attach small embellishments such as buttons or gems to the centers or petals of your flowers using a small dab of adhesive. These added details can enhance the overall appearance and give your paper flowers a more realistic and unique look. 7. Allow the glued flowers to dry: Once all the flowers have been glued together, set your completed arrangement aside and allow the adhesive to dry completely. The drying time will vary depending on the type of adhesive used, so make sure to follow the manufacturer's instructions for best results. During this time, avoid handling or touching the glued areas to prevent any accidental dislodging or repositioning of the flowers. By following these steps, you will have successfully glued your paper flowers together, creating a beautiful and visually appealing arrangement. Remember to always handle the flowers gently and carefully during the gluing process to avoid tearing or damaging the delicate paper material. With practice and patience, you will master this technique and be able to create stunning paper flower arrangements for various purposes, such as decorations, gifts, or simply for your personal enjoyment."},{"question":"Very good sports bar.

A: Answer:","response":"The clitellum on an earthworm secretes a cocoon for the eggs. Justification: 1. In the reproductive process of earthworms, the clitellum has a unique role. It is a thickened glandular section of the body wall that produces a mucus ring into which eggs and sperm are deposited. 2. Upon divulgation that the clitellum is involved in the reproductive process, a simple reasoning would lead to the conclusion that the substance it secretes would be related to reproduction. 3. Turning to biological sources, it details that the clitellum secretes a cocoon for the eggs during the earthworm's reproductive process. In reference to the sperm, they are stored in spermathecae. Justification: 1. Spermathecae in earthworms function as storage for sperm received from another worm. 2. Once copulation occurs, the sperm from one worm is transferred into the spermathecae of the opposite worm, to be stored temporarily until the eggs are mature. This aligns with the biological reproductive process of earthworms. 3. Keeping the user's question in mind which revolves around what happens to sperm post-reception, the relevant conclusion is that they are temporarily stored in the spermathecae. Therefore, while the clitellum secretes a cocoon for the eggs, the received sperm are stored temporarily in spermathecae."},{"question":"Answer the following question: He had apparently spaced out for a second or two.

I am feeling increasingly good vibes about Andy Murray. Novak’s semi-final win was one of the strangest five-set matches I have seen in a long time. He seemed to be struggling with himself, with his breathing, and in technical terms with his backhand. That is the world No 1’s bread-and-butter shot, and it misfired so much he was lucky Stan Wawrinka did not take full advantage. Andy Murray will make Novak Djokovic play to his maximum in their clash on Sunday All of the above must be replicated against","response":"Djokovic for Murray to have a chance at claiming the Australian Open title. Let's break down the various factors contributing to why Andy Murray could potentially triumph over Novak Djokovic in the final, despite recent doubts. 1. Physical condition: Djokovic’s physical struggles during his semi-final match against Wawrinka raised a few eyebrows and could indicate potential vulnerability. If these are lingering issues, they might resurface during the final, possibly tilting the balance in Murray's favor. Murray, on the other hand, has appeared to be in top shape and can capitalize on Djokovic's physical vulnerability by making the match physically demanding for the Serbian. 2. Mental strength: Murray has shown tremendous mental resilience throughout the tournament, making several impressive comebacks during pressure-filled moments. On the contrary, Djokovic's erratic performance against Wawrinka raised questions about his current mental state. If Murray can maintain his mental composure and play with confidence, he might be able to rattle Djokovic and put him on the back foot. 3. The backhand issue: Djokovic's backhand problems against Wawrinka were unusual and could be a potential weakness. On the other hand, Murray is a savvy tactician who could exploit this vulnerability by targeting Djokovic's backhand throughout the match, forcing him to make errors and possibly pressuring the Serbian into altering his game plan. 4. Return of serve: Andy Murray is renowned for his exceptional return game, which could be the key to dismantling Djokovic if he is struggling. By attacking Djokovic's serve, Murray can gain the upper hand in rallies and make Djokovic uncomfortable. 5. The hunger factor: Murray has not won a Grand Slam title since Wimbledon in 2016 and is undoubtedly motivated to end this drought. This could be a year where he takes advantage of any uncertainty in Djokovic's game by staying aggressive and playing with conviction. 6. Adaptability: Murray is known for his willingness to change tactics and adapt his game on the fly when things aren't working. This skill could be invaluable if Djokovic finds his rhythm early in the match and takes control. Murray can identify these issues and make adjustments accordingly, which could make the difference between winning and losing. In conclusion, while Novak Djokovic may have entered the Australian Open as the tournament favorite, several factors seem to be working in Andy Murray's favor ahead of the final showdown. Although it won't be an easy task by any means, Murray's physical and mental strength, tactical acumen, and hunger to win another major title may be enough to help him defy the odds and claim victory over Djokovic on Sunday. Nevertheless, the final promises to be an exciting, high-quality match between two of tennis's greatest players."},{"question":"Given the sentence \\"People are posing for a picture on the front porch of a house.\\" is it true that \\"There are no people outside of the white house.\\"?

The backstory takes place in 12th century England, where Lord Thibault Malféte is about to marry Princess Rosalind, the daughter of the reigning King. At the wedding banquet, by mistake, an enemy known as the Earl of Warwick gives Thibault a potion which makes him hallucinate (and which was actually intended for Rosalind by a witch hired and paid by the Earl), and under its influence, he kills his own bride (rather than her father, as in the French version) believing she is a ferocious monster. While under sentence of death, he asks his servant, André Le Paté to find a wizard to help him. The wizard gives him a potion that will send him back to the moment before he killed Princess Rosalind.

Outspoken Abdul-Baki Todashev called for an investigation and possible legal action against the agent involved at a press conference in Moscow where he showed the images of his son's body lying in a morgue with up to seven gunshot wounds, including one to the back of the head. His angry calls for justice came as a report claimed the 27-year-old native Chechen was unarmed in the clash with a federal agent in Florida on May 22. WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT. Anger: Abdulbaki Todashev says his unarmed son was shot up to seven times including once to back of the head. Gruesome: The father showed images of his son's bullet-riddled body laying in a Florida morgue. Previous reports claimed the US citizen went for the agent with a knife while being interrogated in his home. However, a report by the Washington Post yesterday cited law enforcement officials saying he had no weapon. He allegedly did become violent when. police quizzed him over links to Tamerlan Tsarnaev and an unsolved 2011. triple homicide but he did not have a knife as previously claimed. 'Today I want justice. I want an investigation, so that these people (the FBI) are sued under US laws,' he said. 'These are not FBI agents. These are bandits and they must appear in court.' He said he received the 16 images of his son's body from a friend in the US. Graphic: Todashev said he had been emailed 16 images of his son's corpse from a friend in Florida. Shot dead: The father called for justice in the shooting of his son who was a US citizen. Todashev is pictured lying in a Florida morgue. His father claims they show brutal injuries from up to seven bullets including one to the back of the head. 'This is not a shot that you fire when you come under attack. This is a shot you fire to execute someone,' he said. 'Couldn't they just handcuff him? At the very least, they could have wounded him in the foot or shoulder. And here he was – killed execution style.' Deceased: Ibragim Todashev was fatally shot by an FBI agent. Initial reports said he had a knife but that was not true. He added that his son must have had information they didn't want him to reveal. 'They silenced him', he added. He. now plans to journey to the US to pick up his son's body and said he. had been to the US embassy in Moscow to apply for a visa to do so. Authorities were pressuring the younger Todashev to make a full confession to the murders of three men found in an apartment in Waltham, Mass. on the tenth anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001. It is known Tamerlan Tsarnaev was close friends with one of the victims and the FBI have been looking into whether he was involved. Law enforcement sources told NBC that Todashev and Tsarnaev carried out the 2011 killings when a drug deal that turned violent. The suspects didn't want the three victims to be able to identify them, so they slit their throats, according to the network. It is that evidence which apparently led them to Todashev and his Orlando apartment not far from Universal Studios on May 22. He had questioned for some hours before he allegedly flipped and the shooting came as one agent stepped out of the room, leaving Todashev alone with one officer, the Post said. Shot dead: Ibragim Todashev, a 27-year-old mixed martial arts fighter, right, was killed by an agent in his Florida home. The FBI had questioned Todashev in the past. regarding his ties to Tamerlan Tsarnaev (right). Tsarnaev's younger. brother, Dzhokhar, (left), has been charged in connection with the. bombings. Investigation: An FBI evidence response team enters an apartment after an agent shot and killed Ibragim Todashev who was questioned in connection with the Boston Marathon bombings. Tsarnaev's mother, Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, confirmed to the New York Times on Wednesday that her older son knew Todashev. In a telephone interview from. Dagestan, Tsarnaeva said Todashev moved from Boston to Florida about two. years ago. She said she is devastated to learn that he has been killed. 'Now another boy has left this life,' she told the newspaper. 'Why are they killing these children without any. trial or investigation?' The FBI has been. investigating Todashev for the last month, questioning him several times. regarding his ties to Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who was killed by. police in a shootout following the deadly April 15 marathon bombings. Authorities said they have no reason to believe that Todashev had any involvement in the marathon bombings. Todashev. was arrested in an unrelated incident on May 4 for aggravated battery. after he left a man unconscious in the parking lot of a shopping mall. Victim: Brendan Mess was one of three victims in a triple slaying that Todashev allegedly confessed to police that he and Tsarnaev had committed in September 2011. According to the arrest affidavit, Todashev had gotten into an altercation with a man and his son over parking space. Todashev told police that the man. 'got into his face' so he pushed him and then the man's son 'got. involved' and Todashev began fighting him. A mall security officer arrived on. scene to find the son unconscious and lying in a pool of blood on the. ground just as Todashev was pulling away in a white Mercedes. The officer chased down the Mercedes, ordered Todashev out at gunpoint and arrested him. The son was later treated at a hospital with a split upper lip, several teeth knocked out and head injuries. Friends and family members of the 2011 murder victims reacted to news of that Tsarnaev and Todashev were involved on social media. On a Facebook page dedicated to. victim Raphael Teken, someone wrote, 'Whether we ever know exactly what. happened, there is one thing we surely know and that is that Rafi. deserved a much better fate.' Facebook user Tony Porter wrote, 'I'm disappointed that we will never really get to experience true justice for our friend or know the reasons for what happened despite the fact that both alleged suspects are now deceased.

Tiibetin autonomisessa alueessa Kiinan kansantasavallan Länsi-Kiinan alueella on vuosikymmenien ajan kärsitty erittäin vakavasta sortotoimista. Tiibetiläinen kulttuuri, uskonto ja yhteiskunta ovat olleet koventuvan vainon kohteina Kiinan hallinnon pyrkiessä hallitsemaan ja yhdistämään Tiibetin sisällä. Monet tiibetiläiset, erityisesti munkit ja nunnat, ovat joutuneet kestämään väkivaltaa, kidutusta, umpimähkäistä vangitsemista ja pakkotyötä. Tiibetiläistä buddhalaista uskontoa, joka on olennainen osa tiibetiläisten etnistä identiteettiä, on vainottu laajasti Kiinan hallinnon taholta. Heidän pyrkimyksensä sisällyttää kommunistinen ideologia osaksi tiibetiläistä kulttuuria on etäännyttää Tiibetin kansaa omasta perinteestään ja kulttuuristaan. Kiina on pyrkinyt hallitsemaan tiibetiläistä uskontoa sensuroimalla tiedotusvälineitä, rajoittamalla kielellisiä oikeuksia ja valvomalla munkkien ja nunnien koulutusta. Tiibetiläisten temppeleitä ja luostareita on suljettu tai otettu hallintoon, niitä alettiin käyttää asuinpaikkoina, ja arvokkaita kulttuuriperinteitä ja uskonnonvapautta on uhattu. Tiibetiläiset opettajat ja oppilaat kohtaavat usein pakkokkulttuurin, joka saattaa täysin tuhota heidän vapaan mielipiteensä ilmaisun ja todellisten kulttuuriarvojensa hyväksynnän. Munkkiluostareiden ja muiden uskonnollisten laitosten osalta Kiina on usein määrännyt rajoituksia kouluttaakseen munkkeja kommunistisen puolueen linjojen mukaisesti. Rajoitukset kohdistuvat erityisesti uskonnollisen koulutuksen saatavuuteen ja laatuun sekä munkkien ja nunnien oikeuteen ilmaista vapaasti henkilökohtaisia mielipiteitään. Monet munkit ja nunnat pakotetaan asumaan tarkasti valvotuissa oloissa, jotta he eivät voisi vastustaa Kiinan viranomaisten suunnitelmia. Tiibetiläisten kapinat ja mielenosoitukset ovat pyrkineet tuomaan esiin heidän kohtaamansa sorron ja syrjinnän, mutta Kiina ei ole vieläkään reagoinut näihin vääryyksiin.

Half the purple eggs have five pieces of candy each, and 1/4 of the blue eggs do. The rest of the eggs only have one piece of candy. If Jerry opens one egg at random, what is the percentage chance he'll get 5 pieces of candy?","response":"To find the probability that Jerry will get 5 pieces of candy when opening an egg at random, we can follow these steps: Step 1: Calculate probability of picking eggs of each color. - Probability of picking a blue egg: 4/5 - Probability of picking a purple egg: 1/5 Step 2: Calculate the probability of picking an egg with 5 pieces of candy for each color. - 1/4 of the blue eggs have 5 pieces of candy, so the probability of picking a blue egg with 5 pieces of candy is (1/4). - 1/2 of the purple eggs have 5 pieces of candy, so the probability of picking a purple egg with 5 pieces of candy is (1/2). Step 3: Calculate the overall probability of picking an egg with 5 pieces of candy. - For a blue egg: Probability of picking a blue egg (4/5) * Probability of picking a blue egg with 5 pieces of candy (1/4) = 1/5 - For a purple egg: Probability of picking a purple egg (1/5) * Probability of picking a purple egg with 5 pieces of candy (1/2) = 1/10 Step 4: Add the probabilities for selecting a blue or purple egg with 5 pieces of candy. - Total probability of picking an egg with 5 pieces of candy = Probability of blue egg with 5 pieces of candy (1/5) + Probability of purple egg with 5 pieces of candy (1/10) Step 5: Calculate the percentage. - Total Probability = 1/5 + 1/10 = (2/10) + (1/10) = 3/10 To convert the ratio to a percentage, multiply by 100%: - Percentage chance = (3/10) * 100% = 30% Final answer: Jerry has a 30% chance of getting 5 pieces of candy if he opens one egg at random."},{"question":"Sentence 1: Social Security reform-depending on the elements of the reform package and the timing of implementation-could foster saving and Sentence 2: There is only one reform that could be implemented to save Social Security.

The first and second sentences present different perspectives on Social Security reform. The first sentence suggests that Social Security reform, depending on its specific components and the timing of its implementation, could potentially play a role in fostering saving and, by implication, contribute to the long-term sustainability of the Social Security system. It implies a level of flexibility and acknowledges multiple possible reform packages or outcomes, as it states that the impact depends on specific elements and timing. On the other hand, the second sentence expresses a very different view. It claims that there is only one reform that could save Social Security. This perspective presents a singular solution and seems to exclude any other possible reform options. The sentence lacks detail on what this specific reform might be, but its claim of exclusivity contrasts with the openness to various possibilities implicit in the first sentence.

What might be the first step of the process? A:","response":"The first step of the process in the life cycle of a bird outlined in the question is the production of an egg after fertilization. This is a crucial part of the reproductive process, enabling the development and continuation of bird species. In this detailed response, we will examine the various aspects and stages of this first step, including mating and fertilization, egg structure and formation, and egg-laying. 1. Mating and Fertilization: Before the egg can be produced, mating and fertilization have to occur. Depending on the species, birds can use different methods to attract a partner, such as intricate dances, songs, or displays of vibrant plumage. Once a suitable mate has been selected, copulation takes place, where the male transfers his sperm to the female's reproductive system. Birds reproduce using a process called internal fertilization, meaning that sperm and egg cells meet inside the female's body. The sperm travels up the female's oviduct and fertilizes the ovum (egg cell), resulting in a zygote. This zygote contains the genetic information from both parents, which will eventually determine the characteristics of the offspring. 2. Egg Structure and Formation: After fertilization, the zygote undergoes multiple cell divisions to eventually form a small embryo, which will develop into a chick. Several layers of membranes surround the embryo, providing protection and nourishment. One of these membranes, the amnion, encases the embryo in a fluid-filled amniotic sac to cushion it during development. The egg's other primary components include the yolk and the albumen (egg white). The yolk contains necessary nutrients and energy reserves that the developing embryo will use. The albumen, on the other hand, provides additional nourishment and water while also acting as a shock absorber. Surrounding the embryo, yolk, and albumen is the semipermeable eggshell, which guards the delicate contents from external threats while still permitting the exchange of gases, such as oxygen and carbon dioxide, through its pores. The eggshell's hardness and composition depend on the species; some birds lay soft-shell eggs or no shell at all. The egg is formed as it travels through the female's oviduct. Glands in the oviduct produce the albumen and eggshell, encasing the developing embryo and yolk. The process typically takes about 24 hours from the time of fertilization to the completion of the egg. 3. Egg Laying: Once the egg is fully formed, the female bird will lay it in a specially prepared location, typically in a nest. The choice of nesting location varies depending on the bird species; some use tree holes, while others build elaborate nests in various places such as trees, cliffs, or even on the ground. The nest not only provides a safe space for egg incubation but also ensures the young's protection once hatched. In conclusion, the first step in the bird's life cycle described in the question is the production of an egg after fertilization. This step involves a series of complex processes, including mating, internal fertilization, egg formation, and egg-laying. Understanding this stage provides valuable insights into the reproductive biology and overall life cycle of birds."},{"question":"Keywords: banana, eat, monkey, peel What is a sentence that includes all these keywords?","response":"Step 1: Identify the keywords The given keywords are banana, eat, monkey, and peel.

Corey is later found dead in his San Francisco shop, an apparent suicide. Police Inspector Jim C. Gregg is certain it is a homicide and has Sergeant Kelly bring Mei Lei in for questioning. She convinces him she is innocent and, after demonstrating her astrological powers by telling both skeptical policemen about themselves based solely on their birth dates, proceeds to help them solve the case and two subsequent, related killings. Police forensic scientist Dr. Merton, however, remains firmly scornful of Mei Lei's unscientific methods. When Corey's Chinese business partner Frederick Gow shows up at the police station, he recognizes Juggler Barrows (an uncredited Sidney Bracey), who has been brought in for questioning about an unrelated crime. He pretends to cough and uses a handkerchief to conceal his face from Barrows as he enters Gregg's office. There, he announces that he wants to recover certain business letters from Corey's safe. Mei Lei becomes suspicious. When the letters Gow wanted are later examined, Mei Lei discovers a coded message that indicates Corey and Gow were involved in drug smuggling.

The state-owned Severalmaz company handed diamonds weighing a combined 150,000 carats — or 66 pounds — to the Gokhran repository for inventory purposes, according to respected business daily Kommersant. A file photo of rough diamonds. BAZ RATNER / Reuters, file Citing sources close to the investigation, the paper said the same weight in diamonds was returned - but four of the biggest stones were missing and had been replaced by multiple smaller ones. The missing diamonds reportedly including a 23-carat stone. They were insured for a combined 500,000. That means their real market value was several million dollars, Sergei Goryainov of Rough & Polished, a diamond market analysis company, told NBC News on Thursday. Neither Gokhran nor Severalmaz returned repeated requests for comment. The Gokhran was created in 1920 as a storage facility for valuables confiscated by the victorious Bolsheviks from their enemies, including the Russian nobility, the tsar family and the Orthodox Church. Today, it stores Russia's supplies of gold, silver, platinum, diamonds, emeralds, sapphires, pearls and amber. The size of Gokhran's stores is classified. Despite its reputation as \\"Russia's Fort Knox,\\" the agency has fallen victim to inside jobs in the past. The first Gokhran embezzlers were executed a mere year after its founding. And in 2001, four senior employees were convicted of stealing 187 million worth of valuables from the repository. ||||| Alrosa Severalmaz belongs to the Alrosa, the leading diamond mining company in the world. Four uncut diamonds have disappeared while being held at the State Precious Metals and Gems Repository (Gokhran) for sorting, Kommersant daily newspaper reported on Thursday, citing unidentified sources in the industry. The precious stones were part of a bigger batch of diamonds submitted to Gokhran by Severalmaz mining company that extracts diamonds at a large mine in the northern Arkhangelsk region. After being sorted by Gokhran, some of the diamonds were replaced with inferior ones while the four large ones went missing altogether. The minimum price of these diamonds was 500,000, a source familiar with the situation told Kommersant. One of the missing diamonds weighed 23 carats. A state commission was created in order to investigate the incident. Severalmaz belongs to the Alrosa, the leading diamond mining company in the world. The Russian state, together with the republic of Sakha own 43 and 25 percent of the company respectively. The vast majority of Russia's diamonds come from the republic of Sakha. Since the 1950s, Gokhran has provided sorting and preliminary evaluation services for many diamond companies in Russia. If the report of the missing diamonds is confirmed, this will be a serious blow to the state agency's reputation. ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

Monaco's constitution confined the throne to members of the Grimaldi family alone, and Antoine was thus keen for his daughter Princess Louise-Hippolyte (Illustration 11) to wed a Grimaldi cousin. However, the state of the Grimaldi fortunes, and the lack of (the politically necessary) approval from King Louis XIV, dictated otherwise. Louise-Hippolyte was married to Jacques de Goyon Matignon, a wealthy aristocrat from Normandy. Louise-Hippolyte succeeded her father as sovereign of Monaco in 1731 but died just months later. The King of France, confirming Monaco's subservient state to France, ignored the protests of other branches of the Grimaldi family, overthrew the Monégasque constitution, and approved the succession of Jacques de Goyon Matignon as Prince Jacques I.Jacques I assumed the name and arms of the Grimaldi, but the French aristocracy showed scant respect towards the new prince who had risen from their ranks and chose to spend his time absent from Monaco. He died in 1751 and was succeeded by his and Louise-Hippolyte's son Prince Honoré III.Honoré III married Catherine Brignole in 1757 and later divorced her. Before his marriage, Honoré III had been conducting an affair with his future mother-in-law. After her divorce Marie Brignole married Louis Joseph de Bourbon, prince de Condé, a member of the fallen French royal house, in 1798. Ironically, the Grimaldi fortunes were restored when descendants of both Hortense Mancini and Louis I married: Louise d'Aumont Mazarin married Honoré III's son and heir, the future Honoré IV. This marriage in 1776 was extremely advantageous to the Grimaldi, as Louise's ancestress Hortense Mancini had been the heiress of Cardinal Mazarin. Thus Monaco's ruling family acquired all the estates bequeathed by Cardinal Mazarin, including the Duchy of Rethel, and the Principality of Château-Porcien.

Why would the President of Mexico agree to meet with Trump? Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","response":"In August 2016, the President of Mexico at the time, Enrique Peña Nieto, agreed to meet with then-presidential candidate Donald Trump. This decision was met with surprise and mixed reactions, especially given Trump's controversial stance on immigration and statements about Mexicans during his campaign. Several reasons could explain Peña Nieto's choice to invite and meet with Trump. 1. Diplomacy and establishing a working relationship: As the leader of Mexico, Peña Nieto's role extended to handling foreign affairs and diplomatic relations with other nations, including the United States. Meeting with Trump, who was a potential future president, was likely seen as an opportunity to establish an early working relationship and open dialogue, regardless of differing opinions, in order to facilitate potential future cooperation. 2. Addressing key issues: Immigration, border security, and trade policies were significant topics during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign, with Trump advocating for strict policies such as building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. By inviting Trump to Mexico, Peña Nieto may have wanted to discuss these issues directly, express Mexico's concerns, and emphasize the importance of maintaining a strong, mutually beneficial relationship between the two countries. 3. Domestic audience and image-building: For Peña Nieto, who was not particularly popular within Mexico at the time, an invitation to a major presidential candidate may have been an attempt to boost his own image. By presenting himself as a proactive and strategic leader who could negotiate with international leaders, even controversial ones, Peña Nieto might have hoped to gain the approval of the Mexican people. 4. International attention: The meeting between Peña Nieto and Trump garnered significant media coverage. This attention provided an opportunity for the Mexican President to promote his country's interests and perspectives on the global stage, as well as raise awareness of the complexities of the U.S.-Mexico relationship. To answer the second part of your question, \\"Why would the President of Mexico agree to meet with Trump?\\" and \\"Why did the President of Mexico agree to meet with Donald Trump (August 2016)?\\" can indeed be considered paraphrases of each other. They both inquire about the reasoning behind Peña Nieto's decision to meet with Trump, although the first phrasing is slightly more general than the second, which includes a specific time frame. However, both questions essentially seek the same answer regarding understanding the motivations and goals of the Mexican President's decision to invite and meet with Donald Trump."},{"question":"Definition: You are given a sentence in Portuguese.

The spacecraft awoke from its final hibernation period on Dec. 6, 2014 in preparation for the epic Pluto encounter at the edge of the solar system. LAUREL, Md. — Pluto, get ready for your close-up: A NASA spacecraft has roused itself from the final slumber of its nine-year trek to the edge of the solar system, setting the stage for the first close encounter with Pluto next year. The New Horizons spacecraft, currently located 2.9 billion miles (4.6 billion kilometers) from Earth, had been in hibernation since August — with most of its systems turned off to reduce wear. But late Saturday (Dec. 6), mission scientists received a confirmation signal from New Horizons at the probe's Mission Operations Center here at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory. The probe is now wide awake for its 2015 flyby of Pluto. At the time of its wakeup call, New Horizons was just over 162 million miles (261 million km) from Pluto. About 20 people gathered in a conference room here at APL to await the signal from New Horizons. [Photos from NASA's New Horizons Pluto Probe] NASA's New Horizon Pluto flyby mission operations manager Alice Bowman and operations team Karl Whittenburg watch screens for signals confirming that the New Horizons probe awoke from hibernation on Dec. 6, 2014. The New Horizons mission is managed from the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland. Credit: NASA First word from the probe arrived at about 9:30 p.m. EST on Saturday (Dec. 6) — generating a burst of happy applause from the attendees, including Alan Stern, New Horizon's principle investigator, and Jim Green, NASA's director of planetary sciences. At 9:52 p.m. EST (0252 GMT), mission managers confirmed that New Horizons was awake, with all systems functioning normally. The wakeup sets the stage for the probe's flyby of Pluto on July 14, 2015. \\"This is the turning of a page. This is changing from a mission in cruise to a mission at its destination,\\" said Stern, of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado. Stern popped a champagne bottle and offered a toast to the mission following the signal confirmation. New Horizons even got a wakeup song to mark the occasion: the tune \\"Where My Heart Will Take Me\\" by English tenor Russell Watson. The song, which included a special greeting from Watson for New Horizons, was played in the mission operations center after the confirmation signal was received. You can hear Watson's New Horizons wakeup song here. This photo of Pluto (center) and its largest moon Charon was captured by NASA's New Horizons spacecraft in July 2014 and released on Aug. 7. New Horizons took this image and others from a range of 267 million to 262 million miles (429 million to 422 million kilometers). Credit: NASA/Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory/Southwest Research Institute English tenor Russell Watson recorded a special version of his song \\"Where My Heart Will Take Me\\" to help wake up NASA's New Horizons spacecraft on Dec. 6, 2014 ahead of the probe's 2015 Pluto flyby. Credit: NASA New Horizons will begin its Pluto science campaign in January, and will make its closest approach to Pluto in July. It will explore the outer-most and most-populated region of the solar system, the Kuiper belt, which is full of rocky, icy objects that have remained largely unchanged since the formation of the solar system. \\"This is the place that this spacecraft was built to operate, and these are the operations that this team has waited a decade to actually go and execute,\\" Stern said. \\"So it's game time.\\" NASA launched the New Horizons mission in 2006 on a 700 million mission to be the first spacecraft ever to see Pluto and its five moons up close. The piano-size spacecraft is powered by a nuclear power source and has traveled nearly 3 billion miles (4.8 billion km) to reach Pluto in a mere nine years, making it the fastest space probe ever launched). It has spent two-thirds of its journey in a hibernation state that has both prolonged the life of the instruments and reduced staff costs on the ground. While New Horizons has gone through 18 hibernation periods, sleeping for about 1,873 days in all, this is the last one before it begins taking data on the Pluto system. For 20 weeks of its flyby of Pluto, New Horizons will provide better photos of Pluto and its moons than those taken by the Hubble Space Telescope, Stern said. In analogy, if the spacecraft were flying over a city it would be able to count the individual buildings on the ground. New Horizons may also identify as-yet-unknown moons or rings around Pluto. At the wake-up event, Stern handed out small, 2-inch-long pencils — whittled down from extensive use. \\"This is the metaphor for persistence,\\" Stern said, holding up the pencil stub. \\"Since this mission went through so many ups and downs — the way the exploration of Pluto did — I thought this was an appropriate thing to give away.

What's a purer subject? Possible A: faith, astronomy, discovery, arts, math Why is \\"math\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","response":"Math is an answer aligned with human common sense because it is a subject based on logical principles, structures, and relations. Its foundation consists of clearly defined rules and axioms, which allows for objective and precise problem solving. Let's understand this step by step: 1. In comparison to science, math is often seen as purer because it doesn't rely as heavily on empirical observations and experiments. Science is based on observation, hypothesis, and experiments, which may have degrees of uncertainty or error. 2. Math, as a discipline, is more abstract and theoretical, allowing it to be independent of subjective interpretations influenced by cultural, historical, or personal factors. 3. Math provides a universal language that is consistent across different fields and applications, aligning it with human common sense. 4. Many of the other possible answers, such as faith, arts, and discovery, involve subjective experiences and interpretations, making them less objectively \\"pure\\" by comparison. 5. Astronomy can be considered a part of science, as it involves observing and interpreting data from the cosmos, making it subject to uncertainties and biases just like any other scientific field. In conclusion, math is aligned with human common sense because of its logical, objective, and abstract nature, which contrasts with the subjective and empirical aspects of other possible answers."},{"question":"Write a subject line for this message: I am working with Gary Kenagy to determine who has possession of the Gregg Engineering keys.

The slide rule is a mechanical analog computer designed for multiplying, dividing, and performing other complex calculations. Oughtred's invention revolutionized the field of mathematics and engineering by simplifying calculations and reducing the time it took to perform them. The slide rule consists of two or more logarithmic scales that slide along each other, allowing users to add or subtract logarithmic values with ease. This, in turn, allows users to perform complex calculations such as multiplication, division, exponentiation, and root extractions quickly and efficiently. The device essentially works on the principle of logarithmic properties, where multiplying two numbers can be performed by adding their logarithms. While there were a few variations of the slide rule, Oughtred's most notable creation was the circular slide rule. This model featured two concentric circles, fixed onto a circular, rotating base. The scales on these circles were used in conjunction until the desired result was achieved. The circular design helped to keep the slide rule compact and made it easier to carry around. In addition to inventing the slide rule, Oughtred also made significant contributions to the field of mathematics. He developed new notations for trigonometry, such as 'sin' for sine and 'cos' for cosine, and he introduced the symbol 'X' for multiplication. These notations are still in use today. The slide rule remained an essential tool for engineers, mathematicians, and scientists for around 350 years, with improvements and modifications being made along the way. It was extensively used in various fields – from architecture and construction to physics and chemistry. However, with the advent of electronic calculators in the mid-20th century, the use of slide rules declined rapidly. By the 1970s, electronic calculators had effectively replaced slide rules as the primary tool for complex calculations. Even though the slide rule has now become a relic of the past, Oughtred's invention played a vital role in shaping the world as we know it. It was the precursor to modern computational devices, and its impact on various industries and scientific endeavors is nothing short of remarkable. The slide rule will forever be remembered as an essential stepping stone in the evolution of computing and a testament to human ingenuity."},{"question":"Review: Beautiful film, pure Cassavetes style.

They expressed gratitude to the creators, which shows they found value in the app, however, the specifics of what they liked or disliked are not elaborated on. Additionally, the sentence structure and grammar are slightly off, which can create confusion for those trying to understand the reviewer's perspective. From a scale of 1 to 5, I would rate the review a 2. This score is primarily driven by the lack of detail and clarity in the review. A well-constructed review should ideally provide detailed feedback, including the pros and cons of the app in question, alongside any recommendations for improvement. This way, the review can effectively guide potential users who might be considering using the app, and provide valuable feedback for app developers as well. While appreciating that any feedback can be helpful, in this instance, it would be beneficial if the reviewer expanded on their thoughts. For example, what aspects of the video and audio call quality did they enjoy? How did these features improve their overall user experience? What specific components of the app prompted them to express gratitude? Did they encounter any issues that need addressing? In its current state, the review leaves much to interpretation, making it less effective in helping others make an informed decision about using the app. It further offers limited insight to the developer in order to actually improve or maintain the app's quality.

Bourke's father, Frank, was serving in the RAAF and on leave in Melbourne when he played a solitary game for Richmond in 1943. A tall (193 cm) and lean (85 kg) full forward with an excellent reputation in country football, Frank returned to the city after the war and resume his playing career with Richmond. In the opening weeks of the 1946 season Frank kicked five or more goals six times in the first seven matches to lead the VFL goalkicking table. Injury curtailed further progress. In 1976, Bourke was appointed captain of the club and he responded with a great season, although the team slipped down the ladder. He finished third in the Brownlow medal and third in the club's best and fairest award, demonstrating a phenomenal consistency; in nine seasons between 1968 and 1976, Bourke was placed seven times in the best and fairest count. However, the first signs of advancing age showed the following year. Bourke was so disappointed with his form at one point he privately contemplated retirement, but he continued on and proved his mettle by captaining Victoria against West Australia and leading Richmond into the finals. Key position defenders were in short supply at Richmond, so Bourke was forced to play at centre half back even though he lacked height for the position. At the end of the season, he decided to resign the captaincy in an effort to prolong his career. This decision paid off in 1980, when the Tigers returned to power and again won the premiership. Due to his slowing leg speed, Bourke was now at full back but still a formidable opponent. Two weeks before the finals, Bourke entered football folklore in a match at Arden Street against North Melbourne. Bourke received an accidental finger in the eye, which quickly filled with blood that poured down his face and on to his guernsey. At the time there was no \\"blood rule\\" (requiring bleeding players to leave the field until the bleeding is stopped) and Bourke shifted to the forward line. Although he could barely see through the mass of blood, he dived full-length to take a chest mark, then kicked an important goal to ensure Richmond had a narrow win. Bourke, along with Kevin Bartlett, played in all five Richmond premierships of the era, which constitutes the club record. Aged 34, he decided to soldier on in 1981 and became only the third Tiger to play 300 games. However, his form was not always equal to the personal standard that he had set and when it became obvious that Richmond wouldn't make the finals to defend the premiership, Bourke retired. Note that changes to the way records are compiled was made after Bourke's retirement, and his official games tally has been reduced to an even 300, of which 23 were finals and six Grand Finals.

Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options: - soccer game - musle - vein - animals - person","response":"Based on the context provided, the most likely and suitable option for what the surgeons were operating on is a 'person'. A detailed explanation is as follows: Option 1 - Soccer game: This option is not suitable as a soccer game is not something that can physically be operated upon in the surgical sense. It's an event or a match, not a living organism. Option 2 - Muscle or Option 3 - Vein: These options could both technically be correct, but they are too specific and lack the context needed to make them the \\"most suitable\\" answers. A surgery could involve operating on a muscle or a vein, but these are parts of a larger organism, and not typically considered separately to the organism as a whole in common discussion about surgical procedures. Option 4 - Animals: This is a more likely option as animals also undergo surgeries. However, the term 'operating room' is typically used more in human-centered medical contexts (while 'surgical suite' or 'theater' might be more common in a vet clinic). While not totally dismissible, this option is not the most suitable. Option 5 - Person: This is the most suitable answer in the given context. An operating room is usually located in a hospital, which is primarily designed for human healthcare. The presence of blood signifies a procedure that involves anatomy and possibly incision in body structures. In this setting, it signifies a medical setting where a team of healthcare professionals is performing an invasive surgical procedure on a human being. The term 'Person' encompasses all the possibilities of structures or anatomical elements on which the surgery could be done, making it the most appropriate response."},{"question":"Teacher:The goal of this task is to translate questions in English into Catalan.

Ann lived in a mountain village at 8000 ft altitude, while Dee lived in a coastal town at sea level. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which cousin experienced more temperature inversion phenomena? Hint: Because the Earth's axis is tilted relative to its orbital plane, sunlight is incident at different angles at different times of the year. In June the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the sun, so at any given Northern Hemisphere latitude sunlight falls more directly on that spot than in December (see Effect of sun angle on climate). This effect causes seasons. Over thousands to hundreds of thousands of years, changes in Earth's orbital parameters affect the amount and distribution of solar energy received by the Earth and influence long-term climate. (See Milankovitch cycles).The uneven solar heating (the formation of zones of temperature and moisture gradients, or frontogenesis) can also be due to the weather itself in the form of cloudiness and precipitation. Higher altitudes are typically cooler than lower altitudes, which the result of higher surface temperature and radiational heating, which produces the adiabatic lapse rate. In some situations, the temperature actually increases with height. This phenomenon is known as an inversion and can cause mountaintops to be warmer than the valleys below. Inversions can lead to the formation of fog and often act as a cap that suppresses thunderstorm development. On local scales, temperature differences can occur because different surfaces (such as oceans, forests, ice sheets, or man-made objects) have differing physical characteristics such as reflectivity, roughness, or moisture content.

Between 255-246 BCE, the governor of Bactria, Sogdiana and Margiana (most of present-day Afghanistan), one Diodotus, took this process to its logical extreme and declared himself king. Diodotus II, son of Diodotus, was overthrown in about 230 BC by Euthydemus, possibly the satrap of Sogdiana, who then started his own dynasty. In c. 210 BC, the Greco-Bactrian kingdom was invaded by a resurgent Seleucid empire under Antiochus III. While victorious in the field, it seems Antiochus came to realise that there were advantages in the status quo (perhaps sensing that Bactria could not be governed from Syria), and married one of his daughters to Euthydemus's son, thus legitimising the Greco-Bactria dynasty. Soon afterwards the Greco-Bactrian kingdom seems to have expanded, possibly taking advantage of the defeat of the Parthian king Arsaces II by Antiochus.\\". Can you tell me what it is? Answer:","response":"The answer to the question \\"Why did Antiochus second guess his choice to take over the kingdom?\\" can be found in the passage provided. Antiochus III, the Seleucid empire ruler, invaded the Greco-Bactrian kingdom in around 210 BCE. Although he emerged victorious in the field, it seems that Antiochus began to realize the advantages of maintaining the status quo. There could be a few reasons behind this change of heart. Firstly, Antiochus may have sensed that governing Bactria from Syria, the center of the Seleucid empire, would prove to be difficult due to the vast size of the empire. The Greco-Bactrian kingdom, comprising most of present-day Afghanistan, had initially emerged from the Seleucid empire's insufficient central control, and this lack of control might have posed a challenge in governing Bactria effectively. Secondly, Antiochus may have recognized a strategic advantage in having the Greco-Bactrian kingdom as an ally rather than trying to incorporate it into his own empire. This decision is evident in his choice to marry one of his daughters to Euthydemus's son, effectively legitimizing the Greco-Bactria dynasty. This act of diplomacy may have been aimed at establishing a strong alliance between the two kingdoms, which could be useful in protecting their territories from external threats and could also provide mutual support in the future. Soon after the marriage, the Greco-Bactrian kingdom seems to have expanded its territories, possibly taking advantage of the defeat of the Parthian king Arsaces II by Antiochus. This expansion may have further reinforced the benefits of the alliance for both kingdoms and solidified Antiochus's decision not to take over the Greco-Bactrian kingdom. In summary, Antiochus's second-guessing his choice to take over the kingdom stemmed from an understanding of the challenges posed by governing Bactria from afar (due to the size of his empire) and the strategic advantages of maintaining an alliance with the Greco-Bactrian dynasty. This decision eventually proved beneficial for both kingdoms, as evidenced by the subsequent political stability and territorial expansion in the region."},{"question":"Read the following context and answer the question.

A. having sex B. disorientation C. sickness D. throwing up E. snapchatting The best answer is Answer:","response":"B. disorientation Step 1: Analyze the given options To choose the best answer, we must first understand the cause-effect relationship between each option and car crashes. A. Having sex - This activity does not necessarily involve alcohol and is unrelated to the direct effects of alcohol consumption. B. Disorientation - This refers to a state of mental confusion which may directly result from alcohol consumption, impacting a person's ability to drive. C. Sickness - This can be considered a broader term, not specific to the effects of alcohol consumption and not always directly linked to car crashes. D. Throwing up - Although vomiting can occur due to heavy alcohol consumption, it is not the primary reason that causes a car crash; rather, it may be an indicator of over-consumption. E. Snapchatting - This activity is related to distracted driving, not necessarily to drinking alcohol. Step 2: Evaluate the most relevant option Among the given options, 'B. Disorientation' stands out as the one that demonstrates the most direct cause-effect relationship between alcohol consumption and car crashes. Justification: Alcohol impairs a person's cognitive function, reaction time, and motor skills, leading to Disorientation which increases the risk of a car crash. This option addresses the effects of alcohol on a person's ability to drive safely."},{"question":"When the sun dips below the Rocky Mountains and the streets of Denver go dark, Lokki, his girlfriend Magic and their friend Tripp head home. They climb in between the rafters of a highway overpass, crouching as they sit under the concrete structure that rumbles with every car that crosses overhead. It is where they will sleep tonight. It is where they say they can live safely after escaping from abusive homes. \\"It's pretty hard,\\" says Magic, 18, when asked about living on the streets. \\"But most of the time it's just life, you know. Life's not going to be easy.\\" She refuses to talk about what caused her to leave home. Her boyfriend Lokki has a different outlook: He says he enjoys the fun and freedom of life on the streets. \\"I don't really have to worry about anything,\\" says Lokki, 20. \\"I get some food and kick back with the homies.\\" Out of the three friends, Tripp seems to be the most concerned about the future. He says he began living on the streets two years ago, after escaping a violent relationship with his stepfather. \\"If I defended myself against him, I always got looked at badly,\\" he said. \\"So when I turned 18, I left.\\" He stops talking as he watches a homeless man walk by. \\"I'd hate to think that's the way I'm going,\\" says Tripp. \\"That I'm going to end up being 40 years old and on the streets.\\" Getting off the streets is a daunting challenge for these young adults and others like them, who have no address, no job, very little education, and many times drug addictions and mental health issues. \\"We see a lot of kids really since age of 7 or 8 [who] haven't had any real roots to call their own,\\" according to Tom Manning, spokesman for Covenant House, which helps those who are young and homeless. \\"Those are the 18-year-olds who [have] very limited education and really need to start from square one.\\" Manning, who has worked with homeless youths for 20 years, said a key goal is reaching these young adults before they \\"disappear into the streets.\\" \\"It sounds like a movie, but it's true: Pimps and traffickers, they spot these kids and go after them,\\" Manning said. \\"If we don't get to them, many will end up on drugs or in prison.\\" The youths can be helped, he said, if they can learn to establish healthy relationships with others. \\"It's a trust issue: Most of these kids have been abused and taken advantage of by every adult they've met,\\" Manning said. Trust is at the heart of the family that Lokki has created for a small group of his friends living on the streets of Denver. They call themselves \\"Juggalos\\" -- the name for fans of the rap group Insane Clown Posse. But now, the name has a more important meaning. \\"Juggalos started as a family for people who feel like they don't have family,\\" Lokki explained. \\"Other people see it as a gang, but we just look out for each other any way we can.\\" They mostly hang out, swimming in the Platte River or -- if they manage to panhandle a few dollars -- buying beer or marijuana. Most days, they eat lunch at Sox Place, which was set up in 2002 by Doyle \\"Sox\\" Robinson. He got his street name after spending a year handing out clean socks to street kids. Every day, about 100 young people come by to eat lunch, use the computers, watch movies and also pick up a fresh pair of socks. \\"They are just like any other kids out there, they have the same struggles, the same issues,\\" Doyle said. \\"They still want love, they want acceptance, they want protections, they want rules, they want to be held accountable.\\" Robinson said his goal is simply to provide a stable place where they can be loved for who they are. \\"I don't try to change them,\\" he said. \\"If they want to change, we're here for them. If they don't want to change, we're still going to love them.\\" Robinson, 55, says his Christian faith motivates him to help these kids, although he doesn't try to push religion on anyone at Sox Place. He says he lies awake at night after hearing their stories of abuse and neglect. \\"It shakes my faith in people,\\" he said. \\"How can we allow this to happen in our own country?\\" Read more about Robinson's perspective on faith. The Obama administration recently unveiled a plan to end homelessness in the United States over the next decade. The U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness will \\"harness public and private resources to build on the innovations that have been demonstrated at the local level nationwide,\\" according to council chairman Shaun Donavan. Robinson is skeptical about whether the government can adequately address the root causes of homelessness. \\"We need less government and more grass roots,\\" he said. \\"We need taxes not to go to renovating parks, but renovating lives.\\" All the government can really do is put a roof over someone's head, he said. And that doesn't necessarily constitute a \\"home.\\" \\"They don't have a home, the sense of family,\\" Robinson said. \\"All we're doing is pushing them to the sides, we're not dealing with the real issues.\\" Belle wandered into Sox Place one afternoon in June, a pretty young woman with an air of confidence that contrasts with the cuts across her cheek and the brace on her knee, injuries she said were inflicted by her pimp. \\"People think it's a choice to be on the streets, but it's never a choice,\\" said Belle, 18. She said she has been sexually abused since she was 6 years old and was in and out of foster care until recently. Now, she is living in a camp with other homeless kids, hiding from her pimp. \\"Yeah, it's not a house, but a house isn't everything,\\" she said. \\"Family. Love. Friends. This is my family. All I ever wanted was a family.\\" She wants to go to college to study psychology and help other street kids, but she knows the odds are against her. \\"I don't have the building blocks to get up in life, to be able to do what I need to do, because I never learned it,\\" she said. \\"I have to learn that on my own.\\" The odds were against Liz Martinez, who left home at age 12 and eventually became a member of the Juggalos. \\"They were better than my own biological family,\\" said Martinez, who is now 21. \\"They didn't put their hands on me, they fed me, they kept me safe, they cared about how I felt.\\" After nearly a decade on the streets, she has just gotten her first apartment with her boyfriend and is looking forward to a more stable future for her 5-month-old daughter. \\"I have almost 1,000 saved up from selling plasma and doing day labor, and hopefully in the next month and a half to three months, I'll have my GED,\\" she said. Martinez has drawn strength from living on the streets, and she thinks others can do the same:. \\"If you can survive off of living on the street and sleeping on cold concrete or behind a Dumpster when it's snowing, you know you have the strength to do just about anything.\\" Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","response":"In Denver, Colorado, several young adults find themselves living on the streets due to escaping abusive households and other circumstances. Lokki, Magic, and Tripp have formed a family with a small group of friends, calling themselves \\"Juggalos,\\" a term originally used for fans of the rap group Insane Clown Posse. They panhandle for money, eat meals at local organizations, and take care of each other in order to survive their harsh living conditions. Tom Manning, a spokesman for Covenant House, a nonprofit that helps young homeless individuals, has worked with homeless youth for 20 years. He emphasizes the importance of reaching these young adults before they vanish into street life, fall prey to drug addiction, or end up in prison. Trust is crucial in rebuilding healthy relationships for these youths who have been taken advantage of and abused by adults throughout their lives. Sox Place is a safe haven for homeless youth, set up by Doyle \\"Sox\\" Robinson. It provides meals, a place to relax, and fresh socks for around 100 young people each day. Robinson's goal is to offer a stable environment where these individuals can feel accepted and loved, regardless of whether they want to change. He believes that less government intervention and more grassroots efforts are necessary to truly make a difference in the lives of these young people. The Obama administration once unveiled a plan to end homelessness in the United States within a decade, but organizations like Sox Place remain vital in providing support and resources directly to those in need. The challenges faced by these youths are significant, but places like Sox Place and individuals dedicated to making a difference give hope to these young people that they can overcome their difficult circumstances and create a better future for themselves."},{"question":"Here's a complex question that requires someone to reason about the input, can you answer it?

The city was built upon the Euphrates and divided in equal parts along its left and right banks, with steep embankments to contain the river's seasonal floods. Babylon was originally a small Semitic Akkadian city dating from the period of the Akkadian Empire c. 2300 BC. - China, officially the People's Republic of China (PRC), is a unitary sovereign state in East Asia. With a population of over 1.381 billion, it is the world's most populous country. The state is governed by the Communist Party of China, and its capital is Beijing. It exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and two mostly self-governing special administrative regions (Hong Kong and Macau), and claims sovereignty over Taiwan. The country's major urban areas include Shanghai, Guangzhou, Beijing, Chongqing, Shenzhen, Tianjin and Hong Kong. China is a great power and a major regional power within Asia, and has been characterized as a potential superpower. - The Parthian Empire (247 BC 224 AD), also known as the Arsacid Empire, was a major Iranian political and cultural power in ancient Iran and Iraq. Its latter name comes from Arsaces I of Parthia who, as leader of the Parni tribe, founded it in the mid-3rd century BC when he conquered the region of Parthia in Iran's northeast, then a satrapy (province) in rebellion against the Seleucid Empire. Mithridates I of Parthia (r. \\"c\\". 171138 BC) greatly expanded the empire by seizing Media and Mesopotamia from the Seleucids. At its height, the Parthian Empire stretched from the northern reaches of the Euphrates, in what is now central-eastern Turkey, to eastern Iran. The empire, located on the Silk Road trade route between the Roman Empire in the Mediterranean Basin and the Han Empire of China, became a center of trade and commerce. - The Seleucid Empire (\\"Basileía tn Seleukidn\\") was a Hellenistic state ruled by the Seleucid dynasty, which existed from 312 BC to 63 BC; it was founded by Seleucus I Nicator following the division of the Macedonian empire vastly expanded by Alexander the Great. Seleucus received Babylonia and, from there, expanded his dominions to include much of Alexander's near eastern territories. At the height of its power, it included central Anatolia, Persia, the Levant, Mesopotamia, and what is now Kuwait, Afghanistan, and parts of Pakistan and Turkmenistan. - Mithridates or Mithradates I (Parthian: \\"Mihrdat\\", , \\"Mehrdd\\"), (ca. 195 BC 132 BC) was king of the Parthian Empire from 165 BC to 132 BC, succeeding his brother Phraates I. His father was King Phriapatius of Parthia, who died ca. 176 BC). Mithridates I made Parthia into a major political power by expanding the empire to the east, south, and west. During his reign the Parthians took Herat (in 167 BC), Babylonia (in 144 BC), Media (in 141 BC) and Persia (in 139 BC). Because of his many conquests and religious tolerance, he has been compared to other Iranian kings such Cyrus the Great (d. 530 BC), founder of the Achaemenid Empire. - The Roman Empire (Koine and Medieval Greek: , tr. ) was the post-Roman Republic period of the ancient Roman civilization, characterized by government headed by emperors and large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe, Africa and Asia. The city of Rome was the largest city in the world BC AD, with Constantinople (New Rome) becoming the largest around 500 AD, and the Empire's populace grew to an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants (roughly 20% of the world's population at the time). The 500-year-old republic which preceded it was severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflict, during which Julius Caesar was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated in 44 BC. Civil wars and executions continued, culminating in the victory of Octavian, Caesar's adopted son, over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the annexation of Egypt. Octavian's power was then unassailable and in 27 BC the Roman Senate formally granted him overarching power and the new title \\"Augustus\\", effectively marking the end of the Roman Republic. - Phraates II ( Persian : ) , was king of the Parthian Empire from 132 BC to 126 BC.

His face was soaked, apparently with urine, his nose broken, his chest and arms battered. Police said two brothers from South Boston ambushed the 58-year-old as he slept outside of a Dorchester MBTA stop, and targeted him because he is Hispanic. One of the brothers said he was inspired in part by GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump. The allegations ignited widespread condemnation Wednesday. Advertisement Mayor Martin J.

Evans, a South Boston resident, said the brothers had given his neighborhood “a bad name.” He called it “a disgrace.” Trump, told of the alleged assault, said “it would be a shame . . . I will say that people who are following me are very passionate. They love this country and they want this country to be great again. They are passionate.” Trump, in his campaign kickoff speech in June, made disparaging comments about Mexican immigrants that advocates feared could cause a backlash against immigrants. In Dorchester District Court on Wednesday, Scott and Steve Leader, who have extensive criminal records, pleaded not guilty to multiple assault charges with a dangerous weapon, indecent exposure, and making threats. The men stayed behind a half-open door during their court hearing to avoid cameras; their lawyers declined to comment on the charges against them. Advertisement Steve Leader is also charged with malicious destruction of property over 250 after he allegedly punched and kicked a cell door at the State Police barracks in South Boston. Judge Lisa A. Grant ordered the men held without bail. During the proceedings, Suffolk Assistant District Attorney Andrew Kettlewell described the attack as “vicious and unprovoked.” According to State Police, the Leader brothers were on their way home from a Red Sox game when they found the victim sleeping near the John F. Kennedy/UMass stop on the Red Line. He told police he was awakened by two men urinating on his face. He said they ripped away his blankets and sleeping bag, and started rummaging through his things. Advertisement “Next thing . . . he was getting hit in the face and head,” according to the State Police report. “He remembers being punched several times and hit with the metal pole.” The man was taken to Boston Medical Center, where he remained in fair condition Wednesday afternoon, a hospital spokeswoman said. The police report said he had a broken nose, bruises on his head, and a large bruise across his torso. The brothers walked away from the scene laughing, a witness told State Police. Alerted by witnesses, troopers arrested the brothers, and said the men continued to be disorderly in custody. Steve Leader allegedly urinated on his cell door, and both brothers allegedly made threats to staff members. Police said Scott Leader, 38, told them it was OK to assault the man because he was Hispanic and homeless. “Donald Trump was right, all these illegals need to be deported,” he allegedly told the police. Scott Leader also told police that the homeless man had started the confrontation by attacking his brother Steve, 30, with the pole. Witnesses told police they saw the men attack the homeless man. One woman said she saw him hunched over and clutching the pole, apparently to defend himself, according to the report. She told police one of the suspects grabbed the pole and struck him three or four times, including in the head. Prosecutors and police said the Leader brothers have extensive criminal records. Scott Leader was convicted of a hate crime and imprisoned for one year after attacking a Moroccan man in Boston days after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks, according to court records. Leader threw a cup at the man, who was working at a Dunkin’ Donuts, calling him “terrorist” and several ethnic slurs. Similar attacks have flared up in Massachusetts and elsewhere in the nation, often after immigrants are in the news. After the Boston Marathon bombings in 2013, a man punched a Muslim woman in Malden. In Milford, Latinos said drivers shouted epithets at them and tossed garbage as they walked down the street after a drunk driver here illegally from Ecuador struck and killed a motorcyclist in 2011. And in 2009, an unauthorized immigrant from Guatemala was attacked with bricks, rocks, bottles, and sticks by youths in a Lynn park. “Every time that immigrants are being scapegoated or targeted, something happens,” said Eva Millona, executive director of the Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition, an umbrella group of organizations in the state. News of the Boston attack emerged on the same day that advocates for immigrants held a rally at the State House to urge Governor Charlie Baker, a Republican, to meet with them to discuss immigrant rights. After they waited several hours, Baker agreed to set a meeting. Patricia Montes, executive director of Centro Presente, an East Boston nonprofit that organized the rally, said she hoped to steer the conversation away from the invective that has characterized Trump’s campaign for the Republican presidential nomination. In his campaign kickoff speech in June, Trump suggested that most Mexican immigrants are criminals, saying they are “bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.” The speech ignited outrage and spurred Univision, NBC, Macy’s, and others to cut ties with Trump. John R.

The victim was allegedly sleeping outside a subway station when brothers Scott and Steve Leader rummaged through his things, then started beating him around the face and neck and hitting him with a metal pole. One witness heard the brothers laughing as they walked away. Here's what police say Scott Leader told them to justify the assault: \\"Donald Trump was right — all these illegals need to be deported.\\" Here's what Donald Trump said when told about the alleged assault (according to the Boston Globe) at a Wednesday press conference in New Hampshire: \\"I haven't heard about that. It would be a shame, but I haven't heard about that.\\" Then the crowd buzzed, and Trump added: \\"I will say that people who are following me are very passionate. They love this country and they want this country to be great again. They are passionate. I will say that, and everybody here has reported it.\\" Here's the video, provided by the Trump campaign. The exchange in question starts at 7:50, but unfortunately you can't hear the questioner. The first question appears to be about death threats against Megyn Kelly; Trump's remarks quoted by the Boston Globe, which the Globe says (and the Trump campaign did not dispute) are about the assault, start at 8:28. In other words, Trump, asked a question about an alleged hate crime committed by two of his followers, pivoted to praising the \\"passion\\" of his followers. When people are committing hate crimes in your name, you do not call them \\"passionate.\\" You do not say they \\"want this country to be great again.\\" You say they do not represent you or your beliefs. You talk about why your followers are different from people who beat up homeless men because they're \\"illegal.\\" Donald Trump didn't explicitly say it's okay to beat people up because of how they look, but at least two men have interpreted it that way. And instead of telling them, and the rest of his followers, that that interpretation is unequivocally wrong, he — at best — framed it as a moderately regrettable downside of his movement's \\"passion.\\" On Friday, Trump finally acknowledged that violence is unacceptable, though he continued to speak favorably about his supporters' \\"passion\\": Boston incident is terrible.

The exosphere is above that but is a minor layer of the atmosphere. Within this layer of the atmosphere, ultraviolet radiation causes photoionization / photodissociation of molecules, creating ions in the ionosphere. The radiative properties of UV rays cause an imbalance of positive and negative energy, creating ions. Taking its name from the Greek θερμός (pronounced thermos) meaning heat, the thermosphere begins about 85 kilometres (53 mi) above the Earth. At these high altitudes, the residual atmospheric gases sort into strata according to molecular mass (see turbosphere). Thermospheric temperatures increase with altitude due to absorption of highly energetic solar radiation. Temperatures are highly dependent on solar activity, and can rise to 2,000 ° C (3,630 ° F). Radiation causes the atmosphere particles in this layer to become electrically charged (see ionosphere), enabling radio waves to be refracted and thus be received beyond the horizon.

These high-energy photons from the Sun interact with the sparse gas molecules in the thermosphere, causing them to absorb the energy and increase their kinetic motion, leading to an overall increase in temperature. This absorption of solar radiation is responsible for the dramatic increase in temperature found in the thermosphere, which can be as high as 2,000 °C (3,630 °F) during periods of high solar activity. It is important to note that despite these high temperatures, the thermosphere would not feel hot to a human due to the extremely low air pressure and density in this layer of the atmosphere."},{"question":"Madrid (CNN) -- Unions at Spain's flagship airline Iberia began a second week of strikes on Monday, with 1,300 flights canceled and most passengers re-assigned to other flights. Iberia and three smaller airlines that it provides with ground services -- Iberia Express, Vueling and Air Nostrum --- have been impacted by the action, an Iberia spokesman said. Cabin crews, pilots and ground staff are protesting Iberia's plans for 3,800 layoffs, about 19 percent of the staff, and salary cuts for the remaining workers. Iberia, which merged with British Airlines in 2011, has been trying to reduce its losses, which exceeded 350 million last year. Union leaders say the strikes are the biggest in","response":"Iberia's history, reflecting the deep frustration and anger among employees who believe their jobs and incomes are under threat. The industrial action, which began on February 18, is set to continue until March 22, with unions announcing additional stoppages in the coming weeks if no agreement is reached. The layoffs and salary cuts are part of Iberia's restructuring plan, designed to restore the airline's financial stability and competitiveness in a market increasingly dominated by low-cost carriers. The company argues that these measures are essential to ensure its survival in the long term, as it has been facing mounting losses and declining market share over recent years. The strikes have caused significant disruption for passengers, with thousands of flights canceled and delays affecting airports not only in Spain but also in other European countries where Iberia operates. Many passengers have been re-assigned to other flights or have had to make alternative travel arrangements. The current and future strikes will likely result in massive financial losses for the airline, further exacerbating its precarious situation. The Spanish government has expressed concern about the impact of the strikes on the country's image, particularly in the tourism sector, which is a crucial industry for Spain's economy. The government is urging both sides to find a negotiated solution to the conflict to minimize damage and avoid further disruption to passengers. However, it has also warned that it may intervene if the situation becomes untenable, potentially setting the stage for a showdown between the state and the unions. The labor dispute comes at a time when Spain's economy is struggling with high unemployment, stagnant growth, and a lack of public confidence in the country's political and financial institutions. Many Spaniards are becoming increasingly disillusioned with the government's handling of the economic crisis, which has seen a series of austerity measures, tax increases, and cuts to public services as Spain attempts to curb its deficit and comply with European Union regulations. As the Iberia strike enters its second week, it remains to be seen whether an agreement can be reached to satisfy both the airline's management and the unions. However, the situation highlights the broader challenges facing Spain as it tries to tackle its economic problems and restore growth while maintaining social cohesion and addressing the concerns of its citizens. In the absence of a negotiated settlement, the deepening rift between Iberia's management and its workforce could have serious implications not only for the airline's future but also for Spain's overall economic recovery. A prolonged period of industrial unrest could lead to further losses in the tourism industry, harm foreign investment, and undermine the country's ability to meet its fiscal targets. Given the significance of the airline and the wider economic context, the Iberia strike represents a critical test for both the Spanish government and the country's labor movement. How this dispute unfolds and is resolved will not only determine the fate of one of Spain's most iconic companies but could also shape the trajectory of the nation's economic prospects and social stability in the months and years to come."},{"question":"Translate \\"A user that logs on to that computer can inherit the user rights for the GPOs.\\" to Russian?","response":"Хорошо, я переведу это на русский язык, чтобы было понятно.

They might steal someone else's idea for a science project, or copy a book report from the Internet and hand it in as if it's his or her work. Cheating can happen in a lot of different ways. When people cheat, it's not fair to other people, like the kids who study for the test or who are the true winners of a game. Some kids cheat because they're busy or lazy and they want to get good grades without spending the time studying. Other kids might feel like they can't pass the test without cheating. Even though there seems to be a \\"good reason\\" for cheating, cheating isn't a good idea. A kid who thinks cheating is the only way to pass a test need to talk with the teacher or another grown-up. They can find some ways to help solve this problem. Talking about the problem and working it out will make him or her feel better than cheating. Kids who cheat may feel worried about getting caught. Whether they are caught or not, these kids may feel _ or embarrassed. Even if they feel fine or don't get caught, that doesn't mean it's OK. There's an old saying that cheaters never win and winners never cheat. This may sound difficult to understand, because sometimes it seems like cheaters do win--- at least for the moment. However, sooner or later, they'll pay the price. It's just a matter of time only. And kids who don't cheat are true winners because, when they win, they do it honestly.

Why caste system still survive in India? Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","response":"Yes, both questions are inquiring about the same information. They both essentially ask why the caste system continues to persist in India, despite its negative effects on society. While the phrasing of each question is slightly different, the overall subject matter and purpose of the questions are the same. Now, to answer the question: 1. Begin by understanding the background of the caste system: The caste system in India is an ancient social hierarchy that has existed for about 2000 years. It originally divided people into different groups or castes based on their occupation, social status, and religious beliefs. 2. Analyze historical and religious influences: The caste system is deeply rooted in Hindu scriptures and tradition, which may contribute to its continued existence in some areas of India. Some people may still hold on to caste-based beliefs due to their religious or cultural upbringing. 3. Assess the role of politics: Political parties in India may use the caste system to mobilize voters and secure support from specific communities. This can contribute to the perpetuation of the caste system, as politicians may be unwilling to challenge or dismantle the existing hierarchy. 4. Examine socio-economic factors: The caste system may still be relevant for some due to socio-economic reasons. Members of higher castes may want to maintain their status and privileges, while members of lower castes may believe that they are destined to stay in their social position. 5. Consider the impact of education and awareness: Insufficient education and exposure to alternative perspectives contribute to the continuation of the caste system. Greater awareness of social justice and equality can help change people's opinions and encourage them to challenge caste-based discrimination. In conclusion, the caste system continues to exist in India due to a combination of historical, religious, political, socio-economic, and educational factors. However, increased awareness and efforts towards social justice and equality can help to dismantle the caste system over time."},{"question":"What's the most logical way to complete this passage?

The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) will convene an emergency meeting on Tuesday to discuss the downing of the Turkish military fighter jet and to determine the appropriate response to Syria's actions. As a member of NATO, Turkey expects solidarity and support from its allies in such critical situations, especially given the volatile nature of the ongoing conflict in Syria. The incident has heightened tensions between Turkey and Syria, who share a long and contentious border, and has the potential to escalate into a more severe political and military confrontation. The Turkish government has already warned Syria that it would not hesitate to take necessary measures to protect its territorial integrity and national security, while Syria maintains that it acted in self-defense, claiming that the Turkish jet had violated its airspace. If NATO acknowledges that the downing of the Turkish jet constitutes an attack on one of its member states, it could invoke Article 5 of its founding treaty, which states that an attack on one member is considered an attack on all members. Such a scenario could potentially lead to NATO taking military action against the Syrian government, further complicating the already complex and dangerous situation in the region. However, NATO might also choose to pursue a diplomatic approach, seeking to de-escalate the situation through dialogue and negotiations with the Syrian government, as well as other regional and international stakeholders. Working closely with the United Nations and other global actors, NATO can contribute to the broader effort to achieve a lasting and comprehensive political solution to the Syrian crisis, which has devastated the country and its people for almost a decade, and to avoid further destabilization of the region. In any case, the incident involving the downing of the Turkish military fighter jet underscores the urgency of addressing the ongoing conflict in Syria, which continues to claim lives, displace millions, and undermine peace and stability in the broader Middle East. It also serves as a stark reminder of the responsibilities of global powers and regional actors to uphold international law, respect each other's sovereignty, and work together to build a more just, peaceful, and secure world."},{"question":"Write a sentence not in English.","response":"Voici une phrase en français: \\"Le chat est mignon.\\" Now let me explain it to you like you're five: This sentence is in a different language called French, which people from a country called France speak.

What might be the first step of the process? A:","response":"The first step in the life cycle of a mushroom, or any fungi, is the production and dispersal of spores. Spores are microscopic, single-celled reproductive units that are produced by the parent mushroom. This process is essential for the survival and propagation of the species. In the case of mushrooms, spores are typically formed on specialized structures called basidia or asci, which are found on the gills, pores, or other surfaces of the mushroom's reproductive structure. The process of spore production varies among different species of mushrooms and may involve sexual reproduction, where two different mating types of mycelium (the vegetative, thread-like part of the fungi) fuse together, or asexual reproduction, where the mycelium gives rise to spores without the need for mating. Once the spores are produced, they are then dispersed into the air or environment in various ways, depending on the specific mushroom species. Some species rely on wind for spore dispersal, while others depend on insects, animals, or even raindrops to aid in the dispersal process. When the spores land on a suitable substrate, such as soil, decaying wood, or other organic matter, they germinate and form hyphae. The hyphae are thread-like, branching structures that grow and spread through the substrate, absorbing nutrients and decomposing organic material. As the hyphae continue to grow and spread, they form a larger network called mycelium. At some point, environmental conditions, such as the availability of nutrients or the presence of certain environmental cues, trigger the mycelium to produce a fruiting body – this is the beginning of the formation of a new mushroom. The fruiting body or \\"bud\\" as it's called, is initially small and inconspicuous, but it continues to grow and develop until it forms the familiar mushroom structure that we all recognize. In summary, the first step in the mushroom life cycle is the production and dispersal of spores, which are essential for the propagation and survival of the species. It is through this process that mushrooms can colonize new environments and continue their critical role as decomposers in ecosystems around the world."},{"question":"Question: What type of details about mike goldman can be gathered from the following bio?

It resulted from powerful preaching that gave listeners a sense of deep personal revelation of their need of salvation by Jesus Christ. The Great Awakening pulled away from ritual, ceremony, sacramentalism, and hierarchy, and made Christianity intensely personal to the average person by fostering a deep sense of spiritual conviction and redemption, and by encouraging introspection and a commitment to a new standard of personal morality. - Methodism, or the Methodist movement, is a group of historically related denominations of Protestant Christianity which derive their inspiration from the life and teachings of John Wesley. George Whitefield and John's brother Charles Wesley were also significant leaders in the movement. It originated as a revival within the 18th century Church of England and became a separate Church after Wesley's death. Because of vigorous missionary work, the movement spread throughout the British Empire, the United States and beyond, today claiming approximately 80 million adherents worldwide. - George Whitefield (30 September 1770), also spelled George Whitfield, was an English Anglican cleric who was one of the founders of Methodism and the evangelical movement. - English America, and later British America, were the English, and later British, territories in North America (including Bermuda), Central America, the Caribbean, and Guyana from 1607 to 1783. Formally, the British colonies in North America were known as \\"British America and the British West Indies\\" until 1776, when the Thirteen British Colonies located along the Atlantic seaboard declared their independence and formed the United States of America. After that, British North America (or, simply but not inclusively, Canada) was used to describe the remainder of Britain's continental North American possessions. The term \\"British North America\\" was first used informally in 1783, but it was uncommon before the Report on the Affairs of British North America (1839), called the Durham Report. - Christianity is a monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, who serves as the focal point for the religion. It is the world's largest religion, with over 2.4 billion followers, or 33% of the global population, known as Christians. Christians believe that Jesus is the Son of God and the savior of humanity whose coming as the Messiah (the Christ) was prophesied in the Old Testament. - A fellow is a member of a group of people who work together in a fellowship pursuing mutual knowledge or practice. There are many different kinds of fellowships which are awarded for different reasons in academia and industry, often indicating an advanced level of scholarship. - John Hyatt ( 12 January 1767 -- 30 January 1826 ) was an Englishman of simple rural upbringing who found Wesleyan theology as a young man . He went on to become a much loved and revered driving force of early Methodism in London , becoming influential in continuing the First Great Awakening started by George Whitefield in the 1740s .

President Obama Obama is ready to play hardball, his allies say. He’s prepared to veto legislation to block the “fiscal cliff” unless Republicans allow the Bush-era tax cuts to expire for those making more than 250,000 a year, the White House says. Because he won reelection, the president may be able to dictate the terms of a bipartisan debt-reduction deal, The Washington Post’s Lori Montgomery reports. Jonathan Ernst/Reuters With the election behind them, Obama and lawmakers have turned their attention to the fiscal cliff. Here’s a look at some of the leaders who will influence whether the country can avoid falling off the cliff. After a brutally divisive presidential campaign and two years of acrimony over the federal budget, the nation's leaders joined hands Friday and pledged fast and far-reaching action to tame the public debt and avoid economy-shaking tax hikes set to hit in January. In a display of bipartisanship unseen since the GOP captured the House in 2010, Republican and Democratic leaders met for more than an hour with President Obama at the White House. They emerged unified, with a message of reassurance for nervous taxpayers and investors — though intense haggling over the shape of a deal is yet to come. “I feel very good about what we were able to talk about in there,” Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) told reporters outside the White House, standing shoulder-to-shoulder with Republicans John A. Boehner (Ohio), the House speaker, and Mitch McConnell (Ky.), the Senate minority leader, as well as House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi (Calif.). “We all know something has to be done. There is no more ‘Let’s do it some other time.’ We’re going to do it now.” The usually sharp-tongued McConnell even praised Obama for his upcoming trip to Southeast Asia, although it will take the president away from Washington as policymakers rush to reach an agreement to avert 500 billion in tax hikes and automatic spending cuts that threaten to throw the nation back into recession early next year. “I can only echo the observations of the other leaders, that it was a constructive meeting,” McConnell said. “We all understand where we are.” What going over the 'fiscal cliff' would mean ... Major details — including the overall scope of a debt-reduction package — still have to be worked out. And the group made no progress Friday on their most fundamental point of disagreement: whether to extend the expiring George W. Bush-era tax cuts for the wealthiest 2 percent of U.S. households through 2013. But the leaders expressed optimism about reaching an accord before the cliff hits in January and dispatched staffers to draft a debt-reduction framework to present to Obama after the Thanksgiving break. Pelosi called on her colleagues to set a Christmas deadline for passing legislation to “send a message of confidence to consumers, to the markets.” U.S. stocks shot up while the leaders were speaking, going from negative to positive territory in a matter of minutes. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 113 points, gaining nearly 1 percent, in the half hour after the meeting ended. (The Dow closed up nearly 46 points, or 0.4 percent.) The upbeat tone marked a dramatic shift from the sullen relations of recent years, when Obama and a GOP fortified by anti- government activists clashed repeatedly over spending and taxes. For months, Washington lurched from crisis to crisis as Republicans threatened to shutter the government and prohibit additional borrowing unless Democrats agreed to massive cuts in spending. In 2011, a potential “grand bargain” between Boehner and Obama collapsed in angry finger-pointing and dueling news conferences. This year, a presidential campaign fueled by hundreds of millions of dollars in negative ads painted Obama as a free-spending redistributionist and the Republican standard-bearer, Mitt Romney, as an out-of-touch corporate robber baron. Since Nov. 6, when Obama won reelection and Democrats made gains in the House and Senate on a pledge to make the rich “pay their fair share,” Republicans have backed down from the fight. On Friday, McConnell and Boehner acknowledged the need for fresh revenue to restrain a public debt that has swollen to dangerous levels — as long as Democrats agree to tackle the rising cost of Medicare and Medicaid, the biggest drivers of future borrowing. “To show our seriousness, we’ve put revenue on the table,” Boehner said. But “it’s going to be incumbent for my colleagues to show the American people that we’re serious about cutting spending and solving our fiscal dilemma.” By all accounts, Obama and congressional leaders made progress on both fronts. During a meeting in the Roosevelt Room that included Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner and White House economic adviser Gene Sperling, Obama acknowledged the need to tackle health-care spending, according to aides in both parties. And while Boehner argued that the economy would suffer if policymakers failed to maintain the Bush-era tax cuts for households at all income levels, Democrats said he did not insist that his caucus would reject any rise in the top tax rates, as he has in the past. “The tone was very good,” Geithner said afterward on Bloomberg TV. “They said what you’d hope for them to say at this point, which is that [an agreement] is something we can do, we’re committed to do it, we want to do it as soon as we can, we know the stakes are very high.” While Obama is out of the country, the leaders said, their staffs will get to work on a framework to replace the year-end fiscal cliff with a less abrupt and less economically-damaging debt-reduction plan. The savings would be generated in two stages. The first would be a down payment composed of immediate tax hikes and spending cuts to replace blunt, across-the-board budget cuts set in motion during the 2011 debt-limit fight. The second would be a mechanism to force an overhaul of the tax code and long-term changes to entitlement programs next year. “What we’re trying to do is to come up with a framework agreement that sets up a process for locking in long-term savings,” Geithner said. “But you have to do a meaningful amount of things upfront.” Pelosi told reporters after the meeting that the leaders did not discuss an overall savings target. But, she said, “I think it would be good if we did something in the 4 trillion category” — a figure that could stabilize the debt as a percentage of the economy. “My hope is that this is going to be the beginning of a fruitful process where we’re able to come to an agreement that will reduce our deficit in a balanced way,” Obama said as the meeting convened. Then he dismissed reporters, before remembering “one other point that I wanted to make”: Boehner’s birthday is Saturday. But “we’re not going to embarrass him with a cake,” Obama said, “because we didn’t know how many candles were needed.” Boehner, who is turning 63, playfully poked the president in the arm, and the two laughed and shook hands. Amy Gardner contributed to this report. ||||| President Obama and Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) and their staffs will be the principal negotiators in talks to avoid the \\"fiscal cliff.\\" As the talks begin formally at the White House on Friday, lawmakers and special-interest groups are scrambling to figure out who else will be in the room and how to influence the outcome. ADVERTISEMENT Obama will host Boehner, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) at 10:15 a.m. in the Roosevelt Room. Senior congressional aides, however, describe it as more of a photo-op than a substantive bargaining session. Informal talks are already under way, behind the scenes, between White House officials and congressional staff, according to a senior Senate aide. Obama has also called the Democratic leaders of the Senate and House to organize strategy. A senior House Democratic aide said Obama and Pelosi have spoken three times since the election. A senior House Republican aide, however, said Obama’s staff has not begun any informal talks with Boehner’s staff. Congressional leadership aides say Obama and Boehner will pick up where they left off in the summer of 2011, when they almost sealed a deal to cut hundreds of billions from Medicare and Medicaid and raise nearly 800 billion in new tax revenues. Obama and Boehner will lead the talks, but there will be more input from other congressional leaders this time compared to last year, when reports of the concessions Obama made to Boehner in private caught Democrats by surprise. Reid confronted Jack Lew, then the White House budget director, in July of 2011 about why he had been kept in the dark about hundreds of billions of dollars in proposed cuts. “I’m the Senate majority leader — why don’t I know about this deal?” Reid demanded as soon as Lew walked into a meeting with Senate Democrats. Congressional Democrats are pressing for more access to the talks. “I think everybody operates under the assumption that Speaker Boehner will need Democratic help on any proposal to get it out of the House,” said a Democratic aide. \\"I would think House Republicans would very much want House Democratic leadership at the table when any deal gets cut.” Senior congressional aides say there is no fixed negotiating group, such as a Gang of Six or a Committee of 12, as in past negotiations. The cast of participants will fluctuate as various players bid for their priorities. Yet the ultimate deciders will be Obama and Boehner. Republicans think Obama will be able to bring his party along to support any deal he signs off on, while Democrats say the House GOP conference, dominated by conservatives, will prove the biggest obstacle to passing a grand bargain through Congress. “The only way we’re going to solve this present crisis and get past the political stalemate is for the president himself to lead,” McConnell said Thursday. “He’s the only one who can lead the members of his own party to do something they wouldn’t ordinarily do.” “I think Pelosi and Reid will go along with whatever the White House delivers. It’s what Boehner can deliver” that will determine what gets through Congress, said a Republican senator. Republican senators predict members of their conference will sign off on any deal Boehner can move through the House. “We're going to have to get something that the president will sign and that the House will pass. And I think that [if] you get that, it will then ultimately have enough votes to pass in the Senate,” Sen. John Barrasso (Wyo.), chairman of the Senate Republican Policy Committee, said in an MSNBC interview. Senate Republican Whip Jon Kyl (Ariz.) said McConnell would be Boehner’s “wingman” in the talks. Some Democrats worry about the prospect of letting Obama and his senior advisers hash out a deal with Boehner on their own. They remember the steep cuts he reportedly agreed to in 2011 and the deal he struck with McConnell in December of 2010 to extend virtually all the Bush-era tax rates. House Democrats are demanding that Pelosi not be shut out of the talks, as she was in December of 2010, the last time the Bush tax cuts were due to expire. “She’s the Democratic leader of the House and I think she has to be at the table. Absolutely,” said Rep. Henry Waxman (Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the Energy and Commerce Committee and a Pelosi ally. “I’d expect she’d want to be at the table. She better be.” Rep. Sandy Levin (Mich.), the ranking Democrat on the Ways and Means panel, said Pelosi’s participation is “vital.” He said Democratic members of the Ways and Means panel would work closely with Pelosi. Pelosi said in a statement Thursday that “House Democrats will act as partners in an effort to reach an agreement.” Senate sources see the active involvement of Pelosi and Reid as intended to keep Obama from drifting too far toward accepting Republican demands on cutting Medicare and other safety-net programs. During the last round of talks with Boehner, Obama’s representatives agreed to cut 250 billion from Medicare over the next decade and use a new formula to calculate cost-of-living adjustments for Social Security benefits, according to The New York Times. Reid has insisted Social Security stay off the bargaining table. Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.), Reid’s deputy, told reporters Wednesday that any deal to avoid the fiscal cliff must increase tax rates on families earning more than 250,000 annually. Obama will press congressional leaders Friday not to let disagreements over taxing the wealthy or reforming safety-net programs imperil a deal to extend current tax rates for middle-income families. “The president will also reiterate that he wants to work with leaders in both parties to achieve a significant, balanced deficit-reduction plan that puts our nation on a sustainable fiscal path,” said a White House official. Rep. Chris Van Hollen (Md.), the ranking Democrat on the Budget Committee, thinks Obama will drive a harder bargain with Republicans this December. “I’m absolutely convinced that this time there will be a different end to this movie because the president has been absolutely clear that if we want to be serious about reducing the deficit, we’ve got to ask very wealthy people to contribute,” he said during a recent C-SPAN \\"Newsmakers\\" interview. |||||Summary:","response":"President Obama was very serious about making some big decisions to help the country save money and avoid a situation called the \\"fiscal cliff.\\" He talked with leaders from both the Republican and Democratic parties to find ways to work together on this issue. They all agreed that something needed to be done and tried to find ways to reach an agreement before the end of the year. This was very important because if they didn't find a solution, there could be problems with taxes and spending which could hurt the economy. Everyone was trying their best to figure out the best way to fix this issue and make sure that the country didn't fall off the \\"fiscal cliff.\\""},{"question":"Please answer the following question: My grandma whom we all called Nanny was a solid, first-generation, Italian immigrant. She came to this country with her family on a tiny ship during World War I when she was only 8 years old. During the trip she survived stormy seas,little food, and an attack by a German U-boat. After getting here,her large family worked hard to build a new life in America. They never had much money but were rich in love. One day,when I was about 5 or 6 years old, my parents and brothers went on a trip. It was just me and Nanny in the house for the weekend. Nanny seemed so happy to be taking care of me all by herself. She made me a special breakfast that first morning. However, all I could do was to complain about how the food was not how Mom always made it. Nanny quietly put down the plate and went into the living room. I followed a minute later and saw that she had tears in her eyes. It was the first time I had ever seen my strong and proud grandmother cry and I was the one who had caused it. I walked over to Nanny, climbed on her lap, and for the first time in my short life I did something else too. I apologized without being told to and asked Nanny to forgive me. She smiled, rubbed my head, and told me I was a good boy even though I didn't feel like one then. That memory just like my Nanny's love will stay in my heart forever. It is a sign of both strength and wisdom. Asking for forgiveness helps us to learn, to grow, and to love. Nanny,s family immigrated to America mainly because _ . A) they suffered starvation in their homeland B) they wanted to start a rich life in the new land C) they tried to get away from the terrible climate D) their country was in war and they needed peace A:","response":"From the context provided in the story, the most probable answer to why Nanny's family immigrated to America is D) their country was in war and they needed peace. The story tells us that Nanny and her family emigrated during World War I, which was a time of immense upheaval and violence. They also experienced an attack by a German U-boat on their journey to America, which again underlines the danger posed by the war. The text does not provide direct information about starvation, desire for riches or terrible climate being reasons for their movement, so these choices are less likely. So, the quest for peace and safety from the war in their homeland is the most plausible reason for their immigration to America."},{"question":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

What is the solution?","response":"The equation you've given is a linear equation in terms of the variable k. Here, the end goal is to isolate the variable, k, in order to determine its value. Step 1: You first rewrite the equation as follows: 4 * k - 4 = 3 * k The equation implies that four times some number k minus four equals three times the same number k. Step 2: You now want to start isolating the variable k. To do this, subtract 3*k from both sides of the equation. This gives: 4 * k - 3 * k - 4 = 3 * k - 3 * k Step 3: Simplify the above by executing the subtraction on both sides, this results in: k - 4 = 0 Step 4: Add 4 to both sides of the equation to completely isolate the variable k on one side. This results in: k - 4 + 4 = 0 + 4 Step 5: Finally, simplify the above again to obtain the solution as: k = 4 So, in conclusion, the solution to the equation 4 * k - 4 = 3 * k is k = 4. Which means when you replace k with 4 in the original equation, both sides of the equation will balance, thus proving the solution to be correct."},{"question":"Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Today, home-ownership has reached extremely high levels. Modern generations tend to believe there is something wrong with them if they rent. However, is high home-ownership really as rosy as people imagine? Staring at data first, we realize that the most successful, stable, attractive country in the Western world is Switzerland. It has tiny unemployment; wealth; high happiness and mental-health scores. Does it have high home-ownership rates? Absolutely not. In Switzerland, about seven in ten of the population are renters. Yet, with Europe's lowest home-ownership rate, the nation thrives. Now go to the other end of the misery distribution. Spain has approximately the highest home-ownership rate in Europe (at more than 80%). But one-quarter of its population are unemployed. A likely reason is that high levels of home-ownership mess up the labour market. In a sensibly functioning economy it is easy for people to move around to drop into the vibrant job slots thrown up by technological change. With a high degree of owner-occupation, everything slows. Folk get stuck. Renters can go to new jobs. In that way they do the economy a favour. As Friedman said, the rate of unemployment depends on the flexibility of the housing market. Next we come to economic breakdown. Most analysts accept that at heart it was the housing market--obsessive pursuit of homes, the engendered mortgage lending and an unavoidable house-price crash--that sank the Western world. Germany, say, with its more efficient rental market, had a far smoother ride through trouble. As for the monetary system, in the past few decades, in the hope of getting untaxed capital gains way above their true labour earnings, many people threw their spare cash into buying larger houses or building extra bedrooms.

A:","response":"Based on the customer's review, it is evident that they are dissatisfied with their purchase of the shotgun microphone. There are several reasons that contribute to their dissatisfaction, which are elaborated upon in the review. Firstly, the sound quality of the microphone is described as \\"sub-par,\\" indicating that the performance of the product did not meet their expectations. They specifically mention the signal and range being weak and short, even after changing the battery. The fact that a battery was already installed upon arrival may also negatively impact their perception of the product's quality. Secondly, the omission of a phantom power option on the microphone added to the dissatisfaction. Phantom power is an important feature for many professionals and enthusiasts, as it provides a consistent source of power for condenser microphones. The lack of such an option questions the product's versatility and usefulness for various applications. Additionally, receiving a used item, rather than a new one, further exacerbates the dissatisfaction of the customer. The fact that the box had been torn open, the documentation and accessories were missing, and the microphone itself had greasy fingerprints and a battery left inside demonstrate a significant discrepancy between the customer's expectations and the actual state of the product they received. This makes them question the product's quality, as well as the credibility and integrity of the supplier. The customer clearly states their intention to return the used item and purchase a better product, suggesting that their overall experience has been negative and disappointing. This supports the conclusion that they are dissatisfied with their purchase of the shotgun microphone."},{"question":"Title: Here is what I think...

The reviewer expresses their approval and satisfaction for the album they're talking about in multiple ways throughout the text. Their appreciation for the music results in a positive assessment, which is reflected through several key points. Firstly, the reviewer appreciates the diversity and creativity in the album. They favor the idea that the songs are not \\"cookie-cut to be the same,\\" paralleling a common criticism of some modern music where pieces can tend to sound analogous or be manufactured to a generic template.

Secondly, the individual enjoys the notion of unexpectedness in the album. Not knowing what to expect next on the album generates a sense of anticipation and pleasure in the listening experience, which is a signal of a positive review. The element of surprise in listening to different types of music in one single compilation highlights the versatility of the album, which the reviewer seems to value. Thirdly, the comment about different types of music fitting all moods demonstrates another positive aspect. The album's versatility in resonating with a wide array of emotional states shows its broad appeal, which appears to be a characteristic the reviewer finds noteworthy and positive. The mention of a \\"haunted\\" feel being maintained throughout the entire album shows the reviewer's fondness for the mood or theme the album presents, adding another positive dimension to the review. Finally, the reviewer indicates their excitement about the band’s future work, specifically looking forward to their next release. This anticipation demonstrates that they have enjoyed the current album and are invested in hearing more from the band – a clear indication of liking what they've heard so far.

The vote, on a provision attached to a student aid bill, was 345-75, with Democrats supplying all the \\"no\\" votes. On Monday the Senate voted 83-7 to deny housing and community grant funding to ACORN, which stands for the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now. Republicans accelerated their attacks on the liberal-leaning group a year ago when ACORN, in conducting a massive voter registration drive, was accused of submitting some false registration forms. On a hidden-camera video released on Monday, two ACORN employees are seen apparently advising a couple that was posing as a prostitute and her pimp to lie about her profession and launder her earnings. The video was the latest in a series that has already led to the firing of four ACORN employees in Baltimore and Washington. It was created by James O'Keefe and Hannah Giles and posted on BigGovernment.com, where O'Keefe identifies himself as an activist filmmaker. ACORN spokesman Scott Levenson blasted the video shot at the organization's Brooklyn office, saying the group believes the voices of the couple were dubbed over to alter the conversation and make the interaction appear more objectionable than it may have been. ACORN said Wednesday that it is ordering its own independent investigation of the incidents, while stressing that they were isolated cases. The Census Bureau, meanwhile, also has severed its ties with the group for the 2010 national census. Republicans have urged federal officials to go further by launching a comprehensive investigation of how ACORN spends and manages federal money. \\"As long as taxpayers are subsidizing ACORN and its affiliates, we need to use every measure possible to ensure that those dollars are being spent and managed appropriately,\\" said Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., sponsor of the measure that passed the House. The Senate and House initiatives to cut funding for ACORN won't take effect until the bills to which they are attached clear Congress and are signed by President Obama. The Senate measure is attached to a fiscal 2010 spending bill. \\"President Obama needs to indicate whether he'll sign this bill and join us in ending all taxpayer funds for this corrupt organization,\\" House Republican leader John Boehner of Ohio said after the vote. White House press secretary Robert Gibbs on Wednesday said the conduct seen on the tapes \\"is completely unacceptable.\\" He said the Obama administration \\"takes accountability extremely seriously\\" and noted that the Census Bureau had determined that ACORN could not meet its goal for conducting a fair and accurate count next year. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, in a conference call with reporters, called the latest allegations against ACORN \\"horrible.\\" However, she pointed out that ACORN has many honest employees and was conducting an internal investigation, and that it was up to House-Senate negotiators to determine whether the provision to cut funding would be in the final version of the bill.

To provide a detailed analysis of the review, it can be broken down into a few key points that demonstrate its negative nature: 1. Quality of food: The reviewer uses the word \\"OK\\" to describe the food, which implies that they did not find it particularly impressive or satisfying. This demonstrates that the quality of the food was not good enough to warrant a positive review. 2. Customer service: The reviewer criticizes the employees for their behavior, labeling them as \\"idiots\\" and \\"rude people.\\" This indicates that the customer experienced a significant amount of dissatisfaction with the staff's attitude and their ability to provide a pleasant dining experience. 3. Communication and responsiveness: The reviewer specifically mentions that the employees do not ask customers what they want and get irritable when asked for additional items, such as salsa for tacos. Poor communication and an unwillingness to accommodate customer requests paint a picture of an establishment that is not focused on creating a positive experience for its patrons. 4. Intent to return: The reviewer explicitly states that they \\"won't be coming back here ever.\\" This assertion demonstrates a strong negative reaction to their overall experience at the establishment, as they have no intention of giving it another chance in the future. 5. Suggestion for improvement: The reviewer concludes their review by stating that the establishment \\"needs a manager.\\" This suggests that one of the reasons for their dissatisfaction is a perceived lack of proper management or oversight, contributing to the employees' poor behavior and overall negative experience.

For over forty years it was the home of Winston Churchill. He bought the property in September 1922 and lived there until shortly before his death in January 1965. In the 1930s, when Churchill was excluded from political office, Chartwell became the centre of his world. At his dining table, he gathered those who could assist his campaign against German re-armament and the British government's response of appeasement; in his study, he composed speeches and wrote books; in his garden, he built walls, constructed lakes and painted. During the Second World War Chartwell was largely unused, the Churchills returning after he lost the 1945 election. In 1953, when again Prime Minister, the house became Churchill's refuge when he suffered a devastating stroke. In October 1964, he left for the last time, dying at his London home, 28, Hyde Park Gate, on 24 January 1965. The origins of the estate reach back to the 14th century; in 1382 the property, then called Well-street, was sold by William-at-Well. It passed through various owners and in 1836 was auctioned, as a substantial, brick-built manor. In 1848, it was purchased by John Campbell Colquhoun, whose grandson sold it to Churchill. The Campbell Colquhouns greatly enlarged the house and the advertisement for its sale at the time of Churchill's purchase described it as an \\"imposing\\" mansion. Between 1922 and 1924, it was largely rebuilt and extended by the society architect Philip Tilden. From the garden front, the house has extensive views over the Weald of Kent, \\"the most beautiful and charming\\" Churchill had ever seen, and the determining factor in his decision to buy the house. In 1946, when financial constraints forced Churchill to again consider selling Chartwell, it was acquired by the National Trust with funds raised by a consortium of Churchill's friends led by Lord Camrose, on condition that the Churchills retain a life-tenancy.

What is the answer??","response":"To solve for h in the equation 434*h = -9378 - 22304, you first need to simplify the right-hand side of the equation. The right-hand side is -9378 - 22304 which equals -31682. So, your original equation can be rewritten as follows: 434*h = -31682 To get the value of 'h', you'll need to isolate it by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of 'h', which in this case is 434. This is known as the division property in algebra. So, doing these calculations, the equation becomes: h= -31682 / 434 Dividing -31682 by 434 will give us 'h', which can be computed as follows: h ≈ -73.02 Note that the ≈ symbol is used here to indicate that this is an approximation. 'h' could have more decimal points, but this provides you an approximate value for 'h'. Therefore, solving the equation 434*h = -9378 - 22304 for h gives us h ≈ -73.02. This means that for every 434 units, there would be a decrease of approximately 73.02 units to give the total decrease of -31682 units."},{"question":"Given the question: I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

Tara (Sarita Choudhury) is an upper-caste princess while Maya (Indira Varma) is her beautiful servant. The two girls are best friends, but an undercurrent of jealousy and resentment is caused by Tara's haughtiness, symbolized by the fact that Maya is given Tara's hand-me-down clothes and never anything new to wear. As the girls approach marriageable age, Tara resents that Maya is a better classical dancer than she is, and that her parents and hunchback brother, Prince Bikram (aka \\"Biki\\") show affection for her servant. Tara is prepared to marry Prince Raj Singh (Naveen Andrews), and Maya is forced into the role of the inferior servant at their wedding festival. When the prince comes to view his future wife, he is instantly infatuated with Maya instead. Noticing this, Tara spits in Maya's face, sending her from the wedding in tears. Maya decides to take revenge when she chances on Raj sleeping alone, before he has completed the marriage rites with Tara.

All chairs are 25% off. If you buy more than 5 chairs, you get an additional 1/3 off the discounted price of the number of chairs over 5. If you bought 8 chairs that were normally priced at 20, how much do the chairs cost in total? Thoughts? Step-by-step reasoning:","response":"Sure, let's break down the problem and solve it step-by-step. 1. Find the discounted price of a single chair – Since Big Lots is offering 25% off all chairs, the price for a single chair would be: Discounted price = Original price * (1 - Discount percentage) Discounted price = 20 * (1 - 0.25) Discounted price = 20 * 0.75 Discounted price = 15 2. Calculate the number of chairs receiving an additional discount – Since you bought 8 chairs and the additional discount applies to chairs over 5, you have: Number of chairs with additional discount = Total chairs - 5 Number of chairs with additional discount = 8 - 5 Number of chairs with additional discount = 3 3. Apply the additional discount to the 3 chairs – The additional discount is 1/3 off the discounted price of 15: Additional discount price = Discounted price * (1 - Additional discount percentage) Additional discount price = 15 * (1 - 1/3) Additional discount price = 15 * 2/3 Additional discount price = 10 4. Calculate the total cost of the chairs – To do this, add the cost of the first 5 chairs (without the additional discount) and the cost of the 3 chairs (with the additional discount): Total cost = (5 chairs * 15) + (3 chairs * 10) Total cost = (75) + (30) Total cost = 105 So, if you bought 8 chairs that were normally priced at 20, the total cost of the chairs would be 105 after applying the discounts."},{"question":"Les dispositions de la présente directive relatives aux investissements dans la sécurité routière s'appliquent sans préjudice des compétences des États membres en matière d'investissements pour l'entretien du réseau routier.

Step 1: Identify the task - The task is to complete the sentence regarding why it was easier for Katrina than Victoria to prevent identity theft of their bank accounts. Step 2: Assess the available options - We are given two options: i. Katrina neglected how to protect their privacy. ii. Victoria neglected how to protect their privacy. Step 3: Analyze the options - We need to find a reason that makes it easier for Katrina to prevent identity theft. If Katrina neglected how to protect their privacy, it would not make it easier for her. On the other hand, if Victoria neglected how to protect their privacy, it would imply that Katrina took necessary precautions, thus making it easier for her to prevent identity theft. Step 4: Choose the appropriate option - Based on the analysis, option ii. Victoria neglected how to protect their privacy, is the correct answer, as it provides a reason for why it was easier for Katrina to prevent identity theft. Step 5: Complete the sentence - \\"It was easier for Katrina than Victoria to prevent identity theft of their bank accounts because Victoria neglected how to protect their privacy.\\" In this sentence, it is clear that Katrina had an easier time preventing identity theft compared to Victoria, who did not take the necessary steps to protect their privacy."},{"question":"My question: Is the following sentence factually correct? \\"Cathay Pacific works in the IATA group of Companies.\\" Options: - yes - no Please think gradually:","response":"To determine if the sentence \\"Cathay Pacific works in the IATA group of Companies\\" is factually correct, let's break it down step-by-step: 1.

Creating such a smooth passage means adjusting a vehicle's speed so that it always arrives at the lights when they are green.That is theoretically possible, but practically hard.Roadside signs wired to traffic lights can help get the message across a couple hundred metres from a crossing, but such signs are expensive, and are not widespread.Margaret Martonosi and Emmanouil Koukoumidis at Princeton University, and Li-Shiuan Peh at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, however, have an idea that could make the process cheaper and more effective.Instead of a hardwired network of signs, they propose to use mobile-phone applications. For a driver to benefit, lie must load the team's software , named SignalGuru, into his phone and then put it on a special thing attached to the inside of his car's windscreen, with the camera lens pointing forward.SignalGuru is designed to detect traffic lights and track their status as red, yellow or green.It broadcasts this information to other phones in the area that are fitted with the same software, and --if there are enough of them ?the phones thus each know the status of most of the lights around town.Using this information, SignalGuru is able to calculate the traffic-light schedule for the area and suggest the speed at which a driver should travel in order to avoid red lights. Tests in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where five drivers were asked to follow the same route for three hours, and in Singapore, where eight drivers were asked to follow one of two routes for 30 minutes, revealed that SignalGuru was capable of predicting traffic-light activity with an accuracy of 98.2% and 96.3% respectively, in the two cities.This was particularly impressive because in Cambridge the lights...

Options: - plastic sword - ignition switch - controlling access - drawer - firearm Step-by-step reasoning process below:","response":"To determine the most suitable lock for John's antique pirate artifact, let's examine each of the given options: 1. Plastic sword: A plastic sword is not an antique pirate artifact. It is a modern toy or replica and would not be associated with real pirates or their historical belongings. 2. Ignition switch: An ignition switch is used in vehicles for starting the engine, which is not related to pirate artifacts. Pirates existed long before vehicles with ignition systems, so this option is not relevant to John's needs. 3. Controlling access: This option seems to be a concept, not an artifact. It cannot be considered an antique pirate artifact. Moreover, it won't need a lock itself. 4. Drawer: A drawer might be part of an antique pirate artifact, specifically, part of a larger piece of furniture like a chest or a cabinet. However, the drawer itself is not an artifact, but rather a component of one. John might need a lock for the drawer if it contains valuable pirate artifacts. 5. Firearm: Antique firearms, such as flintlock pistols or muskets, were commonly used by pirates. It would be a suitable pirate artifact. In this case, John might need a lock to secure the firearm safely, either in a display case, storage box, or a dedicated weapons cabinet. Based on the given options, the most likely antique pirate artifact that John needs a new lock for is the \\"firearm.\\" Step-by-step reasoning process: 1. Rule out irrelevant or inappropriate options (plastic sword, ignition switch, controlling access). 2. Analyze the remaining option that could be a pirate artifact (firearm). 3. Recognize the need for a lock in securing antique firearms. 4. Conclude that the most likely choice is a firearm."},{"question":"Write a sentence in Spanish.","response":"Step 1: Select an appropriate subject for the sentence.

With effects-laden production, Hipgnosis-illustrated concept albums and expansive live shows, the band is famously associated with rock 'n' roll excess. It wasn't for nothing that the Sex Pistols' John Lydon scrawled \\"I HATE\\" on a Pink Floyd T-shirt (though he later admitted he loved the band). But, almost 45 years on, a closer look at the band's catalog reveals as much hardcore pile-driving (\\"Run Like Hell\\") and wistful melodies (\\"Wish You Were Here\\") as the long-form \\"Interstellar Overdrive\\" space rock with which it's frequently classified. Still, drummer Nick Mason says, it's hard to escape the pigeonholing. \\"I think these labels are generally delivered by people who sometimes haven't listened to the music,\\" he said in a phone interview. Longtime fans and new listeners will have another chance to size up Mason's words. The band's entire studio catalog, including the Syd Barrett-led 1967 debut \\"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn,\\" the Roger Waters-dominated \\"The Wall\\" (1979) and the career-concluding \\"The Division Bell\\" (1994), has been remastered and is scheduled for release on Tuesday. \\"The Dark Side of the Moon,\\" the band's 1973 classic, which still holds the record for longest run on the Billboard album charts, will be issued in three versions: a single CD, a two-disc \\"Experience Edition\\" that includes a live album, and a six-disc \\"Immersion Edition\\" boxed set. Mason talked to CNN about the band's evolution, the pitfalls of playing live and fantasies about being the Monkees. The following is an edited version of the interview. CNN: How often do you go back and listen to the old material? Mason: The answer is, I would never willingly put on one of our old records at home for entertainment. But with this project, that all changed -- and I was forced at gunpoint to listen to everything, again and again. (laughs) Actually, it's really interesting. It's a bit like a diary -- looking at old photographs. What you get is not only the music but the memories that come with it of what you were doing, and how it was in the studio, and all the rest of it. CNN: There's been the label placed on Floyd as \\"space rock.\\" How did you guys take that label? Mason: One tends to try and reject any labeling anyway, as a matter of principle. And I think the labels tend to reflect whatever you were doing before. So we were labeled psychedelic -- well, \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" was the least psychedelic album you could hope to listen to. It's terribly specific and measured and not floaty-off anywhere. I think these labels are generally delivered by people who sometimes haven't listened to the music -- sometimes by just looking at the photographs. If the band have got curly hair and flared trousers, then they're prog-rock or space rock, and if they're very, very grubby, with waistcoats and jeans, then they're an R&B band. CNN: Also, it probably has something to do with what you were smoking or doing when you were listening to the album. Mason: Yeah. Always be very careful if you're listening to country and western and doing drugs. CNN: Let's talk about \\"Dark Side.\\" Were you aware that you were creating something different? Mason: I don't think so. My opinion was that we knew we'd done the best thing so far. But as I've told people, even if you think you've done the world's greatest record, that does not guarantee that the public will feel the same way. What happened with \\"Dark Side\\" was we were out touring with it and it began to come up the American charts, but we were actually on tour, so there wasn't that time to reflect and bask in the glory of being No. 1. It was much more, \\"Where are we tomorrow? Dallas. OK.\\" We were slightly disjointed from its success. What the success really bought for us was the thing of moving up a notch. You suddenly go from playing theaters to playing arenas. And in some cases, arenas into stadiums. So that's the way things catch up with you. Sometimes they catch you out. If you're used to playing smaller venues, and you suddenly find yourself in a stadium, it's not necessarily the best place to be working. CNN: After that, you guys did play a lot of stadiums. That led to a lot of discord. Was there a time when you thought, I wish I could go back to the clubs? Mason: No. I don't think there was a wish to go back. But I think stadiums make quite a lot of bands feel a little uneasy. There is that sense that you're not really connecting with the audience as well as you would. I think arenas are fine -- I think arenas are really suited for rock concerts. But stadiums, it gets away from you a bit. There's too many people at the back not listening. CNN: How did the band change for you over the years as leadership went from Syd to Roger to David Gilmour? Mason: I've always been happy with the way it operates. I have no wish to be the fearless leader. And interestingly, I think even David found it pretty wearing when he was sort of in command on the last couple of tours. It's not always easy being the chief. I've always felt that I have my say and I am a partner in it, rather than an employee. CNN: What do you think are some of the underrated aspects of the band? Mason: To be honest, after this long and this many releases, there's not much that's been overlooked. I was telling someone yesterday, I feel like a stately home with people taking tours around me. CNN: How are you guys getting along nowadays? Mason: Fine, I think. We haven't had any fights recently. David and I pitched up for Roger's show in London. And it was really nice -- we had dinner together. There's a lot of shared stuff as well as plenty of aggro. The fact of the matter is you grow up together. The problem is when you start in a band you think it's all going to be like the Monkees -- four lovable moptops running around at double speed. But then you get married and have children, and being rock and roll often the marriages break up. People change as they grow. CNN: And here you are still with people you knew at 18. Mason: Yes, it's very unsatisfactory. (chuckles) CNN: Do you feel like sitting in with an R&B band some night? Mason: Yeah. I still really like playing music, and playing with other people is terrific. I was talking with someone about a charity record we did a year or so ago, and the rhythm track was Bill Wyman playing bass and me playing drums. I've known Bill for 35 years or something, and it was great to finally end up playing together. It's always a little bit nerve-wracking -- you're always alarmed at the prospect of f***ing up -- and if you get through it, and someone says, \\"It's good,\\" it's a very warming feeling.

Title: The Contractor Movie plot: Retired CIA black-ops hitman James Jackson Dial (Wesley Snipes) is living his life in seclusion on his ranch in Montana when he is offered the chance to redeem himself by his former employer, Jeremy Collins (Ralph Brown). Some years earlier, Dial had been seconds away from taking down notorious terrorist cell leader Ali Mahmoud Jahar (Nikolay Sotirov) but his carelessness allowed Jahar to escape, marking his assignment as a failure. Now Collins wants Dial to complete his task by assassinating Jahar, who has been captured and is now in the custody of the police in London, England. Provided with a safe house, passports, and an assistant, Terry Winchell (Richard Harrington), Dial is off to London to complete unfinished business. Disguised as a priest, Dial gets into position in a church bell tower across the street from the building that Jahar is being brought into. When Jahar is brought out of the police van, his head is covered by a jacket, leaving Dial without a clean shot. Not wanting to fail again, Dial patiently waits for his opportunity. Moments later, from his high vantage point, Dial spots Jahar standing inside the building with his back to the window. Dial grasps the opportunity and shoots through the glass, fatally hitting Jahar in back of his head. Because of the delay caused by a pair of cops, Winchell is late in bringing the getaway car, and this brings attention to them fleeing the scene. After numerous attempts to stop the car, the police open fire, killing Winchell. The car, now out of control, comes to crashing stop, injuring Dial. But Dial manages to get out of the crashed car. On the run and bleeding profusely, he makes his way to the safe house, where he meets curious 12-year-old neighbor Emily Day (Eliza Bennett), who lives with her grandmother (Gemma Jones). Emily helps Dial stop the bleeding. Even though Jahar has been eliminated, the assignment is still considered to be failure by Collins because Dial had been filmed fleeing the scene by a security camera. Meanwhile, Collins is being...

The Hamburg group shared the anti-U.S. fervor of the other candidates for the operation, but added the enormous advantages of fluency in English and familiarity with life in the West, based on years that each member of the group had spent living in Germany. Not surprisingly, Mohamed Atta, Ramzi Binalshibh, Marwan al Shehhi, and Ziad Jarrah would all become key players in the 9/11 conspiracy. Mohamed Atta was born on September 1, 1968, in Kafr el Sheikh, Egypt, to a middle-class family headed by his father, an attorney. After graduating from Cairo University with a degree in architectural engineering in 1990, Atta worked as an urban planner in Cairo for a couple of years. In the fall of 1991, he asked a German family he had met in Cairo to help him continue his education in Germany. They suggested he come to Hamburg and invited him to live with them there, at least initially. After completing a course in German, Atta traveled to Germany for the first time in July 1992. He resided briefly in Stuttgart and then, in the fall of 1992, moved to Hamburg to live with his host family. After enrolling at the University of Hamburg, he promptly transferred into the city engineering and planning course at the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg, where he would remain registered as a student until the fall of 1999. He appears to have applied himself fairly seriously to his studies (at least in comparison to his jihadist friends) and actually received his degree shortly before traveling to Afghanistan. In school, Atta came across as very intelligent and reasonably pleasant, with an excellent command of the German language. When Atta arrived in Germany, he appeared religious, but not fanatically so. This would change, especially as his tendency to assert leadership became increasingly pronounced. According to Binalshibh, as early as 1995 Atta sought to organize a Muslim student association in Hamburg. In the fall of 1997, he joined a working group at the Quds mosque in Hamburg, a group designed to bridge the gap between Muslims and Christians. Atta proved a poor bridge, however, because of his abrasive and increasingly dogmatic personality. But among those who shared his beliefs, Atta stood out as a decisionmaker.

So when, at the ripe age of 3, his parents, Damion and Andrea, let him come along to return some water bottles at a recycling center, he was thrilled to help. “He likes to sort pretty much anything, and he liked putting the bottles in the machine,” Damion, said. “He probably got two or three bucks, and he was so excited about it. And of course then he got to sort his change, so that meant more sorting.” For an average 3-year-old, that probably would have been the end of the story. But when Damion returned home from work the next day, Ryan was waiting for him in the driveway. He told his dad that he wanted to show him his new business—or “bidness” in toddler talk. “I asked him what it was, and he kind of waved down the street and goes, ‘tah-dah!’” Damion recalled. “Ryan and Andrea had gone around giving all the neighbors trash bags—he wanted everyone to start saving cans for him.” That was the beginning of Ryan’s Recycling Company, established in 2012 in the family’s San Juan Capistrano home. A first-grader at Ambuehl Elementary School, Ryan has already earned more than 8,000 by collecting cans and bottles from about 40 “customers” in five different neighborhoods. His biggest client is the El Niguel Country Club. Of course, being a 6-year-old entrepreneur comes with some hurdles. Ryan’s parents, grandmother and aunt all help drive him around to collect his recyclables and often make multiple trips to pick up a few carloads at a time. The family’s backyard acts as Ryan’s sorting facility, where he has about eight large trash cans that he sorts containers into—bottles and cans, plastics and glass, they all have their place. Ryan’s family visits the recycling center every third Sunday, and on the weekends he can often be seen sorting to prepare for those visits with his work gloves on and sporting a blue CR&R hat. The young businessman said even though he has to dump the occasional “yucky liquids” from some of the collected containers, it’s all worth it—every nickel goes into a savings account and toward his dream of owning his own garbage truck one day. Since he’s got about 10 more years until he can learn to drive, Ryan figures that gives him at least a decade to earn the 70,000 needed to purchase a used truck, or 120,000 for a brand new one. “Ryan’s one of those really unique kids who has a passion,” said his first grade teacher Suzanne Devaney. “He just sees things that need to be done and he does them.” Since the company’s inception, Damion, who does graphic designing, has created business cards for Ryan as well as Ryan’s Recycling T-shirts, which sell for 13 apiece. All the proceeds from the shirts are donated to the Pacific Marine Mammal Center—so far they’ve contributed about 1,000. In a YouTube video posted last July, Damion asks Ryan if other people should start recycling to help save the earth. “Mmm … no,” Ryan says nonchalantly. “I got it all handled.” His answer has changed a bit since then. Ryan said he thinks people should start recycling not only to earn some extra cash, but “because it helps the world, too.” He worries that birds at the beach may eat the trash and “get sick or die.” “He’s very passionate about it, and he likes to get everybody else passionate about it as well,” Andrea said. “I think he’s rubbed off on all of us now. You find yourself walking past a can on the ground and needing to pick it up instead of walking away and leaving it there.” For more information on supporting Ryan’s Recycling, visit www.dhdwear.com/Ryans-Recycling.

The day after going to the recycling center, Ryan notified his mom and dad that he wanted to give empty plastic bags to all the neighbors and maybe they would save their recyclables for him. Not only did the local neighbors save their cans and bottles for Ryan but so did their friends, families and co-workers. Today, Ryan has customers all over Orange County, CA and he has a passion to recycle that is amazing. His goal is to recycle to keep cans and bottles from reaching the ocean where it’s harmful to the environment. Ryan spends a part of every week sorting thru cans and bottles from his customers and getting them ready to take to the recycle center. In 2016, Ryan’s recycling story went viral and ever since he has been featured on web sites, television and radio stations around the planet. He’s a 2017 CNN Young Wonder, he’s appeared on the Ellen DeGeneres show, The Pickler & Ben show and was interviewed by Maria Menunous on Sirius/XM Radio as well as Ryan Seacrest’s syndicated radio program and featured on the KFI AM 640 Bill Handel show. He’s a multiple time WE DAY speaker and has been featured on NBC, CNN, CNBC, PBS, FOX News, Amazon Prime’s SELF MADE series, Australia’s Channel 7 Sunrise morning show, Huffington Post, Voice of America, AJ+, UpWorthy, NOW THIS!, 60 Second Docs, KBS, USA Today, Univision, Good Morning America, and ABC World News. Ryan has been recognized internationally for his recycling efforts and Ryan was awarded the “2017 Citizen of the Year” by his hometown of San Juan Capistrano and he was recognized by the Orange County Register as one of the 100 most influential people of 2017. Ryan was selected in 2018 by MSN in their top 15 kids changing the world and was featured in TIME Magazine for Kids and National Geographic as well as being featured as a WHIZ KID in OC Family Magazine. Thank you to everyone who have sent Ryan inspiring emails and supporting his passion. Ryan is hoping to raise as much awareness to saving the planet through recycling and saving for his future college education (or saving for a full size trash truck) and he is a Youth Ambassador at the Pacific Marine Mammal Center in Laguna Beach. All proceeds from his company logo t-shirts go to help support their volunteer efforts. Ryan is also a proud brand ambassador for the recycling and sustainability efforts of Sand Cloud, Busch Systems, Recycle Across America and Valet Living. People ask all the time what kind of items that Ryan recycles. Ryan collects and recycles plastic and glass beverage bottles as well as aluminum cans. Ryan and his dad take them in by the truckload regularly to the local redemption center where they are unloaded, sorted and weighed. If you’d like to help Ryan and help the environment at the same time, contact him here to schedule a pick up. Thank you to all of Ryan’s friends around the world, his customers and family who have supported his ambitions and hard work recycling. ||||| Photo Gallery of Ellen DeGeneres Ryan Hickman, 7, of San Juan Capistrano, was recently invited onto \\"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\\" to talk about his business, Ryan's Recycling Company.

To do that, let's first move all the terms containing h to one side of the equation. In this case, let's move the -2*h to the left side of the equation by adding 2*h to both sides. 2*h + 8 + 2*h = -2*h + 2*h This simplifies to: 4*h + 8 = 0 Step 2: Now, we need to isolate the 'h' term. To do that, let's subtract 8 from both sides of the equation. 4*h + 8 - 8 = 0 - 8 This simplifies to: 4*h = -8 Step 3: Finally, to find the value of 'h', we need to divide both sides of the equation by 4.

Article: It's illegal for the police to attach a GPS unit to your car without your permission, as the U.S. Supreme Court settled in 2012.But if the police are in hot pursuit of a bank robber or other escaping criminals that threaten public safety, a GPS tracker is acceptable. But exactly how can the police GPS track a car that is moving fast? The answer to that question comes from StarChase,a new police technology being used by a small but growing number of law enforcement agencies.It allows the police to fire 4.5-inch glue-covered GPS bullet-like projectiles from an air gun fixed in their police cars.If the GPS tracker makes contact with the escaping robber's car, it'll stick no matter how fast the vehicle is going.That way, the police will have a constant read on the car's location and heading.Aside from simply apprehending criminals,it's believed this new technology could help save lives.If the police successfully fire a GPS unit at a speeding criminal,they can pull back from a high-risk chase.Chases can be incredibly dangerous to all involved,including innocent bystanders and other drivers.Once the GPS bullet connects,there's no need for the chase any longer. Now,predictably,a GPS-loaded gun isn't cheap. Police departments need to pay about 5.000 per vehicle for the technology,and individual GPS bullets cost as much as 250 each.That may sound expensive,but remember:The alternative is often thousands of dollars in property damage,and great human cost in injury and lost life.According to Star Chase,their GPS bullet system has an apprehension rate of 80%without any report of inury or property damage.If you'd like to learn more about the StarChase system,Popular Mechanics has just published a good article about it.There's also plenty more information available at the company's website.

Like an opera, an oratorio includes the use of a choir, soloists, an ensemble, various distinguishable characters, and arias. However, opera is musical theatre, while oratorio is strictly a concert piecethough oratorios are sometimes staged as operas, and operas are sometimes presented in concert form. In an oratorio there is generally little or no interaction between the characters, and no props or elaborate costumes. A particularly important difference is in the typical subject matter of the text. Opera tends to deal with history and mythology, including age-old devices of romance, deception, and murder, whereas the plot of an oratorio often deals with sacred topics, making it appropriate for performance in the church. Protestant composers took their stories from the Bible, while Catholic composers looked to the lives of saints, as well as to Biblical topics. Oratorios became extremely popular in early 17th-century Italy partly because of the success of opera and the Catholic Church's prohibition of spectacles during Lent. Oratorios became the main choice of music during that period for opera audiences. - The masque was a form of festive courtly entertainment that flourished in 16th- and early 17th-century Europe, though it was developed earlier in Italy, in forms including the intermedio (a public version of the masque was the pageant). A masque involved music and dancing, singing and acting, within an elaborate stage design, in which the architectural framing and costumes might be designed by a renowned architect, to present a deferential allegory flattering to the patron. Professional actors and musicians were hired for the speaking and singing parts. Often the masquers, who did not speak or sing, were courtiers: the English queen Anne of Denmark frequently danced with her ladies in masques between 1603 and 1611, and Henry VIII and Charles I of England performed in the masques at their courts. In the tradition of masque, Louis XIV of France danced in ballets at Versailles with music by Jean-Baptiste Lully. - A song, most broadly, is a single (and often standalone) work of music that is typically intended to be sung by the human voice with distinct and fixed pitches and patterns using sound and silence and a variety of forms that often include the repetition of sections. Written words created specifically for music or for which music is specifically created, are called lyrics. If a pre-existing poem is set to composed music in classical music it is an art song. Songs that are sung on repeated pitches without distinct contours and patterns that rise and fall are called chants. Songs in a simple style that are learned informally are often referred to as folk songs. Songs that are composed for professional singers who sell their recordings or live shows to the mass market are called popular songs. These songs, which have broad appeal, are often composed by professional songwriters, composers and lyricists. Art songs are composed by trained classical composers for concert or recital performances. Songs are performed live and recorded on audio or video (or in some, cases, a song may be performed live and simultaneously recorded). Songs may also appear in plays, musical theatre, stage shows of any form, and within operas. - A Singspiel (plural: Singspiele; literally \\"sing-play\\") is a form of German-language music drama, now regarded as a genre of opera. It is characterized by spoken dialogue, which is alternated with ensembles, songs, ballads, and arias which were often strophic, or folk-like. Singspiel plots are generally comic or romantic in nature, and frequently include elements of magic, fantastical creatures, and comically exaggerated characterizations of good and evil. History. Some of the first Singspiele were miracle plays in Germany, where dialogue was interspersed with singing. By the early 17th century, miracle plays had grown profane, the word \\"Singspiel\\" is found in print, and secular Singspiele were also being performed, both in translated borrowings or imitations from English and Italian songs and plays, and in original German creations. - A tradition is a belief or behavior passed down within a group or society with symbolic meaning or special significance with origins in the past. Common examples include holidays or impractical but socially meaningful clothes (like lawyers' wigs or military officers' spurs), but the idea has also been applied to social norms such as greetings. Traditions can persist and evolve for thousands of yearsthe word \\"tradition\\" itself derives from the Latin \\"tradere\\" or \\"traderer\\" literally meaning to transmit, to hand over, to give for safekeeping. While it is commonly assumed that traditions have ancient history, many traditions have been invented on purpose, whether that be political or cultural, over short periods of time. Various academic disciplines also use the word in a variety of ways. - Ballet is a type of performance dance that originated in the Italian Renaissance courts of the 15th century and later developed into a concert dance form in France and Russia. It has since become a widespread, highly technical form of dance with its own vocabulary based on French terminology. It has been globally influential and has defined the foundational techniques used in many other dance genres. Becoming a ballet dancer requires years of training. Ballet has been taught in various schools around the world, which have historically incorporated their own cultures to evolve the art. - Costume is the distinctive style of dress of an individual or group that reflects their class, gender, profession, ethnicity, nationality, activity or epoch. - A Requiem or Requiem Mass, also known as Mass for the dead (Latin: \\"Missa pro defunctis\\") or Mass of the dead (Latin: \\"Missa defunctorum\\"), is a Mass in the Catholic Church offered for the repose of the soul or souls of one or more deceased persons, using a particular form of the Roman Missal. It is frequently, but not necessarily, celebrated in the context of a funeral. - Operetta is a genre of light opera, \\"light\\" in terms both of music and subject matter. - A pianist is an individual musician who plays the piano. Most forms of Western music can make use of the piano. Consequently, pianists have a wide variety of repertoire and styles to choose from, including traditionally classical music, Jazz, blues and all sorts of popular music, including rock music. Most pianists can, to a certain extent, play other keyboard-related instruments such as the synthesizer, harpsichord, celesta and the organ and keyboard. Perhaps the greatest pianist of all time was Franz Liszt, whose piano mastery was described by Anton Rubinstein: \\"In comparison with Liszt, all other pianists are children\\". - Acting is an activity in which a story is told by means of its enactment by an actor or actress who adopts a characterin theatre, television, film, radio, or any other medium that makes use of the mimetic mode. - Drama is the specific mode of fiction represented in performance. The term comes from a Greek word meaning \\"action\\" (Classical Greek: , \\"drama\\"), which is derived from \\"to do\\" (Classical Greek: , \\"drao\\"). The two masks associated with drama represent the traditional generic division between comedy and tragedy. They are symbols of the ancient Greek Muses, Thalia, and Melpomene. Thalia was the Muse of comedy (the laughing face), while Melpomene was the Muse of tragedy (the weeping face). Considered as a genre of poetry in general, the dramatic mode has been contrasted with the epic and the lyrical modes ever since Aristotle's \\"Poetics\\" (c. 335 BCE)the earliest work of dramatic theory. - One Thousand and One Nights (\\"kitb alf layla wa-layla\\") is a collection of Middle Eastern and South Asian stories and folk tales compiled in Arabic during the Islamic Golden Age. It is often known in English as the Arabian Nights, from the first English language edition (1706), which rendered the title as \\"The Arabian Nights' Entertainment\\". - Dance is a performance art form consisting of purposefully selected sequences of human movement. This movement has aesthetic and symbolic value, and is acknowledged as dance by performers and observers within a particular culture.

The core meaning of the term refers to individuals who have contributed to the tradition of Western classical music through creation of works expressed in written musical notation (e.g., sheet music scores). - Abu Hassan is a comic opera in one act by Carl Maria von Weber to a German libretto by Franz Carl Hiemer , based on a story in One Thousand and One Nights . It was composed between 11 August 1810 and 12 January 1811 and has set numbers with recitative and spoken dialogue . The work is a Singspiel in the then popular Turkish style . - Dialogue (sometimes spelled dialog in U.S. English) is a written or spoken conversational exchange between two or more people, and a literary and theatrical form that depicts such an exchange. As a narrative, philosophical or didactic device, it is chiefly associated in the West with the Socratic dialogue as developed by Plato, but antecedents are also found in other traditions including Indian literature. In the 20th century, philosophical treatments of dialogue emerged from thinkers including Mikhail Bakhtin, Paulo Freire, Martin Buber, and David Bohm. Although diverging in many details, these thinkers have articulated a holistic concept of dialogue as a multi-dimensional, dynamic and context-dependent process of creating meaning. Educators such as Freire and Ramón Flecha have also developed a body of theory and technique for using egalitarian dialogue as a pedagogical tool. - A libretto is the text used in, or intended for, an extended musical work such as an opera, operetta, masque, oratorio, cantata or musical. The term \\"libretto\\" is also sometimes used to refer to the text of major liturgical works, such as the Mass, requiem and sacred cantata, or the story line of a ballet. - An aria (plural: \\"arie\\" , or \\"arias\\" in common usage, diminutive form arietta or ariette) in music was originally any expressive melody, usually, but not always, performed by a singer. The term became used almost exclusively to describe a self-contained piece for one voice, with or without orchestral accompaniment, normally part of a larger work. The typical context for arias is opera, but vocal arias also feature in oratorios and cantatas, sharing features of the operatic arias of their periods. - Islam (' ;) is a religion articulated by the Quran, a text considered by its adherents to be the verbatim word of God ('), and, for the vast majority of adherents, the teachings and normative example (called the \\"sunnah\\", composed of accounts called \\"hadith\\") of Muhammad (5708 June 632 CE). It is the world's second-largest religion and the fastest-growing major religion in the world, with over 1.7 billion followers or 23% of the global population, known as Muslims. Islam is an Abrahamic monotheistic religion that upholds that God is one and incomparable and that the purpose of existence is to worship God. Muslims consider Muhammad to be the last prophet of God. - An opera house is a theatre building used for opera performances that consists of a stage, an orchestra pit, audience seating, and backstage facilities for costumes and set building. While some venues are constructed specifically for operas, other opera houses are part of larger performing arts centers. - A critic is a professional who communicates an assessment and an opinion of various forms of creative works such as art, literature, music, cinema, theater, fashion, architecture, and food. Critics may also take as their subject social or government policy. Critical judgments, whether derived from critical thinking or not, weigh up a range of factors, including an assessment of the extent to which the item under review achieves its purpose and its creator's intention and a knowledge of its context. They may also include a positive or negative personal response. - A guitarist (or a guitar player) is a person who plays the guitar. Guitarists may play a variety of guitar family instruments such as classical guitars, acoustic guitars, electric guitars, and bass guitars. Some guitarists accompany themselves on the guitar by singing or playing the harmonica. - A ballad is a form of verse, often a narrative set to music. Ballads derive from the medieval French \\"chanson balladée\\" or \\"ballade\\", which were originally \\"danced songs\\". Ballads were particularly characteristic of the popular poetry and song of the British Isles from the later medieval period until the 19th century. They were widely used across Europe, and later in the Americas, Australia and North Africa. Ballads are 13 lines with an ABABBCBC form, consisting of couplets (two lines) of rhymed verse, each of 14 syllables. - The Middle East is a transcontinental region centered on Western Asia and Egypt. The corresponding adjective is \\"Middle-Eastern\\" and the derived noun is \\"Middle-Easterner\\". The term has come into wider usage as a replacement of the term Near East (as opposed to Far East) beginning in the early 20th century. - An orchestra is a large instrumental ensemble typical of classical music, which features string instruments such as violin, viola, cello and double bass, as well as brass, woodwinds, and percussion instruments, grouped in sections. Other instruments such as the piano and celesta may sometimes appear in a fifth keyboard section or may stand alone, as may the concert harp and, for performances of some modern compositions, electronic instruments. - Carl Maria Friedrich Ernst von Weber (18 or 19 November 1786 5 June 1826) was a German composer, conductor, pianist, guitarist and critic, one of the first significant composers of the Romantic school. - Theatre or theater is a collaborative form of fine art that uses live performers, typically actors or actresses, to present the experience of a real or imagined event before a live audience in a specific place, often a stage. The performers may communicate this experience to the audience through combinations of gesture, speech, song, music, and dance. Elements of art, such as painted scenery and stagecraft such as lighting are used to enhance the physicality, presence and immediacy of the experience. The specific place of the performance is also named by the word \\"theatre\\" as derived from the Ancient Greek (théatron, \\"a place for viewing\\"), itself from (theáomai, \\"to see\\", \\"to watch\\", \\"to observe\\"). - A cantata (literally \\"sung\\", past participle feminine singular of the Italian verb \\"cantare\\", \\"to sing\\") is a vocal composition with an instrumental accompaniment, typically in several movements, often involving a choir. - Recitative (also known by its Italian name \\"recitativo\\") is a style of delivery (much used in operas, oratorios, and cantatas) in which a singer is allowed to adopt the rhythms of ordinary speech. Recitative does not repeat lines as formally composed songs do. It resembles sung ordinary speech more than a formal musical composition. - A musician (or instrumentalist) is a person who plays a musical instrument or is musically talented. Anyone who composes, conducts, or performs music may also be referred to as a musician. - Opera (English plural: \\"operas\\"; Italian plural: \\"opere\\" ) is an art form in which singers and musicians perform a dramatic work combining text (libretto) and musical score, usually in a theatrical setting. In traditional opera, singers do two types of singing: recitative, a speech-inflected style and arias, a more melodic style. Opera incorporates many of the elements of spoken theatre, such as acting, scenery, and costumes and sometimes includes dance. The performance is typically given in an opera house, accompanied by an orchestra or smaller musical ensemble, which since the early 19th century has been led by a conductor. - A musical ensemble, also known as a music group or musical group, is a group of people who perform instrumental and/or vocal music, with the ensemble typically known by a distinct name. Some music ensembles consist solely of instruments, such as the jazz quartet or the orchestra. Some music ensembles consist solely of singers, such as choirs and doo wop groups. In both popular music and classical music, there are ensembles in which both instrumentalists and singers perform, such as the rock band or the Baroque chamber group for basso continuo (harpsichord and cello) and one or more singers. In classical music, trios or quartets either blend the sounds of musical instrument families (such as piano, strings, and wind instruments) or group together instruments from the same instrument family, such as string ensembles (e.g., string quartet) or wind ensembles (e.g., wind quintet). Some ensembles blend the sounds of a variety of instrument families, such as the orchestra, which uses a string section, brass instruments, woodwinds and percussion instruments, or the concert band, which uses brass, woodwinds and percussion.

With no official heir apparent, the Macedonian military command split, with one side proclaiming Alexander's half-brother Philip III Arrhidaeus (r. 323 – 317 BC) as king and the other siding with the infant son of Alexander and Roxana, Alexander IV (r. 323 – 309 BC). Except for the Euboeans and Boeotians, the Greeks also immediately rose up in a rebellion against Antipater known as the Lamian War (323–322 BC). When Antipater was defeated at the 323 BC Battle of Thermopylae, he fled to Lamia where he was besieged by the Athenian commander Leosthenes. A Macedonian army led by Leonnatus rescued Antipater by lifting the siege. Antipater defeated the rebellion, yet his death in 319 BC left a power vacuum wherein the two proclaimed kings of Macedonia became pawns in a power struggle between the diadochi, the former generals of Alexander's army.A council of the army convened in Babylon immediately after Alexander's death, naming Philip III as king and the chiliarch Perdiccas as his regent. Antipater, Antigonus Monophthalmus, Craterus, and Ptolemy formed a coalition against Perdiccas in a civil war initiated by Ptolemy's seizure of the hearse of Alexander the Great. Perdiccas was assassinated in 321 BC by his own officers during a failed campaign in Egypt against Ptolemy, where his march along the Nile River resulted in the drowning of 2,000 of his men. Although Eumenes of Cardia managed to kill Craterus in battle, this had little to no effect on the outcome of the 321 BC Partition of Triparadisus in Syria where the victorious coalition settled the issue of a new regency and territorial rights. Antipater was appointed as regent over the two kings. Before Antipater died in 319 BC, he named the staunch Argead loyalist Polyperchon as his successor, passing over his own son Cassander and ignoring the right of the king to choose a new regent...

Answer:","response":"The 1990 United States elections took place during the presidency of George H. W. Bush, who served as the 41st President of the United States from January 20, 1989, to January 20, 1993. The midterms, like all midterm elections in the United States, were held midway through George H. W. Bush's single term in office. These elections were conducted at the federal, state, and local levels, with various posts up for grabs, such as seats in the United States Congress, governorships, and state legislatures. The overall outcome of the 1990 elections saw significant gains for the Democratic Party, particularly in the United States Senate and United States House of Representatives. The shift in political power during these elections served as an indication of the American public's sentiment, reflecting, in part, disapproval of the Republican Party and the incumbent Bush administration. Now, returning to the original question of identifying the father of the man who would become the 43rd President of the United States, the answer is George H. W. Bush. His son, George W. Bush, served as the Governor of Texas from January 17, 1995, to December 21, 2000, before becoming the President of the United States. George W. Bush was inaugurated as the 43rd President on January 20, 2001, and served two terms in office, leaving on January 20, 2009. In summary, the 1990 United States elections occurred during the presidency of George H. W. Bush, the 41st President of the United States. George H. W. Bush's son, George W. Bush, later took office as the 43rd President of the United States, solidifying their place in American political history as the second father-son duo to both hold the highest elected office in the country, following John Adams and John Quincy Adams."},{"question":"Is it possible to conclude that \\"A brown dog shaking its head.\\" if \\"A brown dog learns latin.\\"?","response":"No, it is not possible to conclude that \\"A brown dog shaking its head\\" if \\"A brown dog learns Latin.\\" These two statements are entirely unrelated and cannot be logically connected or deduced from one another. Let us analyze both statements in more detail to understand why this conclusion is not possible. Statement 1: A brown dog learns Latin. The first statement provides information about a specific feature of a brown dog - its ability to learn Latin. Learning Latin is a language capability, which usually pertains to humans. In reality, it is highly unlikely for a dog to be able to learn Latin or any other human language to the extent a human can. Theoretically speaking, within the confines of this statement, we are to assume that this particular brown dog somehow has a unique ability to learn Latin as a language. Statement 2: A brown dog shaking its head. The second statement describes an action of a brown dog - shaking its head. This is a common dog behavior and can be seen in dogs of all breeds and colors. This action might be a response to several external factors or internal conditions, such as physical irritation, communicative behavior, or simply adjusting its ears. Unlike the first statement, this statement is providing information about a specific action performed by the brown dog without connecting it to any other context. The connection between these statements: There is no logical connection between these two statements. One statement informs us about a hypothetical language learning ability of a brown dog, while the other provides information about a physical action the dog performs. They are not causally related, and neither statement can serve as evidence or support for the other. To conclude, as there is no direct or indirect logical relation between the statements \\"A brown dog learns Latin\\" and \\"A brown dog shaking its head,\\" it is not possible to derive one statement from the other or to assume it happens due to the other statement. They are independent statements describing unrelated properties and actions concerning a brown dog."},{"question":"Choose from options: Determine if the sentence is true based on the text below: airplanes have fuel in them People who fly on airplanes today, the cargo hold is not X-rayed, but the baggage is.

Here's the justification: In the process of analyzing the information presented to us, firstly we look at the number of countries involved. According to the paragraph, US military forces are evacuating US citizens and citizens of 72 other countries but from one country in particular- Liberia. We don't have any information about US actions towards evacuating citizens from other countries in the original paragraph. Secondly, 230 other countries implies a much larger scale evacuation and exceeds the total number of nations in the world. The United Nations recognizes 195 sovereign nations (193 member states and 2 observer states), so there can't possibly be 230 distinct countries from where US citizens could be evacuated. So, based on the information you've given, we can't accurately or truthfully say they are evacuating US citizens from 230 other countries."},{"question":"In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Wash each quince in cool water. Stem and core the fruit and cut each one into chunks. Leave the peel intact. Place the pieces in a large soup pot or stew pot. Add enough water to cover all of the pieces by about an inch. Bring the water to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook the quinces for 45 minutes or so, until the pieces are soft. To test whether the quince pieces are done, poke them with a fork. If the fork slides in easily, the quince is ready. Overcooking the quince will affect the flavor, so make sure it is simmering, not boiling, as it cooks. Use a potato masher to mash the quince into pulp, leaving no large lumps. The mashed quince should be slightly runny, like loose applesauce. Add a little water if it seems too thick. Set out a large bowl. Place a mesh strainer over it, and cover the strainer with a large piece of cheesecloth. Pour the quince pulp into the cloth-covered strainer. The juice will begin to run into to the bowl, while the pulp stays in the cloth. Let the pulp strain for about 4 hours. Check the juice in the bowl every so often. You should end up with 4 to 5 cups after a 3 to 4 hours; if it doesn't seem as though you're getting enough juice, mix some water into the pulp and continue letting it drain. Use the back of a wooden spoon or a spatula to press the pulp when the straining time is nearing an end, to extract the last drops of juice.

We would require more context, such as additional sentences, to get a better understanding of the reviewer's perspective on the movie. However, the word \\"cherish\\" typically has a positive connotation and could indicate that the reviewer appreciated an aspect of the movie. Cherish is usually used to describe something that is held in high regard or cared for deeply, but because the surrounding context is absent, we cannot be sure if this word is being used to emphasize a positive sentiment on the complete review. To have a more precise conclusion, we need a complete sentence or even a paragraph from the movie review that gives clear insight into the reviewer's opinion. Factors like movie plot, acting, cinematography, and overall theme may all contribute to a reviewer's stance. In conclusion, while the word 'cherish' implies a positive sentiment, it is insufficient to determine whether the movie is seen positively or negatively based on this single word.

There is some evidence that myopia is inherited. If one or both of your parents need glasses, there is an increased chance that you will too. Individuals who spend a lot of time reading, working or playing at a computer, or doing other close visual work may also be more likely to develop nearsightedness. Because the eye continues to grow during childhood, myopia typically progresses until about age 20. However, nearsightedness may also develop in adults due to visual stress or health conditions such as diabetes. A common sign of nearsightedness is difficulty seeing distant objects like a movie screen or the TV, or the whiteboard or chalkboard in school. and the situation: Two elementary school classmates, Clarence and Molly, are sitting in the back row of the classroom while the teacher lectures. They are both paying attention and reading what the teacher is writing on the board, but Molly is finding it difficult to read what is on the board since it appears blurry.

First, I analyzed the sentence and identified the key phrases and terms. 2. For 'Amongst these destitute people are' I used 'Printre aceste persoane sărace se află'. Here 'printre' means 'amongst,' 'aceste' specifies 'these,' 'persoane sărace' is 'destitute people,' and 'se află' is a phrase meaning 'there are'. 3. For 'the indigenous Rohingya community of Western Burma' I translated as 'comunitatea indigenă Rohingya din vestul Birmaniei'. 'Comunitatea indigenă Rohingya' is the literal translation for 'the indigenous Rohingya community' and 'din vestul Birmaniei' means 'of Western Burma'. 4. For 'who, in recent years' I chose 'care, în ultimii ani', where 'care' is 'who' and 'în ultimii ani' is 'in recent years'. 5. The phrase 'have been the victims of ethnic cleansing' is translated as 'a fost victima unei epurări etnice'. Here, 'a fost victima' means 'have been the victims' and 'unei epurări etnice' is 'of ethnic cleansing'. 6. Lastly, 'carried out by the Burmese Government' is 'realizate de guvernul birman'. 'Realizate de' signifies 'carried out by' and 'guvernul birman' is 'the Burmese Government'.

Step 4: Conclude the review To sum up the review, I will reiterate my disappointment with the film and suggest that readers save their time and money by skipping this movie. Review: Disappointment on the Big Screen: A Review of \\"Falling Star\\" \\"Falling Star,\\" directed by John Smith and starring Jane Doe and Michael Johnson, was an eagerly anticipated film. Sadly, it failed to live up to the hype and fell flat in nearly every aspect. The plot revolves around Sarah (Jane Doe) who is on a quest to find her long-lost brother, Jack (Michael Johnson), in a post-apocalyptic world. While they eventually do reunite, the story's lack of depth and logic derails the audience’s interest. The screenplay undoubtedly is the weakest element, with poorly developed characters and a puzzling plot. Additionally, the dialogue seems forced and unnatural, further distancing the audience from any connection to the storyline. The acting, especially from the two leads, was incredibly disappointing. Jane Doe's performance came across as stiff and unconvincing, while Michael Johnson seemed to struggle with delivering any of his lines with emotion. Their on-screen chemistry was virtually non-existent, which only exacerbated the film's detached feeling. Moreover, John Smith's direction was lackluster, failing to bring anything exceptional to the table, as crucial scenes lacked tension and energy. The cinematography didn't elevate the movie, either. The dreary color palette and uninspired camera work added to the disappointments. In conclusion, \\"Falling Star\\" is a letdown on many levels – from its weak story, poor acting, uninspired direction, to its dull visuals. Save your time and money and skip this cinematic disappointment, as there are far better ways to spend your evening."},{"question":"Write highlights for this article: Shocking images depicting U.S. soldiers burning the bodies of what appear to be Iraqi insurgents, have emerged today.

Guidelines provided are to find the absolute value of the differences. This means you need to take the positive value of the difference, regardless of the order in which you subtract the values. Now, let's solve the instance you provided: [84, 5, 83, 83, -46, -33, -100, 21] Step 1: Start from the second value (5) and subtract the first value (84), then find the absolute value of the difference. |5 - 84| = |-79| = 79 Step 2: Continue with the third value (83) and subtract the second value (5), then find the absolute value of the difference. |83 - 5| = |78| = 78 Step 3: Keep moving through the list until you reach the last value (21), subtracting the previous value and finding the absolute value of the difference each time. Here's a summary of the differences: - |5 - 84| = 79 - |83 - 5| = 78 - |83 - 83| = 0 - |-46 - 83| = 129 - |-33 - (-46)| = 13 - |-100 - (-33)| = 67 - |21 - (-100)| = 121 The final output list should be: [79, 78, 0, 129, 13, 67, 121] That's it! You have now found the absolute value of the differences between each two consecutive values in the given list."},{"question":"How does the next paragraph end?

The reasoning behind this is that Amsterdam, the capital city of the Netherlands, is located in Northern Europe and is well-known for its extensive network of canals. These canals were mainly built during the 17th century, also known as the Dutch Golden Age. They were constructed to manage the city's increasing population and booming trade industry. Amsterdam's picturesque canals are one of its most famous and distinctive features. The city has more than 100 kilometers of canals, including the three main ones: Herengracht, Prinsengracht, and Keizersgracht. Together, they form a UNESCO World Heritage site called 'Seventeenth-century canal ring area of Amsterdam, inside the Singelgracht'.

Altında bulunulan süreç, etnik ve dini temelli ayrımcılığın neden olduğu çeşitli problemlerden dolayı, başlarından beri tezatlar ve karmaşıklıklar içeren bir hâl almıştır. Bu nedenle, bu sürecin ilerlemesinde devletin rolü hem önemlidir hem de hassasiyetle ele alınmalıdır. Türkiye'deki gayrimüslim azınlıkların mülkiyet hakları konusu, hem iç hem de uluslararası alanda, özellikle Avrupa Birliği üyelik süreci ve Türkiye'nin uluslararası hukuk yükümlülükleri doğrultusunda gerçekleştirilen reformlar çerçevesinde tartışmalar yaratmıştır. Bu kapsamda gerçekleştirilen adımlar; vakıf mallarının iadesi, gayrimüslim azınlık okullarının ve ibadet yerlerinin yasal statülerinin düzeltilmesi ve mülkiyet haklarının genişletilmesi gibi konuları içermektedir. Ancak bu süreçte atılan adımların etkisi ve başarısı, yapılan düzenlemelerin eksiklikleri ve uygulamada yaşanan sorunlar dahil olmak üzere tartışma konusu olmuştur. Mülkiyet hakları ile ilgili düzenlemeler konusunda atılan adımların önceliği gayrimüslim azınlıklara ait vakıf mallarının iadesi üzerine yoğunlaşmıştır. Türkiye, 1936'da kabul edilen Vakıflar Kanunu'nda yapılan değişikliklerle vakıf mallarının iadesi konusunda önemli bir adım atmıştır. Bununla birlikte, uygulamada yaşanan sorunlar ve yapılan düzenlemelerin yetersizliği, gayrimüslim azınlıkların mülkiyet haklarının tam anlamıyla güvence altına alınmasını engellemekte. Örneğin, mülkiyet haklarının geri verilmesi sürecinde, geri verilen vakıf mallarının özelleştirilmesi veya başka amaçlarla kullanılmasına yönelik hassasiyet ve denetim yetersizliği yaşanmaktadır. Aynı zamanda, bazı mülkiyetlerin geri alınmasında yaşanan süreçlerde, bürokrasi ve yasal engellerle karşılaşılmıştır. Öte yandan, gayrimüslim azınlıkların mülkiyet haklarının genişletilmesi ve düzeltilmesi konusunda atılan adımlar, bu alanlarda yaşanan sorunların büyük bir kısmını çözmeye yönelik olarak değerlendirilmeli. Bu noktada, devletin, gayrimüslim azınlıkların mülkiyet haklarını iyileştirmeye yönelik somut adımlar atarak yasal düzenlemeleri sağlamlaştırması ve uygulamadaki sorunları gidermesi gerekmektedir. Sonuç olarak, Türkiye'nin Müslüman olmayan azınlıkların mülkiyet haklarını iyileştirmek için atmaya başladığı adımlar önemli olmakla beraber, bu süreçte yaşanan kısıtlamalar ve sorunlar önemli bir ilgi alanı olarak kalmaya devam etmektedir. Türkiye, uluslararası yükümlülüklerini ve demokratik değerleri korumak adına, gayrimüslim azınlıkların mülkiyet haklarının tam anlamıyla güvence altına alınması için süreci hızlandırmalı ve çözüme yönelik daha etkin adımlar atmaya devam etmelidir."},{"question":"Question 1: How can we recover our Gmail password online? Question 2: How Can You Recover Your Gmail Password? Possible answers: 1. no; 2. yes; Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","response":"Yes, the answer to these two questions would indeed be the same as they are both inquiring about the process of recovering a Gmail password online. Here is a detailed answer to help you with password recovery. Although it can be a frustrating experience to forget your Gmail password, Gmail has provided a fairly user-friendly password recovery process. Here are the steps to recover your Gmail password: 1. **Go to Gmail:** Begin by navigating to the Gmail homepage (www.gmail.com). 2. **Click \\"Forgot password\\":** Click on the \\"Forgot password\\" link located underneath the password field. 3. **Enter your Gmail address:** Enter your Gmail address (your email ending in \\"@gmail.com\\") in the \\"Email or phone\\" field and click \\"Next.\\" 4. **Analyze your account information:** Gmail will ask you for any previous passwords you remember. This is to verify your ownership of the account. If you don't remember any previous passwords, click on \\"try another way.\\" 5. **Verification:** Gmail will provide various ways to verify your identity. These may include sending a verification code via text message to your registered phone number, a security question you had set up, sending a prompt to your phone where you're signed in to your Google Account, email verification to a recovery email address if it's linked with your account. Depending on the verification method, * If you’ve chosen the text message option, you'll need to enter the code that's sent via SMS to your registered phone number. * If you choose the security question option, you'll need to answer it correctly. * If you’ve chosen the email verification option, you'll have to follow the instructions sent to your additional recovery email. 6. **Enter the verification code or answer the question:** Depending upon what verification option you opted for, you now have to enter the verifier. 7. **Reset password:** If the verification is successful, Gmail will ask you to create a new password. Ensure that your new password is secure and unique, and is something that you will remember. 8. **Complete the password recovery process:** Once you've created your new password, you can use it to access your Gmail account. Consider saving your password in a secure password manager to avoid forgetting it in the future. In case you fail to recover your password on your own, you can also get in touch with Google's customer service for further assistance. Remember, this process only works if you've set up a recovery method, like a phone number or an alternative email address. If you haven't, it will be harder for Gmail to verify your account ownership and recover your password. It's always a good idea to keep your account recovery information updated for situations like these. So, for both questions, the process of recovering the Gmail password would be the same, as outlined above."},{"question":"At length, as I entered the pass, the huge rocks began to close around in all their wild, mysterious impressiveness, when suddenly, as I was gazing eagerly about me, a drove of gray hairy beings came in sight, lumbering toward me with a kind of boneless, wallowing motion like bears.

Muhammed Rahim al-Afghani, who is being held with the most significant terrorism suspects in U.S. custody, has apparently gained extensive knowledge of western pop culture in Guantanamo's Camp 7. An inmate who is imprisoned alongside 'high value' terrorism suspects in the most secretive of Guantanamo Bay camps has somehow learned about Gangnam Style, his lawyer has revealed. Mohammed Rahim al-Afghani, an Afghan man who became the last prisoner sent to Guantanamo after he was accused of helping Osama bin Laden elude capture five years ago, has written a series of letters to lawyer Carlos Warner, revealing a startling knowledge about western culture. Across the letters, he refers to Howard Stern, Fox News and the global video hit of South Korean singer PSY - hardly what you'd expect from a middle-age Afghan who has never been to the U.S. 'Dear Mr. Warner,' he wrote. 'I like. this new song Gangnam Style. I want to do the dance for you but cannot. because of my shackles.' In another letter, the multilingual Rahim. shows some familiarity with American slang. He tells his lawyer, most. likely in jest, that he has adopted a banana rat, a rodent commonly. spotted around the U.S. base in Cuba. 'Tell the guards to leave my. friend alone. They need to chillax.' South Korean rapper Psy has become a global phenomenon with his signature song and dance, 'Gangnam Style' The letters come as a surprise as little has been heard about Rahim since his capture. He was interrogated at an undisclosed location then locked away in Guantanamo's Camp 7, a prison unit shrouded in secrecy that holds about 15 men who have been designated 'high value' detainees. The letters suggest that the prisoners in Camp 7, a group that includes five charged with aiding and orchestrating the September 11 terror attack, are not completely isolated from the outside world. To Warner, a federal public defender for the Northern District of Ohio, the letters humanize a man who he contends has been demonized by U.S. authorities, who allege he worked as a translator and assistant to bin Laden and other al-Qaida leaders. The lawyer says the letters demonstrate a surprising amount of resilience. 'It shows he's different and he's intelligent,' Warner said. 'Just think that he's doing this under all the restrictions that's he's under down there. He has an incredibly good sense of humor.' There have been letters released to the media in the past from other detainees at Guantanamo, often providing valuable information about the prison. Muhammed Rahim al-Afghan said that he cannot do Psy's signature moves because of his shackles. The Justice Department document says Rahim began helping the Taliban in the 1990s and that job morphed into working for al-Qaida. It cites two other prisoners and an undisclosed source identifying Rahim as a close associate of bin Laden. Rahim was captured in Pakistan in 2007 and turned over to the CIA, in whose custody he was subjected to prolonged sleep deprivation. He was transferred to Guantanamo in March 2008. In photos taken by the Red Cross at Camp 7, and obtained by the AP from the prisoner's family in Afghanistan, Rahim has a long flowing beard. In one, he smiles broadly at the camera. It is unclear how the prisoner learned so much of Western pop culture from Cell 7 in Guantanamo, located in Cuba. The first letters from Rahim released by Warner were in June, including one in which he disclosed that Majid Khan, a former Maryland resident who pleaded guilty to aiding al-Qaida, had acquired a cat at Camp 7, which AP reported at the time. The Pentagon and prison officials declined comment and said they could not discuss conditions of confinement for high-value detainees, although they added that prisoners are not permitted to have pets. Rahim al-Afghan was accused of helping the late Osama bin Laden go into hiding; here, bin Laden's house in Abbottabad, Pakistan. The rest of the letters came during or after subsequent visits by Warner, who had them cleared by the military before releasing them to the AP. None are more than a few sentences, and contain many typographical errors, which have been corrected for this story for the sake of clarity. In one, Rahim returns to the theme of his fellow prisoner's alleged cat. 'I want a dog,' he writes. 'I will train my dog to chase Majid Khan's cat.' Osama bin Laden was killed in his home on May 1, 2011. In separate notes, he asks Warner to appeal for help from radio personality Howard Stern. 'If he is the 'King of All Media' he can help me.' In another, he criticizes Fox News' 'Fair and Balanced' slogan, writing that if that were true the channel 'would not have to say it every five minutes.' How he came by this information is not clear. A prison spokesman, Navy Capt. Robert Durand, won't discuss life in Camp 7 but he says that \\"where satellite television and radio is available for detainees,\\" they have access to a wide variety of channels in Arabic, Farsi, English, Russian, Spanish and other languages. The line-up, however, apparently does not include Howard Stern or Fox. With no Internet access, he could have picked up such information from other shows or through Warner, who has spent hours with him and delivered magazines such as Rolling Stone, Sports Illustrated and The Economist. The U.S. military will not say when or if Rahim will be charged. His name does not appear on the list of detainees who have been cleared for release from Guantanamo and his name was not among those mentioned as possible candidates for an exchange with the Taliban as part of a peace deal. What are the important parts of this article?","response":"The article discusses how Muhammed Rahim al-Afghani, who is currently being held in U.S. custody alongside significant terrorism suspects at Guantanamo Bay’s Camp 7, has gained extensive knowledge of Western pop culture despite being in detention. This was revealed through a series of letters written by Rahim to his lawyer, Carlos Warner, where he demonstrates knowledge of numerous pop culture references, including South Korean singer PSY's song - Gangnam Style, American radio personality Howard Stern, and Fox News. Rahim is the last prisoner to be transferred to Guantanamo, where he was held after being accused of assisting Osama bin Laden avoid capture. He is multilingual and presents a surprising amount of resilience, humor, and intelligence in his letters according to Warner, who shares that these traits help humanize Rahim, a man he asserts has been demonized by U.S. authorities. The article also provides some background about Rahim, mentioning that he began assisting the Taliban in the 1990s and subsequently started working for Al-Qaida. It says he was captured in Pakistan in 2007 and handed over to the CIA where he was subjected to prolonged sleep deprivation before being transferred to Guantanamo in March 2008. The ways in which Rahim gathered so much knowledge about Western pop culture, from his prison cell in Cuba, is unclear. But he’s been able to access a variety of TV and radio channels in various languages. While he doesn’t have access to the internet, he could have potentially garnered such information from other shows or via Warner, who provided him with magazines like Rolling Stone, Sports Illustrated and The Economist, and spent hours with him.

Also, his name hasn’t been mentioned among possible candidates for an exchange with the Taliban as part of a peace deal. Overall, Rahim's letters demonstrate that prisoners in Camp 7 are not entirely isolated from the outside world, challenging some people's presumptions about the conditions of high-value detainees. Lastly, prison officials and the Pentagon declined comment and specified that high-value detainees are not allowed to keep pets, in response to Warner revealing that Rahim expressed a desire to adopt a dog and train it to chase fellow prisoner Majid Khan's alleged cat in one of the letters."},{"question":"Q:Both Zan-e Rooz and Glamour are magazines catered to which biological sex.?

Although the band had typically featured four lead vocalists (with Edge also contributing vocally), Hayward was the principal guitarist/vocalist whilst Pinder was considered to be the person most responsible for their symphonic sound, arrangements, and overall conceptual direction. Pinder and Thomas also doubled as the Moodies' onstage MCs (as the 1969 \\"Caught Live + 5\\" album displayed). Before the band's 1973-74 world tour (their last with Pinder), Hayward wrote a song called \\"Island\\" with the intention of including it on a potential follow-up album, which the Moodies recorded in 1973 before ultimately going their separate ways. An additional cause of the hiatus were the long tours that had by this time strained Pinder, who needed a rest. In 1974 the band oversaw preparation of the compilation album This Is The Moody Blues which was released that year. Hayward and Lodge released a duo album, the very successful Blue Jays (1975), and a UK chart single, \\"Blue Guitar\\" (no. 8), which was credited to Hayward and Lodge even though it was just Hayward with 10cc backing him.

Traficant graduated from Cardinal Mooney High School in 1959 and the University of Pittsburgh in 1963. He played quarterback for Pitt's football team, and his teammates included Mike Ditka. Traficant was drafted in the NFL's twentieth round (276th overall) by the Pittsburgh Steelers in 1963, and tried out for the Steelers and the Oakland Raiders of the American Football League, but did not play professionally. He later obtained a master's degree from the University of Pittsburgh (1973) and another from Youngstown State University (1976). At the start of his career, Traficant worked as consumer finance director for the Youngstown Community Action Program. He taught courses on drug and alcohol dependency and recovery at Youngstown State University and Kent State University, as well as lecturing on drug and alcohol abuse for colleges and government agencies outside Ohio. In addition, Traficant taught at the Ohio Peace Officer Training Academy. He was the executive director of the Mahoning County Drug Program from 1971 to 1981, and Sheriff of Mahoning County from 1981 to 1985. While serving as sheriff, Traficant made national headlines by refusing to execute foreclosure orders on several unemployed homeowners, many of whom had been left out of work by the recent closures of steel mills. This endeared him to the local population, which was dealing with a declining economy following the closures and relocations of steel making and steel-associated businesses. In 1983, he was charged with racketeering for accepting bribes. Traficant, who represented himself in the criminal trial, argued that he accepted the bribes only as part of his own alleged secret undercover investigation into corruption. Traficant was acquitted of the charges, becoming the only person ever to win a Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) case while representing himself. Publicity from the RICO trial increased Traficant's local visibility. He was elected as a Democrat to Congress from Ohio's 17th District, defeating Lyle Williams, a three-term Republican incumbent. He was reelected eight times without serious opposition.

The principle of casual Fridays seems to have appeared around the 1950s. It was probably in response to the changing attitudes towards workplaces. Over time, some offices have relaxed their dress rules even more by using a \\"business casual\\" dress rule. On casual Fridays, employees may wear clothes which are considered to be \\"business casual\\", meaning they still obey certain standards . Clothes must be clean and in good condition, with no spots. Men are generally allowed to wear casual trousers and bright-colored clothes, and in some offices they may be allowed to wear button-down shirts or polo shirts, with or without a tie. Women often wear neat skirts or dresses; casual trousers are common and generally allowed to wear, except in very formal workplaces. As a general rule, extremely casual clothes, like jeans, shorts, T-shirts, tank tops, and so on, are not encouraged on casual Fridays. Employees are still expected to make an effort to look professional, out of respect for their offices and their customers. Many people feel that casual Fridays are good for employees'mood because they encourage employees to express their individuality and feel more comfortable in the offices. Others feel that business casual clothing and the concept of casual Fridays don't show respect for the workplaces. Casual Fridays are dealt with differently, depending on the industry and the nation. The technology industry, for example, is well known for casual clothes in general, while major financial companies still dislike casual clothes. We can learn from the passage that _ . A) the casual Friday concept has been out of fashion B) people were required to wear formal clothes in offices before casual Fridays concept appeared C) the casual Friday concept had appeared before the 1950s D) employees who wear formal clothes lack individuality A:","response":"B) people were required to wear formal clothes in offices before the casual Fridays concept appeared. The casual Friday concept emerged around the 1950s as a sign that strict dress rules for offices were starting to relax. Before this concept appeared, employees were expected to adhere to formal dress codes in the workplace. As attitudes towards workplaces evolved, casual Fridays provided an opportunity for employees to dress in a more comfortable, \\"business casual\\" manner while still maintaining a professional appearance. While the practice differs across industries and nations, it generally caters to the employees' comfort and individuality while ensuring a sense of respect for their offices and customers."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Title: It's Amazing...

Fort Ticonderoga (), formerly Fort Carillon, is a large 18th-century star fort built by the French at a narrows near the south end of Lake Champlain, in northern New York, in the United States. It was constructed by Canadian-born French military engineer Michel Chartier de Lotbinière, Marquis de Lotbinière between October 1755 and 1757, during the action in the \\"North American theater\\" of the Seven Years' War, often referred to in the US as the French and Indian War. The fort was of strategic importance during the 18th-century colonial conflicts between Great Britain and France, and again played an important role during the American Revolutionary War. The site controlled a river portage alongside the mouth of the rapids-infested La Chute River, in the 3.5 miles (5.6 km) between Lake Champlain and Lake George. It was thus strategically placed for the competition over trade routes between the British-controlled Hudson River Valley and the French-controlled Saint Lawrence River Valley. The terrain amplified the importance of the site. Both lakes were long and narrow and oriented north–south, as were the many ridge lines of the Appalachian Mountains, which extended as far south as Georgia. The mountains created nearly impassable terrains to the east and west of the Great Appalachian Valley that the site commanded. The name \\"Ticonderoga\\" comes from the Iroquois word tekontaró:ken, meaning \\"it is at the junction of two waterways\\".During the 1758 Battle of Carillon, 4,000 French defenders were able to repel an attack by 16,000 British troops near the fort. In 1759, the British returned and drove a token French garrison from the fort. During the American Revolutionary War, when the British controlled the fort, it was attacked in May 1775 in the Capture of Fort Ticonderoga by the Green Mountain Boys and other state militia under the command of Ethan Allen and Benedict Arnold, who captured it in the surprise attack. Cannons taken from the fort were transported to Boston to lift its siege by the British, who evacuated...

Keep emotional distance from the issue you’re evaluating. Consider how the “cons” can be overcome. Article:","response":"Title: A Balanced Approach: Using Pro and Con Columns to Make Informed Decisions Introduction In our daily lives, we constantly face numerous decisions; some insignificant, others impactful. At times, it can be difficult to make these decisions and finding an objective approach is vital. One such approach is the use of pro and con columns. In this article, we will explore the benefits of using pro and con columns to maintain emotional distance and carefully evaluate the issue at hand. Step 1: Filling Out the Pro and Con Columns To start, simply take a sheet of paper and divide it into two columns. Label one column 'pros' and the other 'cons.' This visual representation helps to create a clearer understanding of the issue. Next, think about the decision or problem being faced and consider all the possible positive and negative outcomes. Write these points down in the respective columns, and take your time to ensure that you have considered all aspects of the situation. Step 2: Keeping Emotional Distance It can be easy to let emotions cloud our judgment when it comes to making decisions, which may result in irrational choices. By maintaining emotional distance from the issue, we can remain unbiased and focus on the facts at hand. Writing down the pros and cons of a situation allows us to detach ourselves from potential emotional influences and clearly assess the situation. Step 3: Evaluating the Cons and Finding Solutions Once you have filled out the pro and con columns, it's important to carefully review the list. Consider the weight and significance of each point. Some cons may have more impact on the overall decision than others. By recognizing these points, you can give more attention to the cons that truly matter. With a clearer understanding of the cons, the next step is to evaluate whether there are possible solutions or alternatives to overcome them. Brainstorm ways you can mitigate the negative aspects of the situation or decision. The goal is to improve the overall outcome and to address potential concerns in a proactive manner. Conclusion In conclusion, using pro and con columns can significantly help individuals make more informed, objective decisions in both their personal and professional lives. This approach ensures that we don't let emotions cloud our judgment and that all aspects of a situation are considered. By evaluating the cons and working to find possible solutions, individuals can make a final decision with confidence and clarity."},{"question":"Not all relay races are a component of the special Olympics and racial identity cannot be inferred from outward appearances.is the reasoning for what question and answer pair?","response":"Question: Can you determine someone's participation in the Special Olympics' relay races or their racial identity based on their outward appearance?

She called her situation a \\"life-altering\\" experience and said she now wants to be a \\"catalyst of good\\" going forward. \\"I am deeply humbled by this opportunity to grow,\\" she said. \\"I do not believe I am a threat to society and I ask you to allow me to prove it,\\" she pleaded to the judge. Conley's mother waved to her with tears in her eyes as Conley was led out of the courtroom. Later her parents released a statement online criticizing the U.S. legal system for making an example of their daughter in trying to discourage others from turning to extremism. If \\"the government is willing to sacrifice the future of a 19-year-old American citizen to drive the point home ... then we feel the terrorists have won this particular battle in the war on terrorism.\\" Outside the courthouse after the proceeding, Conley's lawyer, Assistant Federal Defender Robert Pepin, told reporters he was disappointed with the sentence and noted that the plea agreement imposed limitations on any appeal, which the defense is considering. \\"I think the judge gave a sentence he thought was appropriate. That's all I really have to say about the sentence,\\" Pepin said. He said he wanted Americans to know that his client is a wonderful person. \\"Her future will be bright. She will get past this,\\" he said. But Moore said Conley's plea agreement gave him limited options on sentencing. Under the plea agreement, Conley faced \\"up to five years in federal prison and a fine up to 250,000 for conspiracy to provide material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization,\\" federal prosecutors said. She received credit for cooperating with federal authorities, according to the prosecutor and the judge. Her prison sentence will be followed by three years of supervised release and 100 hours of community service, in which she has to interact with \\"ordinary people,\\" Moore said. He also prohibited her possession of any black powder or explosive materials. \\"I'm not taking any chances,\\" Moore said. Conley's plea was made last year in exchange for a reduced charge with a lighter sentence. During Friday's sentencing hearing, U.S. Attorney Greg Holloway said Conley has been cooperative and willingly provided information to investigators. He argued that a four-year sentence would send a message that the U.S. government uses restraint, but consequences are serious in terror cases. Moore interrupted the prosecutor at one point saying, \\"That woman is in need of psychiatric help.\\" \\"I'm not saying that her decisions were all a product of mental illness. ... But she's a bit of a mess,\\" Moore said. The judge referenced Conley's psychiatric report that stated \\"she is not a terrorist.\\" The judge also alluded to a series of events from 2011 to her arrest in 2014. \\"There is a history of events that would make for a bad movie,\\" Moore said. Conley almost agreed to marry three different people in a matter of months, according to Moore. The prosecutor said Conley was \\"pathologically naive.\\" Added the judge: \\"She has no history in the criminal justice system. She is very young. ... Teenagers make dumb decisions a lot.\\" Conley looked relaxed in court. She smiled at times while talking with lawyers before the hearing. She wore a blue and white jail uniform, a head scarf and glasses. Pepin said while Conley has been in jail, she has been studying Spanish and macroeconomics, writing letters to her mother, sisters, friends, even \\"Allah,\\" talking about religion and her desire \\"to understand.\\" Her lawyer said she has gone through a complete transformation in the past nine months. Pepin argued that \\"the things that she believed at the time she was arrested she does not believe now.\\" He noted that Conley, a convert to Islam, changed her adopted Muslim name from Halima to Amatullah, because she is a different person now. Amatullah means female \\"servant of Allah.\\" Conley initially took the name Halima after converting to Islam. Opinion: When Americans leave for jihad. But Moore adamantly responded, \\"She had another name before Halima.\\" \\"Don't tell me that changing her name means she gets it. She changes her name like I change my socks,\\" the judge told the defense. The judge said a belief, even if she was misled by ill-intentioned extremists asserting religion justifies violent jihad, does not excuse her actions. \\"There is a string of defiance that rolls through her life that I have not seen change yet,\\" Moore said. \\"Defiance has been a part of the fabric for a long time and that is concerning.\\" The judge talked about how she showed up to a meeting with the FBI wearing a T-shirt that said, \\"Sniper don't run, you'll die trying.\\" The judge also mentioned how investigators tried to stop Conley with multiple warnings that following through on her plans could lead to her arrest. She responded with, \\"I'd rather go to prison than do nothing,\\" according to Moore. The judge also expressed alarm about Conley's other preoccupations. \\"What am I to do about this obsession with the military?\\" Moore said. Opinion: Rise of the female jihadists. He said Conley planned to be a police officer and join the military and then went to training with U.S. Army Explorers to learn military skills. What if one reason she desired to go to Syria to marry an ISIS fighter wasn't just because she shared a belief in jihad, but \\"because he was attractive to her because he was a soldier?\\" the judge asked. The judge noted that Conley still signs letters \\"behind enemy lines.\\" A female imam went to mentor Conley in jail and reported that Conley wanted to talk about violent jihad. The judge said it's surprising that Conley suddenly is disavowing jihad and that she has seemed to do a 180-degree turn in a very short period. The judge also brought up a letter Conley wrote to a friend that seemed to mock the American people's concern about terrorism. Moore also referenced comments that Conley made to CNN when it visited her a day before Friday's sentencing. Conley told CNN of her new adopted Muslim name, a new hairstyle for the sentencing date, and how \\"I'm in a vulnerable place right now, and it would be stupid of me to talk to you when I'm vulnerable.\\" On Friday, Moore noted that \\"she doesn't get it.\\" \\"She's a look-at-me girl,\\" Moore continued, and he referenced the CNN interview. Pipen said he was furious about the jailhouse visit and said he thought it was sneaky. The judge also cited the ISIS fighter whom she was to marry, Yousr Mouelhi, a 32-year-old Tunisian man. \\"Why did she think Mouelhi was a good man?... Does she get this?\\" the judge said. He indicated that Conley still calls her suitor \\"a good man.\\" Conley attracted national attention last year after authorities arrested her at Denver International Airport. Investigators said she told them she was going to Turkey to await word from an ISIS member in Syria, a man she met on the Internet and planned to marry. According to court documents, she intended to become a nurse in an ISIS camp. She is a Colorado certified nurse's aide. Her parents, Ana Maria and John Conley, were aware of their daughter's conversion to Islam but didn't know about her interest in extreme Islam or jihad. John Conley reportedly caught his daughter talking to her ISIS \\"suitor\\" on Skype. The couple asked for the father's blessing, but he said no. On April 1, the father called the FBI to report that he had found her ticket for an April 8 flight to Turkey on his desk. Opinion: What lures Americans to Syria fight? CNN's Ana Cabrera and Sara Weisfeldt reported from Colorado. Michael Martinez wrote and reported from Los Angeles. Highlights:","response":"- 19-year-old Colorado woman, Shannon Maureen Conley, was sentenced to four years in prison for wanting to become an ISIS bride and participate in its jihad in the Mideast. - Conley is one of the first Americans to be sentenced for conspiracy to support ISIS, and her sentence aimed to send a message of deterrence. - The judge initially said Conley needed psychiatric care, but eventually agreed with the prosecutors' recommendation for the prison sentence. - Conley expressed regret for her actions and claimed her understanding of Islam and ISIS had been distorted by online sources. - Following her prison sentence, Conley will also have three years of supervised release and be required to complete 100 hours of community service."},{"question":"The exercise is to decide whether the question accepts the proposed suggestion as a correct answer.

She is the great-granddaughter of Conrad Hilton, the founder of Hilton Hotels. Born in New York City and raised there and in Beverly Hills, California, Hilton began her modeling career as a teenager when she signed with New York-based modeling development agency Trump Model Management. Her lifestyle and rumored short-lived relationships made her a feature of entertainment news and tabloid magazines, and Hilton was proclaimed \\"New York's leading It girl\\" in 2001. Hilton was born in New York City. Her mother, Kathy Hilton (nee Kathleen Elizabeth Avanzino), is a socialite and former actress; her father, Richard Howard \\"Rick\\" Hilton, is a businessman. She was raised in the Catholic faith. Hilton is the oldest of four children; she has one sister, Nicholai Olivia \\"Nicky\\" Hilton (born 1983), and two brothers: Barron Nicholas Hilton II (born 1989) and Conrad Hughes Hilton III (born 1994). Her paternal great-grandfather was Conrad Hilton, who founded Hilton Hotels. Hilton has Norwegian, German, Italian, English, Irish, and Scottish ancestry. She moved frequently in her youth, living in a suite in the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in Manhattan, Beverly Hills and the Hamptons. As a child, she was friends with other socialites, including Ivanka Trump, Nicole Richie and Kim Kardashian. Growing up in Los Angeles, Hilton attended the Buckley School and St. Paul the Apostle School, finishing elementary school in 1995. Her freshman year of high school (1995-96) was spent at the Marywood-Palm Valley School in Rancho Mirage, California. In 1996, Hilton and her family left California for the East Coast. At age 16, Hilton spent one year at the Provo Canyon School for emotionally troubled teens. She then attended the Canterbury School in New Milford, Connecticut from fall 1998 to February 1999 (her junior year), where she was a member of the ice hockey team. In February 1999, Hilton was expelled from Canterbury for violating school rules, returning to the Dwight School before dropping out a few months later. She later earned a GED certification. Hilton began modeling as a child, originally at charity events. When she was 19, she signed with Donald Trump's modeling agency, T Management. Hilton said that she \\"wanted to model\\", Trump wanted her at his agency, and she was \\"loving\\" the work. While modeling, she became a daily feature of entertainment news for her partying; according to Vanity Fair, Cisco Adler (producer of Sweetie Pie, in which Hilton acted) called her \\"a young party girl who gets sucked into the L.A. party scene and grew up a little too fast\\". In 2001, Hilton developed a reputation as a socialite; she was called \\"New York's leading It Girl\\", whose fame was beginning to \\"extend beyond the New York tabloids\\". Around that time she made a cameo appearance in Zoolander and appeared on several magazine covers, including the UK's Tatler, Italy's Giola and the US' Vanity Fair and FHM. Hilton also appeared in Vincent Gallo's \\"Honey Bunny\\" video. In 2002, she played a lead role in the straight-to-video horror film, Nine Lives. According to Beyondhollywood.com, \\"Hilton's presence in the cast is the film's main marketing point, which is plainly obvious by the fact that she's front and center on the box art and is the only recognizable name in the cast\\". The website noted that her character was, basically, herself: \\"Hilton plays--what else?--a spoiled American socialite who shops on three continents in one day. The script is even clever enough to take a few jabs at Hilton's real-life social standing, even mentioning that she's been on the cover of a few sleaze rags in her day\\". That year Hilton became engaged to fashion model Jason Shaw, but they broke up in early 2003. Did she attend college?","response":"Paris Hilton did not attend college. After being expelled from Canterbury School for violating school rules and returning to the Dwight School before dropping out a few months later, she later earned a GED certification. Instead of pursuing college education, she began her modeling career by signing with Donald Trump's modeling agency, T Management, when she was 19 years old."},{"question":"Background: Quicksand forms in saturated loose sand when the sand is suddenly agitated. When water in the sand cannot escape, it creates a liquefied soil that loses strength and cannot support weight. Quicksand can form in standing water or in upwards flowing water (as from an artesian spring). In the case of upwards flowing water, forces oppose the force of gravity and suspend the soil particles. The saturated sediment may appear quite solid until a sudden change in pressure or shock initiates liquefaction. This causes the sand to form a suspension and lose strength. The cushioning of water gives quicksand, and other liquefied sediments, a spongy, fluid-like texture. Objects in liquefied sand sink to the level at which the weight of the object is equal to the weight of the displaced soil/water mix and the submerged object floats due to its buoyancy. Paragraph: Rob is competing in a cross country race. After running about a mile he reached a place with two signs, sign A and sign B. Sign A says that it's a quicksand.

The first statement specifically describes a man wearing a sweater who is playing darts. Darts is a game that typically involves throwing small, pointed missiles (darts) at a circular target (dartboard) mounted on a wall. The key information provided in this statement revolves around the person's appearance (wearing a sweater) and the activity they are engaged in (playing darts). The second statement, \\"A guy is playing pool.\\", refers to a completely different situation. In this case, the person is described simply as a \\"guy\\" with no additional information about his appearance. Furthermore, the activity mentioned here is \\"playing pool\\", also known as billiards, which is a distinct game that involves using a cue to strike billiard balls across a table, aiming to pocket the balls in one of the table's six pockets. There is no direct connection between the two statements, as they involve different individuals (or at least provide no information to assume they are the same individual) and different activities – one playing darts and the other playing pool. In this case, it is not possible to infer that the guy playing pool is the same person as the man in the sweater playing darts or that the two activities are taking place simultaneously or in the same location. Thus, we cannot conclude that \\"A guy is playing pool.\\" based solely on the information provided in the initial statement about a man in a sweater playing darts."},{"question":"To whom it may concern, This is the worst dinning experience my wife and I have ever endured!

Which group didn't bring solid chunks of wood? Two groups of friends went camping , but camped separately a few hundred yards away and started a fire each. Both groups had the same volume of wood. Group P had larger logs, while group Q had small twigs, sawdust and kindlings. Hint: A large log placed in a fire will burn relatively slowly. If the same mass of wood were added to the fire in the form of small twigs, they would burn much more quickly. This is because the twigs provide a greater surface area than the log does. An increase in the surface area of a reactant increases the rate of a reaction. Surface area is larger when a given amount of a solid is present as smaller particles. A powdered reactant has a greater surface area than the same reactant as a solid chunk. In order to increase the surface area of a substance, it may be ground into smaller particles or dissolved into a liquid. In solution, the dissolved particles are separated from each other and will react more quickly with other reactants.

Although both sides squandered opportunities after the break, the game looked destined to end goalless. But Kermorgant seized on a loose ball in the Cardiff box and struck an emphatic half-volley to seal Reading's first away win of the season. It was a rare moment of quality in an otherwise forgettable meeting between two sides who struggled to play with any fluency. The most significant event of the day for Cardiff was their omission of goalkeeper David Marshall ahead of a £5m move to Hull. His successor, Ben Wilson, almost gifted Reading victory midway through the second half as he dropped the ball in the Bluebirds' box, but Roy Beerens' scuffed shot was cleared off the line. Paul Trollope's side mustered some promising chances - Immers and Sean Morrison both missing with free headers - but their toothless attacking display prompted boos from the home crowd at the final whistle. Cardiff manager Paul Trollope: \\"I'm really frustrated.

Both sides had their share of chances, but it was Kermorgant's half-volley that provided the breakthrough in a game that otherwise lacked fluency. Cardiff City's omission of goalkeeper David Marshall due to his impending move to Hull was another noteworthy event during the match, with his replacement, Ben Wilson, nearly costing the team a goal."},{"question":"Given the question: Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: Another example of Nashville's current identity crisis, circa 2003 Review: Yawn. Overproduced, overly wordy, prettyboy country. Wayne has an okay voice, but he doesn't seem fully in control of his product, and has an unfortunate penchant for needlessly elaborate, stagily pseudo-intellectual material, like \\"True Friends,\\" a song about two childhood friends who meet in jail -- one's a prison guard, and the others a convict -- and \\"Papers Angels,\\" a shamelessly sentimentalized issue song about abducted children. Oh, and then there's also \\"I Love You This Much,\\" a weeper about some guy trying to get close to his distant dad, complete with swelling string sections and gushing vocals. Yawn, again. Memo to Nashville: can we just agree to keep the predictable, made-for-Dr. Phil, sensitive-guy, psychobabble songs down to a minimum, at least from here on?

From the review, it is clear that the reviewer is not satisfied with the product, in this case, an album. They view it as an example of a broader problem in Nashville music and accuse it of being overproduced, overly wordy, and expressing cliche themes. They feel the artist Wayne has an okay voice but does not fully control the product and uses needlessly elaborate and artificially intellectual material. They criticize specific songs for various reasons, such as being overly sentimental or predictable. They find the album boring, as indicated by their repeated use of the term 'yawn'.

The pioneering test allows scientists to analyse the genetic make-up of tumours. By screening for 70 different markers – all of which increase the risk of the disease spreading – the MammaPrint test can accurately identify those patients who could be spared the toxic treatment. Chemotherapy uses anti-cancer drugs circulating in the bloodstream to destroy diseased cells in the body, by preventing their growth. The toxic therapy fails to distinguish between healthy and cancerous cells and as such, side-effects include severe nausea, hair loss, ulcers, chest pain and bleeding. Many women in the early stages of the disease are given the treatment after surgery or radiotherapy, as a preventative measure to minimise the risk of their tumour returning and spreading. Using the MammaPrint test, scientists found 46 per cent of patients’ tumours were low risk and as such, they had an excellent chance of survival without undergoing the ordeal of chemotherapy. Dr William Audeh, chief medical officer at Agendia, said the test could potentially spare patients from unnecessary chemotherapy. “The toxicities and side effects of chemotherapy may outweigh the potentially small and non-statistically significant benefit of chemotherapy in women at high-risk based on clinical factors, but at low risk per MammaPrint,” he said. “Thus, physicians and breast cancer patients may on an individual basis decide to avoid it.” The results, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, came from a clinical trial involving 6,693 patients across 112 cancer centres in nine European countries over five years. Dr Gabriel Hortobagyi, of the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Texas and chair of the Agendia medical advisory board, said: “The reporting of these conclusive results of the trial will now give physicians increased confidence that in using MammaPrint, their treatment decisions will be based on the highest level of clinical evidence and will minimize the incidence of over- or under-treatment.” Professor Laura van’t Veer of the University of California San Francisco, who helped design the test for Agendia, told The Telegraph: “Our ability to profile the gene expression of a tumour is transforming the way we characterise cancers and how we can more effectively treat patients.” She said it is already being used to help breast cancer patients safely avoid chemotherapy. MammaPrint is currently approved for use by the Food and Drugs Administration in the US. In the UK the test is only available privately, as the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (Nice) discusses the potential for making it available on the NHS. Summary:","response":"Scientists have made a new test called MammaPrint, which can help tell if breast cancer will come back in some patients. This test is amazing because it lets doctors look at what is inside the cancer and might help many women avoid difficult treatments they don't need. Some cancer treatments can make people feel very sick and lose their hair, but MammaPrint could help doctors choose the best treatment without using these strong medicines unless they really need to. This test is only for private use in the UK right now, but it may be approved for more UK patients soon."},{"question":"Generate a sentence about this data: Zizzi eatType pub; Zizzi food Chinese; Zizzi customer rating high; Zizzi familyFriendly yes Sentence:","response":"Zizzi is a fun pub where they serve yummy Chinese food, and lots of families like to go there because they are really nice to kids and people say it's really good!"},{"question":"Premise: you know drugs drugs and everything else and they talk about how soon they start that and that scares me Hypothesis: I hate when peopel talk about drugs because I am very anti-drug. Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","response":"Step 1: Identify the key concepts in both the premise and the hypothesis. In the premise, key concepts are drugs, people talking about them, and the feeling of fear. In the hypothesis, key concepts are hating when people talk about drugs and being anti-drug. Step 2: Compare the key concepts in both the premise and the hypothesis to determine if there's a direct or strong implicit connection. The premise discusses being scared when hearing people talk about drugs and their potential use. The hypothesis states disliking it when people talk about drugs due to strong anti-drug beliefs. Step 3: Analyze the strength of the connection between key concepts. The connection between the key concepts in the premise and the hypothesis is moderately strong. Although the premise deals with the feeling of fear while the hypothesis focuses on hate, both revolve around a negative emotional reaction to discussions about drugs. Step 4: Determine whether the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. Although the hypothesis is not directly entailed by the premise, as the emotions connected to each statement differ, it can be argued that there is a moderate implicit connection. The fear mentioned in the premise could be related to or partly caused by the strong anti-drug beliefs stated in the hypothesis. The hypothesis expands upon the premise and provides a potential reason for the fear.

A U.S. interagency group traveled to Saudi Arabia twice, in 1999 and 2000, to get information from the Saudis about their understanding of those finances. The group eventually concluded that the oft-repeated assertion that Bin Laden was funding al Qaeda from his personal fortune was in fact not true. The officials developed a new theory: al Qaeda was getting its money elsewhere, and the United States needed to focus on other sources of funding, such as charities, wealthy donors, and financial facilitators. Ultimately, although the intelligence community devoted more resources to the issue and produced somewhat more intelligence, it remained difficult to distinguish al Qaeda's financial transactions among the vast sums moving in the international financial system. The CIA was not able to find or disrupt al Qaeda's money flows. The NSC staff thought that one possible solution to these weaknesses in the intelligence community was to create an all-source terrorist-financing intelligence analysis center. Clarke pushed for the funding of such a center at Treasury, but neither Treasury nor the CIA was willing to commit the resources. Within the United States, various FBI field offices gathered intelligence on organizations suspected of raising funds for al Qaeda or other terrorist groups. By 9/11, FBI agents understood that there were extremist organizations operating within the United States supporting a global jihadist movement and with substantial connections to al Qaeda. The FBI operated a web of informants, conducted electronic surveillance, and had opened significant investigations in a number of field offices, including New York, Chicago, Detroit, San Diego, and Minneapolis. On a national level, however, the FBI never used the information to gain a systematic or strategic understanding of the nature and extent of al Qaeda fundraising. Treasury regulators, as well as U.S. financial institutions, were generally focused on finding and deterring or disrupting the vast flows of U.S. currency generated by drug trafficking and high-level international fraud. Large-scale scandals, such as the use of the Bank of New York by Russian money launderers to move millions of dollars out of Russia, captured the attention of the Department of the Treasury and of Congress. Before 9/11, Treasury did not consider terrorist financing important enough to mention in its national strategy for money laundering.

Answer:","response":"The nineteenth-century writer featured in Alicia Ramsey's historical play was a leading figure in the literary movement known as Romanticism. Romanticism emerged in the late 18th century as a reaction against the Enlightenment's emphasis on reason, logic, and scientific inquiry. It championed the ideals of emotion, imagination, and individualism, advocating for a deep connection with nature and the elevation of the human spirit. This literary movement initially began in Germany and then quickly spread to other European countries, including England, France, and Spain. The Romantic period saw the prominence of some of the most famous poets and writers in history, such as William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Percy Bysshe Shelley, Lord Byron, John Keats, and Mary Shelley in England; Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Friedrich Schiller, and Novalis in Germany; Victor Hugo, François-René de Chateaubriand, and Alphonse de Lamartine in France; and José de Espronceda and Gustavo Adolfo Bécquer in Spain. The Romantic writers focused on the following key themes and principles: 1. Imagination and Emotion: Romanticism shifted the focus from reason and intellect to imagination, emotion, and intuition as the primary sources of artistic expression. Gothic, supernatural, and fantastical elements were often incorporated into their works to appeal to the imagination and evoke deep emotions in the reader. 2. Nature: Romantic writers had a deep love and appreciation for nature, as it was considered a source of inspiration, solace, and spiritual nourishment. They saw nature as a powerful force and often used it as a central element to express themes of beauty, eternity, and unity. 3. Individualism: Romanticism celebrated the unique qualities and experiences of the individual. Romantic writers often portrayed solitary, introspective characters who struggled with their emotions, inner turmoil, or societal constraints. These heroes were typically complex and flawed, but their struggles were viewed as noble and essential to the human experience. 4. Rebellion: Romantic writers frequently questioned and critiqued societal norms, tradition, and authority. They valued personal freedom and frequently depicted themes of revolution and the struggle for independence. 5. The Past: The Romantic movement generally looked back toward previous eras, particularly the medieval period, as a source of inspiration and spiritual depth. This fascination with the past was often expressed through a revival of interest in folklore, legends, and ancient myths. In conclusion, the nineteenth-century writer featured in Alicia Ramsey's historical play was a leading figure in the Romantic movement, which dominated the literary world during that time. This literary movement was characterized by its focus on emotion, imagination, individualism, and a deep appreciation for nature. It influenced generations of writers, poets, and playwrights and shaped the course of Western literature well into the 20th century."},{"question":"Question: \\"What is at the beginning of the path?\\" Context: \\"The Farmington Canal Trail is a rail trail that will eventually run continuously from downtown New Haven to Northampton, Massachusetts.

He was chosen before the next match at Lord and was never injured again . 2. He was injured before the next match at Lord 's , and was never chosen again . Are these two sentences paraphrases of each other?","response":"No, these two sentences are not paraphrases of each other, as they convey different scenarios. Let's break down the meaning of each sentence to better understand their differences: Sentence 1: He was chosen before the next match at Lord's and was never injured again. This sentence tells us that the person in question was selected to play or participate before a forthcoming match at Lord's, which is a famous cricket ground in London. Additionally, the sentence highlights that after being selected, the person did not experience any more injuries during their career. The overall tone of this sentence is positive, as it implies that the person continued to play without any injury problems. Sentence 2: He was injured before the next match at Lord's, and was never chosen again. In contrast to the first sentence, this one implies that the person suffered an injury before the upcoming match at Lord's. As a result of this injury, the person was not selected to play again. This sentence has a negative tone, as it tells the story of someone who was injured and never had the opportunity to participate in the sport they were involved with again. In summary, the two sentences are not paraphrases of each other because they describe different situations. The first sentence reveals a player who was chosen for a match at Lord's and did not face further injuries, while the second sentence describes a person who was injured before a match at Lord's and was never chosen to play again due to their injury."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Information: - Summer is the hottest of the four temperate seasons, falling between spring and autumn.

Now let's transform these steps into commands using logical operators: 1. filter_eq(view, \\"Rank\\", 14) -> this will return the subview whose values under \\"Rank\\" column are equal to 14. {filtered_view = filter_eq(view, \\"Rank\\", 14)} 2. only(filtered_view) -> this will check if there is exactly one row in the filtered_view. {only_one_row = only(filtered_view)} 3. hop(filtered_view, 4) -> this will return the value under the fourth column of the unique row. {fourth_place_value = hop(filtered_view, 4)} 4. eq(fourth_place_value, 2) -> this will check if the fourth place value is equal to 2. {is_equal_to_two = eq(fourth_place_value, 2)} Now let's put the commands together in the output: Output: { filtered_view = filter_eq(view, \\"Rank\\", 14); only_one_row = only(filtered_view); fourth_place_value = hop(filtered_view, 4); is_equal_to_two = eq(fourth_place_value, 2); }"},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Process: - Two birds meet each other - Egg is produced after fertilziation - Mother sits on egg until it hatches - Bird Hatches - Grows up - Flee the next - Starts family - Dies. Question: suppose the bird mates for life and their spouse died happens, how will it affect an offspring will be produced. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","response":"B: Less When a bird mates for life and its spouse dies, it is likely to produce fewer offspring than it would if its partner were still alive. This is because the surviving bird may take some time to find a new mate (or may never find one), and during this time, it will not be producing any offspring. In species where birds form strong, long-lasting pair bonds, the loss of a mate can have significant effects on the surviving bird's reproductive success. They have a reduced chance of finding a compatible mate, as well as the potential impact on their emotional state which could potentially influence their ability to breed. Overall, the death of a lifelong mate could lower the likelihood of offspring production for the surviving bird, leading to fewer offspring than if its partner was still alive."},{"question":"Answer the following question: I have unfriended someone over his near daily harassment of me to come over to his way of thinking. Way back in 2006, when Facebook was a young whelp and I had a newborn who steadfastly refused to sleep at night, I would sit and connect with old friends from university and high school, many of whom I had not seen or spoken with in more than a decade. One of those people was Scott. Scott was a super nice guy. He was a year ahead of me at university. He was a bit socially awkward but you really couldn’t hope to meet a more genuine individual. Like most people, Scott had had some ups and downs in his life. At some point he found religion. Like he really, really found it. Now, I am somewherere between an agnostic and an atheist but my attitude is generally live and let live. But Scott couldn’t do that. Almoost every day he would send me some sort of message. “What do you pray about?” I don’t. “God loves you, he gave his son for you, why don’t you love Him?” Because I don’t believe He or his Son exist. “What are you going to say when you die and stand before Satan instead of God?” Missed that by a mile, didn’t I? This went on for a few months. His questions became increasing unhinged and the only thing that mattered to him were his beliefs. Mine were of no consequence. I had asked him, politely at first and then more assertively, to stop bombarding me with his attempts to convert me or to witness to me. All to no avail. Finally, I’d had enough and decided I had better things to do. I pulled the plug and unfriended Scott. He’s sent me several friend requests over the years, all of which I have summarily ignored.

Will the torso be safe from blows to the largest and smallest bones in body?","response":"Rationale: When considering whether the torso will be safe from blows to the largest and smallest bones in the body, we must take into account a few factors such as the location of these bones, their specific functions, and the overall protective mechanisms in place around the torso area. The largest bone in the human body is the femur or the thigh bone, which is located in the lower extremities and connects the hip to the knee. The smallest bone is the stapes, located in the human ear and playing a crucial role in the process of hearing. Now that we have the rationale, let's examine whether the torso will be safe from blows to these specific bones. Answer: Yes, the torso will generally be safe from blows to the largest and smallest bones in the body. The femur, being part of the lower extremities, is located away from the main torso area and primarily functions to support the body weight and facilitate movement. Similarly, the stapes bone is located within the ear, far from the torso region. Because these bones are not in close proximity to the torso itself, a direct blow to them would likely not impact or endanger the torso significantly. However, it's essential to consider that heavy impacts or severe injuries to the femur or stapes could indirectly cause harm to the torso as part of a larger traumatic event. But when considering the question specifically in terms of direct blows to these bones, the torso will generally remain safe."},{"question":"Here is a dialogue: Ann: Did you get my order?

Animals have been killed for their fur and feathers, for food, for sport, and simply because they were in the way. Thousands of kinds of animals have disappeared from the world forever. Hundreds more are on the danger list today. About 170 kinds in the United States alone are considered in danger. Why should people care? Because we need animals. And because once they are gone, there will never be any more. Animals are more than just beautiful and interesting. They are more than just a source of food. Every animal has its place in the balance of nature . Destroying one kind of animal can create many problems. For example, when farmers killed large numbers of hawks , the farmers' stores of corn and grain were destroyed by rats and mice. Why? Because hawks eat rats and mice. With no hawks to keep down their numbers, the rats and mice multiplied quickly. Luckily, some people are working to help save the animals. Some groups raise money to let people know about the problem. And they try to get the governments to pass laws protecting animals in danger. Quite a few countries have passed laws. These laws forbid the killing of any animals or plants on the danger list. Slowly, the number of some animals in danger is growing. Options: A Hundreds of kinds of animals have disappeared forever.

Given these facts, what is the result of imperfect passing of heat through a metal, on that metal among the following options: - contamination - expansion - sweating - Energy. - forces - burning - Evaporation - electricity Answer:","response":"When a metal conducts heat, the atoms in the metal vibrate more rapidly as they absorb energy. This leads to an increase in the space between the atoms, causing the metal to expand. Conduction is indeed the passing of heat through a medium, such as a metal, and the effectiveness of the conduction process is dependent on the physical properties of the metal and the temperature difference across the medium. Imperfect passing of heat through a metal can have several effects on that metal. Analyzing each option provided: 1. Contamination: Imperfect heat conduction is not directly related to contamination. Contamination usually occurs due to impurities or external substances that come into contact with the metal. 2. Expansion: Imperfect heat conduction leads to uneven heat distribution within the metal. This will result in uneven expansion, causing distortion or potential deformation of the material. The metal may expand more in some areas than in others, which can lead to internal stresses, warping, or even cracking in extreme cases. 3. Sweating: Sweating is related to condensation, which is not directly relevant to the conduction of heat through a metal. Sweating refers to the accumulation of moisture on a surface due to the cooling of the air around that surface. 4. Energy: Imperfect heat conduction can result in heat loss and decreased energy efficiency. The insufficiency of heat transfer can cause the energy input to not be fully utilized, leading to wasted energy or an increase in electrical consumption if electrical heating is being used. 5. Forces: Uneven expansion of a metal due to imperfect heat conduction can lead to the formation of internal stresses, which are forces within the material. These forces can cause deformation, warping, and potentially lead to mechanical failure in extreme cases. 6. Burning: Although imperfect heat conduction may not directly cause burning, it can lead to localized overheating, which in extreme cases may result in burning or damaging the metal if the temperature exceeds the metal's melting point or causes chemical reactions. 7. Evaporation: Evaporation is not directly related to the imperfect conduction of heat through a metal. Evaporation occurs when a liquid substance turns into a gas due to the absorption of energy when its vapor pressure is equal to or greater than the surrounding air pressure. 8. Electricity: Imperfect heat conduction itself is not directly linked to the production of electricity. However, it can influence the efficiency of various electrical devices or systems that rely on the proper conduction of heat, such as heat sinks, transformers, or generators. In conclusion, among the options provided, expansion and forces are the most directly related effects on a metal due to the imperfect passing of heat through it. Uneven expansion and internal stresses can have significant consequences on the structural integrity and performance of the metal. Additionally, energy can also be impacted indirectly as it pertains to energy efficiency and potential heat loss."},{"question":"Read the following context and answer the question.

I don't, either. And although I tell myself not to worry about them, I always do! So I'm not surprised that my students worry about them, too, even though they usually don't need to. Because they are afraid of failing. However, since it is hard not to worry at all, we all must try not to worry too much. Why? Because worrying makes exams worse! How to do this? Ask the teacher about how to revise and about exam skills--how to work when you are in the exam. Good students don't wait until the week before an exam. They study all through the year. It is not possible to learn everything at the last minute. So don't leave it till then. If you start planning and working for each exam early and you make sure that you understand what you're studying, then, when it is over, you'll be able to say, \\"What a good exam that was!\\" Take a short rest during your time of work and revision. If your mind is tired, it won't remember well. Work at the time when you know you'll work at your best. If you're studying in the evening, don't go straight to bed afterwards. Your mind will still be \\"going round and round\\"--thinking too much. Do something else, maybe walk or get exercise. Choose something that will relax you, and make you think of other things. If you feel bad, talk to someone about your worries. But don't be too relaxed! Some stress over exams makes you work hard for them. According to the passage, if you feel bad, you'd better _ . A) take a short rest B) tell someone about your worries C) walk or get exercise D) keep busy working and forget your worries Answer:","response":"B) tell someone about your worries"},{"question":"In a 2009 case, Netbula, LLC v.

The videos claimed they exposed illegal sales of fetal tissues by Planned Parenthood to a tissue bank called Stem Express, as well as illegal abortion procedures. Planned Parenthood denied the claims, which sparked Congressional hearings and investigations in 10 states, and released a report calling the videos deceptive. Now the women's health organization, which performs about one-third of all abortions nationwide, is filing suit in the Northern California federal district against the CMP. \\"The express aim of the enterprise — which stretched over years and involved fake companies, fake identifications, and large-scale illegal taping — was a to demonize Planned Parenthood,\\" the lawsuit says. \\"Planned Parenthood provides high-quality compassionate care and has done nothing wrong,\\" said Kathy Kneer, president of Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California, in a briefing on the lawsuit. \\"Game on,\\" Daleiden told BuzzFeed News by email. \\"I look forward to taking the depositions of all the Planned Parenthood CEOs who profited off of their business relationship with StemExpress.\\" Racketeering lawsuits typically ask for triple damages, and the lawsuit asks for payments for Planned Parenthood's increased security costs and penalties for violation of confidentiality agreements. Three people died in a shooting at a Colorado clinic in November, and Planned Parenthood cited death threats as a result of the videos. In addition to Daleiden, Planned Parenthood named prominent anti-abortion activist Troy Newman of the anti-abortion group Operation Rescue in the suit, as well as some CMP activists whose names were previously undisclosed by the group. ||||| Planned Parenthood filed a federal court lawsuit Thursday alleging extensive criminal misconduct by the anti-abortion activists who produced undercover videos targeting the handling of fetal tissue at some Planned Parenthood clinics. \\"The people behind this fraud lied and broke the law in order to spread malicious lies about Planned Parenthood,\\" said Dawn Laguens, the organization's executive vice president. \\"This lawsuit exposes the elaborate, illegal conspiracy designed to block women's access to safe and legal abortion.\\" The anti-abortion activists, who named their group the Center for Medical Progress, began releasing a series of covertly recorded videos in July alleging that Planned Parenthood sold fetal tissue to researchers for a profit in violation of federal law. Planned Parenthood has denied any wrongdoing, saying a handful of its clinics provided fetal tissue for research while receiving only permissible reimbursement for costs. The lawsuit says the videos were the result of numerous illegalities, including making recordings without consent, registering false identities with state agencies and violating non-disclosure agreements. The civil lawsuit was filed on Thursday in U.S. District Court in San Francisco. It seeks compensatory and punitive damages, as well as legal fees. A Planned Parenthood lawyer, Beth Parker, declined to estimate how much money would be sought, but it said the amount would include extra money spent since the videos' release on additional security for Planned Parenthood clinics. David Daleiden, a founder of the Center for Medical Progress who oversaw the video operation, said he looked forward to confronting Planned Parenthood officials in court. \\"My response is: Game on,\\" he said in an email. \\"I look forward to deposing all the CEOs, medical directors, and their co-conspirators who participated in Planned Parenthood's illegal baby body parts racket.\\" The lawsuit alleges that Daleiden and several collaborators, including longtime anti-abortion activist Troy Newman, \\"engaged in a complex criminal enterprise to defraud Planned Parenthood.\\" The suit contends that the Center for Medical Progress violated the Racketeer Influence and Corrupt Organization Act (known as the RICO Act), engaging in wire fraud, mail fraud, invasion of privacy, illegal secret recording and trespassing. According to the suit, Daleiden, Newman and other defendants used aliases, obtained fake government IDs and formed a fake tissue procurement company, Biomax, in order to gain access to private medical conferences and health care centers, and to tape private professional conversations of medical providers. The videos provoked an outcry from the anti-abortion movement, and prompted numerous investigations of Planned Parenthood by Republican-led committees in Congress and by GOP-led state governments. Thus far, none of the investigations has turned up wrongdoing by Planned Parenthood in regard to fetal tissue research, but Republicans in Congress and in several states are seeking to cut off government funding to the organization. The videos created a \\"poisonous environment\\" in which Planned Parenthood staffers were targeted with hate mail and death threats, said Parker, the organization's lawyer. She cited the attack in November on a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado in which three people were killed; the man arrested in the shooting depicted himself in court as a \\"warrior for the babies.\\" Planned Parenthood is the leading abortion provider in the United States, and also provides a range of other health services, including cancer screenings, contraceptives and testing for sexually transmitted diseases. ||||| What is a summary?","response":"Planned Parenthood, a women's health organization in the United States, has filed a lawsuit against an anti-abortion activist named David Daleiden and his group called the Center for Medical Progress. This group secretly recorded some people working for Planned Parenthood talking about some things that made it seem like they were doing something wrong. These people tricked those in the videos into talking about these things, and when they shared the videos they edited them to make them look even worse. Planned Parenthood says they did nothing wrong and now they are suing those people in court for causing them a lot of problems, like having to spend more money on security.

Are these councils being more sympathetic to motorists, or missing the opportunity to offer improved services to businesses and residents? According to the RAC Foundation report, English councils had a total surplus of £565m from parking operations in 2011-12, up £54m on the previous year. Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, describes the revenue from parking charges as \\"a nice little earner\\" for councils. Topping the list of authorities is Westminster, where officials, as well as disputing some of the figures behind its reported £41.6m surplus, say the revenue helps pay for a range of vital transport and highways services that help the High Street prosper. Bottom of the table are Essex County Council, which lost £1.8m, and Surrey County Council which lost £1.3m. Councillor Rodney Bass, Essex cabinet member for highways and transportation, said: \\"The boroughs and districts have their own off-street car parking, but we don't have a tradition of on-street parking charges and it works very well. \\"It is called 'localism'. We decide what happens here and [Westminster] decides there. \\"We run a park-and-ride system, Essex has one of the best here in Chelmsford. \\"Our car parks are still off-street. I don't think there is a single parking meter in Essex - we are a parking meter-free county and we are proud of it.\\" Similar park-and-ride schemes run by other authorities are often paid for by money brought in through parking charges. Guildford Borough Council, which generates more money from its parking than all the other Surrey boroughs and districts combined, is set to launch its fourth park-and-ride service in the town. \\"In Guildford we make around a million a year in surplus and use that to subsidise the park-and-ride scheme into town, a scheme that has proven popular with traders and residents alike,\\" says Councillor David Goodwin, who sits as an opposition member on both Surrey County and Guildford Borough Councils. He was also a member of Surrey's parking task group. \\"The park-and-ride is there to alleviate parking and traffic problems in the town. If you just look at the park-and-ride they wouldn't be able to operate at the level they do without the parking income,\\" he says. \\"For the traders in town and the workers in town, park-and-ride helps them. It keeps traffic out of the town centre which is a massive benefit to the residents who live there. \\"As an opposition member I would love to say it's 'money-grabbing' but I just can't, and I don't get that at all from residents.\\" As well as accusations of \\"money-grabbing', authorities are accused of using parking charges and fines as \\"stealth taxes\\", but officials at the biggest earner highlight the use of funds for area improvements. Westminster service development manager Kieran Fitsall says: \\"The actual surplus was £36.3m last year and the money generated goes on transport and infrastructure, this includes bridge repairs and all sorts of schemes from the Freedom Pass and concessionary fares for the elderly and disabled. \\"It all goes back into transport.\\" He adds: \\"One misconception is that Westminster generates money from issuing parking tickets. We don't actually generate money from issuing parking tickets, it practically costs us the same to operate that as we take in.\\" A Controlled Parking Zone permit in Westminster costs £130, while daily and hourly charges vary depending on where you park from £1.20 per hour to £4.40. \\"Charges for the permits were set some years back and are reviewed every two years, normally it is just an inflationary increase,\\" says Mr Fitsall. \\"Money that is generated is from people paying to park legally. Last year we took in £38.3m from people paying legally to park. \\"That has been increasing as more people have been parking legally. The number of tickets being given out has gone down and there have been no cutbacks of enforcement officers. \\"These charges are important as it benefits everyone in terms of those who live and work in Westminster.\\" The growth in pay-by-phone parking has seen revenues rise and tickets issued fall, while the council also has a smartphone app in the works that will let people know the location of available spaces. The app, called \\"park right\\", tells users in real time which parking spots are free and which are taken. The council is currently at the procurement stage so will not confirm the cost of the project, which will involve installing small sensors in the road to relay information to the app displaying free spaces as green dots and occupied ones in red. \\"We are looking at anything we can do to cut down on congestion and make it easier to get around,\\" says Mr Mr Fitsall. \\"It is better for the High Street as people spend less time looking for parking and more time in the shops.\\" The full list of councils operating parking services at a loss are: Ashfield, Babergh, Barnet, Basildon, Blaby, Breckland, Brentwood, Broadland, Broxtowe, Corby, Crawley, Cumbria, Daventry, East Cambridgeshire ,East Northamptonshire, Essex, Fenland, Forest of Dean, Gedling, Halton UA, Hertsmere, Hyndburn, Lancashire, Leicestershire, Norfolk, North East Derbyshire, North Warwickshire, Northamptonshire, Norwich, Oadby & Wigston, Pendle, Redditch, Rossendale, Sandwell, South Cambridgeshire, South Derbyshire, South Gloucestershire UA, South Norfolk, South Northamptonshire, South Ribble, South Staffordshire, Sunderland, Surrey, Surrey Heath, Tandridge, Telford and the Wrekin UA, Three Rivers, Walsall, Warrington UA, Wealden, Wellingborough, West Lindsey, West Oxfordshire.

Stepping into the busy streets of Soho, an array of experiences and adventures captivate my senses. The echoes of street performers, the aroma of food trucks, and the colorful exhibition of local art and fashion contribute to the lively ambiance. As I wander down the charming cobblestone streets in search of something that could rival the allure of The James, I stumble upon Little Italy – a small, quaint neighborhood famous for its rich Italian heritage, bustling restaurants, and decadent gelato. The warm, welcoming atmosphere of the neighborhood draws me in and, for a moment, I forget about my swanky room back at the hotel. After satiating my appetite with an authentic Neapolitan pizza, I find myself drawn to New York's renowned Broadway, with its dazzling marquees inviting me to experience the magic of live theater.

Though the enchanting show proves to be a worthy contender, my thoughts inevitably drift back to the mesmerizing skyline views and unparalleled comfort of The James hotel. Returning to my room after a memorable day in New York, I can't help but feel a sense of contentment and gratitude for having experienced the best of both worlds – the bustling energy of the city and the opulent serenity of my home away from home.

Lee was born on August 11, 1964 in Seoul, South Korea. He grew up in St. Louis, Missouri, where he lived a \\"typical middle-class childhood\\". Lee attended River Bend Elementary School in Chesterfield and later St. Louis Country Day School, where he drew posters for school plays. Having had to learn English when he first came to the U.S. presented the young Lee with the sense of being an outsider, as did the \\"preppy, upper-class\\" atmosphere of Country Day. In 1986, as he was preparing to graduate, Lee took an art class that reignited his love of drawing, and led to his rediscovery of comics at a time when seminal works such as Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns and Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons' Watchmen spurred a renaissance within the American comics industry. After obtaining his psychology degree, he decided to postpone applying to medical school, and earned the reluctant blessing of his parents by allotting himself one year to succeed, vowing that he would attend medical school if he did not break into the comic book industry in that time. He submitted samples to various publishers, but did not find success. When Lee befriended St. Louis-area comics artists Don Secrease and Rick Burchett, they convinced him he needed to show his portfolio to editors in person, prompting Lee to attend a New York comics convention, where he met editor Archie Goodwin. Goodwin invited Lee to Marvel Comics, where the aspiring artist received his first assignment by editor Carl Potts, who hired him to pencil the mid-list series Alpha Flight, segueing from that title in 1989 to Punisher: War Journal. Lee's work on the Punisher: War Journal was inspired by artists such as Frank Miller, David Ross, Kevin Nowlan, and Whilce Portacio, as well as Japanese manga. In 1989, Lee filled in for regular illustrator Marc Silvestri on Uncanny X-Men No. 248 and did another guest stint on issues No. 256 through No. 258 as part of the \\"Acts of Vengeance\\" storyline, eventually becoming the series' ongoing artist with issue No. 267, following Silvestri's departure. During his stint on Uncanny Lee first worked with inker Scott Williams, who would become a long-time collaborator. During his run on the title, Lee co-created the character Gambit with long-time X-Men writer Chris Claremont. Lee's artwork quickly gained popularity in the eyes of enthusiastic fans, which allowed him to gain greater creative control of the franchise. In 1991, Lee helped launch a second X-Men series simply called X-Men volume 2, as both the artist and as co-writer with Claremont. X-Men vol. 2 No. 1 is still the best-selling comic book of all-time with sales of over 8.1 million copies and nearly 7 million, according to a public proclamation by Guinness World Records at the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con. The sales figures were generated in part by publishing the issue with five different variant covers, four of which show different characters from the book that formed a single image when laid side by side, and a fifth, gatefold cover of that combined image, large numbers of which were purchased by retailers, who anticipated fans and speculators who would buy multiple copies in order to acquire a complete collection of the covers. Lee designed new character uniforms for the series, including those worn by Cyclops, Jean Grey, Rogue, Psylocke and Storm and created the villain Omega Red. Actor/comedian Taran Killam, who has ventured into comics writing with The Illegitimates, has cited X-Men No. 1 as the book that inspired his interest in comics.

More than 800 students were asked how they tried to relieve hangover symptoms, but neither food nor water was found to have any positive effect. The findings are being presented at a conference in Amsterdam. A team of international researchers from the Netherlands and Canada surveyed students' drinking habits to find out whether hangovers could be eased or if some people were immune to them. Among 826 Dutch students, 54% ate food after drinking alcohol, including fatty food and heavy breakfasts, in the hope of staving off a hangover. With the same aim, more than two-thirds drank water while drinking alcohol and more than half drank water before going to bed. Although these groups showed a slight improvement in how they felt compared with those who hadn't drunk water, there was no real difference in the severity of their hangovers. Previous research suggests that about 25% of drinkers claim never to get hangovers. So the researchers questioned 789 Canadian students about their drinking in the previous month and the hangovers they experienced, finding that those who didn't get a hangover simply consumed \\"too little alcohol to develop a hangover in the first place\\". Of those students who drank heavily, with an estimated blood alcohol concentration of more than 0.2%, almost no-one was immune to hangovers. According to lead author Dr Joris Verster, from Utrecht University, the relationship was pretty straightforward. \\"The more you drink, the more likely you are to get a hangover. \\"Drinking water may help against thirst and a dry mouth, but it will not take away the misery, the headache and the nausea.\\" Dr Verster said part of the problem was that scientists still do not know what causes a hangover. \\"Research has concluded that it's not simply dehydration - we know the immune system is involved, but before we know what causes it, it's very unlikely we'll find an effective cure.\\" He said the next step was to carry out more controlled trials on hangovers. Dr Michael Bloomfield, from University College, London, said the economic costs of alcohol abuse ran into hundreds of billions of euros every year. \\"It's therefore very important to answer simple questions like, 'How do you avoid a hangover?' \\"Whilst further research is needed, this new research tells us that the answer is simple - drink less.\\" The paper is presented at the European College of Neuropsychopharmacology conference.

Up in front of me was a giant billboard advertising yet another jeweler, in ten-foot letters and bright silver watches like massive alien machines. The traffic slowed and stopped on the ramp as it bottlenecked further into the city, and my head turned to examine the sign and the blocked view of the cityscape and land beyond. Past it was another billboard, with the name of a casino as its only text, filled with collaged images of money, plush rooms, and dancers. A quarter mile further brought me to an advertisement for business management solutions. Another few hundred yards and I was urged to try the new sandwich at the new sandwich place. The sun set and the signs stayed bright as automatic light switched on. The city grew dark and the hills beyond feebled out, existing only in our minds and finally not even there. All that remained were the well-lit and shiny reminders that lawyers were standing by to take my case to court, and that somebody's air conditioners would outlast somebody else's. I had an idea. I made the call the next day. It would put me back a good half grand, but it would be worth it. There would be no design meeting; I sent them the image and it was printed. A few weeks later it went up. Now on my commute, when I paused in the crush of metal bodies, I looked up and saw mountains by Maxfield Parrish, reaching up to the clouds in impossible cragginess, rivulets and gushing streams painted down their sides, with the sun striking vibrant oranges and reds into the shadows of the rocks. There were trees in copper-patina green and still pools quieter than the middle of winter but warm as the first day of summer. No doubt people thought it was the first part of a two-stage advertising gimmick, or a filler to be used when no one was renting space on the sign. But I was happy.

One might argue that it is possible to estimate the number of jelly beans, for instance, by visually judging the size of the jar or the number of jelly beans it appears to hold.

Moreover, factors such as the size and shape of the jelly beans, the distribution of empty spaces between them, and the opacity of the jar could all hinder a precise determination.

When people are under the influence of alcohol, it can inhibit their cognitive abilities, lower their inhibitions, and diminish their ability to judge situations accurately. This can lead to them behaving in ways that they might not normally exhibit when sober, including becoming more impulsive, emotional, and less likely to filter their words before speaking. In your case, if you are aware that you tend to act childish when you become intoxicated, it may indicate that your inhibitions are lowered, and you are more likely to express yourself in a less guarded manner. Consequently, it is possible that you might say things that you shouldn't say. However, it is essential to note that this is not an absolute conclusion and depends on various factors. Furthermore, the concept of \\"shouldn't say\\" is subjective and depends on individual perspectives and societal norms. What may be considered inappropriate or offensive in one social context may not be viewed the same way in another. Therefore, it is crucial to evaluate the particular context in which the statements are made and whether those present could be hurt or offended by what has been said. In summary, while it is possible that you may say things you shouldn't say when drunk and acting childish, it is not a definitive conclusion. The impact of alcohol on a person's behavior varies depending on several factors. To minimize the risks associated with alcohol-related impairments and negative social consequences, it is essential to consume alcohol responsibly, know your limits, and consider how your actions could affect others around you."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Given the following passage \\"The earliest recorded Western philosophy of time was expounded by the ancient Egyptian thinker Ptahhotep (c. 2650–2600 BC), who said, \\"Do not lessen the time of following desire, for the wasting of time is an abomination to the spirit.\\" The Vedas, the earliest texts on Indian philosophy and Hindu philosophy, dating back to the late 2nd millennium BC, describe ancient Hindu cosmology, in which the universe goes through repeated cycles of creation, destruction, and rebirth, with each cycle lasting 4,320,000 years.

Just as Christianity introduced Mediterranean culture into northern Europe, so Buddhism brought Chinese culture into Japanese society. Throughout the seventh and eighth centuries numerous Japanese monks, scholars, and artists made the perilous trip west across the Sea of Japan to study Chinese religion, history, music, literature, and painting — later to be brought back for further development in Japan. An outstanding figure of this time was Prince Shotoku, who in 604 developed the \\"Seventeen-Article Constitution,\\" outlining a code of human conduct and the ideals of state as a basic law for the nation. He also established relations with the Sui dynasty in China. Through him, the Japanese imperial court developed Chinese patterns of centralized government, with its formal bureaucracy of eight court ranks. The Chinese calendar was used to calculate the year of Japan's foundation by counting back the 1,260 years of the Chinese cosmological cycle. Thus, 660 b.c. is still the official date celebrated nationwide. At this early stage in its history Japan was already (for the most part) only nominally ruled by the emperor. De facto power was exercised by the militarily and economically strongest family. The Sogas had promoted Buddhism as an imperially sanctioned counterweight to the native Shinto religion, along with the new Chinese customs, to weaken the influence of their more conservative rivals. But they in turn were ousted in a.d. 645 by Nakatomi Kamatari, founder of the great Fujiwara clan, which was to rule Japanese affairs for hundreds of years and provide prominent advisers to the emperor even up to the 19th century. After reading the above, is \\"Chinese customs\\" the correct answer to the question \\"What parts of Chinese culture were brought into Japanese society?\\"?","response":"While \\"Chinese customs\\" is part of the answer, the text suggests that multiple facets of Chinese culture were integrated into Japanese society. Along with Chinese customs, Chinese Buddhism (involving sacred images and scriptures), religion, history, music, literature, painting, and patterns of centralized government were also brought into Japanese society. The use of the Chinese calendar in Japan also reflects this influence. Therefore, it would be more accurate to say that various elements of Chinese culture, including but not limited to \\"Chinese customs,\\" were integrated into Japanese society."},{"question":"Given the question: Fact 1: Exercise increases a body 's strength.

By the middle 1950s, he had become one of the best-loved and most successful children's book writers in the world. His books are very popular with young readers. They enjoy the invented words and the pictures of unusual funny animals and plants. In 1954, life magazine published a report about school children who could not read. The report said many children's books were not interesting. Doctor Seuss strongly hoped to help children and decided to write books that were interesting and easy to read. He used words with the same ending sound, like fish and wish. He did not receive training in art. Yet, he drew the pictures for most of his books. In 1957, Dr. Seuss wrote The Cat in the Hat. He used less than 230 words to write the book and even a six-year-old should be able to read it. It was a fun story and easy to read. Children loved it. Their parents loved it, too. Today it is still one of the stories they like best. The success of The Cat in the Hat made him want to write more books for children. In 1960, he wrote a book using less than fifty words. The book is called Green Eggs and Ham. In 1984, Doctor Seuss won a Pulitzer Prize . He was honored for the education and enjoyment his books provided American children and their parents. He died at the age of 87, but his influence remains. Millions of his books have been sold worldwide. People say his books helped change the way American children learned to read.

It highlights the unfolding of a rematch between Stephanie Herseth and her previous opponent just four months after their prior contest. With the spotlight shifted to Stephanie Herseth's re-election bid, the text explores the implications of her groundbreaking victory as the first ever woman to win a House of Representatives seat from South Dakota. In a broader context, this narrative can be seen as an intersection of gender, politics, and power. The text underscores Stephanie Herseth's unique position in South Dakota's political history, being the first woman elected to such a significant post and potentially benefitting from the amplified recognition her historic feat has drawn. The text essentially raises questions about the impact of her noteworthy win on the then-upcoming electoral race, and whether the influence and recognition gained from her successful election bid could affect the rematch. The context in which Herseth is running for re-election, described as a \\"shadow\\", may imply various elements. It might refer to possible controversies, elevated pressure, or the heightened expectations she might be facing after her historical triumph. It could suggest perceptions of her political capacities, legislative potential, and electoral appeal being cast under a shadow of scrutiny, anticipation, or skepticism, a situation that is common for many political figures under unique circumstances. Additionally, this extract is also about the electoral processes in the United States, specifically touching on the term length for representatives—two years—and the fact that the candidates could run multiple times within a relatively short period.

A Chinese version of Mars One, a Dutch program to send people to Mars, blossomed in my mind. They could call it “Huoxing yi,” or Fire Star One, with Mars translating into Chinese as “fire star.” It would be a select group of second graders, future breeders in white jumpsuits, taking off from the Chinese desert in a Shenzhou, or Divine Land, spacecraft, abandoning their exhausted planet to build a new civilization as Earth slides into an abyss of climate change. China has a pretty good space program, after all. Yet we had been called in to hear about the school’s music band, not a mission to Mars. So what was Teacher Wang talking about? Eugenics for music, it turns out. Teacher Wang proceeded to describe a program by which a group of 8-year-olds, selected purely on the basis of physical characteristics rather than interest, would build the best band in the world that would travel overseas and wow audiences with the flower of Chinese youth. Freaky enough, without a one-way ticket to Mars. “For the best band, we’ve chosen the best students and the best teachers,” Teacher Wang continued. Mr. Wang, whom parents addressed only as “Teacher,” (a sign of respect common here) stood before a giant white screen on which he projected a power point full of instrument images. “I’ve chosen your kids, one by one, out of a thousand kids.” Mr. Wang was referring to band C, the third in the school which trained the youngest students, some of whom would eventually rise through the ranks to band B and on to A, at which point they would perform at overseas gigs. “I’ve looked at their teeth, at their arms, their height, everything, very carefully,” Teacher Wang said. “We don’t want anyone with asthma, or heart problems, or eye problems. And we want the smart kids; the quick learners.” “Your kids were chosen not because they want to play this or that instrument, but because they have long arms, or the right lips, or are the right height, say for the trumpet, or the drums,” he said. Seated across from me at a school desk, a father in China’s blue Public Security Uniform with silver-and-black insignia on his shoulder appeared to be listening carefully. Yet as he fiddled with a pen, took notes, leaned forward with his elbows on the desk, stared down, crossed his legs at the ankles, I wondered if he was entirely “there.” Chinese police attend a lot of ideological meetings at which matters such as the rejuvenation of the great Chinese nation or control of ethnic minorities are freely discussed. Likely he was proud his child had been selected for Band C. But perhaps he was also a bit bored, I thought. I, however, was spellbound. During my years in China I’d learned about ideas on a person’s “quality,” or “suzhi,” — concepts that are widely accepted here but would probably discomfort liberal parents elsewhere. At our school, the children are separated into two sections — a so-called “international department” and a “Chinese department” — depending on their citizenship. Though both sections use similar Chinese-language teaching materials, they are treated differently and rarely mingle. The majority of students in the international department are of Chinese origin too, but have with overseas passports. The international department is more laid-back than the Chinese department which, according to my daughter, gets fewer breaks, more homework and is subject to harsher discipline. For the purposes of the school band, however, the two groups were one. Two other non-Chinese, 8-year-old friends of my daughter were among the chosen. The Italian mother of one said her daughter had been chosen for saxophone because the girl was strongly built. “The other girl playing the sax is a Russian, and she’s also pretty built up and strong,” said my friend. (I have omitted their names out of respect for their privacy and that of their children.) My friend recalled that some of the parents had asked Teacher Wang why he was choosing children in grade 2 now, rather than earlier when they were in grade 1. Teacher Wang’s reply: “Because in grade 1 their teeth are falling out,” she said. My friend said that Teacher Wang had personally inspected each child’s teeth, as if, she said, “they were horses in the market.” There was discussion of what kind of lips worked best for the trumpet. And in a statement that shocked both of us profoundly, Teacher Wang said something about how Africans had long arms and so would be good at particular instruments, such as the cello. The American father of the third girl said a dentist had visited the school to see which students’ teeth were best suited to play wind instruments. His daughter, braces-free, passed and is learning to play the clarinet. My daughter, who has some wonky teeth and braces, is a drummer. Apart from the teeth, I can see why; she has the mad energy of Animal in The Muppets and loves what the Chinese call “renao,” or “hot noise,” excitement. As a parent who found the eugenics of it disturbing, what was Ito do? Everyone, including the parents of “long-armed” children, seemed O.K. with it. My daughter was pushing hard to be part of it. I gave in. And she loves it.","response":"In a Beijing public elementary school, a group of children has been selected for the school band on the basis of their physical attributes rather than their musical interests or abilities. This controversial practice of eugenics for music is intended to build the best band that would travel globally to showcase the excellence of Chinese youth. The selection process, led by Teacher Wang, included examining the children's teeth, arms, height, welfare, and learning abilities. While this selection approach may seem strange and discomforting to some liberal parents, the majority of those involved were content with it, and the children selected enjoy being part of the band."},{"question":"Проведение заседания Совета Всеукраинской ассоциации клинической химии и лабораторной медицины (Киев, 9 февраля 2008 г.

Which language is this?","response":"The language presented in this sentence, \\"Succesul de la Berlin marchează un nou jalon internaţional pentru cinematografia turcească,\\" is Romanian. A member of the Eastern Romanic subgroup, Romanian is the official language of Romania and Moldova. Romanian has its roots in Latin and shares many similarities with Italian, French, Spanish, and Portuguese. It has also adopted words from Slavic neighbors and from French, German, English, and Hungarian. The translation of the provided sentence in English is: \\"The success from Berlin marks a new international milestone for Turkish cinematography.\\" This English translation might vary slightly depending on the context. Romanian grammar, similarly to other Romance languages, can be complicated, particularly in determining the gender, case, and number of nouns or the conjugation patterns of verbs. Let's further analyse your sentence to see the Romanian linguistic characteristics: - \\"Succesul\\" means \\"the success\\", where '-ul' is the definite article attached to masculine singular nouns. In contrary to English, Romanian places the definite article at the end of the word. - \\"de la\\" is a preposition means \\"from\\". - \\"Berlin\\" is the capital of Germany and it's used here in the function of a Proper noun. - \\"marchează\\" is a verb that means \\"marks\\". It is in the third person singular form of the present indicative tense. - \\"un nou\\" translates to \\"a new\\". This is an interesting combination of an indefinite article \\"un\\" (a/an) and the adjective \\"nou\\" (new). - \\"jalon internaţional\\" translates to \\"international milestone\\". \\"jalon\\" is not a commonly word used in Day-to-Day Romanian, it's rather used in a formal context. - \\"pentru\\" is a preposition means \\"for\\". - \\"cinematografia\\" means \\"cinematography\\". It is a feminine noun. - \\"turcească\\" is an adjective, it means \\"Turkish\\". So, we can see from this sentence that Romanian follows a Subject-Verb-Object sentence structure, just like English. The sentence analyzed demonstrates the richness of Romanian in expressing complex ideas with precision and clarity."},{"question":"Write a subject line for this message: I have attached the review.

The current Congressman is a democrat who represents the failed economic policies of Barack Obama and Nancy Pelosi. It's time for a change.\\" He was unseated in Congress by Rep. Joe Garcia (D) in 2012. Rivera is under investigation by the federal government for potential ties to a campaign finance scheme involving a Democratic opponent of Garcia's who received unreported campaign cash. The Miami Herald, which has covered the matter extensively, reported Thursday that when Rivera made his campaign announcement on Spanish-language television, he would not talk about the investigation. Rivera's decsion puts him at odds with Miami-Dade School Board member Carlos Curbelo (R), who is already in the race against Garcia. Curbelo is a highly-touted recruit who was recently promoted to \\"Contender\\" in the National Republican Congressional Committee's \\"Young Guns\\" program for top challengers and open seat hopefuls. He's also backed by former Florida governor Jeb Bush (R). \\"I just got the news and wanted to make sure that you heard it from me: David Rivera is going to run for Congress again, despite being under investigation by federal agencies for serious allegations,\\" Curbelo wrote in a fundraising e-mail sent Thursday evening. Summary:","response":"Okay kiddo, you know how we have leaders who we choose to make important decisions for us? Well, there's a man named David Rivera. He used to be one of those leaders and worked in a big building called Congress. But he had to leave because he might have done something wrong - some people gave him money they weren't supposed to. He's being looked into by some serious people who figure out if rules were broken. Despite all this, Mr. Rivera wants to work in the big Congress building again! And he just told everyone about it. But not everyone is happy about this. Another man named Carlos Curbelo also wants the same job. So it became a bit complicated. Mr. Curbelo even has the backing, or support, of a really famous person named Jeb Bush who used to be the head leader of Florida."},{"question":"Q:Question: what team was the movie the replacements based on I found the following answer on Google: The Replacements is a 2000 American sports comedy film directed by Howard Deutch . Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. A:","response":"Yes, the answer you found on Google is partially correct, but it does not specifically mention the team the movie is based on. \\"The Replacements\\" is a 2000 American sports comedy film directed by Howard Deutch. The movie has a fictional storyline, but it was loosely inspired by the 1987 NFL players' strike. The film centers around the Washington Sentinels, a fictional professional football team. While the team itself is not directly based on a real-life NFL team, the storyline of replacement players being brought in during a players' strike was reminiscent of the events of the 1987 NFL strike. During the 1987 strike, NFL team owners hired replacement players to fill their rosters for three games until the strike was resolved. \\"The Replacements\\" takes creative liberties and uses a fictionalized representation of the NFL strike, providing an entertaining and comedic portrayal of the challenges faced by a group of misfits turned professional football players. So, although the movie is not based on a specific real-life team, it draws its inspiration from the real-life situation that occurred in the NFL during the 1987 players' strike."},{"question":"Generate a sentence about this data: The Plough eatType pub; The Plough food Chinese; The Plough priceRange high; The Plough familyFriendly no; The Plough near Café Rouge Sentence:","response":"The Plough is a pub where they serve Chinese food that is a bit expensive, not really a place for families with little kids, and it is close to Café Rouge."},{"question":"Premise: \\"The agency should receive proposals, evaluate the technical and cost merits of different proposals, negotiate with contractors, and award a contract in accordance with a source selection plan developed before release of the RFP.\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"The agency shouldn't receive proposals or negotiate with contractors.\\" true?

And more and more often, it is fatal. Often perceived as enemy targets, war reporters cover the front lines without military protection. And in addition to the physical threats comes an emotional toll from repeatedly witnessing death and destruction. “Most people would be surprised to learn the real story behind the war journalists bringing them the news of television. They often look so together and reasonably serene and don’t appear to be in any emotional stress,” documentary filmmaker and international battlefields veteran Martyn Burke told FOX411’s Pop Tarts column while promoting his new documentary “Under Fire: Journalists in Combat.” “But behind the scenes, many of them ... suffer a lot of the PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) symptoms. The stress just gets to them.” “Under Fire” brings together combat footage with interviews and first-hand accounts from an array of war journalists. According to the Burke, only two journalists were killed in WWI, while 63 journalists lost their lives in the WWII. Compare that to the last two decades, where almost a journalist a week has been slain, and the increasing threat of kidnapping, torture and even beheadings, is contributing to serious stress-related problems. “Nowadays the pace of news has picked up to the point of being 24/7. The journalists don’t have the down time, they have to always be on and ready to go to the battle,” Burke continued. “For instance, in Vietnam the reporters would go out into combat but then come back to places like Saigon and stay for a week or so. It is no longer like that. Now the journalists are out in combat every bit as much as the troops and for often longer durations than some of the troops. That is creating the problems. The circle of danger gets closer and closer with each war.” Burke and his team looked at the personal sacrifices a war reporter makes to deliver the news. In particular, the director was intrigued by the very different way these experiences are processed by female reporters as opposed to men, as more and more women cover the front lines. “The old glass ceiling in war reporting has been shattered. We’ve got two women in the film, and each has a different perspective on it than the men. Women off doing war coverage often have more family responsibilities and carry much more guilt than the men. Women are constantly wondering about their children back home or their husbands, it seems family life follows the women around a lot more than the males,” Burke said. “But what was most fascinating was the addiction these journalists develop to covering wars… the adrenalin highs, the combat highs, it becomes a form of a rush and people need it more and more. For some people, it gave them a purpose in life, merely surviving for one more day was actually a strange high. Some people get so caught up in this, and they are the ones that often hit the wall psychologically.” And even though the last decade has brought about increased understanding about such things as PTSD, with news organizations becoming more proactive in recognizing and treating these issues, Burke said there is still a long way to go in providing support for journalists who bring us critical information. “The human mind can only be pushed so far in terms of constant stress and fear of death and seeing horrors, and there are different levels of resilience in different people. There just needs to be a level of understanding that these people can find themselves in serious emotional trouble from time to time,” Burke added. “We get all of the news, which leads to foreign policy and decisions being made, from these people. On a global scale, we need to understand that this is where our news comes from, and if these people are under stress, it needs to be monitored.” “Under Fire: Journalists in Combat” opens in Los Angeles on November 11, and New York on December 2. What is a short summary of the above article?","response":"The documentary \\"Under Fire: Journalists in Combat\\" explores the increasing dangers and stresses faced by war reporters. Filmmaker Martyn Burke interviews war journalists who have witnessed death and destruction, discussing their experiences with PTSD and the emotional toll of constantly being at risk. The documentary highlights the fact that compared to WWI and WWII, where journalist casualties were relatively low, nearly a journalist a week has been killed in the past two decades. Additionally, the film looks at how female war reporters process their experiences differently and the impact of the danger on their family lives. The need for better support and understanding for these journalists is emphasized in the documentary as they play a critical role in providing news and influencing foreign policy decisions."},{"question":"Definition: This task is in Spanish. Based on the given context, generate a question which can be answered by the given context. Generate a question that has more than 7 words. You can paraphrase the given context while forming the question. Suggestion: The question may involve starting question words like WHERE, WHEN, HOW, WHAT (in Spanish). Input: CONTEXT: Producción Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games se convirtió en la segunda colaboración entre Nintendo y Sega. Una vez que Sega dejó de producir hardware para desarrollar software para cualquier plataforma en 2001, ambas compañías trabajaron en F-Zero GX, lo cual marcó el punto de partida de una alianza de negocios. El concepto para un crossover entre Sonic y Mario era un tema recurrente en las discusiones de Sega y Nintendo; los creadores de dichos personajes, Yuji Naka y Shigeru Miyamoto, respectivamente, discutieron el tema en privado en 2005. A pesar de ello, el proyecto no se llevó inmediatamente a cabo ya que no había un concepto que le diera a ese juego «un signo de exclamación», como para que se produjera. La idea de un escenario olímpico se originó una vez que Sega obtuvo la licencia para las Olimpiadas de Pekín 2008, más o menos un año después. Esta última adoptó la misión del Comité Olímpico Internacional (COI) referente a promover un espíritu deportivo, por lo que quiso que los jóvenes se interesaran en los Juegos Olímpicos por medio de su nueva licencia. De esta forma, concibieron un juego de deportes donde aparecieran sus personajes que «los jóvenes aman y que son muy icónicos», en vez de crear una simulación más realista. Sega entonces le solicitó permiso a Nintendo para usar a Mario, con lo que sería la primera vez que Sonic y Mario aparecían en un mismo título. Nintendo aceptó y colaboró con Sega para ocuparse del control de calidad en el desarrollo del juego. Tanto Nintendo como Sega sintieron que el espíritu competitivo de los Juegos Olímpicos era una elección idónea para usar a sus personajes, que alguna vez habían rivalizado previamente.

At her new school, she forms a friendship with a group of girls rumored to be witches, Bonnie (Neve Campbell), Nancy (Fairuza Balk) and Rochelle (Rachel True). At the same time, Sarah becomes attracted to the popular Chris (Skeet Ulrich). Bonnie, Nancy and Rochelle worship a powerful deity named \\"Manon\\". Sarah exhibits supernatural powers from the onset of the film (revealed to being a \\"natural witch,\\" i.e. born of a parent who practiced witchcraft) and her new friends believe that she will complete their coven, making them all-powerful. When Sarah is harassed by a vagrant with a snake (whom she had encountered before in her new house), he is immediately hit by a car and the girls believe that together they willed it to happen. After a date with Chris, Sarah is upset to learn that he has spread a false rumor that they had sex. When Sarah confronts him, he treats her disrespectfully in front of his friends. Sarah casts a love spell upon him; Rochelle casts a revenge spell on a hateful racist bully, Laura Lizzie (Christine Taylor); Bonnie casts a spell for beauty; and Nancy for liberation from working-class poverty. It becomes clear that the spells have been successful: Chris becomes infatuated with Sarah, scars that Bonnie has on her back are completely healed by an experimental gene therapy, Laura loses her hair, and Nancy's abusive stepfather has a heart attack and dies, leaving a large insurance policy which makes her mother rich. Nancy lusts for more power and encourages the others to join her in a rite called \\"Invocation of the Spirit\\". To do so, she plans to \\"call the corners\\" by creating a fire on a beach, so that all four natural elements (earth, fire, air, and water) can be called upon by the four separate girls, to grant them further supernatural abilities. On completion of the spell, Nancy is struck by lightning, and all four girls fall unconscious. Afterward Nancy is...

Gnats cannot bite through clothing, so an easy way to avoid getting bit is to wear clothing that fits loosely. Tight clothing can stretch over the skin and provide holes in the fabric that gnats can bite you through. Long sleeve shirts, gloves, and jeans, for example, provide good coverage. This is especially helpful in summer and early autumn when bugs are more active. This is a good short-term solution when you are faced with a large number of gnats. Tie ordinary garden netting over your head. Wearing a hat makes this easier. Throw the netting over your head or hat, wrap it loosely around your neck, and either tuck it into your shirt or tie loosely with a piece of strong. This will protect your head and neck while still allowing you to see. In extreme cases, you may wish to buy permethrin-treated clothing to cover your entire body.

While waiting for the shower to heat up, she notices she got one cut on each of her arms. The cut on her left arm is hardly even noticeable, but the one on her right arm is red and easy to see. Karen gets some cream from her cabinet to use on her cuts after she gets done showering. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which arm's blood vessels are more dilated? Hint: The body's second line of defense against pathogens includes the inflammatory response. If bacteria enter the skin through a scrape, the area may become red, warm, and painful. These are signs of inflammation. Inflammation is one way the body reacts to infections or injuries. Inflammation is caused by chemicals that are released when skin or other tissues are damaged. The chemicals cause nearby blood vessels to dilate, or expand. This increases blood flow to the damaged area, which makes the area red and slightly warm. The chemicals also attract white blood cells called neutrophils to the wound and cause them to leak out of blood vessels into the damaged tissue. Answer:","response":"Given the information provided, the blood vessels in Karen's right arm are more dilated. The cut on her right arm is red and easy to see, which indicates an inflammatory response. The dilation of blood vessels increases blood flow to the damaged area, making it appear red and slightly warm.

Step 1: Identifying key words The main keywords in this review are \\"Can't download\\" and \\"update.\\" This suggests dissatisfaction or inconvenience experienced by the user. Step 2: Estimating the degree of frustration or disappointment The user seems to be mildly frustrated, as indicated by the exclamation points and the seemingly random word \\"Manassas\\" (which may be an expression of disbelief or annoyance). Step 3: Considering the average review rating for a frustrating experience A ★★☆☆☆ or ★★☆☆☆ rating might be given to a product that doesn't work as expected or causes minor inconvenience. Given the user's frustration, I would lean toward the lower end of this range. Step 4: Balancing the negativity with possible positivity Although the user's statement primarily expresses dissatisfaction, it's possible they could still find value in the product or service once they're able to download and update it. This would slightly reduce the negative impact of the review. Taking these factors into account, I would estimate a ★★☆☆☆ rating for this review.

In 1754, Columbia University was founded under charter by King George II as King's College in Lower Manhattan. The Stamp Act Congress met in New York in October 1765 as the Sons of Liberty organized in the city, skirmishing over the next ten years with British troops stationed there.\\" Answer: A:","response":"The result of the media being able to say whatever they wanted, following the trial of John Peter Zenger in 1735, led to the establishment of freedom of the press in North America. This freedom played a significant role in shaping the history and politics of the region. Before the Zenger trial, the press was heavily censored, and any criticism of the government was punishable by law. The Zenger trial marked the beginning of the press's ability to report on and critique the actions of government officials, providing the public with information that held authorities accountable and transparent. As a consequence, newspapers began to proliferate, and the colonies were exposed to different perspectives and ideas, including those advocating for independence from Britain. The freedom of the press proved to be an essential factor in the run-up to the American Revolutionary War. Newspapers, pamphlets, and other forms of media provided information and rallied support for the Patriot cause. This free circulation of information bolstered the colonial opposition to British rule and played a significant role in the ratification of the United States Constitution, which enshrined the right to freedom of speech and press in the First Amendment. In summary, the media being able to say whatever they wanted as a result of the Zenger trial led to the establishment of freedom of the press in North America. This freedom played a critical role in the formation of an informed society, shaping politics, and influencing events such as the American Revolution and the adoption of the United States Constitution."},{"question":"Read the bio below and try to give details on georgi nadjakov 's: - death place - fields - death date - workplaces - birth date - name - nationality - image - birth place - alma mater Bio: georgi nadjakov -lrb- december 26 , 1896 - february 24 , 1981 -rrb- was a famous bulgarian physicist . he became a corresponding member of the göttingen academy of sciences -lrb- 1940 -rrb- in germany , member of the bulgarian academy of sciences -lrb- 1945 -rrb- and member of the russian academy of sciences -lrb- 1958 -rrb- . sofia university sent him to specialize in the laboratories of paul langevin and marie curie in paris , where he investigated photoelectricity for one year . georgi nadjakov experimentally investigated photoconducting properties of sulphur . he prepared the permanent photoelectret state of matter for the first time and published his paper in 1937 photoelectrets were the most notable achievement of georgi nadjakov . its practical application led to the invention of the photocopier by chester carlson some years later .
