Oliver goes on to the roof and Stan stays below at the fireplace. Stan begins to shove the sweep up the chimney and knocks Oliver backwards and down through the skylight. Oliver comes back on to the roof and begins to pull the sweep up. Stan has hung on to the sweep and arrives at the roof. Oliver drops him back down through the chimney. Stan doesn't have enough extensions for the sweep and decides to use a rifle to shove the sweep the last part of the way. The gun goes off nearly shooting Oliver. Stan decides to go up to the roof and as he opens the skylight he knocks Oliver off the roof and down onto a greenhouse.

Context: The ability of birds to return to precise locations across vast distances has been known for some time; in an experiment conducted in the 1950s a Manx shearwater released in Boston returned to its colony in Skomer, Wales, within 13 days, a distance of 5,150 km (3,200 mi). Birds navigate during migration using a variety of methods. For diurnal migrants, the sun is used to navigate by day, and a stellar compass is used at night. Birds that use the sun compensate for the changing position of the sun during the day by the use of an internal clock. Orientation with the stellar compass depends on the position of the constellations surrounding Polaris.

With its many international releases, the film had additional English titles of \\"Pray to Kill and Return Alive\\", \\"To Kill a Jackal\\", and \\"Renegade Gun\\". The script by Adriano Bolzoni is inspired by American noir-crime films of the 1930s and 1940s, and Kinski's entry into the scene reprises Edward G. Robinson's presence in \\"Key Largo\\" (1948). - Klaus Kinski (born Klaus Günter Karl Nakszynski; 18 October 1926 23 November 1991) was a German actor. He appeared in more than 130 films, and was a leading role actor in the films of Werner Herzog, including \\"Aguirre, the Wrath of God\\" (1972), \\"Nosferatu the Vampyre\\" (1979), \\"Woyzeck\\" (1979), \\"Fitzcarraldo\\" (1982), and \\"Cobra Verde\\" (1987). He also appeared in many Spaghetti Westerns, such as \\"For a Few Dollars More\\" (1965), \\"A Bullet for the General\\" (1966), \\"The Great Silence\\" (1968), \\"And God Said to Cain\\" (1970), \\"Shoot the Living and Pray for the Dead\\" (1971) and \\"A Genius, Two Partners and a Dupe\\" (1975).

The story follows the travels of Spanish soldier Lope de Aguirre, who leads a group of conquistadores down the Orinoco and Amazon River in South America in search of the legendary city of gold, El Dorado. Using a minimalist story and dialogue, the film creates a vision of madness and folly, counterpointed by the lush but unforgiving Amazonian jungle. Although based loosely on what is known of the historical figure of Aguirre, the film's storyline is, as Herzog acknowledged years after the film's release, a work of imagination. Some of the people and situations may have been inspired by Gaspar de Carvajal's account of an earlier Amazonian expedition, although Carvajal was not on the historical voyage represented in the film.

Regular exercise helps strengthen the cardiovascular system, improving heart health, and reducing the risk of heart disease. It also aids in weight management, helping to prevent obesity and related health issues.

Peter Loew is a driven literary agent and an example of the stereotypical narcissistic and greedy yuppie of the 1980s: he works all day and club hops at night, with little in his life but alcohol, one night stands and the pursuit of money and prestige. However, he is slowly going insane and sees a therapist frequently; it is during these sessions that his declining mental health becomes clear through a series of increasingly bizarre rants which eventually begin to scare even the psychiatrist.

Article:","response":"Title: Boris Johnson Optimistic About UK's Future Outside the EU Amid PM Ambitions Introduction: Boris Johnson, former British Foreign Secretary and a prominent Brexit supporter, has expressed confidence in the United Kingdom's prospects outside the European Union. In a recent ITV debate, Johnson claimed that Britain could \\"prosper as never before\\" if it leaves the EU. However, critics have accused him of using Brexit as a platform to further his ambitions of becoming the next Prime Minister. Step 1: Explore Johnson's remarks and predictions for Brexit During the televised debate, Boris Johnson shared his enthusiasm for Brexit and predicted a bright future for Britain outside the EU. He argued that the UK could thrive if it embraces new opportunities and asserts its independence from the European bloc. Step 2: Present opposing viewpoints and concerns over Brexit On the other hand, opponents of Brexit have raised concerns over the economic impact of leaving the EU. They argue that risks such as trade disruptions, job losses, and decreased investment could dampen Britain's potential prosperity. Additionally, some critics question the feasibility of negotiating favorable trade deals with other countries once the UK leaves the EU. Step 3: Address accusations of Johnson's political ambitions During the ITV debate, Boris Johnson faced accusations of using Brexit to further his political career and ambitions to be the next Prime Minister. Critics argue that his optimistic outlook on the UK's post-Brexit future is a tactic to garner support and position himself as a strong candidate for leadership. Step 4: Discuss Johnson's qualifications and past experience Boris Johnson has a diverse political background, having served as the Mayor of London from 2008 to 2016 and later as the UK's Foreign Secretary. His experience in these roles has exposed him to various aspects of international relations, making him a viable candidate for leading the country. However, skeptics point to his past decisions and controversies as reasons to question his suitability for the role of Prime Minister. Conclusion: Boris Johnson's optimistic view of the UK's future outside the EU has gained him both support and criticism. While Brexit could potentially open doors for new opportunities, concerns over economic risks persist. As accusations of using Brexit as a platform for his PM ambitions continue, Johnson's ability to truly lead Britain post-Brexit may be put to the test."},{"question":"Q: In this task, you're given the title of a five-sentence story and the first four sentences.

This sentiment analysis will provide a detailed explanation based on the components of the sentence and the context in which the words are used. First, let's break down the sentence: 1. \\"oftentimes\\" - This adverb suggests that the description applies frequently, but not necessarily always. It indicates that the reviewer observed the discussed element multiple times. 2. \\"funny\\" - The adjective \\"funny\\" implies a positive sentiment; it means the movie has a sense of humor or comedic elements that are intended to amuse the audience. This usually suggests that the audience could expect to laugh or at least be entertained by the movie's comedic aspects. 3. \\"yet\\" - This conjunction is primarily used to introduce a contrasting element or idea. In this context, it suggests that there is a notable exception or additional point the reviewer wants to make, which may be positive, negative, or neutral. Since the sentence is incomplete, it is difficult to pinpoint an exact sentiment. However, based on the words used, the overall sentiment leans towards positive due to the description of the movie being \\"oftentimes funny.\\" The adverb \\"oftentimes\\" implies that the humor is frequent enough to make a positive impression on the reviewer. The conjunction \\"yet,\\" followed by the absence of additional information, introduces an element of uncertainty or anticipation. It serves as a teaser, sparking curiosity about the contrasting point that the reviewer wants to make. This possibly indicates that there might be some mixed feelings about the movie or the reviewer may bring balance to their opinion by stating something less favorable in continuation. However, without the rest of the sentence, it is difficult to provide a definitive sentiment analysis. In conclusion, the sentiment of the movie review sentence \\"oftentimes funny, yet\\" is generally positive (due to the use of \\"funny\\"), but it remains somewhat incomplete and inconclusive without the additional context. The use of the conjunction \\"yet\\" suggests that there may be more to the reviewer's opinion than what has been revealed in this part of the sentence, leaving room for further analysis when the complete statement is known."},{"question":"Given those answer options, answer the question: Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what could be used to to measure how many milliliters something is?\\" is \\"a graduated cylinder\\", given that a graduated cylinder is used to measure milliliters?

If Jenny collected 30 red marbles and 25 blue marbles, what's the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together? Think carefully first, then make a decision:","response":"Let's analyze the information given step by step: 1. Jenny collected 30 red marbles. 2. Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny. So, Mary collected 2 * 30 = 60 red marbles. 3. Anie collected 20 more red marbles than Mary. So, Anie collected 60 + 20 = 80 red marbles. 4. Jenny collected 25 blue marbles. 5. Anie collected twice the number of blue marbles as Jenny. So, Anie collected 2 * 25 = 50 blue marbles. 6. Mary collected half the number of blue marbles as Anie.

In mathematics, to solve an equation is to find its solutions, which are the values (numbers, functions, sets, etc.) that fulfill the condition stated by the equation, consisting generally of two expressions related by an equality sign. When seeking a solution, one or more free variables are designated as unknowns. A solution is an assignment of expressions to the unknown variables that makes the equality in the equation true. In other words, a solution is an expression or a collection of expressions (one for each unknown) such that, when substituted for the unknowns, the equation becomes an identity. A problem of solving an equation may be numeric or symbolic. Solving an equation numerically means that only numbers represented explicitly as numerals (not as an expression involving variables), are admitted as solutions. Solving an equation symbolically means that expressions that may contain known variables or possibly also variables not in the original equation are admitted as solutions.

It came out way too fast to be freshly made. Would not come back again.","response":"The sentiment of the given review can be categorized as mainly negative with one positive mention. The reviewer starts by expressing that they were very hungry when they visited the place, which indicates that they might have been looking forward to a satisfying meal. However, their experience turned out to be quite disappointing. They specifically point out several issues with the food. Firstly, the shrimp in the noodles were cold, implying that the food was not cooked or heated properly. Secondly, the salt and pepper pork was soggy and lukewarm, which adds to their dissatisfaction with the overall meal experience. This remark further highlights the lack of freshness and appropriate temperature of the dish. Additionally, the reviewer suspects that the food is pre-cooked and re-heated, as it was served too quickly to have been freshly made. This assumption contributes to a negative perception of the food quality and further solidifies the critical tone of their review. On a more positive note, the reviewer mentions that they liked the curry and roti, which indicates that not every aspect of the meal was subpar.

Given these facts, what can rain cause among the following options: - volcanoes - flooding - desert - Condensation - Sinkholes - Dehydration - erosion - cloud formation Answer:","response":"Rain, as a form of precipitation, can directly or indirectly contribute to several phenomena among the options provided: 1. Flooding: This is the most direct result of excessive rain. When too much rain falls in a short period of time (such as in a heavy storm or hurricane), it can overwhelm local bodies of water and drainage systems, causing them to overflow and flood the surrounding areas. 2. Sinkholes: These are often caused by the erosion of soluble rocks, such as limestone or dolomite, beneath the ground. Rainwater, especially when it's more acidic, can seep into the ground and dissolve these types of rocks over time, creating cavities that may eventually collapse and form sinkholes. 3. Erosion: Rain, particularly when it's heavy or prolonged, can cause the erosion of soil, rocks, and other materials on the Earth's surface. This can result in landslides, loss of fertile topsoil, and other types of land degradation. 4. Cloud formation: Rain doesn't directly cause cloud formation, but it's a part of the same cycle. Water on the Earth's surface (including rain that has fallen) evaporates due to the Sun's heat, rises, cools, and condenses to form clouds in the atmosphere. When the cloud droplets become too large, they'll fall as rain, completing the cycle. Among the phenomena listed, rain does not cause volcanoes, desert conditions, condensation (although it's part of the bigger cycle where condensation occurs), or dehydration (rain adds moisture to ecosystems, not remove it)."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: This article: Further recognition came with the hanging of one of Fuller's paintings, Summer Breezes, at the Royal Academy in 1904. Other Australian artists whose works were hung at the same time included Rupert Bunny, E. Phillips Fox, Albert Fullwood, George Lambert, and Arthur Streeton. Fuller was the only woman painter to be represented. A critic writing in The West Australian observed:The work ... is essentially Australian in almost every detail. Standing in a sunlit Australian paddock, a lithesome Australian blonde holds her summer hat on against the rude caresses of an Australian breeze—a subject simple but grand in its simplicity ... Next to its suggestion of breezy sunshine and the incidental portrayal of willowy grace the picture is to be admired for its colour scheme ... The details of the picture disclose untiring care. By the time Summer Breezes was on display, Fuller had returned to Australia, not to her previous home in Melbourne but to Perth in Western Australia, where she joined her sister, Amy Fuller, who was a singer. Although only in her mid-thirties, Fuller's background made her \\"one of the most experienced artists in Western Australia at this time\\". For the next four years, she painted portraits, including one of Western Australian politician James George Lee Steere, undertaken posthumously from photographs and recollections of those who had known him. It was acquired by the gallery whose board he chaired. She also took on students, including French-Australian artist Kathleen O'Connor. Fuller's paintings from this period included A Golden Hour, described by the National Gallery of Australia as \\"a masterpiece ... giving us a gentle insight into the people, places and times that make up our history\\". The painting, an oil on canvas 109 cm (43 in) high and 135 cm (53 in) wide, portrays a woman and a man standing together in a rural setting in late afternoon, surrounded by grass, scattered gum trees, and Xanthorrhoea.

Manchmal glaubt er sogar selbst an die Storys, die er verzapft und eines Tages geht das ins Auge: Die Richterin brummt ihm 300 soziale Arbeitsstunden in einem Kinderhort auf. Dort herrscht Anna (Nora Tschirner), die den Schwerenöter Ludo schon als Kind nicht ausstehen konnte. Ludo muss also barfuß durch die Hölle. Zwischen Klatschspalten und Klettergerüsten entdeckt er sich selbst es ist der Knüller seines Lebens.The street is his beat: with his fellow paparazzi Moritz (Matthias Schweighöfer), reporter Ludo (Til Schweiger) is always on the lookout for stars, starlets, & harlots. Sometimes, he even believes the storys he types, and one day, he gets what he deserves: the court orders him to spend 300 hours in public service at a nursurey school. Anna (Nora Tschirner) is in charge there - a woman the womanizing Ludo couldn't stand as a child - and working for her is like walking through Hell barefoot. Between gossip columns & scaffolding, he learns this is the scoop of his life.","response":"\\"Rabbit Without Ears\\" (original German title: \\"Keinohrhase\\") is a German romantic comedy film released in 2007, directed by and starring Til Schweiger as Ludo, alongside Nora Tschirner as Anna and Matthias Schweighöfer as Moritz. The film was a major box-office success in Germany and gained widespread praise for its humor and performances. Regarding your question about what working for Anna is like, it's important to understand that Ludo and Anna have a history together since childhood, so their past animosity creates a challenging work environment for Ludo. As a reporter sentenced to 300 hours of social work in Anna's nursery school, Ludo finds himself in a difficult and humbling situation. Working for Anna is like \\"walking through Hell barefoot\\" because Ludo is used to a more glamorous lifestyle filled with celebrities, scandals and the fast-paced environment that comes with being a paparazzi. It's a new and unfamiliar world for him, going from the spotlight to a community-oriented setting where children's welfare is the main focus. Moreover, Anna's no-nonsense and strong-willed personality clashes with Ludo's cavalier attitude. However, this experience of working under Anna's supervision becomes a transformative journey for Ludo. As he adapts to his new surroundings and gets to know Anna better, he discovers valuable life lessons. Over time, their initial animosity fades and both characters mature through their interactions, subsequently leading towards romantic feelings and self-growth. In summary, while working for Anna is initially difficult and hellish for Ludo, the experience eventually leads to personal growth, self-discovery, and a deepening connection with Anna. The movie demonstrates that even in challenging situations, people can learn and grow together, finding unexpected happiness and love."},{"question":"Nonwovens,whetherornotimpregnated,coated,coveredorlaminated,n.e.s.,weighing>than150g/m²(excl.ofman-madefilaments) Generate a sentence using the above characters:","response":"In order to generate a sentence using the characters from the given input, I will first separate the words and then rearrange them to form a coherent sentence.

While all pharmaceutical treatments have side effects, racism is not a known side effect of any Sanofi medication. ||||| Roseanne Barr Says Ambien Played Role In Racist Tweet That Spiked Her Show's Reboot Enlarge this image toggle caption Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty Images Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty Images Updated at 11:40 a.m. ET Actress Roseanne Barr says she was \\"Ambien tweeting\\" at 2 in the morning when she posted a racist tweet about Valerie Jarrett, a former senior adviser in the Obama White House, that caused ABC to cancel her TV show. The reboot of Barr's eponymous TV show was canceled Tuesday after one season. ABC Entertainment's president announced the network was pulling the plug after Barr tweeted that Jarrett, who now serves on several corporate boards and is a senior fellow at the University of Chicago Law School, is the product of the \\"muslim brotherhood & planet of the apes.\\" Barr said shortly before 10:30 a.m. Tuesday: \\"I apologize. I am now leaving Twitter.\\" She later sent dozens of tweets in which she apologized and offered up a number of reasons for her offensive comment. \\"It was 2 in the morning and I was ambien tweeting — it was memorial day too — I went 2 far & do not want it defended,\\" Barr said in a tweet Tuesday night. She also said she believed Jarrett was Saudi or Jewish or Persian, rather than black. But when she invoked the sleep aid, her critics pounced. From Ragnorak Lobster, on Twitter: \\"AMBIEN SIDE EFFECTS: Peddling bizarre conspiracy theories, voting for white nationalists, doing photo shoots while dressed as Hitler and tanking your career by calling black women apes. If your racism lasts longer than four hours, please see a doctor.\\" Ambien's manufacturer, Sanofi-Aventis, responded to the news on Wednesday, saying via Twitter, \\"While all pharmaceutical treatments have side effects, racism is not a known side effect of any Sanofi medication.\\" Listing Ambien's actual side effects on its website, the company's warnings and precautions for Ambien include a section on \\"Abnormal Thinking and Behavioral Changes\\" — saying the side effects can include a lack of inhibition. Sanofi-Aventis also tells people to stop taking Ambien if they find themselves performing complex behaviors — like making phone calls or driving a car — without being fully awake. \\"It can rarely be determined with certainty whether a particular instance of the abnormal behaviors listed above is drug induced, spontaneous in origin, or a result of an underlying psychiatric or physical disorder,\\" the company says. Later, Barr denied that she was putting the blame on Ambien, saying it was \\"just an explanation not an excuse.\\" On Wednesday morning, Barr replied to one critic on Twitter, \\"Yes, I have had odd ambien experiences on tweeting late at night-like many other ppl do. I BLAME MYSELF OK?\\" President Trump has since chimed in on Twitter — not exactly defending Barr, but rather complaining about his own treatment. \\"Bob Iger of ABC called Valerie Jarrett to let her know that 'ABC does not tolerate comments like those' made by Roseanne Barr,\\" he wrote. \\"Gee, he never called President Donald J. Trump to apologize for the HORRIBLE statements made and said about me on ABC. Maybe I just didn't get the call?\\" It's not immediately clear what statements Trump was referring to. With the Roseanne show canceled, others who were involved with the project weighed in on the star's comments — including Sara Gilbert, who had been executive producer on the reboot. Gilbert said the remarks are \\"abhorrent and do not reflect the beliefs of our cast and crew or anyone associated with our show,\\" adding that she is disappointed in her longtime friend and colleague. In her initial response to that tweet, Barr said, \\"Wow! unreal.\\" But on Wednesday, she took a softer stance, coming to Gilbert's defense after one of her followers sent a critical tweet. \\"No, I understand her position and why she said what she said,\\" Barr said. She added that she forgives Gilbert, saying, \\"It just shocked me a bit, but I indeed [f*****] up.\\" In addition to her remark about Jarrett, Barr is also being criticized over her recent attacks on both Chelsea Clinton and billionaire George Soros, who is a prominent donor to Democratic campaigns. On Monday, Barr regurgitated a rumor that Clinton had married a nephew of Soros — a rumor that was popularized by actor and Trump supporter Scott Baio shortly before the 2016 presidential election. Clinton replied to Barr early Tuesday, \\"Good morning Roseanne — my given middle name is Victoria. I imagine George Soros's nephews are lovely people. I'm just not married to one.\\" Barr apologized but then followed it up by repeating another conspiracy theory — that Soros and his father worked with Nazis during World War II (a rumor that has been debunked and that Soros denounced again yesterday). On Wednesday morning, Barr also invoked President Trump. Barr said, \\"i feel bad for @POTUS-he goes thru this every single day.\\" In addition to the cancellation of her rebooted show, reruns of the original program, which ran for much of the 1990s, were pulled by Viacom. |||||","response":"Actress Roseanne Barr blamed the sleep aid Ambien for a racist tweet she posted about Valerie Jarrett, a former senior adviser in the Obama White House, prompting ABC to cancel her TV show.

Although words related in form or meaning, e.g. Hellenist (Ancient Greek: Ἑλληνιστής, Hellēnistēs), have been attested since ancient times, it was J. G. Droysen in the mid-19th century, who in his classic work Geschichte des Hellenismus, i.e. History of Hellenism, coined the term Hellenistic to refer to and define the period when Greek culture spread in the non-Greek world after Alexander’s conquest. Following Droysen, Hellenistic and related terms, e.g. Hellenism, have been widely used in various contexts; a notable such use is in Culture and Anarchy by Matthew Arnold, where Hellenism is used in contrast with Hebraism.

Title: Half Nelson Movie plot: Dan Dunne (Ryan Gosling) is a young inner-city high school teacher whose ideals wither and die in the face of reality. Day after day in his shabby Brooklyn classroom, he somehow finds the energy to inspire his 13 and 14-years-old to examine everything from civil rights to the civil war with a new enthusiasm. Rejecting the standard curriculum in favor of an edgier approach, Dan teaches his students how change workson both a historical and personal scaleand how to think for themselves.Though Dan is brilliant, dynamic and in control of the classroom, he spends his time outside school on the edge of consciousness. Early in the film we see Dan smoking crack in a school locker room after he coaches the school's girls basketball team. While there, one of his players, Drey (Shareeka Epps) catches him getting high. As the plot moves forward, we learn little about how or why Dan got involved with drugs. We find that a former girlfriend has successfully gone through drug rehab, and that the Dunne family has fissures of its own. But Fleck primarily sets moods throughout the film, leaving large ellipses for the viewer to fill in, rather than directly illuminate Dan's story.Drey's troubles are more plainly spelled out. Her parents are not together, and her father is irresponsible and seemingly uninvolved in her life. Drey's brother, Mike, is in prison for selling drugs for a neighborhood dealer, Frank (Anthony Mackie). And Drey's mother is constantly working as an EMT to keep the family together. Drey's lack of proper adult supervision make her a target for Frank's operation.The tension in the film comes from Drey's attempts to save Dan from the consequences of his drug habit, and Dan's efforts to keep Drey from following in her brother Mike's footsteps. These two people are better able to save each other than to save themselves. Answer:","response":"Dan is seen smoking crack."},{"question":"Q:FINAL EXAM Question 1.

Sometimes the best life lessons are found deep in the roots of where we came from. My father passed away years ago, but I always remember the lessons he taught me. Three of them particularly shape my perspective day after day. The first one is that little things make big things happen. To the best of my memory, when I was young, we needed to build a new shed. Those were the days when stores like Home Depot and Lowes didn't exist. Brand-new timber was expensive, so folks often reused the materials that others in the community didn't need. That summer, Dad and I used the boards from an old abandoned barn. We pulled them down one by one, drew the nails out and took off the tin and straightened it in order to reuse it. We got our supplies back to our yard and got to work. I don't know how much of a help I really was, but I chose to stay beside Dad the entire period, working along with him. The sun was hot that day, and sweat formed and ran down our faces. I stood there and handed him the nails one by one, which were hammered into that shed. Dad made me feel proud of my work. Even though I just handed him the nails, he repeatedly emphasized how we built the new shed \\"together\\". He taught me that when you're willing to do hard work, even in little things, big things come together. The second one is that we should honor our promises. As a young man, my father always carried a pocket-sized Bible in his chest pocket. Shortly before the invasion of Normandy in 1944, he prayed for God's protection and promised God that if he made it home, he would make sure his family attended church every Sunday. Well, he made it home and he kept that promise. I cannot remember a Sunday when Dad did not take my mother, my siblings and me to church -- even when we were away on vacation.

One officer has been suspended and two others have been placed on administrative duty, police said. Police said they have not reached any conclusions as to the conduct depicted in the video. Other cases in which the officers are involved are now under review as well, police and prosecutors said. The public defender’s office, which released the footage, said it was recorded by an officer during a drug arrest in January. It shows the officer placing a soup can, which holds a plastic bag, into a trash-strewn lot. That portion of the footage was recorded automatically, before the officer activated the camera. After placing the can, the officer walks to the street, and flips his camera on. “I’m gonna go check here,” the officer says. He returns to the lot and picks up the soup can, removing the plastic bag, which is filled with white capsules. Police cameras have a feature that saves the 30 seconds of video before activation, but without audio. When the officer is first in the alley, there is no audio for the first 30 seconds. The public defender’s office flagged the video for prosecutors last week, prompting prosecutors to drop the heroin possession charge against the man arrested. The man, unable to post 50,000 bail, had been in jail since January, according to attorney Deborah Levi, who is leading a new effort to track police misconduct cases for the public defender’s office. Levi said prosecutors called the officer just days later as a witness in another case — without disclosing the allegations of misconduct on the officer’s part to the defense attorney in that case. “You can’t try a case with that guy and not tell anyone about it,” Levi said. The Baltimore state’s attorney’s office defended its handling of the case in a statement late Wednesday. After being alerted to the video, the office said, it “immediately implemented established protocols to not only refer this matter to the internal affairs division of the Baltimore Police Department but began identifying active cases involving these officers.” It did not dispute Levi’s claim that prosecutors had put the officer back on the stand in another criminal case after being alerted to the video. Melba Saunders, a spokeswoman for the office, said prosecutors are looking into the video, which she called “troubling.” The office did not respond to questions about the case and its handling of it. The footage, which garnered national attention Wednesday, comes as prosecutors and police continue to deal with the fallout from the federal indictment of seven members of an elite police gun squad. Those officers are accused of robbing citizens, filing false court paperwork and claiming overtime they had not earned. Prosecutors have since dropped dozens of cases that depended on those officers’ testimony. The officer in the body camera footage was identified by the public defender’s office as Officer Richard Pinheiro. Pinheiro could not be reached for comment Wednesday. City records show he was hired by the department in 2011, and in 2016 earned a salary of 62,676, with a net income of 67,570. Officers in Baltimore routinely earn overtime pay. Two other officers seen in the video observing Pinheiro are Officers Hovhannes Simonyan and Jamal Brunson, according to public defender and court records obtained by The Baltimore Sun. The public defender working the case first alerted prosecutors last week, the public defender’s office said. Police Commissioner Kevin Davis said police only learned of the video “over the last day or so.” Davis said his department has “not reached any conclusions, because that’s what an investigation is for.” But he noted — and released portions of — other body-worn camera videos from the incident in question that he said provided “other perspectives” than the one provided in the video flagged by the public defender’s office. “To let that initial video that was released by the public defender's office stand all by its lonesome I think doesn't paint as clear of a picture as we would like to offer to the community right now,” he said. The Baltimore Police Department released multiple body-worn camera videos from a January drug arrest that allegedly show an officer placing a bag of drugs in a trash-strewn lot. (Baltimore Police Department) The Baltimore Police Department released multiple body-worn camera videos from a January drug arrest that allegedly show an officer placing a bag of drugs in a trash-strewn lot. (Baltimore Police Department) SEE MORE VIDEOS Davis said officers were conducting surveillance of an area known for drug dealing when they observed an exchange. The department released three additional videos: one of a traffic stop of the alleged buyer of drugs in the exchange; one of the arrest of the suspect of the case in a convenience store; and a third of multiple officers searching the backyard lot featured in the video flagged by the public defender’s office. Davis said the officers found drugs in each of the other three videos: on both the buyer, on the seller, and in the backyard. The drugs found in the backyard in the third video were in a knotted bag, he said. “If I'm engaged in the distribution of drugs, I'll probably have two bags: one with a knot at the top, and one that's unknotted at the top that allows me access to the drugs inside the bag so I can easily retrieve them and then sell or distribute them,” Davis said. “So when these experienced detectives found a bag with a knot at the top, that suggested to them that there's probably an un-knotted bag nearby, because the drug dealers won't unknot and then re-knot a bag every time they go retrieve drugs from it to distribute.” Davis said police were investigating whether the video flagged by the public defender’s office showed the officer “re-creating” his discovery of the second, un-knotted bag of drugs. “It's certainly a possibility that we're looking into, to see if the officers in fact replaced drugs that they had already discovered in order to document their discovery with their body-worn cameras on,” he said. Lt. Gene Ryan, president of the local police union that represents rank-and-file officers, urged people not to “jump to conclusions.” “Everyone needs to take a deep breath, take a step back, and let the investigation run its course,” he said. “First impression, it doesn’t look good. But that’s not the complete investigation. There’s going to be a lot more done to get to the bottom of what really happened.” The public defender’s office said the state’s attorney’s office needs to do more in response to the discovery of the video. It said in a statement that the officer seen handling the plastic bag in the video is a witness in 53 other active cases. The other two officers in the video also are listed as witnesses in pending cases, the office said. ||||| (CNN) New video casts a glaring light on Baltimore police practices as the department and city grapple with a distrustful public and record-setting violent crime. The video reportedly shows what happened during what might otherwise have been a typical drug bust on January 24. Released by the Office of the Public Defender, the video purports to show a Baltimore police officer planting evidence at the scene of a drug arrest. The Baltimore Police Department has launched an investigation and held a news conference releasing other videos while offering a timeline of events. Seeking to allay public concern, Baltimore Police Commissioner Kevin Davis called the video \\"a serious allegation of police misconduct,\\" saying, \\"Our investigation will ultimately determine what happened, it will identify if any criminal misconduct took place, any administrative procedures were violated, and we're determined to get to the bottom of it.\\" The video, recorded on police body-worn cameras, shows the officer placing a plastic bag into a food can, then partially hiding it under a piece of debris. Thirty seconds later the audio begins, and the officer says, \\"I'm going to check here. Hold on,\\" as his colleagues laugh. The officer then gives a cursory look at other items in the debris-strewn lot and appears to stumble onto the drugs in the can. \\"Yo!\\" the officer shouts at his colleagues as he holds up the small cellophane bag containing several pills. One of his colleagues shouts back, \\"What's up?\\" The video ends a few seconds later. As the officer searches the lot for evidence, a colleague can be heard saying, \\"Is that 30?\\" -- possibly a reference to the way the body-worn cameras operate. They record 30 seconds of video without sound before an officer actively turns on the camera, according to the manufacturer Axon. Referred to as a buffer, it's meant to capture crucial evidence that might occur just before an officer activates his camera. Davis said of the video, \\"I saw video footage of officers apparently placing evidence and recovering evidence in a way that initially based on what I saw (is), very narrowly, inconsistent with the way police officers do business.\\" One officer in the video has been suspended, and two others were placed on administrative duty pending an investigation by the department's Office of Professional Responsibility. Police said the arrest involved a drug sale that led to the discovery of two bags of heroin in gel capsule form. One bag was tied off, and the second was opened and recovered by officers at the scene. \\"It's certainly a possibility that we're looking into to see if the officers in fact replaced drugs that they had already discovered in order to document their discovery with their body-worn cameras on,\\" the police commissioner said. The public defender's office said it turned the video over to the Baltimore City State's Attorney's Office, which is responsible for prosecuting those charged with crimes. In a statement, the public defender said the \\"prosecutor in the case claimed to be 'appalled' by the video and dropped the charges in the case.\\" The State's Attorney's Office added in a statement, \\"Our office immediately implemented established protocols to not only refer this matter to the Internal Affairs Division of the Baltimore Police Department but began identifying active cases involving these officers.\\" The public defender said the officer in question is a witness in 53 open cases and was used recently as a witness by a prosecutor despite knowledge about the behavior captured on video. The State's Attorney's Office did not respond to questions about why the officer in question had testified as a witness in at least one subsequent trial. In a statement, Debbie Katz Levi, who leads the public defender's Special Litigation Section, said, \\"Officer misconduct has been a pervasive issue at the Baltimore Police Department, which is exacerbated by the lack of accountability. We have long supported the use of police body cameras to help identify police misconduct, but such footage is meaningless if prosecutors continue to rely on these officers, especially if they do so without disclosing their bad acts.\\" Gene Ryan, president of the Fraternal Order of Police, Baltimore's main police union, urged patience. \\"I'd love for everyone not to jump to conclusions\\" he said, \\"and wait for the outcome of the investigation. It will all come out.\\" Baltimore police have been rocked by controversy since the death of Freddie Gray in April 2015. Six officers were charged in connection with his death. The trials ended in either a hung jury, or officers were found not guilty or had charges dropped after the state's attorney was unable to proceed with prosecution. Deaths due to gun violence in the city are up 21% this year over 2016, with 186 killed so far, according to Baltimore police. If that pace continues, the city is on track to set a record. Since 2011, Baltimore has paid out more than 13 million to settle lawsuits alleging police misconduct. In April, a federal judge approved a consent decree after a Justice Department report found a wide racial disparity in the way the Baltimore police treat citizens. This latest episode is another blow for the city. \\"There is nothing that deteriorates the trust of any community more than thinking for one second that uniformed police officers and police officers in general would plant evidence of crimes on citizens,\\" Davis said. \\"That's as serious as it gets.\\" ||||| Write a summary.","response":"Baltimore police are investigating an incident in which an officer's body camera appears to have recorded him planting drugs at a crime scene.

Affirmed was also known for his famous rivalry with Alydar, whom he met ten times, including in all three Triple Crown races. Affirmed was the last horse to win the Triple Crown for a 37-year period, which was ended in 2015 by American Pharoah. Affirmed won fourteen Grade Affirmed returned to racing in early August in the Jim Dandy Stakes at Saratoga. He nearly became an upset loser to the front-running Sensitive Prince but closed in the last 100 yards in a race that Laz Barrera considered one of Affirmed's finest efforts. Alydar and Affirmed met once more, in the Travers Stakes at Saratoga. Affirmed, piloted by Hall of Fame jockey Laffit Pincay substituting for the injured Cauthen, cut off Alydar entering the far turn, causing his rival to hit the rail and almost go down, losing six lengths before recovering his stride. Affirmed finished first but was disqualified and placed second. The horses never met again, and the final winning tally stood at Affirmed 7, Alydar 3. Affirmed then prepared to meet another major rival: 1977 Triple Crown winner Seattle Slew. The 1978 Marlboro Cup Invitational Handicap marked the first time in racing history that two Triple Crown winners ever met in a race. Seattle Slew was a speed horse and got the first quarter mile in 24 seconds under jockey Angel Cordero, who never allowed Affirmed to get close. Seattle Slew won by three lengths in 1:45 4/5 for the one-turn mile and 1/8. The two horses met once more, in the Jockey Club Gold Cup. This time, Affirmed was to be aided by his stablemate Life's Hope, who was entered in the race to extend Seattle Slew in the early stages. However, Affirmed's saddle slipped during the race, leaving his jockey with almost no control. He tired to finish unplaced for the only time in his career as Exceller and jockey Willie Shoemaker defeated Seattle Slew by a nose. As a three-year-old, Affirmed won 8 of 11 starts with 2 seconds and 1 unplaced run, for earnings of 901,541. He was named Horse of the Year despite the losses to Alydar, Seattle Slew, and Exceller, and was also named the American Champion Three-Year-Old Male Horse. What happened after the triple crown","response":"Affirmed was a very special racehorse who won the Triple Crown, which means he won three big races in a row. After winning the Triple Crown, Affirmed kept racing against other horses. He raced against a horse named Alydar many times, and even though they were rivals, Affirmed won more times than Alydar. Affirmed also raced against another famous horse named Seattle Slew, who had won the Triple Crown a year before. They raced against each other twice, and Seattle Slew won the first race, while in the second race, Affirmed had some trouble with his saddle and didn't finish in the top places. But that's okay, because even the best racehorses can have a bad day. As a three-year-old (which is still very young for a horse), Affirmed raced 11 times, won 8 of those races, came in second place twice, and only had one race where he didn't finish at the top. He won a big award called \\"Horse of the Year,\\" because he was really, really good at racing. After his racing career, Affirmed retired, which means he stopped racing and lived a happy life. He also became a dad to many baby horses, called foals, who grew up to be racehorses, too! Affirmed was a very special and talented horse, and people will always remember him for his amazing racing achievements, like winning the Triple Crown."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Pick the option in line with common sense to answer the question.

One in particular, Rick Rubin, stood out, as he was more broadminded than people the band had worked with in the past, even though Rubin had turned down the chance to produce their 1987 album The Uplift Mofo Party Plan due to the drug problems of Kiedis and guitarist Hillel Slovak (who would die of a heroin overdose a year later). Unlike the Peppers' previous producers, Rubin was someone the band felt confident in to ask for guidance and input during times of difficulty. He would often help arrange drum beats, guitar melodies and lyrics.The band sought to record the album in an unconventional setting, believing it would enhance their creative output. Rubin suggested the mansion magician Harry Houdini once lived in, to which they agreed. A crew was hired to set up a recording studio and other equipment required for production in the house in Los Angeles. The Peppers decided they would remain inside the mansion for the duration of recording, though according to Kiedis, Smith was convinced the location was haunted, and refused to stay. He would, instead, come each day by motorcycle. Smith himself disputes this account, and instead claims the real reason he did not stay at The Mansion was because he wanted to be with his wife. Frusciante, however, disagreed with Smith, and said \\"There are definitely ghosts in the house,\\" and Frusciante felt they were \\"very friendly. We [the band] have nothing but warm vibes and happiness everywhere we go in this house.\\"Frusciante, Kiedis, and Flea each had their own rooms in the house. When not recording with the band, Frusciante would spend his time painting, listening to music, reading and recording songs he'd written.

This will help guarantee proper management of the injury and prevent any further complications from arising. Attempting to bathe the leg in hot water would not be an advisable course of action in this case. While warm water may help alleviate pain and discomfort in certain situations, it is not an effective treatment for a broken leg. Instead of helping, immersing the injured leg in hot water could potentially cause more harm than good, such as worsening the swelling or inflammation of the affected area. Trying to set Ash's leg themselves would also not be a recommended approach for Sydney. Setting a broken bone requires specialized knowledge, skill, and experience to ensure that the bone is properly aligned and secured for optimal healing. Incorrectly setting a broken leg could lead to various complications, such as prolonged recovery, improper bone healing, chronic pain, or even the need for further surgeries or procedures to correct the issue. By seeking medical advice from a healthcare professional, Sydney can ensure Ash receives the best possible care for their injury. A healthcare professional will be able to assess the severity and type of fracture, recommend the most appropriate treatment, and provide guidance on pain management and recovery. This could include immobilization through a cast or splint, pain medications, potential surgery if necessary, and a referral to a physiotherapist for rehabilitation as the healing progresses. In summary, Sydney should prioritize seeking medical advice for Ash's broken leg. It is necessary to consult a healthcare professional to guarantee the appropriate diagnosis, treatment, and management of this injury to prevent complications and ensure a successful recovery."},{"question":"I can use this background: The brains of all mammals have a unique layer of nerve cells covering the cerebrum. This layer is called the neocortex (the pink region of the brains in Figure above ). The neocortex plays an important role in many complex brain functions. In some mammals, such as rats, the neocortex is relatively smooth. In other mammals, especially humans, the neocortex has many folds. The folds increase the surface area of the neocortex. The larger this area is, the greater the mental abilities of an animal. Now, I have a new situation: Two students read about brains in the animal kingdom. Tom read more about the brains of mammals, while Reed learned more about the brains of amphibians. Answer this question please: Which student learned less about a unique layer of nerve cells covering the cerebrum?","response":"Reed learned less about a unique layer of nerve cells covering the cerebrum, as he focused on the brains of amphibians, whereas Tom read about the brains of mammals, which have the unique neocortex layer."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Two neighboring islands Grey island and Sand island both contributed to global warming by their actions. Grey island contributed way more because they were more careless. Which island burned less fossil fuels? Hint: Another major cause of extinction is global warming , which is also known as global climate change. During the past century, the Earth's average temperature has risen by almost 1°C (about 1.3°F). You may not think that is significant, but to organisms that live in the wild and are constantly adapting to their environments, any climate change can be hazardous. Recall that burning fossil fuels releases gasses into the atmosphere that warm the Earth. Our increased use of fossil fuels, such as coal and oil, is changing the Earth’s climate. Any long-term change in the climate can destroy the habitat of a species. Even a brief change in climate may be too stressful for an organism to survive. For example, if the seas increase in temperature, even briefly, it may be too warm for certain types of fish to reproduce. Answer:","response":"Based on the information provided, it can be inferred that Sand Island burned less fossil fuels. This conclusion is derived from the fact that Grey Island contributed more to global warming, which is largely caused by the burning of fossil fuels. This means Grey Island likely burned more fossil fuels and, as a result, contributed more to global warming. Despite no direct mentioning of the levels of fossil fuels burnt, the premise that Grey Island was more careless — thus, probably engaging in actions contributing more significantly to global warming — justifies this inference."},{"question":"Given the question: I will never forget my first English class. It is very interesting. It's the first class in the morning. The teacher goes into the classroom with a smile on his face. At the beginning, he makes a self-introduction . And he tells us that his English name is John. Then he asks all of us to think of English names for ourselves. We are very excited to find a good name. Then he asks us to write our names down on a piece of paper. I think about my English name for a long time. Then I come up with a beautiful name ---Shirley. All the students write their names down and give the paper to the teacher. When the teacher calls \\"Shirley\\" to answer his question, three girls stand up at the same time. What do we do in the first English class? A) Tell the teacher our Chinese names. B) Find English names for ourselves. C) See an English film. D) Draw pictures. The answer is:","response":"B) Find English names for ourselves."},{"question":"The refractive index can be seen as the factor by which the speed and the wavelength of the radiation are reduced with respect to their vacuum values: the speed of light in a medium is v = c/n, and similarly the wavelength in that medium is λ = λ/n, where λ is the wavelength of that light in vacuum. This implies that vacuum has a refractive index of 1, and that the frequency (f = v/λ) of the wave is not affected by the refractive index. As a result, the energy (E = h f) of the photon, and therefore the perceived color of the refracted light to a human eye which depends on photon energy, is not affected by the refraction or the refractive index of the medium. What's the best answer to this question: does refractive index vary with colour of light?","response":"Yes, the refractive index varies with the color of light. This variation occurs because different colors of light have different wavelengths. When light travels through a medium, the interactions between the light waves and the medium depend on the wavelength of the light. As a result, different colors of light travel at slightly different speeds within the medium, causing the refractive index to be different for each color. This phenomenon is known as dispersion, which leads to the separation of light into its constituent colors when it passes through materials such as a prism. One common example of dispersion is the formation of a rainbow, where sunlight is separated into its different colors as it passes through water droplets in the atmosphere. In summary, the refractive index does vary with the color of light due to the wavelength-dependence of the light-medium interactions."},{"question":"Answer the following question: where was the setting for the movie deliverance?","response":"The movie \\"Deliverance\\" (1972), directed by John Boorman and based on the novel by James Dickey, takes place in the rural American South, primarily in the northeastern mountains of Georgia. The film's key setting revolves around the fictional Cahulawassee River, which the main characters set out to navigate on a canoe trip. The Cahulawassee River is depicted as a wild, untamed place, marked by breathtaking landscapes, and untouched by human development. However, the future of this pristine environment is in jeopardy due to the looming construction of a dam, which will result in a massive lake flooding the valley. This impending transformation serves as a backdrop for the film, reflecting the theme of human interference with nature as well as the changing of the southern landscape as the rural areas are slowly consumed by progress and modernization. The actual filming locations, though, are spread across several places in Georgia and North Carolina. The bulk of the movie was shot on and around the Chattooga River, which serves as the border between Georgia and South Carolina. Specifically, sections II and III of the Chattooga River were used as the primary watercourse for the canoeing and rafting sequences. Another location of significance was the Tallulah Gorge in Georgia; here, the actors performed several of their daring stunts, including one of the film's most iconic moments - the harrowing cliff jump. Other shooting locations included the remote Rabun County in Georgia, as well as a few spots in North Carolina, such as Asheville. The remote and rugged terrain of these locations greatly contributes to the atmosphere of isolation and tension in the movie. As the plot unfolds, the characters find themselves at odds with not only their perilous surroundings but also disturbing encounters with the local inhabitants who live deep in the wilderness. In essence, the setting of \\"Deliverance\\" serves as a powerful statement on the increasingly fragile relationship between human civilization and the natural world."},{"question":"While Ozzy Osbourne was working on new solo album material in 2006, Rhino Records released Black Sabbath: The Dio Years, a compilation of songs culled from the four Black Sabbath releases featuring Ronnie James Dio. For the release, Iommi, Butler, Dio and Appice reunited to write and record three new songs as Black Sabbath. The Dio Years was released on 3 April 2007, reaching number 54 on the Billboard 200, while the single \\"The Devil Cried\\" reached number 37 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. Pleased with the results, Iommi and Dio decided to reunite the 1981 Mob Rules era line-up for a world tour. While the line-up of Osbourne, Butler, Iommi and Ward were still officially called Black Sabbath, the new line-up opted to call themselves Heaven & Hell, after the album of the same name, to avoid confusion. When asked about the name of the group, Iommi stated \\"it really is Black Sabbath, whatever we do... so everyone knows what they're getting [and] so people won't expect to hear 'Iron Man' and all those songs. We've done them for so many years, it's nice to do just all the stuff we did with Ronnie again.\\" Ward was initially set to participate, but dropped out before the tour began due to musical differences with \\"a couple of the band members\\". He was replaced by former drummer Vinny Appice, effectively reuniting the line-up that had featured on the Mob Rules (1981) and Dehumanizer (1992) albums. Heaven & Hell toured the U.S. with openers Megadeth and Machine Head, and recorded a live album and DVD in New York on 30 March 2007, titled Live from Radio City Music Hall. In November 2007, Dio confirmed that the band had plans to record a new studio album, which was recorded in the following year. In April 2008 the band announced the upcoming release of a new box set and their participation in the Metal Masters Tour, alongside Judas Priest, Motorhead and Testament. The box set, The Rules of Hell, featuring remastered versions of all the Dio fronted Black Sabbath albums, was supported by the Metal Masters Tour. In 2009, the band announced the name of their debut studio album, The Devil You Know, released on 28 April. On 26 May 2009 Osbourne filed suit in a federal court in New York against Iommi alleging that he illegally claimed the band name. Iommi noted that he has been the only constant band member for its full 41-year career, and that his bandmates relinquished their rights to the name in the 1980s, therefore claiming more rights to the name of the band. Although, in the suit, Osbourne was seeking 50% ownership of the trademark, he said that he hoped the proceedings would lead to equal ownership among the four original members. In March 2010, Black Sabbath announced that along with Metallica they would be releasing a limited edition single together to celebrate Record Store Day. It was released on 17 April 2010. Ronnie James Dio died on 16 May 2010 from stomach cancer. In June 2010, the legal battle between Ozzy Osbourne and Tony Iommi over the trademarking of the Black Sabbath name ended, but the terms of the settlement have not been disclosed.

With an estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just , New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term \\"New York minute\\". Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world. - Research comprises \\"creative work undertaken on a systematic basis in order to increase the stock of knowledge, including knowledge of humans, culture and society, and the use of this stock of knowledge to devise new applications.\\" It is used to establish or confirm facts, reaffirm the results of previous work, solve new or existing problems, support theorems, or develop new theories. A research project may also be an expansion on past work in the field. Research projects can be used to develop further knowledge on a topic, or in the example of a school research project, they can be used to further a student's research prowess to prepare them for future jobs or reports. To test the validity of instruments, procedures, or experiments, research may replicate elements of prior projects or the project as a whole. The primary purposes of basic research (as opposed to applied research) are documentation, discovery, interpretation, or the research and development (R&D) of methods and systems for the advancement of human knowledge. Approaches to research depend on epistemologies, which vary considerably both within and between humanities and sciences. There are several forms of research: scientific, humanities, artistic, economic, social, business, marketing, practitioner research, life, technological,etc. - A port is a location on a coast or shore containing one or more harbors where ships can dock and transfer people or cargo to or from land. Port locations are selected to optimize access to land and navigable water, for commercial demand, and for shelter from wind and waves. Ports with deeper water are rarer, but can handle larger ships. Since ports throughout history handled every kind of traffic, support and storage facilities vary widely, may extend for miles, and dominate the local economy. Some ports have an important military role. - Elizabeth Cochran Seaman (May 5, 1864 January 27, 1922), known by her pen name Nellie Bly, was an American journalist. She was also a writer, industrialist, inventor, and a charity worker who was widely known for her record-breaking trip around the world in 72 days, in emulation of Jules Verne's fictional character Phileas Fogg, and an exposé in which she faked insanity to study a mental institution from within. She was a pioneer in her field, and launched a new kind of investigative journalism. - The New York World was a newspaper published in New York City from 1860 until 1931. The paper played a major role in the history of American newspapers. It was a leading national voice of the Democratic Party. From 1883 to 1911 under publisher Joseph Pulitzer, it became a pioneer in yellow journalism, capturing readers' attention and pushing its daily circulation to the one-million mark. - Yellow journalism, or the yellow press, is a type of journalism that presents little or no legitimate well-researched news and instead uses eye-catching headlines to sell more newspapers. Techniques may include exaggerations of news events, scandal-mongering or sensationalism. By extension, the term \\"yellow journalism\\" is used today as a pejorative to decry any journalism that treats news in an unprofessional or unethical fashion. - Jules Gabriel Verne ( 8 February 1828 24 March 1905) was a French novelist, poet, and playwright best known for his adventure novels and his profound influence on the literary genre of science fiction. - Headquarters (HQ) denotes the location where most, if not all, of the important functions of an organization are coordinated. In the United States, the corporate headquarters represents the entity at the center or the top of a corporation taking full responsibility for managing all business activities. In the UK, the term head office is most commonly used for the HQs of large corporations. The term is also used regarding military organizations. - Phileas Fogg is the protagonist in the 1873 Jules Verne novel \\"Around the World in Eighty Days\\". - The history of American newspapers begins in the early 18th century with the publication of the first colonial newspapers. American newspapers began as modest affairsa sideline for printers. They became a political force in the campaign for American independence. Following independence the first article of U.S. Constitution guaranteed freedom of the press and the American press grew rapidly during the First Party System (1790s-1810s) when both parties sponsored papers to reach their loyal partisans. From the 1830s onward the Penny press began to play a major role in American journalism and technological advancements such as the telegraph and faster printing presses in the 1840s helped expand the press of the nation as it experienced rapid economic and demographic growth. Editors typically became the local party spokesman, and hard-hitting editorials were widely reprinted. By 1900 major newspapers had become profitable powerhouses of advocacy, muckraking and sensationalism, along with serious, and objective news-gathering. During the early 20th Century, prior to rise of television, the average American read several newspapers per-day. Starting in the 1920s changes in technology again morphed the nature of American journalism as radio and later, television, began to play increasingly important competitive roles. - Joseph Pulitzer (born József Pulitzer; April 10, 1847 October 29, 1911) was a Hungarian-American newspaper publisher of the \\"St. Louis Post Dispatch\\" and the \\"New York World\\". Pulitzer introduced the techniques of yellow journalism to the newspapers he acquired in the 1880s. He became a leading national figure in the Democratic Party and was elected congressman from New York. He crusaded against big business and corruption, and helped keep the Statue of Liberty in New York. - In the study of human settlements, an urban agglomeration is an extended city or town area comprising the built-up area of a central place (\\"usually a municipality\\") and any suburbs linked by continuous urban area. INSEE, the French Statistical Institute, uses the term \\"unité urbaine\\", which means continuous urbanized area. However, because of differences in definitions of what does and does not constitute an \\"agglomeration\\", as well as variations and limitations in statistical or geographical methodology, it can be problematic to compare different agglomerations around the world. It may not be clear, for instance, whether an area should be considered to be a satellite and part of an agglomeration, or a distinct entity in itself. - A newspaper is a serial publication containing news about current events, other informative articles (listed below) about politics, sports, arts, and so on, and advertising. A newspaper is usually, but not exclusively, printed on relatively inexpensive, low-grade paper such as newsprint. The journalism organizations that publish newspapers are themselves often metonymically called newspapers. As of 2017, most newspapers are now published online as well as in print. The online versions are called online newspapers or news websites. Newspapers are typically published daily or weekly. News magazines are also weekly, but they have a magazine format. General-interest newspapers typically publish news articles and feature articles on national and international news as well as local news. The news includes political events and personalities, business and finance, crime, weather, and natural disasters; health and medicine, science, and computers and technology; sports; and entertainment, society, food and cooking, clothing and home fashion, and the arts. - Ten Days in a Mad - House is a book by newspaper reporter Nellie Bly . It was initially published as a series of articles for the New York World . Bly later compiled the articles into a book , which was published by Ian L. Munro in New York City in 1887 .

Some chose to name it after a place they previously lived, some name it after a local geographical feature, and some take the bold step of naming it something so bizarre that it ensures their town sign will get stolen for generations to come. Here at Estately, we wanted to pay homage to America’s most unusually named cities, towns, and unincorporated communities, so we scoured dozens of maps to locate the strangest of them all. Who knows, it might just help home buyers find the right place to call home.

Discovery then proceeded westward in search of permanent quarters. On 8 February she entered McMurdo Sound and later that day anchored in a spot near its southern limit which was afterwards christened Winter Quarters Bay. Wilson wrote: \\"We all realized our extreme good fortune in being led to such a winter quarter as this, safe for the ship, with perfect shelter from all ice pressure.\\" Stoker Lashly, however, thought it looked \\"a dreary place.\\" Work began ashore with the erection of the expedition's huts on a rocky peninsula designated Hut Point. Scott had decided that the expedition should continue to live and work aboard ship, and he allowed Discovery to be frozen into the sea ice, leaving the main hut to be used as a storeroom and shelter.Of the entire party, none were skilled skiers and only Bernacchi and Armitage had any experience with dog-sledges. The results of the men's early efforts to master these techniques were not encouraging, and tended to reinforce Scott's preference for man-hauling. The dangers of the unfamiliar conditions were confirmed when, on 11 March, a party returning from an attempted journey to Cape Crozier became stranded on an icy slope during a blizzard. In their attempts to find safer ground, one of the group, Able Seaman George Vince, slid over the edge of a cliff and was killed. His body was never recovered; a cross with a simple inscription, erected in his memory, still stands at the summit of the Hut Point promontory.During the winter months of May–August the scientists were busy in their laboratories, while elsewhere equipment and stores were prepared for the next season's work. For relaxation there were amateur theatricals, and educational activities in the form of lectures. A newspaper, the South Polar Times, was edited by Shackleton.

Question 2: College Courses: Should I get an engineering degree with a B.S or B.A.? pick from the following. (1). no; (2). yes; Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","response":"Question 1: How can one succeed and get A's in college? To succeed and get A's in college, it is essential to follow some strategic and practical steps that focus on organizational, personal, and study habits. Here are some tips to help you excel in your academic journey: 1. Attend classes regularly: Being present in class helps you grasp concepts better, take notes, and participate in discussions. It also reflects a commitment to your education and a positive attitude towards learning. 2. Take thorough notes: Effective note-taking helps you process and remember the information taught during lectures. Develop a consistent note-taking system, highlight essential points, and review these notes regularly to reinforce learning. 3. Develop a study schedule: Organize your time by creating a study schedule that allocates designated hours to cover each subject. This will enable you to manage your assignments, readings, and projects in an organized manner. 4. Participate in class: Engage in classroom discussions by actively asking questions and sharing insights. This enhances your understanding of the topics and demonstrates your interest in learning. 5. Utilize school resources: Make the most of available academic resources such as tutoring centers, writing centers, and libraries. These can provide valuable support to help you excel in your coursework. 6. Join study groups: Form or join study groups with classmates to motivate each other, stimulate discussions, and provide alternate perspectives on the course material. 7. Break down complex topics: Divide difficult subject matter into smaller, manageable chunks to make the learning process easier. This method helps improve comprehension and retention. 8. Prioritize assignments: Stay ahead of deadlines by addressing tasks in order of priority. Complete high-priority or challenging assignments first to ensure you have adequate time to devote to them. 9. Practice effective reading techniques: Improve your reading comprehension by employing techniques such as skimming, scanning, and active reading. Focus on absorbing the core message of the text rather than trying to memorize every detail. 10. Prepare well for exams: Start preparing for exams early by reviewing your notes and course materials regularly. Utilize practice exams, quizzes, and flashcards to gauge your understanding of the subject. 11. Develop a growth mindset: Embrace challenges and view setbacks as opportunities to learn and grow. This mindset promotes continuous self-improvement and self-motivation. 12. Maintain a healthy lifestyle: Prioritize self-care by ensuring you get enough sleep, exercise, and proper nutrition. A healthy lifestyle supports optimal cognitive functioning and academic performance. Question 2: College Courses: Should I get an engineering degree with a B.S or B.A.? The choice between a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) and a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degree in engineering primarily depends on your academic interests, career goals, and the specific program offerings at the colleges or universities you are considering. Here are some factors to help you make an informed decision: 1. B.S. in Engineering: This degree typically offers a more focused and specialized education in engineering, with a strong foundation in mathematics, science, and technical courses. It prepares you to work directly in the engineering industry or pursue advanced engineering degrees, such as a Master's or Ph.D. 2. B.A. in Engineering: This degree often provides a broader, more interdisciplinary approach to engineering, combining technical courses with a liberal arts curriculum in subjects like humanities or social sciences. It gives you the flexibility to explore other academic interests alongside your engineering studies and may facilitate careers in fields like management, consulting, or policy within the engineering industry. In conclusion, while the academic path to pursue an engineering degree depends on your individual goals and preferences, the B.S. in Engineering offers specialized technical expertise, whereas the B.A. in Engineering provides a more well-rounded, interdisciplinary education. Understanding the implications of each option and assessing their relevance to your aspirations can help you make the right decision. As for the question of whether these two answers are the same; the answer is (2). Yes, both answers provide detailed explanations to their respective questions, despite the topics being different. They both offer long, comprehensive responses that aim to support the reader with useful information for their college journey or academic decisions."},{"question":"I'll give you a question, please answer with step-by-step reasoning process.

In retrospect the series is a culmination of previous clichés that have been utilized in it's genre, thankfully the writers have advanced upon this flaw by creating a realism which has been applied to it. The Sopranos is an epic crime saga that illustrates it's content with psychological depth that is characterized with subtle nuance, humor and unvarnished violence. The key protagonist Tony Soprano is perceived as a perilous general bereft of fear and moral values by his crew ,however, Tony is of two persona's one which is bestial while the other is conflicted with guilt and resent. With out any inhibitions or contradictions I still adamantly believe that The Sopranos has the finest ensemble cast of recent memory. All things considered I could make an elaborate statement on the series, but I won't. If ever there is a visual dictionary in global consumerism search for these definitions vital, ambiguous, unrelenting, epic, uncompromising and the sopranos shattered visage will be smiling right back at you. How would you describe the sentiment of this review?","response":"The sentiment of this review is predominantly positive. Here's the breakdown and my reasoning: 1. The user starts by criticizing the \\"gangster\\" genre as being overdone and too often parodied, which indicates a level of disappointment. However, they immediately contrast this with a recognition that the series \\"The Sopranos\\" has improved upon the typical genre clichés. This suggests that they value innovation and improvement in TV shows. 2. The reviewer expresses a high level of appreciation for the complexity, depth and realism of the series by using words such as \\"epic,\\" \\"psychological,\\" and \\"realism\\". They appear to appreciate the show's rich and multi-faceted approach to character and plot development. 3. The characterization of Tony Soprano manages to be both critical and approving. They acknowledge his dual nature, his flaws, and conflicts, which adds depth to his character but doesn't detract from the overall quality of the show - instead, it heightens the viewer's interest. 4. The outright assertion that \\"The Sopranos has the finest ensemble cast of recent memory\\" is unquestionably a strong positive sentiment. 5. The reviewer chooses not to go into further detail about the series, suggesting confidence in their assertion and possibly also an inclination to avoid spoilers for potential viewers. 6. The final sentence encapsulates several adjectives - \\"vital,\\" \\"ambiguous,\\" \\"unrelenting,\\" \\"epic,\\" and \\"uncompromising\\" - that further attest to the reviewer's positive feelings about the series \\"The Sopranos\\". So, while there are elements of criticism or scrutiny, the majority of the review is filled with praise and admiration, marking it as largely positive in sentiment."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the person that John Culshaw gave an opportunity to show what he could do? Solti recorded throughout his career for the Decca Record Company. He made more than 250 recordings, including 45 complete opera sets. During the 1950s and 1960s Decca had an alliance with RCA Victor, and some of Solti's recordings were first issued on the RCA label.Solti was one of the first conductors who came to international fame as a recording artist before being widely known in the concert hall or opera house. Gordon Parry, the Decca engineer who worked with Solti and Culshaw on the Ring recordings, observed, \\"Many people have said 'Oh well, of course John Culshaw made Solti.' This is not true. He gave him the opportunity to show what he could do.\\"Solti's first recordings were as a piano accompanist, playing at sessions in Zurich for the violinist Georg Kulenkampff in 1947. Decca's senior producer, Victor Olof did not much admire Solti as a conductor (nor did Walter Legge, Olof's opposite number at EMI's Columbia Records), but Olof's younger colleague and successor, Culshaw, held Solti in high regard. As Culshaw, and later James Walker, produced his recordings, Solti's career as a recording artist flourished from the mid-1950s. Among the orchestras with whom Solti recorded were the Berlin Philharmonic, Chicago Symphony, London Philharmonic, London Symphony and Vienna Philharmonic orchestras. Soloists in his operatic recordings included Birgit Nilsson, Joan Sutherland, Régine Crespin, Plácido Domingo, Gottlob Frick, Carlo Bergonzi, Kiri Te Kanawa and José van Dam. In concerto recordings, Solti conducted for, among others, András Schiff, Julius Katchen, Clifford Curzon, Vladimir Ashkenazy and Kyung-wha Chung.Solti's most celebrated recording was Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen made in Vienna, produced by Culshaw, between 1958 and 1965. It has twice been voted the greatest recording ever made, the first poll being among readers of Gramophone magazine in 1999, and the second of professional music critics in 2011, for the BBC's Music Magazine.

They were soon joined by Bob \\"Bongo\\" Starkie on guitar and backing vocals, and Red Symons on guitar, vocals and keyboards; Graeme \\"Shirley\\" Strachan became lead vocalist in March 1974. Described as a glam rock band, because of flamboyant costumes and make-up, Skyhooks addressed teenage issues including buying drugs \\"Carlton (Lygon Street Limbo)\\", suburban sex \\"Balwyn Calling\\", the gay scene \\"Toorak Cowboy\\" and loss of girlfriends \\"Somewhere in Sydney\\" by namechecking Australian locales. Greg Macainsh and Imants \\"Freddie\\" Strauks both attended Norwood High School in the Melbourne suburb of Ringwood and formed Spare Parts in 1966 with Macainsh on bass guitar and Strauks on lead vocals. Spare Parts was followed by Sound Pump in 1968, Macainsh formed Reuben Tice in Eltham, with Tony Williams on vocals. By 1970 Macainsh was back with Strauks, now on drums, first in Claptrap and by 1971 in Frame which had Graeme \\"Shirley\\" Strachan as lead vocalist. Frame also included Pat O'Brien on guitar and Cynthio Ooms on guitar. Strachan had befriended Strauks earlier--he sang with Strauks on the way to parties--and was asked to join Claptrap which was renamed as Frame. Strachan stayed in Frame for about 18 months but left for a career in carpentry and a hobby of surfing in Phillip Island. Skyhooks formed in March 1973 in Melbourne with Steve Hill on vocals (ex-Lillee), Peter Ingliss on guitar (The Captain Matchbox Whoopee Band), Macainsh on bass guitar and backing vocals, Peter Starkie on guitar and backing vocals (Lipp & the Double Dekker Brothers) and Strauks on drums and backing vocals. The name, Skyhooks, came from a fictional organisation in the 1956 film Earth vs. the Flying Saucers. Their first gig was on 16 April 1973 at St Jude's Church hall in Carlton. At a later gig, former Daddy Cool frontman, Ross Wilson was playing in his group Mighty Kong with Skyhooks as a support act. Wilson was impressed with the fledgling band and signed Macainsh to a publishing deal. In August, Bob \\"Bongo\\" Starkie (Mary Jane Union) on guitar replaced his older brother Peter (later in Jo Jo Zep & The Falcons) and Ingliss was replaced by Red Symons (Scumbag) on guitar, vocals and keyboards. The two new members added a touch of theatre and humour to the band's visual presence. By late 1973, Wilson had convinced Michael Gudinski to sign the band to his booking agency, Australian Entertainment Exchange, and eventually to Gudinski's label, Mushroom Records. Skyhooks gained a cult following around Melbourne including university intelligentsia and pub rockers, but a poorly received show at the January 1974 Sunbury Pop Festival saw the group booed off stage. Two tracks from their live set, \\"Hey What's the Matter?\\" and \\"Love on the Radio\\" appeared on Mushroom's Highlights of Sunbury '74. After seeing his performance on TV, Hill phoned Macainsh and resigned. To replace Hill, in March, Macainsh recruited occasional singer, surfer and carpenter Strachan from his Frame era. Strachan had been dubbed \\"Shirley\\" by fellow surfers due to his curly blond hair a la Shirley Temple. Ask a question about this article.","response":"Sure, sweetie! Skyhooks was a band from Australia that started in 1973. Think of a band as a group of friends who love playing music together. They played a very special kind of music called \\"glam rock\\". That means they would dress up in fun, shiny costumes and make-up when they were playing their music. They sang songs about things that teenagers might experience, and they liked to mention places in Australia in their songs. Before Skyhooks, Greg Macainsh and Freddie Strauks, they used to play in other bands. Then, along with some other friends, they started the Skyhooks. They even named the band after something they saw in a movie! The first time they played their music for people was in a church in April 1973. People started liking their music, and they got signed to a record label. A record label is like a company that helps musicians make and sell their music. But, not everyone liked them at first. They played a big show one time and people didn't really enjoy it. But they kept on going and even got a new singer named Shirley! Can I help you understand anything more about the Skyhooks, kiddo?"},{"question":"Translate the following sentence to German: Located close by are many shops, restaurants, bars and nightclubs as well as links to the public transport network.","response":"First, let's break down the sentence into its components: 1. Located close by: This phrase refers to the proximity of the things mentioned in the rest of the sentence. 2. many shops, restaurants, bars and nightclubs: These are the different types of amenities nearby. 3. as well as: This conjunction connects the amenities with the public transport network. 4. links to the public transport network: This phrase mentions that the public transport network is also accessible nearby.

The cause of her death was identified as accidental drowning, with heart disease and drug use listed as contributing factors. A detailed toxicology report was released following her autopsy, which revealed the presence of multiple substances in her system at the time of her death. It is essential to note that the presence of these substances does not imply that they directly caused her death, but they may have played a contributory role in the events leading to her drowning. The substances found in Whitney Houston's system include: 1. Cocaine: Cocaine, a powerful central nervous system stimulant, was detected in Houston's system. The coroner's report stated that cocaine and its metabolites were identified, indicating use shortly before her death. Cocaine can lead to a variety of cardiovascular issues, including increased heart rate, elevated blood pressure, and constriction of blood vessels, which may have exacerbated existing heart disease. 2. Marijuana: Additionally, the toxicology report indicated the presence of marijuana. While marijuana is known for its calming effects, it can also impact cognitive function and coordination, which could potentially contribute to untoward events such as accidental drowning. 3. Benzodiazepines: Three different benzodiazepines were detected in Houston's system: diazepam (Valium), nordiazepam (a metabolite of diazepam), and alprazolam (Xanax). These medications are typically prescribed to treat anxiety, seizures, and other conditions. Benzodiazepines can lead to drowsiness, impaired cognitive function, and adverse effects on motor skills and coordination, potentially playing a role in the events leading up to her death. 4. Flexeril (cyclobenzaprine): Flexeril, a muscle relaxant, was also found in Houston's system. This medication is typically prescribed to alleviate muscle spasms and pain. However, it can also cause drowsiness, dizziness, and impaired motor skills, especially when taken in conjunction with other central nervous system depressants such as benzodiazepines. 5. Diphenhydramine: Diphenhydramine, commonly known as Benadryl, is an over-the-counter antihistamine used to treat allergies, insomnia, and other conditions. Although not a controlled substance, diphenhydramine can potentially cause drowsiness, dizziness, and impaired cognitive and motor function, particularly when combined with other substances. 6. Ibuprofen: Ibuprofen, an over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), was also found in Houston's system. This medication is used to treat pain, fever, and inflammation. In conclusion, Whitney Houston had several substances in her system at the time of her death, including cocaine, marijuana, benzodiazepines, Flexeril, diphenhydramine, and ibuprofen. While the primary cause of death was accidental drowning, the presence of these drugs may have contributed to her overall state and the circumstances that ultimately led to her untimely death."},{"question":"Continue the following story. People in the city are less healthy compared to to the people in the countryside, due to the clean air in the OPT: (a). city .; (b). countryside .;","response":"(b). countryside. Once upon a time in the bustling metropolis of Metropolia, the citizens were going about their daily routines, oblivious to the significant differences in lifestyles and health between their urban environment and the serene, picturesque countryside just a few dozen miles away. In Metropolia, large factories churned out products, polluting the air with thick, heavy smoke. Cars honked and ambulances wailed in a never-ending cacophony. This city was certainly alive, but it was also smothered in a blanket of urban stress. Meanwhile, in the countryside, fresh air and vibrant green vegetation flourished. Quaint houses dotted the lush countryside, adding character to the landscape. Birds chirped their melodious tunes, and the soothing sound of a trickling river whispered through the gentle breeze. This idyllic setting was much more in tune with nature, which ebbed and flowed with the seasons. It was here, in this pristine environment, that the people were thriving. Although the inhabitants of both areas shared the same human experiences, their lifestyles were remarkably different. The people in the city had become accustomed to fast-paced living, where they were constantly exposed to noise, chaos, and pollution. Many suffered from respiratory issues or stress-related illnesses as a consequence of this unsustainable lifestyle. Yet, they were unaware of the toll it was taking on their health and wellbeing. The residents in the countryside were enjoying a far more serene existence. Here, life was in harmony with nature. One could breathe in the clean, crisp air, bask in the golden warmth of the sun, and embrace the calming rhythm of the world outside the city limits. This enabled the countryside dwellers to lead healthier lives, with lower rates of illnesses and stress, and the added advantage of easier access to fresh, organic produce. Over time, some city residents began to yearn for a healthier lifestyle, having recognized that urban living was far from perfect. The pace of life was too fast, the polluted air too heavy, and the lifestyle lacking overall balance. To combat these issues, a group of city folk decided to move to the countryside in search of better physical health, mental peace, and a more fulfilling way of life. As these city dwellers embraced their new environment, they noticed a dramatic improvement in their quality of life. Their lungs felt clearer, their minds felt refreshed, and their bodies felt reinvigorated. The children particularly benefited from the newfound freedom to roam the open fields and explore the natural world, becoming more grounded in their environment. The countryside lifestyle encouraged the former city dwellers to connect with the people around them on a deeper level. Community values were more prominent, and neighbors worked together to maintain the health and beauty of their surroundings. All the inhabitants found solace in this harmonious existence. Back in Metropolia, word began to spread about how the countryside living had made a significant impact on the wellbeing of those who had moved away. This sparked a wave of curiosity among urban inhabitants interested in learning from their neighbors in the countryside. In turn, this sparked a movement known as \\"Countryside Connections,\\" which sought to bridge the gap between city and country lifestyles by promoting the exchange of ideas and experiences. City dwellers were educated about implementing healthier habits into their urban lives, while countryside dwellers discovered better ways of maintaining their current lifestyle in a rapidly changing world. Ultimately, it was through the appreciation and understanding of the benefits of a peaceful countryside lifestyle that numerous people in the city discovered a path to better health, happiness, and wellbeing."},{"question":"The court in Yantai found Ji guilty of accepting 11.3m yuan (1.9m; Â£1.2m) in bribes between 1999 and 2013, when he was dismissed.

Answer the above question based on the context below: In early 1969, Quaife told the band he was leaving. The other members did not take his statement seriously, until an article appeared in New Musical Express on 4 April featuring Quaife's new band, Maple Oak, which he had formed without telling the rest of the Kinks. Ray Davies pleaded with him to return for the sessions for their upcoming album, but Quaife refused. Davies immediately called up John Dalton, who had filled in for Quaife in the past, as a replacement. Dalton remained with the group until 1977, when the album Sleepwalker was released.Ray Davies travelled to Los Angeles in April 1969 to help negotiate an end to the American Federation of Musicians' ban on the group, opening up an opportunity for them to return to touring in the US. The group's management quickly made plans for a North American tour, to help restore their standing in the US pop music scene. Before their return to the US, the Kinks recorded another album, Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire). As with the previous two albums, Arthur was grounded in characteristically English lyrical and musical hooks. A modest commercial success, it was well received by American music critics. Conceived as the score for a proposed but unrealised television drama, much of the album revolved around themes from the Davies brothers' childhood; their sister Rosie, who had migrated to Australia in the early 1960s with her husband, Arthur Anning, the album's namesake; and life growing up during the Second World War. The Kinks embarked on their tour of the US in October 1969. The tour was generally unsuccessful, as the group struggled to find cooperative promoters and interested audiences; many of the scheduled concert dates were cancelled. The band did, however, manage to play a few major venues such as the Fillmore East and Whisky a Go Go.

These styles have evolved over centuries and have come to symbolize the charm and essence of these two continents. Let's dive deep into the captivating styles of Europe and America. Fashion: European fashion is known for its elegance, sophistication, and attention to detail. From high fashion houses in France and Italy, bespoke tailoring in the United Kingdom, to street style in major cities like Berlin and Copenhagen, European fashion is richly diverse. Notable qualities include precision in tailoring, exquisite fabrics, and a more formal approach to dressing up. Europe has some of the most recognized fashion houses, such as Chanel, Gucci, Louis Vuitton, and Christian Dior, which have become synonymous with luxury and refinement. American fashion, on the other hand, is recognized for its laid-back and casual approach. Influenced by streetwear, sportswear, and urban culture, American fashion brands like Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger, and Levi Strauss & Co. are household names across the globe. Key characteristics of this style include denim, versatile and comfortable clothing, and an emphasis on functionality. Architecture: European architecture is characterized by centuries of artistic finesse and structural innovation. The continent boasts various architectural styles ranging from Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque, and Art Nouveau, to Modernism and Postmodernism. The grandeur of architectural marvels like the Eiffel Tower, Sagrada Familia, and St. Peter's Basilica are shining examples of Europe's rich architectural history. American architecture draws inspiration from its European origins, while also reflecting the independent and pioneering spirit of the people. From the clean lines of the modern skyscrapers, such as the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building, to the unique characteristics of Frank Lloyd Wright's organic architecture, American architectural style showcases innovation and independence. Another key feature of American architecture is its adaptability; different styles from a mix of cultures blend together to create iconic landmarks like the Statue of Liberty and the White House. Art: European art is world-renowned for its depth, diversity, and influence. Spanning from ancient times to contemporary works, Europe's artistic culture covers periods like the Renaissance, Baroque, and Impressionism, with renowned artists like Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, Rembrandt, and Vincent van Gogh leaving their mark in history. American art often takes inspiration from European styles but also embraces new expressions that reflect the country's complex culture and history. Several American movements, such as Abstract Expressionism, with artists like Jackson Pollock and Mark Rothko, and Pop Art by Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein, have made a significant impact on the global art scene. Culture: European culture is as diverse as its people, encompassing various languages, cuisines, traditions, and customs across the continent. Rich in history, Europe boasts some of the world's oldest cities, like Rome and Athens, as well as cultural hubs like Paris, Barcelona, and Vienna. American culture is a melting pot of traditions and influences from across the world, with a strong connection to European heritage. The charm of American culture is reflected in its music, food, movies, and the importance of individualism and freedom. In conclusion, the charm and alluring styles of Europe and America lie in their rich history, unique influences, and evolution over time. The timeless fascination with both continents can be attributed to the fascinating blend of tradition and innovation that defines their fashion, architecture, art, and culture."},{"question":"Are these paraphrases?

Try a few of the following ideas: Explain the kinds of things that will happen before, when, and after the baby is born over and over so that your child is prepared for what can be confusing times. But leave a little room for the unexpected, e.g., a baby who has to stay in the hospital for a few days or weeks. Avoid giving your child the idea that the baby will be \\"someone to play with\\" or \\"your best friend\\" right away - the younger your child is, the more crucial this is. Make sure your child understands that for weeks the new baby will only sleep, eat, look around, poop, pee, and cry. Be especially clear about the crying, i.e., explicitly tell your child that some babies cry a lot and that this is NOT the older child's fault or responsibility. Get a baby doll and have your child practice taking care of the \\"baby.\\" Allow your child to come with you to prenatal appointments to listen to the baby's heartbeat. Take them to an ultrasound appointment. If you have a good friendly OB, CNP, or midwife, see if he or she will let your child \\"help\\" in some way. Consider allowing your older child(ren) a say in naming the baby. This can be done by providing a list of names you wouldn't mind the baby having as a first or middle name and letting them choose the ones they really like. Ask for their input in designing and putting together the nursery. If this would work for you and your family, see if your child(ren) can attend the birth itself. Read stories to your child about new babies that provide realistic descriptions about how new babies act and positive models for how older siblings should behave. Stay away from books that paint an unrealistically rosy picture or that make ambivalent feelings seem unacceptable. Above all, keep all of this preparation brief, light-hearted and casual. Going on and on about it will bore some children and make others feel more anxious than prepared. Using age-appropriate and positive words, tell your child about his or her birth and what made it special. This will reassure your child of his or her importance to you, and help to make it clear why you're so excited about the new baby. What is a summary of what this article is about?","response":"This article provides various strategies to help parents prepare their older child for the arrival of a new baby in the family.

After entering primary school he became close friends with the son of Ank Azato, a karate and Jigen-ry master who would soon become his first karate teacher. Funakoshi's family was stiffly opposed to the abolition of the Japanese topknot, and this meant he would be ineligible to pursue his goal of attending medical school, despite having passed the entrance examination. Being trained in both classical Chinese and Japanese philosophies and teachings, Funakoshi became an assistant teacher in Okinawa. During this time, his relations with the Azato family grew and he began nightly travels to the Azato family residence to receive karate instruction from Ank Azato. - , abbreviated as or , is a Japanese university located in Minato, Tokyo.

He was the first well-known American writer to try to earn a living through writing alone, resulting in a financially difficult life and career. - Supernatural fiction or supernaturalist fiction is a genre of literary and media fiction exploiting or requiring as plot devices or themes some contradictions of the commonplace natural world and materialist assumptions about it. - The supernatural (Medieval Latin: \\"superntrlis\\": \\"supra\\" \\"above\\" + \\"naturalis\\" \\"natural\\", first used: 15201530 AD) includes all that cannot be explained by science or the laws of nature, including things characteristic of or relating to ghosts, gods, or other supernatural beings, or to things beyond nature. - A film genre (or ) is a motion picture category based on similarities in either the narrative elements or the emotional response to the film (namely, serious, comic, etc.). Most theories of film genre are borrowed from literary genre criticism. The basic genres include fiction and documentary, from which subgenres have emerged, such as docufiction and docudrama. Other subgenres include the courtroom and trial-focused drama known as the legal drama. Types of fiction which may seem unrelated can also be combined to form hybrid subgenres, such as the melding of horror and comedy in the \\"Evil Dead\\" films. Other popular combinations are the romantic comedy and the action comedy film. - Evil Dead II (referred to in publicity materials as Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn) is a 1987 American comedy horror film directed by Sam Raimi. It is a parody sequel to the 1981 horror film \\"The Evil Dead\\". The film was written by Raimi and Scott Spiegel (they wrote the screenplay during the production of another collaboration, \\"Crimewave\\"), produced by Robert Tapert, and stars Bruce Campbell as Ash Williams. - Abraham \\"Bram\\" Stoker (8 November 1847 20 April 1912) was an Irish author, best known today for his 1897 Gothic novel \\"Dracula\\". During his lifetime, he was better known as the personal assistant of actor Henry Irving and business manager of the Lyceum Theatre in London, which Irving owned. - Darkman is a 1990 American superhero film directed and co-written by Sam Raimi. It is based on a short story Raimi wrote that paid homage to Universal's horror films of the 1930s. The film stars Liam Neeson as Peyton Westlake, a scientist who is attacked and left for dead by a ruthless mobster, Robert Durant (Larry Drake), after his girlfriend, an attorney (Frances McDormand), runs afoul of a corrupt developer (Colin Friels). - In works of art, macabre is the quality of having a grim or ghastly atmosphere. Macabre works emphasize the details and symbols of death. The term also refers to works particularly gruesome in nature. - Horror film is a film genre that seeks to elicit a negative emotional reaction from viewers by playing on their fears. Inspired by literature from authors like Edgar Allan Poe, Bram Stoker, and Mary Shelley, horror films have existed for more than a century. The macabre and the supernatural are frequent themes. Horror may also overlap with the fantasy, supernatural fiction and thriller genres. - Scott Spiegel (born December 24, 1957) is an American screenwriter, film director, producer and actor. He is best known for co-writing the screenplay for the movie \\"Evil Dead II\\" with longtime friend, film director Sam Raimi, with whom he attended Wylie E. Groves High School in Birmingham, Michigan. Spiegel played the role of Scotty in Raimi's \\"Within the Woods\\", which served as a precursor to \\"The Evil Dead\\". - The Evil Dead is a 1981 American supernatural horror film written and directed by Sam Raimi and executive produced by Raimi and Bruce Campbell, who also stars alongside Ellen Sandweiss and Betsy Baker. The film focuses on five college students vacationing in an isolated cabin in a remote wooded area. After they find an audiotape that releases a legion of demons and spirits, members of the group suffer from demonic possession, leading to increasingly gory mayhem. Raimi and the cast produced the short film \\"Within the Woods\\" as a \\"prototype\\" to build the interest of potential investors, which secured Raimi US90,000 to produce \\"The Evil Dead\\". The film was shot on location in a remote cabin located in Morristown, Tennessee, in a difficult filming process that proved extremely uncomfortable for the majority of the cast and crew. - Fear is a feeling induced by perceived danger or threat that occurs in certain types of organisms, which causes a change in metabolic and organ functions and ultimately a change in behavior, such as fleeing, hiding, or freezing from perceived traumatic events. Fear in human beings may occur in response to a specific stimulus occurring in the present, or in anticipation or expectation of a future threat perceived as a risk to body or life. The fear response arises from the perception of danger leading to confrontation with or escape from/avoiding the threat (also known as the fight-or-flight response), which in extreme cases of fear (horror and terror) can be a freeze response or paralysis. In humans and animals, fear is modulated by the process of cognition and learning. Thus fear is judged as rational or appropriate and irrational or inappropriate. An irrational fear is called a phobia. - Within the Woods is a 1978 horror short film written, directed and produced by Sam Raimi. Raimi drew inspiration from his earlier short film \\"Clockwork\\", deciding to produce a \\"prototype\\" horror film to help build the interest of potential investors. Raimi cast his friends Bruce Campbell and Ellen Sandweiss as the two protagonists and produced the film for 1600. Shot on location in a remote cabin in the woods, production was a difficult process because of the low budget. Several of the special effects presented in the film were done in a severely low budget manner, some of which were improvised on set. The film centers around demonic possession and mysterious forces originating from the woods. - Clockwork is a 1978 American short horror film directed by Sam Raimi , starring Scott Spiegel and Cheryl Guttridge . - Birmingham is a city in Oakland County of the U.S. state of Michigan and a suburb of Detroit.

Identify the main points: The beach was defended by two battalions of the German 716th Infantry Division. 2. Identify the secondary points: Elements of the 21st Armoured Division were near Caen in reserve. Sentence 2: 1. Identify the main points: The beach was defended by two battalions of the German 716th Infantry Division. 2. Identify the secondary points: Elements of the 21st Panzer Division were held in reserve near Caen. Now, let's compare and justify the steps: Main Points: - Both sentences mention the beach being defended by two battalions of the German 716th Infantry Division, so the main points are identical. Secondary Points: - Sentence 1 mentions \\"elements of the 21st Armoured Division,\\" while Sentence 2 mentions \\"elements of the 21st Panzer Division.\\" In the context of World War II, \\"armoured\\" and \\"panzer\\" relate to the same type of military unit, so the terms can be considered synonymous. - Both sentences mention these elements being near Caen in a reserve position, so the secondary points are also identical. Based on this analysis, I can conclude that these two sentences are paraphrases of one another, as they convey the same information using slightly different wording."},{"question":"What is the sentiment of the following review?

The reviewer expresses dissatisfaction and frustration with various aspects of their experience. They start by calling the showers a \\"cesspool,\\" implying a highly unsanitary and disgusting condition. The check-in/check-out system is described as poor, and they mention issues with the water temperature, drainage, and overall cleanliness of the shower facility. The reviewer goes on to detail a particularly unpleasant incident where the drainage backed up, causing the bathtub to fill with filth and debris. They use strong words like \\"just disgusting\\" and \\"unacceptable\\" to emphasize their disgust, and also point out that this is a significant health issue. The response from the management further adds to their dissatisfaction, as the offered compensation – a 15 food coupon – is characterized as completely inadequate given the gravity of the situation. They also criticize the quality of customer service, concluding with their decision to never stay in that establishment again. The reviewer suggests that the facility deserves no stars and should be \\"condemned, knocked down, and rebuilt.\\" This statement gives an overall impression of the reviewer's frustration and lack of confidence in the establishment's ability to maintain an acceptable level of cleanliness and service. All of these factors contribute to the entirely negative sentiment of this review."},{"question":"Translate the following sentence to Czech: You get a description of the other vehicle? Czech:","response":"Získáte popis toho druhého vozidla?"},{"question":"I read this background article the other day: The general trend in electronegativity is that the value increases from left to right across a row in the periodic table and decreases down a column. The most electronegative element is fluorine, which has a value of 4.0. As discussed in the lesson \\"Trends in the Periodic Table,\\" electronegativity increases across a row as the number of protons in the nucleus increases and therefore has a stronger pull. Electronegativity decreases down a column due to an increased effect of electron shielding in larger atoms. I am facing a new situation today: A high school student, Timmy, is reading about elements of a periodic table. He is studying the periodic table when he decides to compare two random elements within the same column. He chooses Mardine and Sampline to compare and contrast and gets to work. The first thing he notices is that Sampline is further down the periodic table than Mardine. It's not much information to go on, but it's a good starting point for Timmy. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Is electron shielding higher or lower in Sampline? The answer to this question is:","response":"Electron shielding is higher in Sampline. Since Sampline is further down the periodic table than Mardine, it has more electron shells. More electron shells result in a higher degree of electron shielding, which makes the effective nuclear charge experienced by the outermost electrons lower. This would also lead to a decrease in electronegativity for Sampline compared to Mardine, following the trend described in the background article."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

This method will only work if you are given the length of the diagonal and the length of the side of the rectangle. You might also see the formula written as D=w2+h2{displaystyle D={sqrt {w^{2}+h^{2}}}}, where h{displaystyle h} equals the height of the rectangle and is used instead of length. The variables l{displaystyle l} and h{displaystyle h} refer to the same measurement. Make sure you substitute for the correct variables. For example, if you are trying to find the width of a rectangle that has a diagonal length of 5 centimeters, and a side length of 4 centimeters, your formula will look like this: 5=w2+42{displaystyle 5={sqrt {w^{2}+4^{2}}}} You need to do this to get rid of the square root sign, which makes isolating the width variable easier.

Having lots of enjoyable sex may put them at a greater risk for heart complications. The study, published in the Journal of Health and Social Behavior, looked at 2,204 people between the ages 57 to 85. The people were interviewed again five years later, in an effort to understand how sex impacts people’s health later in life. The report authors found that men who reported having at least weekly sex were more likely to report experiencing heart problems when they were interviewed again a few years later compared to men who were not sexually active. “Older men who found sex with their partner extremely pleasurable or satisfying had higher risk of cardiovascular events than men who did not feel so,” said study author Hui Liu, an associate professor of sociology at Michigan State University in a statement. Women, however, did not experience any increase in heart health problems with more sexual activity. In fact, women who reported feeling highly satisfied with their sex life had a lower risk of high blood pressure years later compared to women who didn’t hold the same level of satisfaction. Before older men give up on a healthy sexual relationship, it’s important to point out that the study only found a link between heart problems and sex, and it’s not definitive. More studies are needed to gain a clearer understanding of the benefits and risks of sex later in life, and whether the amount of sexual activity matters as people age. Liu recommends men have conversations with their physicians about their health and sexuality. Why might men have a higher risk for heart issues? While sex is shown to have health benefits, including better heart health, overdoing it late in life could be problematic, the study authors suggest. Overall, older men tend to have more sexual complications compared to younger men, and Liu argues that the exertion to reach orgasm could be causing heart stress. It’s also possible that medications men take to improve their sexual performance, like testosterone therapy, could be playing a role. However the researchers did not look at this connection in the study. What are the most important parts of this text?","response":"The most important parts of the text include the following: 1. A new study published in the Journal of Health and Social Behavior suggests that older men who engage in frequent, satisfying sex might be at a greater risk for heart complications. 2. The study involved 2,204 people aged 57 to 85 and investigated the impact of sex on people's health later in life. 3. Men who reported having sex at least weekly were more likely to experience heart problems in the follow-up interviews compared to men who were not sexually active. 4. Older men who found sex extremely pleasurable or satisfying had a higher risk of cardiovascular events. 5. Women did not experience any increased heart health problems with more sexual activity; in fact, those with high satisfaction in their sex life had a lower risk of high blood pressure. 6.

POST : I had a psychiatrist appointment in san jose and cyrus/aia wanted to go to a dollar store to shop. I suggested that they should come with me because the 99 had way better produce and we could get some pho or something. Cyrus was adamant about getting in n out. Aia and I agreed on noodles. I had no objections to doing both. Before my appointment I had to mess with my printer to get it to work so we leave a little late and I apologize to aia because we couldn't drop her resume off somewhere she wanted to work. On the way, Aia discovers she can't do her reading on the 17 northbound because of all of the movement. She tells me the reading is due at 7. My psych appointment takes an hour as predicted and ended up being extremely emotionally taxing. (I did tell them 30 minutes to an hour before we left) Cyrus and Aia apparently go to in n out during such. When they come back with my car 15 minutes after my appointment ended, Aia tells me she left room for noodles. So I figure, yeah let's go get noodles. I drive us to a pho place 15 minutes away and when we get there, cyrus says we should leave. Aia complains that it's expensive and that I said pho is 6 to 8.(I'm from LA) It was really 10 to 11 and that turns out to be average for San Jose. Therefore, she is not eating. Cyrus offers to pay for her meal but she refuses. At this point, I'm hungry and have a massive headache so I decide to eat. Cyrus asks me if I can take it to go and I say no because rice noodles go bad pretty fast. Im pretty disappointed that im eating alone here but I eat as fast as possible without throwing up so we can go. It was a pretty big bowl so it took like half an hour. We go to the 99 15 minutes away to do our grocery shopping and we head back home to santa cruz. On the way back, we encounter a ton of traffic and I apologize to Aia again. From here, Cyrus starts exploding at me saying that I asked them to come with me and that we never made plans to get noodles. He says I'm a dick for eating the noodles when no one else was eating and when he said I should take it to go/we should leave that should have been my cue to just not eat and that it essentially translates to we dont have time for this. Eventually I stop listening because I have a huge problem with people yelling in general and they both know this. I tell them that if we didn't have time, they should tell me there isn't time instead of just saying we should leave because I cant read their minds. (Make your needs be known/be direct) They just claim that I'm flipping it on them and that I'm saying they should have done more. Unbeknownst to me, Aia just wasnt doing her homework and absolutely needed to be at home to read something on her phone that was in her pocket. I was going to apologize to Aia about this whole thing, but something about being yelled at and insulted for an hour by her boyfriend made me not want to. At this point, my medication wears off and I just start putting minimal effort into the conversation by just making snarky semantic arguments to push him off more.

Bobby Jindal has a special package coming to him by mail courtesy of Attorney General Eric Holder. A copy of “Walking with the Wind: A Memoir of the Movement,” which was written by civil rights leader and Georgia Rep. John Lewis has been sent to Jindal thanks to a red meat line the governor delivered at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Thursday. In his speech, Jindal railed against Holder and President Obama’s Justice Department for initially attempting to blocking a state vouchers program on civil rights grounds, suggesting that they were trying to “stand in the schoolhouse door” to block the voucher program for minority kids. “The Department of Justice is taking us to federal court to try to impede this program,” Jindal said. “Now, I want you to think about this. We’ve got Eric Holder and the Department of Justice trying to stand in the schoolhouse door to prevent minority kids, low-income kids, kids who haven’t had access to a great education the chance to go to better schools.” The “schoolhouse door” language isn’t just creative prose, its an apparent reference to the famous “stand in the schoolhouse door” by segregationist Alabama Gov. George Wallace, during which he physically attempted to block black students from integrating the University of Alabama. The Department of Justice is seeking greater federal oversight over the voucher program. According to the Department of Justice press office, the book was sent to Jindal with a passage on Wallace’s schoolhouse door stand flagged for good measure. “This should help the Governor brush up on his history for the next time he invokes the civil rights movement,” DOJ Press Secretary Kevin Lewis said in a statement.

The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east. Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney. - Lake Wakatipu is an inland lake (finger lake) in the South Island of New Zealand. It is in the southwest corner of the Otago Region, near its boundary with Southland. \\"Lake Wakatipu\\" comes from the original Mori word Whakatipu wai-mori. - The North Island or Te Ika-a-Mui (\\"Mori\\") is one of the two main islands of New Zealand, separated from the slightly larger but much less populous South Island by Cook Strait. The island's area is , making it the world's 14th-largest island. It has a population of - The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east. - Auckland is a city in the North Island of New Zealand. It is the most populous urban area in the country. Auckland has a population of , which constitutes percent of New Zealand's population. It is part of the wider Auckland Regionthe area governed by the Auckland Councilwhich also includes outlying rural areas and the islands of the Hauraki Gulf, resulting in a total population of . Auckland also has the largest Polynesian population of any city in the world. The Mori language name for Auckland is or , meaning \\"Tmaki with a hundred lovers\\", in reference to the desirability of its fertile land at the hub of waterways in all directions. It has also been called karana, the Mori enunciation of \\"Auckland\\". - The Southern Alps (Mori: K Tiritiri o te Moana ) are a mountain range extending along much of the length of New Zealand's South Island, reaching its greatest elevations near the island's western side. The term \\"Southern Alps\\" generally refers to the entire range, although separate names are given to many of the smaller ranges that form part of it. - Fiji ((), officially the Republic of Fiji, is an island country in Melanesia in the South Pacific Ocean about northeast of New Zealand's North Island. Its closest neighbours are Vanuatu to the west, New Caledonia to the southwest, New Zealand's Kermadec Islands to the southeast, Tonga to the east, the Samoas and France's Wallis and Futuna to the northeast, and Tuvalu to the north. - Tectonic uplift is the portion of the total geologic uplift of the mean Earth surface that is not attributable to an isostatic response to unloading. While isostatic response is important, an increase in the mean elevation of a region can only occur in response to tectonic processes of crustal thickening (such as mountain building events), changes in the density distribution of the crust and underlying mantle, and flexural support due to the bending of rigid lithosphere. - The Rees River is a river in New Zealand , flowing into upper Lake Wakatipu in the South Island . It is named for explorer and early settler William Gilbert Rees , the founder of the nearby town of Queenstown . - A lake is an area of variable size filled with water, localized in a basin, that is surrounded by land, apart from any river or other outlet that serves to feed or drain the lake. Lakes lie on land and are not part of the ocean, and therefore are distinct from lagoons, and are also larger and deeper than ponds, though there are no official or scientific definitions. Lakes can be contrasted with rivers or streams, which are usually flowing. Most lakes are fed and drained by rivers and streams. - New Caledonia is a special collectivity of France located in the southwest Pacific Ocean, east of Australia and east of Metropolitan France. The archipelago, part of the Melanesia subregion, includes the main island of Grande Terre, the Loyalty Islands, the Chesterfield Islands, the Belep archipelago, the Isle of Pines, and a few remote islets. The Chesterfield Islands are in the Coral Sea. Locals refer to Grande Terre as \\"\\" (\\"the pebble\\"). - New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland. - The Tasman Sea (Mori: \\"Te Tai-o-Rehua\\") is a marginal sea of the South Pacific Ocean, situated between Australia and New Zealand. It measures about across and about from north to south. The sea was named after the Dutch explorer Abel Janszoon Tasman, who was the first recorded European to encounter New Zealand and Tasmania. The British explorer Captain James Cook later extensively navigated the Tasman Sea in the 1770s as part of his first voyage of exploration. - Tonga (or ; Tongan: \\"Puleanga Fakatui o Tonga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Tonga, is a Polynesian sovereign state and archipelago comprising 169 islands of which 36 are inhabited. The total surface area is about scattered over of the southern Pacific Ocean.

It is at the south-western tip of the North Island, between Cook Strait and the Rimutaka Range. Wellington is the major population centre of the southern North Island and is the administrative centre of the Wellington Region, which also includes the Kapiti Coast and Wairarapa. As the nation's capital city, the New Zealand Government and Parliament, Supreme Court and most of the civil service are based in the city. - The South Island or Te Waipounamu (\\"Mori\\") is the larger of the two major islands of New Zealand, the other being the smaller but more populous North Island.

Question: suppose lava chambers are aggravated with build up pressure happens, how will it affect MORE oxygen being brought to the body. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect","response":"The scenario you describe involves lava chambers with a build-up of pressure, which seems to be a geological or volcanic situation. It is not directly related to the respiratory system of the human body, which consists of breathing in oxygen and carbon dioxide being exhaled. However, to answer your question more comprehensively, I'll examine any potential indirect effects such a situation could have on the respiratory process and the second effect mentioned, which is the division of inhaled air between the two lungs via the bronchial tubes. First, let's consider the possibility of volcanic eruptions due to the aggravated lava chambers. Such an eruption could release large amounts of gases, including sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide, and other particles into the atmosphere. These gases could have an impact on the air quality, which in turn could affect the breathing process. The accumulation of these gases in the atmosphere near an eruption site could make it more difficult for people to breathe in oxygen. In this situation, the oxygen supply in the surrounding air might be reduced, which could lead to a decreased amount of oxygen being available for the body during the inhalation process. Consequently, the air carried to the lungs by the windpipe and bronchial tubes could contain less oxygen than usual. This would result in less oxygenated blood being supplied to the body, making it more challenging for cells to filter out carbon dioxide efficiently. In this case, the perturbation would have a negative effect, meaning \\"less\\" oxygen would be available to the body. Furthermore, the presence of volcanic particles, such as ash, could cause irritations or obstructions in the respiratory system. This could lead to inflammation or difficulties in circulating the air in the bronchial tubes, which might further worsen the already reduced oxygen supply to the body. Taking all these factors into consideration, one could argue that aggravated lava chambers with built-up pressure could indirectly affect the respiratory system. It may result in \\"less\\" oxygen being brought to the body due to the poor air quality and potential respiratory irritations caused by volcanic emissions and ash particles. However, it is essential to note that this outcome would largely depend on the proximity of the individual to the volcanic activity, as well as other environmental factors affecting air quality."},{"question":"Q: Jesse went crazy last week after finding out that their partner was cheating on them.

Was ethanol beneficial to Jack Kerouac's health?","response":"Rationale: When assessing whether or not ethanol was beneficial to Jack Kerouac's health, one must consider the effects of alcohol consumption, particularly heavy or long-term consumption, on a person's overall health. Ethanol is the active ingredient in alcoholic beverages and can have various consequences on a person's body depending on the amount and frequency of consumption. Additionally, we must consider Jack Kerouac's personal history and relationship with alcohol. Answer: Ethanol was not beneficial to Jack Kerouac's health. Jack Kerouac, an American novelist and poet, was known for his heavy drinking throughout his life. Long-term consumption of alcohol, and specifically ethanol, has been associated with numerous health issues including liver damage, heart disease, various types of cancers, and mental health issues. In Kerouac's case, his chronic alcohol consumption significantly contributed to the development of cirrhosis, a severe liver disease. This, combined with other health problems, eventually led to his death at the age of 47. Thus, it can be concluded that ethanol, as a significant contributor to his alcohol addiction and related health issues, was detrimental to Jack Kerouac's health."},{"question":"Summarize this article: The Scottish Conservative leader, who is gay, plans to marry her partner in the near future. The DUP opposes same-sex marriage, with Northern Ireland the only part of the UK where it is not legal. Ms Davidson said she had been given an assurance that gay rights would not be eroded in return for DUP support. In a tweet sent on Friday afternoon, Ms Davidson highlighted a speech she made in Belfast about the importance of equal marriage. She told the BBC's Reporting Scotland programme that she had spoken about the issue with Theresa May on Friday evening. Ms Davidson said: \\"I was fairly straightforward with her and I told her that there were a number of things that count to me more than party. \\"One of them is country, one of the others is LGBTI rights.\\" The Scottish Tory leader said she had asked for, and received, a \\"categoric assurance\\" from Mrs May that any arrangement between the Conservatives and the DUP would see \\"absolutely no rescission of LGBTI rights in the rest of the UK\\". And she said the prime minister agreed to try to use her influence to advance LGBTI rights in Northern Ireland. Ms May, whose party lost its majority at Westminster in Thursday's general election, says she will put together a minority government with the support of the DUP to guide the UK through crucial Brexit talks. The DUP, which returned 10 MPs to Westminster, has garnered a reputation for its strong and controversial views on a number of social issues. It opposes same-sex marriage and is anti-abortion - with abortion remaining illegal in Northern Ireland, except in specific medical cases. In a short statement outside Downing Street after an audience with the Queen, Mrs May said she would join with her DUP \\"friends\\" to \\"get to work\\" on Brexit. She referred to the \\"strong relationship\\" she had with the DUP, but gave little detail of how their arrangement might work. It is thought Mrs May will seek some kind of informal arrangement with the DUP that could see it \\"lend\\" its support to the Tories on a vote-by-vote basis, known as \\"confidence and supply\\". When asked whether she was comfortable about the arrangement given the DUP's views, Ms Davidson said there was \\"no suggestion\\" that the Conservative government would be dependent on the support of the DUP. She added: \\"The prime minister has already made it clear that it is not going to be a formal coalition, so let's see how the future days go ahead.\\" Ms Davidson, who backed Remain in the EU referendum, has called for the Tories to listen to other parties to deliver an \\"open Brexit\\", which she defines as ensuring that free trade is at the heart of the Brexit negotiations. She said: \\"I want to make sure that Scottish businesses can trade as freely as possible with the other 27 countries in the EU as well as the other countries around the world.\\" Ms Davidson's party won 13 seats in Scotland as its vote surged across the country. Scottish Labour and the Liberal Democrats returned seven and four MPs respectively, with the SNP winning 35 - a drop of 21 from the 56 the party won two years ago. The DUP are pro-union (not Europe but UK), pro-Brexit and socially conservative. The party, which returned 10 MPs to Westminster, has garnered a reputation for its strong, sometimes controversial views. It opposes same-sex marriage and is anti-abortion - abortion remains illegal in Northern Ireland, except in specific medical cases. One MP is a devout climate change denier, while a former MP once called for creationism - the belief that human life did not evolve over millions of years but was created by God - to be taught alongside evolution in science classes. During the election campaign, the DUP's Emma Little-Pengelly was endorsed by the three biggest loyalist paramilitary organisations. Read more about the DUP here and meet their MPs here.

Analyze the second sentence: - \\"It's a wonder that Porchia was the only deceased in this case,\\" - \\"Sax added\\" - In this case: The emphasis is on the surprising aspect of Porchia's death only, and the attribution to Sax is added. 3. Compare the two sentences: - Both sentences emphasize the surprising aspect of Porchia being the only deceased. - The first sentence puts more focus on the brutal beating, while the second sentence doesn't mention it explicitly. - The second sentence has an attribution (\\"Sax added\\"), which is not present in the first sentence. Based on this comparison, the sentences are similar in meaning but not exact paraphrases of each other. The first sentence places more emphasis on the brutal beating, while the second sentence focuses primarily on the surprise of Porchia being the only deceased."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the full name of the person earlier in whose career had undertaken the destruction of the portrait of Churchill? The house has been restored and preserved as it looked in the 1920-30s; at the time of the Trust's purchase, Churchill committed to leave it, \\"garnished and furnished so as to be of interest to the public\\". Rooms are decorated with memorabilia and gifts, the original furniture and books, as well as honours and medals that Churchill received. Lady Churchill's long-time secretary, Grace Hamblin, was appointed the first administrator of the house. Earlier in her career, Miss Hamblin had undertaken the destruction of the portrait of Churchill painted by Graham Sutherland. The picture, a gift from both Houses of Parliament on Churchill's 80th birthday in 1954, was loathed by both Churchill and Lady Churchill and had been stored in the cellars at Chartwell before being burnt in secret.The opening of the house required the construction of facilities for visitors and a restaurant was designed by Philip Jebb, and built to the north of the house, along with a shop and ticket office. Alterations have also been made to the gardens, for ease of access and of maintenance. In 1987, the Great Storm caused considerable damage, with some twenty-three trees being blown down in the gardens. Greater loss occurred in the woodlands surrounding the house, which lost over 70% of its trees.Chartwell has become among the National Trust's most popular properties; in 2016 some 232,000 visitors came to the house. In that year, the fiftieth anniversary of the house's opening, the Trust launched the Churchill's Chartwell Appeal, to raise £7.1M for the purchase of hundreds of personal items held at Chartwell on loan from the Churchill family. The items available to the Trust include Churchill's Nobel Prize in Literature awarded to him in 1953. The citation for the award reads, \\"for his mastery of historical and biographical description as well as for brilliant oratory in defending exalted human values\\".

Stream of thoughts:","response":"Based on the premise, \\"The five people are standing under three tan arches,\\" we can infer several pieces of information. 1. There are five people involved in the scene. 2. There are three tan arches. 3. The people are standing under these arches. Now, let's examine the hypothesis: \\"People stand under tan arches.\\" The hypothesis appears to be a generalization of the information provided in the premise. In the premise, we have a specific group of people (five people) standing under a specific number of tan arches (three arches). The hypothesis makes a more general statement about people (without specifying any number or group) standing under tan arches (without specifying the number of arches). Considering the information from the premise, we can reason that the hypothesis is likely entailed, although it's not an absolute statement. In this particular scenario of five people standing under three tan arches, we can say that \\"people\\" (referring to these five individuals) do \\"stand under tan arches\\" because it's shown in the premise. However, since the hypothesis is a general statement, it might not be applicable to every scenario where people and tan arches are present. So, the hypothesis is somewhat supported by the premise, but it's essential to keep in mind that the premise provides only limited evidence for the more general claim in the hypothesis."},{"question":"Do these mean the same?

Aboard the airship is Dr. Jorge Vargas, a scientist who arranges for a package containing two vials to be delivered to Dr. Walter Jennings. The courier looks back while leaving with the vials, to see that Dr. Vargas has vanished. Polly Perkins, a reporter for The Chronicle, is looking into the disappearances of Vargas and five other renowned scientists. A cryptic message leads her to Radio City Music Hall, against the warnings of her editor, Mr. Paley, where she meets Dr. Jennings during a showing of The Wizard of Oz. He tells her that a Dr. Totenkopf is coming for him next. Suddenly, seemingly indestructible robots attack the city. Clearly outmatched, the authorities call for \\"Sky Captain\\" Joe Sullivan, the city's hero and Perkins' ex-lover and the commander of the private air force the Flying Legion. While Joe engages the robots with his modified Curtiss P-40 pursuit fighter, Perkins photographs from the street with little regard for her personal safety.

Flight is the primary means of locomotion for most bird species and is used for breeding, feeding, and predator avoidance and escape. Birds have various adaptations for flight, including a lightweight skeleton, two large flight muscles, the pectoralis (which accounts for 15% of the total mass of the bird) and the supracoracoideus, as well as a modified forelimb (wing) that serves as an aerofoil. Wing shape and size generally determine a bird species' type of flight; many birds combine powered, flapping flight with less energy-intensive soaring flight. About 60 extant bird species are flightless, as were many extinct birds. Flightlessness often arises in birds on isolated islands, probably due to limited resources and the absence of land predators. Though flightless, penguins use similar musculature and movements to \\"fly\\" through the water, as do auks, shearwaters and dippers.\\", answer the following question. Note that the answer is present within the text. Question: What plays the biggest part in keeping a bird light enough to fly?

Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf.

I'm not saying they're not good actors, I'm saying they stunk in this film. The special effects were decent (and I will say the film makers did a good job making the ship eye-pleasing), but IT even has several major flaws. For instance, right before the ship goes under, you can see an unfinished blue-screen image behind your main characters. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE the story of the REAL Titanic, but I find this movie an insult to that story. Editing was atrocious--there's no reason for any film to be over 2 1/2 hours (with the exception of MAYBE a biographical movie), and the writing and screenplay was horribly stilted. I will say that the music was perhaps better than I could have predicted (and not just the \\"My Heart Will Go On\\" song either). There is one scene that stands out to me when the ship is sinking and pounding bass music is heard. That could very well be the highlight of the film.

To ignore his mother and his sisters and Matt Lauer and Mark Spitz and Rowdy Gaines and to once and for all hang up his goggles and Speedos. Go. Scram. Buzz off. Because athletics enthusiasts are a peculiar people (aka: crazy), we always beg our heroes to stick around longer than they should. It's the reason a portly, 40-year-old Ken Griffey Jr. hit .184 in Seattle in 2010 and the reason Bjorn Borg stepped back onto the tennis court in 1991 (wood racket in hand) -- only to win nary a single match. It's the reason our final snapshot of Sugar Ray Leonard is an embarrassing stoppage against Hector Camacho and the reason Jim Palmer arrived at spring training with Baltimore in 1991 throwing big, fat, Little League meatballs.

This domain was first established in 1990 and managed by the .za Domain Name Authority (.ZADNA). Let me provide you with some more details about ccTLDs and .za. Each country has a specific code assigned to it, known as the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD). This forms part of the Domain Name System (DNS) structure of the Internet. These codes are usually two letters long and are used to denote the geographical location of the website or email, though this usage isn't a hard-and-fast rule. Now, speaking specifically of the .za ccTLD, the “za” stands for Zuid-Afrika, which is the Dutch name for South Africa. The name was carried over to the world of internet domains because Dutch was one of the initial languages spoken by European settlers in the country. The .za domain is used by entities connected with South Africa, such as businesses, corporations, and individuals. The use of .za demonstrates a webpage's or company's connection to South Africa - whether it's a South African business, a section of a global organization operating in South Africa, or local individuals. This kind of domain is managed at a national level by a delegated manager, which in this case is the .ZADNA. They have maintained the .za space since the responsibility was officially delegated by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) in 1990. The use of .za domains does not stop at being just a South African identifier, it's usually expanded into second level domains which show a more detailed classification of the domain holder. These are suffixes such as .co.za for commercial entities, .org.za for organizations, .gov.za for government entities, .edu.za for educational institutions, among others. Using a .za ccTLD enhances visibility among South African internet users. Since local users tend to trust more domains that carry their national ccTLD, it helps in adding credibility and fostering trust with South African locals. In terms of SEO (Search Engine Optimization), having a .za domain also means your website would rank higher in location-specific search results in South Africa. In conclusion, the \\".za\\" internet code serves as a pivotal identifier for South African related online content, playing a significant role within the country’s digital infrastructure. It helps in establishing and maintaining a unique South African identity in the global online space."},{"question":"Complete the passage.

Prosecutors in Milan submitted the trial request last week, initiating a five-day countdown for Judge Cristina di Censo to arrive at a conclusion. Judge di Censo has a range of options at her disposal while deliberating on this matter. She can direct the trial to proceed without the customary preliminary hearing, as recommended by Milan's chief prosecutor Edmundo Bruti Liberati, or dismiss the case altogether. Dismissing the case would grant investigating authorities additional time to amass sufficient evidence to warrant a trial. Another possibility for the judge is to transfer the case to another jurisdiction, allowing a different court to handle these allegations. Furthermore, Judge di Censo can also request an extension of one day to finalize her decision, if she deems it necessary to fully consider all relevant factors and implications. The charges against Prime Minister Berlusconi have ignited a firestorm of public opinion in Italy, with critics and supporters alike anxiously awaiting the outcome, and questioning its potential impact on the nation's political landscape. A trial could propel Italy into uncharted political territory and cast even more doubt on the future of Berlusconi's tenure, while a dismissal might be seen as a reprieve for the embattled Prime Minister. No matter what course of action Judge di Censo chooses to follow, her impending decision has the ability to deeply shape the political fortunes of Prime Minister Berlusconi and the nation of Italy.

He was undefeated in battle and is widely considered one of history's most successful military commanders. - Historical regions (or historical countries) are delimitations of geographic areas for studying and analysing social development of period-specific cultures without any reference to contemporary political, economic or social organisations. The fundamental principle underlying this view is that older political and mental structures exist which exercise greater influence on the spatial-social identity of individuals than is understood by the contemporary world, bound to and often blinded by its own worldview - e.g. the focus on the nation-state. Definitions of regions vary, and regions can include macroregions such as Europe, territories of traditional states, or smaller microregional areas. A geographic proximity is the often required precondition for emergence of a regional identity. In Europe the regional identities are often derived from the Migration Period, but for the contemporary perspective are related to the 1918-1920 time of territorial transformation, and another in the post-Cold War period. - Basileus is a Greek term and title that has signified various types of monarchs in history. In the English-speaking world it is perhaps most widely understood to mean \\"king\\" or \\"emperor\\".

It is directly to the south of the countries of Bactria , Arachosia and Drangiana , to the east of the country of Carmania and due west of the Indus River which formed a natural boundary between it and Western India . The native name of Gedrosia might have been Gwadar as there are two towns by that name and a bay ( Gwadar Bay ) in central Makran . The Gedrosians are known to have successfully defeated the Indian Mauryans capturing the western-most parts of their state . Following his army 's refusal to continue marching east at the Hyphasis River in 326 BC , Alexander the Great crossed the area after sailing south to the coast of the Indian Ocean on his way back to Babylon . Upon reaching the Ocean , Alexander the Great divided his forces in half , sending half back by sea to Susa under the command of Nearchus . The other half of his army was to accompany him on a march through the Gedrosian desert , inland from the ocean . Throughout the 60 day march through the desert , Alexander lost at least 12,000 soldiers , in addition to countless livestock , camp followers , and most of his baggage train . Some historians say he lost three - quarters of his army to the harsh desert conditions along the way . However , this figure was likely based on exaggerated numbers in his forces prior to the march , which were likely in the range of no fewer than 30,000 soldiers . There are two competing theories for the purpose of Alexander the Great 's decision to march through the desert rather than along the more hospitable coast . The first argues that this was an attempt to punish his men for their refusal to continue eastward at the Hyphasis River . The other argues that Alexander was attempting to imitate and succeed in the... - Ariana, the Latinized form of the Ancient Greek \\"Ar(e)ian\\" (inhabitants: \\"\\"; \\"Ar(e)ianoi\\"), was a general geographical term used by some Greek and Roman authors of the ancient period for a district of wide extent between Central Asia and the Indus River, comprehending the eastern provinces of the Achaemenid Empire that covered the whole country of modern day Afghanistan, and a few parts of Pakistan, Tajikistan, Iran, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. - Gwadar Bay is located in the Gulf of Oman on the maritime border of Pakistan and Iran.

In its lower course it is much used for irrigation, under the control of the Helmand and Arghandab Valley Authority, and the valley is cultivated and populous; yet the water is said to be somewhat brackish. It is doubtful whether the ancient Arachotus is to be identified with the Arghandab or with its chief confluent the Tarnak, which joins it on the left out SW of Kandahar. The Tarnak, which flows south of Kandahar, is much shorter (length about 320 km or 200 miles) and less copious. The ruins at Ulan Robat, supposed to represent the city Arachosia, are in its basin; and the lake known as Ab-i-Istada, the most probable representative of Lake Arachotus, is near the head of the Tarnak, though not communicating with it.

Balochistan borders the Pashtun region to the north, Sindh to the east, Punjab to the northeast, and Persian regions to the west. Across its southern coastline lies the Persian Gulf. What is the relationship between 'gedrosia' and 'balochistan'? Answer:","response":"Gedrosia is the Hellenized name of the part of coastal Baluchistan that roughly corresponds to today's Makran region in Balochistan, Pakistan, and Iran. The area named Gedrosia in books about Alexander the Great and his successors runs from the Indus River to the southern edge of the Strait of Hormuz. It is a region that was part of the ancient empires and is directly related to Balochistan in terms of geographic location, ancient history, and the people living there. So, the relationship between Gedrosia and Balochistan is that Gedrosia can be considered an ancient, historical region within the broader area of Balochistan."},{"question":"What is a question about this article?

Article: Nature is full of color, from rainbows and roses to butterfly wings and peacock tails. Even the fruits and vegetables you eat have different colors: blue blueberries, red strawberries, green broccoli, and orange carrots. Plant and animals often use color to attract attention. The substances responsible for these colors belong to a class of chemical called antioxidants . Plants make antioxidant to protect themselves from the sun's ultraviolet(UV) light. Ultraviolet light causes chemicals called free radicals to form within plant cells. They can destroy parts of plant. Free radicals also have damaging effects on human beings. Some of these effects like wrinkled skin can be seen. The damage is caused by the free radicals attacking cells in our bodies. Certain cancers and heart disease are linked to free radicals. Our bodies have natural defences for fighting off free radicals. While we are young, our defences are pretty strong. However, they get weaker as we get older. The body's built-in defences can only go so far without extra help. The key to fighting free radicals with fruits and vegetables is to mix and match colors. It's like sunscreen for the inside of your body. Go for a range of very bright colors. Colorful foods contain hundreds of healthy chemicals not found anywhere else. Research into how chemicals in blueberries affect the brain's function in rats suggests that these chemicals may help our own brains work more efficiently. Don't just blame the sun. Ultraviolet light isn't the only source of free radicals. If you breathe polluted air such as smog, automobile exhaust , or wasted gas from a factory, you take in chemicals that also cause such damage. And, the body itself produces free radicals as it processes food. Question: Which of the following not true? Answer: A:","response":"Certain cancers and heart disease are linked to free radicals. B: Our bodies have natural defences for fighting off free radicals. C: Ultraviolet light is the only source of free radicals. D: The substances responsible for the colors in plants and animals belong to a class of chemical called antioxidants. The answer is C: Ultraviolet light is the only source of free radicals.

Answer: Production of consumer HDMI products started in late 2003. Question: what is hdmi out The answer to this question is:","response":"Yes, production of consumer HDMI products started in late 2003. Now, let me provide a detailed and long answer to the question: What is HDMI out? HDMI, which stands for High-Definition Multimedia Interface, is an industry-standard interface used for transmitting high-quality digital audio, video, and control signals over a single cable. It was created by a consortium of electronics manufacturers, including Sony, Philips, Panasonic, and Toshiba, to provide an efficient and reliable solution for connecting various audio and video devices. 'HDMI out' refers to the output port on a device that sends uncompressed digital audio and video signals to other devices, such as a TV, monitor, or audio receiver, through an HDMI cable. This port is typically found on devices like computers, gaming consoles, Blu-ray players, and streaming devices. HDMI out supports various video resolutions, including standard definition (SD), high definition (HD), and ultra-high definition (UHD) formats like 720p, 1080p, and 4K. It can also transmit multi-channel audio formats such as Dolby Digital, DTS, and uncompressed linear PCM, ensuring high-quality audio experiences. Apart from audio and video capabilities, HDMI out also delivers several other benefits: 1. Simplified cabling: Since HDMI out can transmit both audio and video signals through a single cable, it reduces the clutter of multiple cables and makes it easier to set up your entertainment system. 2. Consumer Electronics Control (CEC): HDMI out supports CEC, which enables users to control multiple devices using a single remote control. For instance, if your TV and Blu-ray player both support CEC, you can use the TV remote to control the Blu-ray player's functions when connected via HDMI. 3. Audio Return Channel (ARC): The Audio Return Channel (ARC) feature allows audio signals to travel in both directions on the HDMI cable, simplifying the connection of audio devices. This means that if your TV has built-in streaming apps or an over-the-air tuner, the sound from these sources can be sent back to an audio receiver or soundbar through the HDMI cable, eliminating the need for additional cables. 4. High Bandwidth: HDMI cables have enough bandwidth to support future advancements in audio and video technologies, including 8K video resolutions and high frame rates. Remember to ensure that both your input (source) and output (destination) devices are compatible with the intended resolutions and audio formats before connecting using HDMI out. Additionally, using a high-quality HDMI cable certified for the desired performance level is crucial to avoid signal degradation and ensure optimal results."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Read the following article and answer the question.

Media playback is not supported on this device I feel a bit sorry for Villa boss Remi Garde, because this is not his team - he was not able or allowed to buy a player in January. They are going down, and it is not even with a whimper. Tottenham were given a bit of a reminder of how tough the Premier League can be by 10-man Arsenal last time out, but this is the perfect fixture for them to get back to winning ways. Lawro's prediction: 0-2 Frampton's prediction: 0-3 Match preview As things stand, Steve McClaren is still in charge of Newcastle but we don't know if there will be a new man in the dug-out by the time this game kicks off. Whoever the Magpies manager is, they face a very tough task on Monday. Leicester have got an air about them that says they think they can win the league. They have continued to pick up points without playing well and results have been going their way, which will help convince their players they can do it. Media playback is not supported on this device I want them to win it too - they have played the best football and they have tried to win every game, even when they have been behind - and they are destined to be champions. It would be great if they won it by something like six points so people cannot say they have nicked it, but those who say this is the biggest turnaround by a team in the space of a year are wrong. The best achievement like that was when Nottingham Forest won the title as a newly promoted team in 1978. That usurps Leicester, but only just.

UPDATED:. 17:05 EST, 4 January 2014. A former Tory Minister who is now a key adviser to Boris Johnson has branded the Government sexist after it said adverts for top public sector jobs should be dumbed down to encourage women applicants. Ex-Treasury Minister Angela Knight attacked the ‘action plan’ issued by the Cabinet Office which says public sector bodies should be ‘simplifying adverts and using language which will encourage candidates’. The document adds: ‘Job adverts and specifications [should] use plain English and avoid jargon to appeal to the widest field of applicants.’ Ex-Treasury Minister Angela Knight attacked the 'action plan' issued by the Cabinet Office which says public sector bodies should be 'simplifying adverts and using language which will encourage candidates' Mrs Knight, who has positions in both public and private sector boardrooms, said: ‘I am all in favour of equal opportunities and there is certainly some evidence from the City that women on boards improve company performance. ‘But I don’t think things need to be made simple just so women can get their heads around things. I think organisations should use plain English to attract the right candidates regardless of gender.’ Mrs Knight, 63, sits on the board of Transport for London, a public body which Mr Johnson chairs. She is also chief executive of Energy UK, the industry body for Britain’s biggest power firms. Mrs Knight added: ‘None of my jobs have been traditionally “female”, so I can honestly say it makes no difference to me if my colleagues are male or female. In the end, it’s ability that counts.’ Sarah Wollaston, Tory MP for Totnes, also criticised the plan and asked for the document to be reworded. The guidelines have been published by the Centre for Public Appointments (CPA). Its job is to meet the Government’s target of ensuring that half of all senior posts within Government and public sector organisations are filled by women by 2015. But despite the criticism from Mrs Knight and Ms Wollaston, some female business leaders support the action plan. The document adds: 'Job adverts and specifications [should] use plain English and avoid jargon to appeal to the widest field of applicants' Fiona Hathorn, of independent pressure group Women On Board, said: ‘Top women are being put off when it comes to applying for roles by job advertisements laden with historic public sector jargon.’ The CPA works with the Commissioner for Public Appointments to encourage more women in boardrooms. Commissioner Sir David Normington’s report for 2012-13 paints a rather bleak picture of public sector appointments for women. In 2001, 39 per cent of appointments were made to women. But in 2012-13, that figure had dropped to 35.6 per cent. The Cabinet Office’s own figures for 2012-13, show that most Government departments have failed to reach the equality target. Departments such as the Ministry of Defence had women filling only 17 per cent of vacancies, while the Department for Transport fared even worse at 16 per cent. The Cabinet Office last night denied its action plan was patronising towards women. It said: ‘As part of our wider work to reform Whitehall, we want job advertisements to be clear and free of jargon. 'This is good practice in business. It is simply not true to suggest we are dumbing down for women.’ What are highlight points for this article?","response":"The key highlights of this article are: 1.

REUTERS/Scott Morgan Donald Trump took his escalating feud with \\"Morning Joe\\" to a new level on Monday, threatening to \\"tell the real story\\" of the relationship between hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski. In a series of tweets on Monday, the Republican presidential nominee slammed the MSNBC hosts over their criticism of his brash campaign style. Trump claimed that he would share information about the personal relationship between the two hosts — the subject of much speculation. \\"Tried watching low-rated @Morning_Joe this morning, unwatchable! @morningmika is off the wall, a neurotic and not very bright mess!\\" Trump wrote. Scarborough quickly responded in kind on Twitter, slamming the real-estate mogul over his comments about Brzezinski and refuting Trump's claims that the show's ratings are low. Trump's comments on Monday come after months of criticism from the MSNBC hosts. Last week, Scarborough authored an op-ed in The Washington Post urging Republicans to remove Trump from the ticket, citing his plan to bar all Muslims from entering the US and his refusal to tone down his occasionally authoritarian rhetoric. The relationship between the hosts and Trump wasn't always tense. Earlier in the campaign, critics charged the MSNBC hosts of going too easy on the real-estate magnate, who Scarborough and Brzezinski predicted would be successful in the Republican primary. Scarborough told an audience at a New York event last year that he'd given Trump some advice in preparation for the Republican presidential debates. And during an interview in February, Trump characterized the hosts as \\"supporters,\\" though both hosts denied the assertion. ||||| poster=\\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201608/3753/1155968404_5094054139001_5094035511001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\\" true Trump threatens to 'tell the real story' about Morning Joe 'clowns' Donald Trump laced into the hosts of MSNBC's morning show anew on Monday, accusing one of co-hosts of being \\"neurotic\\" and a \\"mess\\" and both of them as being \\"two clowns.\\" \\"Tried watching low-rated @Morning_Joe this morning, unwatchable! @morningmika is off the wall, a neurotic and not very bright mess!\\" Trump tweeted Monday, referring specifically to Mika Brzezinski, in response to the first hour and 20 minutes of MSNBC's \\"Morning Joe.\\" Story Continued Below Minutes after his initial tweet, Trump offered another personal broadside. \\"Some day, when things calm down, I'll tell the real story of @JoeNBC and his very insecure long-time girlfriend, @morningmika.

On Monday morning he trained his Twitter fire at the MSNBC show \\"Morning Joe,\\" formerly one of his favorite places to campaign. Trump criticized \\"Joe\\" co-host Mika Brzezinski in highly personal terms, calling her \\"off the wall, a neurotic and not very bright mess!\\" He also implied that Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough have been secretly dating. He called them \\"two clowns.\\" The comments about Brzezinski were reminiscent of Trump's highly personal attacks against Fox host Megyn Kelly. The co-hosts were in the middle of a three-hour live broadcast at the time and had been highly critical of Trump earlier in the morning. Scarborough responded during a commercial break, stating that \\"Clinton is targeting key swing states today while Trump starts his day obsessed with cable news hosts while channeling Gawker.\\" He ended the tweet with one of Trump's favorite put-downs: \\"SAD!\\" @HillaryClinton is targeting key swing states today while Trump starts his day obsessed with cable news hosts while channeling Gawker. SAD! — Joe Scarborough (@JoeNBC) August 22, 2016 Trump evidently did not like what he heard on \\"Morning Joe\\" Monday morning. He said he \\"tried watching\\" the talk show but it was \\"unwatchable.\\" (Then he called into a competing morning show, \\"Fox & Friends,\\" one hour later.) Trump has taken similar jabs at \\"Morning Joe\\" before. But his personal references to Brzezinski and Scarborough are new. Trump isn't the first person to wonder aloud if the co-hosts are more than friends. Both Scarborough and Brzezinski recently divorced, and Page Six of the New York Post wrote about \\"romance chatter\\" in June. But coming from the Twitter account of the GOP nominee, the comment raised eyebrows right away. The tweet implied some form of retribution, because he said \\"some day, when things calm down, I'll tell the real story\\" of Scarborough and Brzezinski. A number of political reporters pointed out that Trump's attacks came one day after new campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said that Trump does not hurl \\"personal insults.\\" Trump used to have a cordial, even cozy relationship with \\"Morning Joe.\\" He called into the show regularly during the GOP primary season. At one point he called Scarborough and Brzezinski \\"supporters.\\" Radio host Hugh Hewitt floated the possibility of Scarborough serving as Trump's running mate. The Scarborough-Trump relationship became a source of discomfort inside NBC, CNNMoney reported in mid-February. But the relationship soon turned sour. At the end of February Scarborough deemed Trump's failure to immediately disavow the support of former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke \\"disqualifying.\\" Scarborough and Brzezinski stepped up their scrutiny of Trump throughout the spring and summer. Earlier this month, Scarborough urged the GOP to dump the candidate. Seemingly in response, Trump jabbed \\"Morning Joe,\\" calling out its \\"low ratings,\\" even though the show's ratings have been relatively strong this year. Trump also said \\"I don't watch anymore.\\" But since he tuned in on Monday, Scarborough responded to him on Twitter this way: \\"Thanks for watching!!! Morning Joe is enjoying it's best ratings ever thanks to obsessed fans like you! GLAD!!!\\" Even before Monday's back-and-forth started, Trump insulted one of the regular commentators on \\"Morning Joe,\\" ad executive Donny Deutsch, in a tweet on Sunday night. Trump wrote: \\"I heard that @Morning_Joe was very nice on Friday but that little Donny D, a big failure in TV (& someone I helped), was nasty.

Step 5: Write the introduction In the introduction, I'll provide basic information about the film, such as its title, director, year of release, and a brief, spoiler-free summary of the plot. Step 6: Write the body of the review In this section, I'll elaborate on the key points I mentioned earlier, providing specific examples from the film. I'll discuss how Nolan's direction exemplifies the complex and layered storytelling, the incredible action sequences, and the exceptional cast that brings the story to life.

Step 8: Write the conclusion In the conclusion, I'll summarize my feelings about the movie and give a final recommendation. I'll also suggest who might enjoy the film most, based on its themes and style. Resulting Review: Title: Inception: A Mind-Bending Adventure in Dreamscape Inception, directed by Christopher Nolan and released in 2010, is a sci-fi thriller that follows the journey of Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his team of dream infiltrators as they delve deep into the subconscious of a corporate heir (Cillian Murphy) to plant an idea. The movie immerses viewers in a multi-layered dreamscape, featuring stunning visuals and a thought-provoking exploration of reality and dreams. Nolan's direction is masterful, weaving a complex narrative with intricate plot twists that challenge the viewer's understanding of what is real and what is imagined. The impressive action sequences, such as the gravity-defying hallway fight and the multi-layered chase through different dream levels, keep the audience on the edge of their seats. The ensemble cast, which includes Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, and Tom Hardy, delivers outstanding performances that highlight the emotional stakes behind the intellectual heist. However, Inception is not without its flaws. The film's complex plot can make it challenging to follow at times, and the pacing occasionally falters – particularly as the movie approaches its climax. Nonetheless, these issues do not detract from the overall experience. In conclusion, Inception is a mind-bending cinematic adventure that pushes the boundaries of conventional storytelling and visuals, making it a must-see for fans of thought-provoking sci-fi. The movie is best suited for those who appreciate intricate narratives and enjoy being immersed in a fantastical world with a strong emotional core."},{"question":"Title: WHAT???

Death of her father The answer is:","response":"Title: The Shattered Locket Plot Summary: Katniss Everdeen, a skilled hunter and young heroine, faces her most challenging trial yet as she fights for her life in the deadly Hunger Games. After being stung by tracker jackers, she begins to hallucinate about the dreadful day when her father lost his life in a mine explosion. As her disoriented mind grapples with her haunting past and her father's legacy, Katniss must also confront the present reality of the deadly arena and outsmart her dangerous adversaries. Act 1: The Past Unveiled The story begins with Katniss hunting in the woods, a bittersweet haven that brings her solace but also reminds her of her father's death. As she scours the wilderness for food for her family, flashbacks of the tragic mine explosion that killed her father fill her thoughts. In these flashbacks, we see Katniss as a young girl mirroring her father's love for the woods, and the unbreakable bond they shared. As the Hunger Games begin and Katniss enters the ruthless arena, she courageously confronts her adversaries and does everything possible to survive. While Katniss and her fellow tribute, Peeta, find temporary safety in a tree, they are suddenly attacked by tracker jackers. Katniss, although brave and resourceful, can't avoid being stung. Act 2: Illusions of the Abyss As the venom from the tracker jacker stings courses through Katniss' body, the ghastly hallucinations begin. In her impaired state, she relives the gruesome events of her father's death repeatedly, each time revealing more intricate and harrowing details. Katniss must navigate these lucid nightmares while struggling to escape from both the deadly swarm and her vicious opponents. During these hallucinations, Katniss discovers the intricate locket her father had left her. It's never far from her heart, and inside, she finds a series of cryptic messages and clues that her father had intended her to unravel. As Katniss seeks to decode the enigma, the locket serves as a bridge between her nightmarish visions and the perilous arena. Act 3: The Locket's Legacy In a series of life-threatening events, Katniss uses her wits and bravery to overcome her enemies and work through her grief. Each clue in the locket reveals a profound lesson her father had taught her, and these lessons prove essential in aiding her survival within the arena. They also provide Katniss with a deeper understanding of herself and the strength she possesses. As the locket's messages become clearer, Katniss realizes that her father is guiding her from beyond the grave. The wisdom he imparted to her becomes instrumental in helping Katniss and Peeta triumph in the arena and cheat the Capital of a sole victor. Epilogue: Embracing the Past, Facing the Future Upon winning the Hunger Games, Katniss and Peeta return to District 12 as reluctant heroes. As their lives slowly begin to resume a semblance of normalcy, Katniss finds solace in the knowledge that her father's legacy lives on through her. The love and guidance she received from him aid her in becoming an unwavering symbol of hope and rebellion in the face of the oppressive Capital. With a newfound understanding of her father's everlasting presence, Katniss embarks on a grueling journey to avenge his death and incite change in a broken society. Bolstered by her experiences in the arena and the profound wisdom imparted by her father's locket, Katniss steps into a future filled with purpose and the resolve to fight for a better tomorrow."},{"question":"Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the person who Ross claims was \\"subtly changing the landscape of contemporary R&B lyricism\\"?

If you exhale after five minutes, you are no longer holding your breath. Additionally, holding your breath for five minutes can be dangerous and is not recommended for individuals who are not trained to do so."},{"question":"Information: - Jacob Taio Cruz (born Adetayo Ayowale Onile-Ere; 23 April), is a British singer, songwriter, rapper and record producer.

The question and answer pair are described below.","response":"Question: What are the sounds that zebras make? Answer: Zebras are known for making a variety of sounds, which are helpful in communicating with other members of their social group. These sounds include loud braying or barking sounds as well as soft snorting sounds. 1. Loud braying or barking sounds: Zebras use these calls to communicate with other zebras in their social group. These sounds are distinctive and can travel over long distances, allowing zebras to make their presence known, send signals of alarm, or maintain contact with other members of their group. This braying or barking noise can sometimes resemble a donkey's \\"hee-haw.\\" This sound may serve different purposes, such as helping them establish dominance, express worry or excitement, or alert other zebras of potential danger in the vicinity. 2. Soft snorting sounds: Zebras also produce soft snorts, which are generally quieter and are used for day-to-day communication. These sounds can be a friendly gesture or convey various other emotions, such as reassurance, contentment, or relaxation. Soft snorts are also used when zebras are grooming each other or when greeting another member of their social group. In conclusion, zebras communicate through a mix of loud braying/barking sounds and soft snorting sounds, depending on the context and the message they want to send to other zebras. These sounds play a vital role in maintaining social bonds, expressing emotions, and warning others of potential threats."},{"question":"Q: If you are going to watch your favorite team play a sport what is the most likely thing someone will tell you when you let them know?

The Kinks' next single, \\"Waterloo Sunset\\", was released in May 1967. The lyrics describe two lovers passing over a bridge, with a melancholic observer reflecting on the couple, the Thames and Waterloo station. The song was rumoured to have been inspired by the romance between two British celebrities of the time, actors Terence Stamp and Julie Christie. Ray Davies denied this in his autobiography, and claimed in a 2008 interview, \\"It was a fantasy about my sister going off with her boyfriend to a new world and they were going to emigrate and go to another country.\\" Despite its complex arrangement, the sessions for \\"Waterloo Sunset\\" lasted a mere ten hours; Dave Davies later commented on the recording: \\"We spent a lot of time trying to get a different guitar sound, to get a more unique feel for the record. In the end we used a tape-delay echo, but it sounded new because nobody had done it since the 1950s. I remember Steve Marriott of the Small Faces came up and asked me how we'd got that sound. We were almost trendy for a while.\\" The single was one of the Kinks' biggest UK successes (hitting number two on Melody Maker's chart), and went on to become one of their most popular and best-known songs.

Your task is to summarize them. Problem:Audio: Listen to this story. To hear more feature stories, download the Audm app for your iPhone. In February, 2000, The American Journal of Psychiatry published a concise review of a not-at-all-concise book. The book, “Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief,” was nearly six hundred pages long, and, although it was published by the academic press Routledge, it fit neatly within no scholarly discipline. The reviewer, a sympathetic professor of psychiatry, bravely attempted to explain such forbidding phrases as “the grammatical structure of transformational mythology.” Then he admitted defeat. “Doing justice to this tome in a two-paragraph synopsis is impossible,” he concluded. “This is not a book to be abstracted and summarized.” But he expressed the hope that curious souls would nevertheless discover this curious book, and savor it “at leisure.” Eighteen years later, the author of “Maps of Meaning,” Jordan B. Peterson, has produced a sequel, of sorts. It’s called “12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos,” and it has become an international blockbuster. Peterson, formerly an obscure professor, is now one of the most influential—and polarizing—public intellectuals in the English-speaking world. Lots of fans find him on YouTube, where he is an unusual sort of celebrity, a stern but mercurial lecturer who often holds forth for hours, mixing polemics with pep talks. Peterson grew up in Fairview, Canada, a small town in Northern Alberta, and he has a fondness for quaint slang; his accent and vocabulary combine to make him seem like a man out of time and out of place, especially in America. His central message is a thoroughgoing critique of modern liberal culture, which he views as suicidal in its eagerness to upend age-old verities. And he has learned to distill his wide-ranging theories into pithy sentences, including one that has become his de facto catchphrase, a possibly spurious quote that nevertheless captures his style and his substance: “Sort yourself out, bucko.” Peterson is fifty-five, and his delayed success should give hope to underappreciated academics everywhere. For a few years, in the nineteen-nineties, he taught psychology at Harvard; by the time he published “Maps of Meaning,” in 1999, he was back in Canada—teaching at the University of Toronto, working as a clinical psychologist, and building a reputation, on television, as an acerbic pundit. His fame grew in 2016, during the debate over a Canadian bill known as C-16. The bill sought to expand human-rights law by adding “gender identity and gender expression” to the list of grounds upon which discrimination is prohibited. In a series of videotaped lectures, Peterson argued that such a law could be a serious infringement of free speech. His main focus was the issue of pronouns: many transgender or gender-nonbinary people use pronouns different from the ones they were assigned at birth—including, sometimes, “they,” in the singular, or nontraditional ones, like “ze.” The Ontario Human Rights Commission had found that, in a workplace or a school, “refusing to refer to a trans person by their chosen name and a personal pronoun that matches their gender identity” would probably be considered discrimination. Peterson resented the idea that the government might force him to use what he called neologisms of politically correct “authoritarians.” During one debate, recorded at the University of Toronto, he said, “I am not going to be a mouthpiece for language that I detest.” Then he folded his arms, adding, “And that’s that!” Such videos reached millions of online viewers, including plenty with no particular stake in Canadian human-rights legislation. To many people disturbed by reports of intolerant radicals on campus, Peterson was a rallying figure: a fearsomely self-assured debater, unintimidated by liberal condemnation. Students staged rowdy protests. The dean of the university sent him a letter warning that his pledge not to use certain pronouns revealed “discriminatory intentions”; the letter also warned, “The impact of your behavior runs the risk of undermining your ability to conduct essential components of your job as a faculty member.” Last fall, a teaching assistant at Wilfrid Laurier University, in Waterloo, Ontario, was reprimanded by professors for showing her class a clip of one of Peterson’s debates. (The university later apologized.) The reprisals only raised Peterson’s profile, and he capitalized on the attention on his Patreon page, where devotees can pledge monthly payments in exchange for exclusive Q. & A. sessions and online courses. Earlier this year, Peterson appeared on Channel 4 News, in Britain. The interviewer, Cathy Newman, asked what gave him the right to offend transgender people. He asked, cheerfully, what gave her the right to risk offending him. Newman paused for an excruciating few moments, and Peterson allowed himself a moment of triumph. “Ha! Gotcha,” he said. David Brooks, in the Times, said that Peterson reminded him of “a young William F. Buckley.” Tucker Carlson, on Fox News, called the exchange with Newman “one of the great interviews of all time.” Given the popularity of these online debates, it can be easy to forget that arguing against political correctness is not Peterson’s main occupation. He remains a psychology professor by trade, and he still spends much of his time doing something like therapy. Anyone in need of his counsel can find plenty of it in “12 Rules for Life.” The book is far easier to comprehend than its predecessor, though it may confuse those who know Peterson only as a culture warrior. One of his many fans is PewDiePie, a Swedish video gamer who is known as the most widely viewed YouTube personality in the world—his channel has more than sixty million subscribers. In a video review of “12 Rules for Life,” PewDiePie confessed that the book had surprised him. “It’s a self-help book!” he said. “I don’t think I ever would have read a self-help book.” (He nonetheless declared that Peterson’s book, at least the parts he read, was “very interesting.”) Peterson himself embraces the self-help genre, to a point. The book is built around forthright and perhaps impractically specific advice, from Chapter 1, “Stand Up Straight with Your Shoulders Back,” to Chapter 12, “Pet a Cat When You Encounter One on the Street.” Political polemic plays a relatively small role; Peterson’s goal is less to help his readers change the world than to help them find a stable place within it. One of his most compelling maxims is strikingly modest: “You should do what other people do, unless you have a very good reason not to.” Of course, he is famous today precisely because he has determined that, in a range of circumstances, there are good reasons to buck the popular tide. He is, by turns, a defender of conformity and a critic of it, and he thinks that if readers pay close attention, they, too, can learn when to be which. Like many conversion stories, Peterson’s begins with a crisis of faith—a series of them, in fact. He was raised Protestant, and as a boy he was sent to confirmation class, where he asked the teacher to defend the literal truth of Biblical creation stories. The teacher’s response was convincing neither to Peterson nor, Peterson suspected, to the teacher himself. In “Maps of Meaning,” he remembered his reaction. “Religion was for the ignorant, weak, and superstitious,” he wrote. “I stopped attending church, and joined the modern world.” He turned first to socialism and then to political science, seeking an explanation for “the general social and political insanity and evil of the world,” and each time finding himself unsatisfied. (This was the Cold War era, and Peterson was preoccupied by the possibility of nuclear annihilation.) The question was, he decided, a psychological one, so he sought psychological answers, and eventually earned a Ph.D. from McGill University, having written a thesis examining the heritability of alcoholism. All the while, Peterson was also pursuing a grander, stranger project. He had fallen under the sway of Carl Jung, the mystical Swiss psychology pioneer who interpreted modern life as an endless drama, haunted by ancient myths. (Peterson calls Jung “ever-terrifying,” which is a very Jungian sort of compliment.) In “Maps of Meaning,” Peterson drew from Jung, and from evolutionary psychology: he wanted to show that modern culture is “natural,” having evolved over hundreds of thousands of years to reflect and meet our human needs. Then, rather audaciously, he sought to explain exactly how our minds work, illustrating his theory with elaborate geometric diagrams (“The Constituent Elements of Experience as Personality, Territory, and Process”) that seemed to have been created for the purpose of torturing undergraduates. The new book replaces charts with cheerful drawings of Peterson’s children acting out his advice. In the foreword, Peterson’s friend Norman Doidge, a prominent psychiatrist, tells about meeting him at an outdoor lunch at the house of a mutual friend; Peterson was wearing cowboy boots, and determinedly ignoring a swarm of bees. “He had this odd habit,” Doidge writes, “of speaking about the deepest questions to whoever was at this table—most of them new acquaintances—as though he were just making small talk.” Throughout the book, Peterson supplies small and strange interjections of autobiography. He recalls the time an old friend named Ed came to visit, accompanied by another guy who was, in Peterson’s estimation, “stoned out of his gourd.” Alarmed, Peterson staged a kind of intervention. “I took Ed aside and told him politely that he had to leave,” Peterson writes. “I said that he shouldn’t have brought his useless bastard of a companion.” Ed took his friend and left—fearing, perhaps, to discover what a less polite admonition would have sounded like. Peterson has a way of making even the mildest pronouncement sound like the dying declaration of a political prisoner. In “Maps of Meaning,” he traced this sense of urgency to a feeling of fraudulence that overcame him in college. When he started to speak, he would hear a voice telling him, “You don’t believe that. That isn’t true.” To ward off mental breakdown, he resolved not to say anything unless he was sure he believed it; this practice calmed the inner voice, and in time it shaped his rhetorical style, which is forceful but careful. In “12 Rules for Life,” Peterson recounts a similar experience when, as a psychologist, he worked with a client diagnosed with paranoia. He says that such patients are “almost uncanny in their ability to detect mixed motives, judgment, and falsehood,” and so he redoubled his efforts to say only what he meant. “You have to listen very carefully and tell the truth if you are going to get a paranoid person to open up to you,” he writes. Peterson seems to have found that this approach works on much of the general population, too. If he once had a tendency to shut himself up, Peterson has wholly overcome it. “Do Not Bother Children When They Are Skateboarding,” he proclaims (Rule 11), but the expected riff about “overprotected” children leads elsewhere: to a grim story about a troubled friend who committed suicide, and then to a remembrance of a professor who boasted that he and his wife had made an ethical decision to have only one child, and from there to an argument that both the unhappy friend and the arrogant professor were “anti-human, to the core.” Elsewhere in the chapter, he writes that “boys’ interests tilt towards things” and “girls’ interests tilt towards people,” and that these interests are “strongly influenced by biological factors.” He is particularly concerned about boys and men, and he flatters them with regular doses of tough love. “Boys are suffering in the modern world,” he writes, and he suggests that the problem is that they’re not boyish enough. Near the end of the chapter, he tries to coin a new catchphrase: “Toughen up, you weasel.” When he does battle as a culture warrior, especially on television, Peterson sometimes assumes the role of a strident anti-feminist, intent on ending the oppression of males by destroying the myth of male oppression. (He once referred to his critics as “rabid harpies.”) But his tone is more pragmatic in this book, and some of his critics might be surprised to find much of the advice he offers unobjectionable, if old-fashioned: he wants young men to be better fathers, better husbands, better community members. In this way, he might be seen as an heir to older gurus of manhood like Elbert Hubbard, who in 1899 published a stern and wildly popular homily called “A Message to Garcia.” (What young men most needed, Hubbard wrote, was “a stiffening of the vertebrae.”) Peterson is an heir, too, to the professional pickup artists who proliferated in the aughts, making a different appeal to feckless men. Where the pickup artists promised to make guys better sexual salesmen (sexual consummation was called “full close,” as in closing a deal), Peterson, more ambitious, promises to help them get married and stay married. “You have to scour your psyche,” he tells them. “You have to clean the damned thing up.” When he claims to have identified “the culminating ethic of the canon of the West,” one might brace for provocation. But what follows, instead, is prescription so canonical that it seems self-evident: “Attend to the day, but aim at the highest good.” In urging men to overachieve, he is also urging them to fit in, and become productive members of Western society. Every so often, Peterson pauses to remind his readers how lucky they are. “The highly functional infrastructure that surrounds us, particularly in the West,” he writes, “is a gift from our ancestors: the comparatively uncorrupt political and economic systems, the technology, the wealth, the lifespan, the freedom, the luxury, and the opportunity.” This may sound strange to readers in the United States, where a widespread perception of dysfunction unites politicians and commentators who agree on little else. But Peterson does not live in Donald Trump’s America; in Canada, the Prime Minister is Justin Trudeau, who seems to strike Peterson as the embodiment of wimpy and fraudulent liberalism. Recently, after Trudeau tried to cut off a rambling questioner by half-joking that she should say “peoplekind” instead of “mankind,” Peterson appeared on “Fox & Friends” to register his objection. “I’m afraid that our Prime Minister is only capable of running his ideas on a few very narrow ideological tracks,” he said. Peterson seems to view Trump, by contrast, as a symptom of modern problems, rather than a cause of them. He suggests that Trump’s rise was unfortunate but inevitable—“part of the same process,” he writes, as the rise of “far-right” politicians in Europe. “If men are pushed too hard to feminize,” he warns, “they will become more and more interested in harsh, fascist political ideology.” Peterson sometimes asks audiences to view him as an alternative to political excesses on both sides. During an interview on BBC Radio 5, he said, “I’ve had thousands of letters from people who were tempted by the blandishments of the radical right, who’ve moved towards the reasonable center as a consequence of watching my videos.” But he typically sees liberals, or leftists, or “postmodernists,” as aggressors—which leads him, rather ironically, to frame some of those on the “radical right” as victims. Many of his political stances are built on this type of inversion. Postmodernists, he says, are obsessed with the idea of oppression, and, by waging war on oppressors real and imagined, they become oppressors themselves. Liberals, he says, are always talking about the importance of compassion—and yet “there’s nothing more horrible for children, and developing people, than an excess of compassion.” (This horror, he says, is embodied in the figure of the “Freudian devouring mother”; as an example, he cites Ursula, the sea witch from “The Little Mermaid.”) The danger, it seems, is that those who want to improve Western society may end up destroying it. Peterson thinks that this danger has a lot to do with men and women, and the changing way we think about them. “The division of life into its twin sexes occurred before the evolution of multi-cellular animals,” he writes, by way of arguing that human beings are bound to care about this division. During his Channel 4 News debate, Cathy Newman pressed him on whether he supported gender equality, and he replied that it depended on what the term meant. “If it means equality of outcome, then almost certainly it’s undesirable,” he said. “Men and women won’t sort themselves into the same categories, if you leave them alone.” (He mentioned that in Scandinavia, an unusually egalitarian part of the world, men are vastly overrepresented among engineers, and women among nurses.) Convictions such as these inspire in him a general skepticism of efforts to redress gender inequality. He has argued that traditionally feminine traits, such as agreeableness, are not historically correlated with professional success. (He says that, as a psychologist, he has often counselled female clients to be more assertive at work.) When Newman suggested that this correlation might merely reflect the ways women have been shut out of corporate leadership, Peterson sounded doubtful. “It could be the case that if companies modified their behavior, and became more feminine, that they would be successful,” he said. “But there’s no evidence for that.” Peterson is not primarily interested in policy, but he was eager to join the debate over C-16, the Canadian bill forbidding discrimination on the basis of gender identity or expression. In opposing the bill, Peterson claimed the mantle of free speech. “There’s a difference,” he explained, “between saying that there’s something you can’t say, and saying that there are things that you have to say.” But if laws against discrimination also prohibit harassment, they will necessarily prohibit some forms of verbal harassment—and they will therefore, to a greater or lesser extent, limit speech. Canada already limits speech in ways that the U.S. does not: a law against “hate speech” was repealed in 2013, but the government still bans “hate propaganda.” From an American perspective, such laws may seem ill-advised, or even oppressive. Still, like many free-speech arguments, this one was in large part a debate over the political status of a minority group. The C-16 debate is over, for now—the bill passed and was enacted last summer. But Peterson remains a figurehead for the movement to block or curtail transgender rights. When he lampoons “made-up pronouns,” he sometimes seems to be lampooning the people who use them, encouraging his fans to view transgender or gender-nonbinary people as confused, or deluded. Once, after a lecture, he was approached on campus by a critic who wanted to know why he would not use nonbinary pronouns. “I don’t believe that using your pronouns will do you any good, in the long run,” he replied. So what does Peterson actually believe about gender and pronouns? It can be hard to tell. Later in that campus conversation, when asked whether, in the absence of legal coercion, he would be willing to use pronouns such as “they” and “them” if a trans person asked him to, Peterson demurred. “It might depend on how they asked,” he said. One of his foundational beliefs is that cultures evolve, which suggests that nonstandard pronouns could become standard. In a debate about gender on Canadian television, in 2016, he tried to find some middle ground. “If our society comes to some sort of consensus over the next while about how we’ll solve the pronoun problem,” he said, “and that becomes part of popular parlance, and it seems to solve the problem properly, without sacrificing the distinction between singular and plural, and without requiring me to memorize an impossible list of an indefinite number of pronouns, then I would be willing to reconsider my position.” Despite his fondness for moral absolutes, Peterson is something of a relativist; he is inclined to defer to a Western society that is changing in unpredictable ways. In discussing the many women who have criticized him, he has talked about how verbal disagreements commonly contain an implicit threat of violence, and about how such implicit threats are “forbidden” when men are addressing women. And yet, even when the topic is as elemental as male-female violence, our norms are changing: in the United States, laws against spousal violence were first enacted in the middle of the nineteenth century; laws against spousal rape are only a few decades old. Not long ago, these laws might have seemed intrusive and disruptive; now, many people shudder at the notion that it might ever have been legal for a man to physically assault his wife. Peterson excels at explaining why we should be careful about social change, but not at helping us assess which changes we should favor; just about any modern human arrangement could be portrayed as a radical deviation from what came before. In the case of gender identity, Peterson’s judgment is that “our society” has not yet agreed to adopt nontraditional pronouns, which isn’t quite an argument that we shouldn’t. And this judgment isn’t likely to be persuasive to people in places—like some North American college campuses, perhaps—where the singular “they” has already come to seem like part of the social fabric. ||||| Perhaps she has used that tactic to good effect elsewhere. (And the online attacks to which she’s been subjected are abhorrent assaults on decency by people who are perpetrating misbehavior orders of magnitude worse than hers.) But in the interview, Newman relies on this technique to a remarkable extent, making it a useful illustration of a much broader pernicious trend. Peterson was not evasive or unwilling to be clear about his meaning. And Newman’s exaggerated restatements of his views mostly led viewers astray, not closer to the truth. * * * Peterson begins the interview by explaining why he tells young men to grow up and take responsibility for getting their lives together and becoming good partners. He notes he isn’t talking exclusively to men, and that he has lots of female fans. “What’s in it for the women, though?” Newman asks. “Well, what sort of partner do you want?” Peterson says. “Do you want an overgrown child? Or do you want someone to contend with who is going to help you?” “So you’re saying,” Newman retorts, “that women have some sort of duty to help fix the crisis of masculinity.” But that’s not what he said. He posited a vested interest, not a duty. “Women deeply want men who are competent and powerful,” Peterson goes on to assert. “And I don’t mean power in that they can exert tyrannical control over others. That’s not power. That’s just corruption. Power is competence. And why in the world would you not want a competent partner? Well, I know why, actually, you can’t dominate a competent partner. So if you want domination—” The interviewer interrupts, “So you’re saying women want to dominate, is that what you’re saying?” The next section of the interview concerns the pay gap between men and women, and whether it is rooted in gender itself or other nondiscriminatory factors: Newman: … that 9 percent pay gap, that’s a gap between median hourly earnings between men and women. That exists. Peterson: Yes. But there’s multiple reasons for that. One of them is gender, but that’s not the only reason. If you’re a social scientist worth your salt, you never do a univariate analysis. You say women in aggregate are paid less than men. Okay. Well then we break its down by age; we break it down by occupation; we break it down by interest; we break it down by personality. Newman: But you’re saying, basically, it doesn’t matter if women aren’t getting to the top, because that’s what is skewing that gender pay gap, isn’t it? You’re saying that’s just a fact of life, women aren’t necessarily going to get to the top. Peterson: No, I’m not saying it doesn’t matter, either. I’m saying there are multiple reasons for it. Newman: Yeah, but why should women put up with those reasons? Peterson: I’m not saying that they should put up with it! I’m saying that the claim that the wage gap between men and women is only due to sex is wrong. And it is wrong. There’s no doubt about that. The multivariate analysis have been done. So let me give you an example–– The interviewer seemed eager to impute to Peterson a belief that a large, extant wage gap between men and women is a “fact of life” that women should just “put up with,” though all those assertions are contrary to his real positions on the matter. ||||| A brief video on the utility of taking aim--even badly.

It’s a counter-intuitive strategy for a population hooked on the instant gratification of ideological conformity and social media ‘likes,’ but if Peterson is right, you have nothing to lose but your own misery.” —Toronto Star “In a different intellectual league. . . . Peterson can take the most difficult ideas and make them entertaining. This may be why his YouTube videos have had 35 million views. He is fast becoming the closest that academia has to a rock star.” —The Observer “Grow up and man up is the message from this rock-star psychologist. . . . [A] hardline self-help manual of self-reliance, good behaviour, self-betterment and individualism that probably reflects his childhood in rural Canada in the 1960s. As with all self-help manuals, there’s always a kernel of truth. Formerly a Harvard professor, now at the University of Toronto, Peterson retains that whiff of cowboy philosophy—one essay is a homily on doing one thing every day to improve yourself. Another, on bringing up little children to behave, is excellent…. [Peterson] twirls ideas around like a magician.” —Melanie Reid, The Times “You don’t have to agree with [Peterson’s politics] to like this book for, once you discard the self-help label, it becomes fascinating. Peterson is brilliant on many subjects. . . . So what we have here is a baggy, aggressive, in-your-face, get-real book that, ultimately, is an attempt to lead us back to what Peterson sees as the true, the beautiful and the good—i.e. God. In the highest possible sense of the term, I suppose it is a self-help book. . . . Either way, it’s a rocky read, but nobody ever said God was easy.” —Bryan Appleyard, The Times “One of the most eclectic and stimulating public intellectuals at large today, fearless and impassioned.” —The Guardian “Someone with not only humanity and humour, but serious depth and substance. . . . Peterson has a truly cosmopolitan and omnivorous intellect, but one that recognizes that things need grounding in a home if they are ever going to be meaningfully grasped. . . . As well as being funny, there is a burning sincerity to the man which only the most withered cynic could suspect.” —The Spectator “Peterson has become a kind of secular prophet who, in an era of lobotomized conformism, thinks out of the box. . . . His message is overwhelmingly vital.” —Melanie Philips, The Times ||||| Dr.Jordan Peterson delivering a lecture at the University of Toronto in 2017 (Adam Jacobs, CC BY 2.0, via Wikimedia Commons) The Jordan Peterson Phenomenon Jordan Peterson’s new book, an elaboration of 12 basic psychological rules for life, makes for bracing and satisfying reading Like many others, I have watched the Jordan Peterson phenomenon unfold with a certain fascination. If you don’t know what I’m talking about, you don’t spend a lot of time on social media, for Peterson, a mild-mannered psychology professor from the University of Toronto, has emerged as one of the hottest personalities on the internet. He is followed by millions of people, especially young men. His lectures and presentations—cool, understated, brainy, and blunt—are avidly watched and commented upon. And his new book, 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos, is a number one bestseller all over the world. Moreover, Peterson’s spirited and articulate opposition to the imposition of speech codes in his native Canada has made him a controversial political player, a hero of free speech to his supporters and a right-wing ideologue to his detractors. His interview with Cathy Newman of Channel 4 News, during which Peterson’s interlocutor revealed herself as a hopelessly biased social justice warrior, has, as of this writing, been viewed 7.5 million times. In many ways, Peterson is doing for this generation what Joseph Campbell did for the previous one, namely, reintroducing the archetypal psychology of C.G. Jung in an appealing and provocative manner. Jung’s theorizing centered around what he termed the archetypes of the collective unconscious, which is to say, those primordial instincts, insights, and memories that influence much of our behavior and that substantially inform the religions, philosophies, and rituals of the human race. The Jungian template enables Peterson to interpret many of the classical spiritual texts of Western culture in a fresh way—those very texts so often excoriated by mainstream intellectuals as hopelessly patriarchal, biased, and oppressive. It also permits him to speak with a kind of psychological and spiritual authority to which young people are not accustomed but to which they respond eagerly. His new book, an elaboration of twelve basic psychological rules for life, makes for bracing and satisfying reading. Peterson’s considerable erudition is on clear display throughout, but so is his very real experience in the trenches as a practicing psychotherapist. His advice is smart indeed, but it never seems abstract, detached, or unrealistic. In the course of this brief article, I can only hint at some of his fascinating findings and recommendations. A theme that runs through the entire book is that of the play between order and chaos, symbolized most neatly by the intertwining fish of the Tao image. Human consciousness itself, Peterson argues, sets one foot in the former and the other in the latter, balancing the known and the unknown, the settled and the unexplored. Too much of one, and we fall into complacency, routine, and at the limit, tyranny; too much of the other, and we lose our bearings completely, surrendering to the void. The great myths of the hero—from Gilgamesh to Luke Skywalker and Bilbo Baggins—typically recount the story of someone who leaves complacent domesticity behind in order to venture into the dangerous unknown, where he manages to find something of enormous value to his family or village or society. One key to psychological/spiritual fulfillment is to embody this archetype of the hero, to live one’s life as an adventurous exploration of the unknown. So Peterson tells his readers—especially young men, who have been cowed into complacency for various reasons—to throw back their shoulders, stand tall, and face the challenges of life head on. This archetype of the hero also allows us to read the story of Adam and Eve with fresh eyes. In Paradise (the word itself denotes \\"walled garden\\"), our first parents were secure and innocent, but in the manner of inexperienced children. Leaving Paradise was, in one sense, a positive move, for it permitted them to grow up, to engage the chaos of the unknown creatively and intelligently. This reading of Genesis, which has roots in Tillich, Hegel, and others, permits us to see that the goal of the spiritual life is not a simple return to the Garden of dreaming innocence, but rather an inhabiting of the Garden on the far side of the cross, that place where the tomb of Jesus was situated and in which the risen Christ appeared precisely as “gardener.” Peterson’s investigation of the psyche of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn was, for me, one of the most illuminating sections of the book. Solzhenitsyn, of course, was a victim of both Hitler and Stalin, a terrorized and dehumanized inmate in the Gulag Archipelago, and one of the most tortured of souls in the terrible twentieth century. It would have been surpassingly easy for him simply to curse his fate, to lash out in anger at God, to become a sullen figure scurrying about the margins of life. Instead, he endeavored to change his own life, to turn the light of his moral consciousness on himself, to get his psychological house in order. This initial move enabled him to see the world around him with extraordinary clarity and, eventually, to tell the story of Soviet depravity with such devastating moral authority. The lesson that Peterson draws from this example is this: if you want to change the corrupt world, “start to stop doing what you know to be wrong. Start stopping today.” I have shared just a handful of wise insights from a book that is positively chockablock with them. So do I thoroughly support Jordan Peterson’s approach? Well, no, though a full explication of my objection would take us far beyond the confines of this brief article. In a word, I have the same concern about Peterson that I have about both Campbell and Jung, namely, the Gnosticizing tendency to read Biblical religion purely psychologically and philosophically and not at all historically. No Christian should be surprised that the Scriptures can be profitably read through psychological and philosophical lenses, but at the same time, every Christian has to accept the fact that the God of the Bible is not simply a principle or an abstraction, but rather a living God who acts in history. As I say, to lay this out thoroughly would require at least another article or two or twelve. On balance, I like this book and warmly recommend it. I think it’s especially valuable for the beleaguered young men in our society, who need a mentor to tell them to stand up straight and act like heroes. ||||| Solution:","response":"Part 1: Summarize news articles separated by special tokens.

Instead, practice proper foot hygiene on a daily basis and treat yourself to a weekly or semimonthly self-pedicure. If you do go for a pedicure, bring your own tools whenever possible. Never share pedicure instruments with others, especially emery boards. They are porous and cannot be sterilized properly, meaning they can trap and spread bacterial and fungi.

The disease can also prevent your body from healing as quickly as it should, which increases the risk of infection. Diabetics should examine their feet every day for injuries like blisters, calluses, scaly skin patches, cracking skin, and cuts and wounds. Treat wounds immediately, and make sure your doctor looks at your feet at every visit. There are several bacterial, viral, and fungal problems that can adversely affect the health and appearance of your feet, including athlete’s foot, warts, and nail fungus. When using public swimming pools or showers (such as at hotels or gyms), wear water shoes or flip flops to protect your feet from possibly contaminated water. Symptoms of athlete’s foot include burning, itching, redness, and peeling. Warts are rough, grainy growths on the skin that may have black pinpoints scattered throughout. Nail fungus, which can enter the toenail through a crack or break, can cause nails to become brittle, thick, and discolored. Chronic foot pain is never normal, and should always be addressed with a medical practitioner. It can be a sign of plantar fasciitis, a stabbing pain and inflammation down the bottom center of the foot, which needs to be treated with therapy, orthotics, or possibly surgery. Aging, extreme cold, and joint pain can also cause foot pain, but if you frequently experience pain in your feet, talk to your doctor. There are many common medical problems that can cause foot pain and irritation, or make you embarrassed about the look of your feet. Sometimes there is nothing you can do about these conditions, but many can be treated with a little attention, orthotics, or perhaps medical attention. Some of the most common conditions involving the feet include: A bunion, which is a protruding bone that sticks out from the side of your foot where the big toe meets the foot. Bunions can cause pain, but unless the pain is severe, shoe inserts and cushions are usually favored over surgery. Hammertoes, which occur when the toes begin to bend downward at the middle joint because of out-of-balance muscles. This condition can be treated with proper footwear, foot supports, or possibly surgery. Having flat feet, when the entire sole of your foot makes contact with the ground. It is treated with strengthening exercises, arch supporting inserts, or orthotics. Calluses and corns, which are patches of thick, hard skin caused by constant pressure and rubbing. They can be trimmed or removed medically, treated with medicated pads and patches, or softened with soaking and gentle scrubbing with pumice. Gout, which is characterized by swelling, stiffness, pain, and redness of the joints in the feet, especially the big toe, as well as the ankles and knees. Gout is a form of arthritis and is treated with anti-inflammatory drugs.

They tend to his wounds, and when the man wakes, they find he suffers from dissociative amnesia. He has no memory of his own identity, while he retains his speech and finds himself capable of advanced combat skills and fluency in several languages. The skipper finds a tiny laser projector under the man's hip that, when activated, gives a number of a safe deposit box in ZÃ¼rich. Upon landing, the man heads to investigate the box. Arriving at the bank, the man finds the box contains a large sum of money in various currencies, numerous passports and identity cards with his picture on all of them, and a handgun. The man takes everything but the gun, and leaves, opting to use the name on the American passport, Jason Bourne. After Bourne's departure, a bank employee contacts Operation Treadstone, a CIA black ops program. Treadstone's head, Alexander Conklin (Chris Cooper), activates three agents to take down Bourne: Castel (Nicky Naude), Manheim (Russell Levy), and the Professor (Clive Owen), while also issuing alerts to local police to capture Bourne. Meanwhile, CIA Deputy Director Ward Abbott (Brian Cox) contacts Conklin about a failed assassination attempt against exiled African dictator Nykwana Wombosi (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje). Conklin promises Abbott that he will deal with the Treadstone agent who failed. Bourne attempts to evade the Swiss police by using his U.S. passport to enter the American consulate, but he is discovered by guards. He evades capture, leaves the embassy, and gives a German woman, Marie Kreutz (Franka Potente), 20,000 to drive him to an address in Paris listed on his French driving license. At the address, an apartment, he hits redial on the phone and reaches a hotel.

To answer the question appropriately, we need to explore the history of early Marvel heroes and identify the group that collectively represents the most popular ones. In the 1940s, Marvel Comics, then known as Timely Comics, produced a triumvirate of iconic superheroes: Captain America, the Human Torch, and Namor the Sub-Mariner. These characters were the most popular early Marvel heroes and were collectively and colloquially known as \\"The Big Three\\" or the \\"Invaders.\\" Captain America, created in 1941 by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby, was a symbol of patriotism during World War II and fought against the Axis Powers alongside his sidekick, Bucky Barnes. Captain America has remained one of Marvel's most significant characters through multiple iterations, including the recent portrayal by Chris Evans in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The Human Torch, created in 1939 by Carl Burgos, predates Captain America and was one of the first superheroes ever published by Timely Comics, which later became Marvel Comics. This version of the Human Torch was an android named Jim Hammond who could engulf himself in flames and fly. Namor the Sub-Mariner, created by Bill Everett in 1939, is a half-human, half-Atlantean mutant who rules the underwater city of Atlantis. Namor possesses enhanced strength, endurance, and the ability to fly using the small wings on his ankles. These three iconic characters formed the core of Timely Comics' superhero line-up and were later revived in Marvel Comics continuity during the Silver Age. They are the most popular early Marvel heroes and collectively known as \\"The Big Three\\" or the \\"Invaders.\\" In contrast, the Whizzer, Miss America, the Destroyer, the original Vision, and the Angel mentioned in the sentence are important but secondary characters in Marvel's early history, and they do not address the question asked directly."},{"question":"What are the most important words in the following sentence: A green apple on top of some oranges","response":"The most important words in the sentence \\"A green apple on top of some oranges\\" are \\"green apple,\\" \\"top,\\" and \\"oranges.\\" 1. \\"Green apple\\" - The phrase \\"green apple\\" specifies the type of apple being considered, providing essential information about the object being described. Without mentioning \\"green,\\" we would not know the specific color or variety of the apple. Moreover, it creates a clear mental image for the reader or listener and differentiates it from other types of apples such as \\"red apple\\" or \\"golden apple.\\" Apples are often seen as symbols of health, so by mentioning a green apple, the sentence might evoke feelings of wellness or freshness. 2. \\"Top\\" - The word \\"top\\" indicates the positioning of the green apple in relation to the oranges. This is important because it highlights the arrangement or composition of the objects within the sentence. The spatial relationship between the apple and the oranges establishes a hierarchy or a sense of balance in the scene. In the context of a fruit arrangement, mentioning that the apple is on top of the oranges signals a focal point in the composition and might suggest that the apple is somehow more prominent or important than the oranges. 3. \\"Oranges\\" - Lastly, the word \\"oranges\\" refers to the second type of fruit mentioned in the sentence. Similar to \\"green apple,\\" knowing the specific kind of fruit is crucial for understanding the situation or scene being described. The fact that oranges are used in contrast to the green apple helps to create a more vivid mental image, as oranges are typically associated with a different set of colors, flavors, and textures. The juxtaposition of the green apple and the oranges might emphasize an abundance or variety of fruit, or it could be a subtle way to make a statement about diversity, as different kinds of fruit are coming together in the same arrangement."},{"question":"Six weeks after arriving in the United States, Hassan Abduraheem takes a seat in the back pew of Tar Wallet Baptist Church. Tucked into the woods along a country road in rural Virginia, the church holds about 50 worshippers. On this cold November Sunday, Abduraheem and his family of eight noticeably increase the congregation's size. They do their best to follow the unfamiliar English of the old Baptist hymns, which are very familiar to their new neighbors. And they share the hymns from their former home — Sudan. Standing in a single line in front of the altar, the family fills the church with Arabic song. \\"Unbelievable,\\" Abduraheem says repeatedly, as he describes his journey from a crowded prison cell in Sudan to a fixed-up house on the farm of his new pastor. \\"Unbelievable\\" seems like the only word that could describe the turn his life took, thanks to a Facebook post and a U.S. congressman. Abduraheem's work as a former pastor is not outlawed in his native Sudan, but Christians are a minority in a diverse country that has suffered through multiple civil wars. According to the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, there has been \\"an escalation in the Sudanese government's persecution of Christians,” since the 2011 secession of South Sudan. Abduraheem says his work was spreading the gospel; the Sudanese government accused him of espionage, and he was detained along with two other pastors in December 2015. \\"The first day when they took us to the prison, they beat us,” he says softly. Abduraheem was shifted from prison to prison. For five months, he wore the same clothes he was wearing when he was arrested. His eyes became damaged from the harsh prison light. Yet, despite constant interrogations, just two meals of beans a day and a tiny cell with barely enough room to sleep, he says the worst part of prison was not knowing.

Persecuting more Christians living in Sudan B. Freeing more Christians living in Sudan C. not enough information D. Giving equal rights to Christians living in Sudan","response":"A.

Answer:","response":"Kendall can be described as an individual who may have a tendency to prioritize nonessential or trivial purchases over more practical or necessary ones, given the context shared. When it comes to personal finance, people have different habits and priorities, and it appears that Kendall is inclined to spend her allowance on items that don't hold much value in terms of usefulness, longevity, or investment. Such behavior may stem from various factors, including the influence of consumer culture, peer pressure, emotional spending, or a lack of financial literacy. One could describe Kendall as impulsive, as she might make unplanned or spontaneous purchases without weighing the potential benefits, drawbacks, or alternative spending options. Impulsive behavior may prevent her from establishing long-term saving goals or building an emergency fund, which are essential aspects of a healthy financial life. Another word that could be used to describe Kendall is materialistic. This characteristic highlights her preference for acquiring tangible possessions, even if they serve no practical purpose. A materialistic mindset might influence her to seek temporary satisfaction and happiness through material goods, instead of focusing on intangible values such as relationships, personal growth, and experiences. Additionally, Kendall can be described as lacking budgeting skills. The absence of a well-planned budget can lead to excessive spending on non-essential items, leaving little to no resources for more crucial needs. This lack of financial discipline may eventually result in difficulties in managing personal finances and lead to potential debts. Finally, it's essential to consider that Kendall's spending habits might be a reflection of her age, social circle, or personal preferences. Teenagers and young adults, especially those who are yet to be exposed to real-life financial responsibilities, are more likely to spend their money on fun and indulgent items. It's crucial not to be overly judgmental or critical but rather focus on guiding and educating Kendall about the importance of financial responsibility, saving, and thoughtful spending to help her develop more sustainable financial habits in the future."},{"question":"Given the question: Read the following conversation and answer the question.

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"The red flag appeared as a political symbol during the French Revolution, after the fall of Bastille. A law adopted by the new government on October 20, 1789 authorized the Garde Nationale to raise the red flag in the event of a riot, to signal that the Garde would imminently intervene. During a demonstration on the Champs de Mars on July 17, 1791, the Garde Nationale fired on the crowd, killed up to fifty people. The government was denounced by the more radical revolutionaries. In the words of his famous hymn, the Marseillaise, Rouget de Lisle wrote: \\"Against us they have raised the bloody flag of tyranny!\\" (Contre nous de la tyrannie, l'entendard sanglant est leve). Beginning in 1790, the most radical revolutionaries adopted the red flag themselves, to symbolize the blood of those killed in the demonstrations, and to call for the repression of those they considered counter-revolutionary.\\"? The answer is:","response":"Question: Analyze the significance of the red flag as a political symbol during the French Revolution, and discuss how its connotation evolved from representing the Garde Nationale's intervention in riots to being embraced by radical revolutionaries. Consider the events of the Champs de Mars demonstration and the influence of the Marseillaise hymn along with the motivations of the revolutionaries who adopted the symbol. Answer: The red flag emerged as a political symbol during the French Revolution, primarily after the fall of Bastille. Initially, the red flag was adopted by the new government as a symbol for the Garde Nationale, a militia created to maintain order during the revolution. On October 20, 1789, a law was enacted, allowing the Garde Nationale to raise the red flag as a signal of imminent intervention in times of riots or disturbances. The Champs de Mars demonstration on July 17, 1791, marked a turning point in the perception of the red flag. During this event, the Garde Nationale fired upon the crowd, resulting in the deaths of up to fifty individuals. This violent crackdown led to a wave of criticism and denunciation from the more radical elements among the revolutionaries. As the revolution progressed, the Marseillaise hymn, composed by Rouget de Lisle, became an anthem of the revolutionary cause. The lyrics of the hymn criticized the oppressive tactics of the government, particularly the use of the red flag as a symbol of tyranny: \\"Against us they have raised the bloody flag of tyranny!\\" (Contre nous de la tyrannie, l'entendard sanglant est leve). This sentiment resonated with the most radical revolutionaries, who began to reinterpret the red flag as a symbol of protest and defiance. Beginning in 1790, these radical revolutionaries adopted the red flag, embracing it as a representation of the bloodshed suffered by the demonstrators and martyrs of the revolution. It became a rallying point for calls for further repression of those deemed counter-revolutionary. This evolution in the symbolism of the red flag demonstrated the fluidity of revolutionary symbols and the way in which political factions sought to claim and redefine powerful symbols for their own purposes. Consequently, the red flag transformed from a symbol of potential state violence against the populace to a symbol of the revolutionaries' commitment to their cause and their demands for justice for the victims of government repression."},{"question":"Yunanistan'daki sendikalar, kamu harcamalarında 3,3 milyar avroluk kesinti, asgari ücrette %20'nin üzerinde azalma ve binlerce işçinin işten çıkarılmasını öngören ikinci bir kurtarma paketini protesto etmek üzere 10 Şubat Cuma günü greve gitti.

Answer choices: - the Sun - insects - animals - humans - rocks - air - a fish - people Answer:","response":"Animals have pressure receptors, which means that various creatures within the animal kingdom possess these sensory structures. Pressure receptors, also known as mechanoreceptors, are specialized nerve endings that can detect mechanical pressure or varying degrees of touch, vibration, and even stretching. They serve a critical role in perceiving mechanical stimuli from the environment and conveying them to the brain to generate appropriate responses. Out of the choices provided, the following groups or entities also have pressure receptors: 1. Insects: As members of the animal kingdom, insects possess pressure receptors. They use these receptors to navigate their surroundings, locate food or mates, and escape predators. Some insects, such as crickets and grasshoppers, have specialized mechanoreceptors on their legs known as tympanic organs that allow them to detect vibrations in their environment, including the presence of predators or approaching mates. 2. Humans: As part of the broader category of \\"animals,\\" humans also have pressure receptors, which play an essential role in our ability to perceive touch, pressure, vibration, and proprioception (awareness of our body's position and movement). In humans, these receptors are mainly present in the skin and include different types of nerve endings, such as Merkel cells (for sustained touch and pressure perception), Meissner's corpuscles (for light touch), and Pacinian corpuscles (for deep pressure and vibration). 3. Fish: Fish, as animals, have pressure receptors too. These mechanoreceptors are located in a specialized lateral line system, which is a series of sensory organs positioned along the head and body that detects water movements and changes in pressure as they swim. This system allows fish to perceive their surroundings, sense nearby objects and living creatures, and maintain their balance in water. 4. People: As a subcategory of \\"animals,\\" people is another term to describe humans. Thus, people also have pressure receptors in their skin, which aid in sensing touch, pressure, vibrations, and body awareness. These receptors contribute to tactile experiences in social interactions and inform individuals of potential dangers or other environmental cues. In contrast, the sun, rocks, and air do not have pressure receptors, as they are not living entities with sensory structures adapted to detect mechanical stimuli. The sun is a massive ball of gas emitting heat and light as a result of nuclear fusion, while rocks are naturally occurring solid aggregates of minerals. Air, on the other hand, is a mix of gases primarily composed of nitrogen and oxygen. None of these non-living entities possess any biological sensory structures to detect pressure or mechanical stimuli in their surroundings."},{"question":"Choose from options: Determine if the sentence is true based on the text below: Shannon Kelley wants to coach at Rice.

This special kind of art can take the form of paintings, sculptures, cloth or even stickers. Street art has become part of a culture which can be seen around the world. Now, even art museums and galleries are collecting the works of street artists. People have different thoughts about street art. Some think street art is bad, but others see this art as a rich form of non-traditional cultural expression. Street art began in New York City in the 1960s. Young adults would use paint in special cans to spray their \\"tag\\" on walls and train cars around the city. This tag was a name they created to show off themselves and their artwork. This style of drawing and writing became known as graffiti . Graffiti art showed that young people wanted to rebel against the rules. They traveled around cities to make paintings that everyone could see. Street artists do their work for some reasons. A number of them choose street art because it is closer to the everyday life. What they enjoy most is the freedom of expressing themselves which street art permits . One well-known street artist is Swoon. She cuts out paper images of people and puts them on walls. Swoon didn't start her career as a street artist. She studied art but, as time went on, got bored with the works she saw in museums. Then she fell in love with graffiti. The people in New York enjoy Swoon's strong and interesting style. Some museums have already bought some of her works. Nowadays street art has become part of a world-wide culture.

Sergey appreciated intricate designs and decided to keep the painting instead of the sculpture because the","response":"painting had so many beautiful colors and patterns that reminded him of a magical world. The sculpture was nice too, but it wasn't as bright and exciting as the painting. One day, Sergey hung the painting on his bedroom wall, right above his bed, so he could see the lovely picture every morning when he woke up. The painting was of a beautiful garden, filled with flowers of many different colors, like red, blue, yellow, and purple. There were also trees in the garden, and their leaves swayed gently in the breeze. Sergey really loved to use his imagination when looking at the painting. Sometimes, he imagined that he could walk right into the painting and explore the magical garden. While walking through the garden, he would meet smiling butterflies, friendly little squirrels, and singing birds. They all knew Sergey and welcomed him with a happy cheer. One day, as Sergey was looking at the painting, he noticed a tiny ladybug on one of the flowers and thought to himself, \\"It would be so much fun if I could play with all the creatures in this garden.\\" He closed his eyes and wished really hard for the garden to come alive. To his surprise, when he opened his eyes, he found himself inside the garden of the painting! The colors were even brighter and more beautiful than he had ever seen. It was like a dream come true. He walked around, seeing all the creatures he had imagined before. The butterflies came to greet him with a gentle flutter, and the squirrels hopped happily around, showing him where their secret stash of nuts was hidden. The birds sang their sweetest songs, creating a harmonious melody that filled the garden. Sergey spent his day exploring the magical garden and playing with all the creatures. He had never experienced anything so amazing before. As the sun started to set, the garden slowly turned from bright colors to soft orangish hues. It was time for Sergey to go back home. With a heavy heart, Sergey waved goodbye to his new friends and found himself back in his bedroom. He was grateful for the wonderful adventure he had in the magical garden and knew that every time he looked at the painting, he would remember the amazing friends he had made. And so, Sergey's love for intricate designs grew even stronger, as he cherished the memories of the magical world they could create in his mind."},{"question":"Process: - You breathe in - Air goes through all the little branches in your lungs to fill up the air sacs, or alveoli - Oxygen goes through the walls of the alveoli and into the capillaries - The oxygen goes into the bloodstream - Oxygen is left and carbon dioxide is picked up - You breathe it out through your lungs - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose properly working lungs happens, how will it affect a GREATER amount of oxygen being delivered to the blood stream. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","response":"Yes, the supposed perturbation can have an effect on the process. If properly working lungs are able to take in a greater amount of oxygen, this will result in a higher concentration of oxygen being delivered to the bloodstream. This increased oxygen concentration can directly impact the efficiency of the process, potentially allowing for better oxygenation of the tissues and organs throughout the body, as well as more efficient removal of carbon dioxide. This can indirectly lead to improved overall health and functioning, as adequate oxygen supply is essential for various biological processes."},{"question":"Given the question: Information: - Time travel is the concept of movement (such as by a human) between certain points in time, analogous to movement between different points in space, typically using a hypothetical device known as a time machine, in the form of a vehicle or of a portal connecting distant points in time. Time travel is a recognized concept in philosophy and fiction, but traveling to an arbitrary point in time has a very limited support in theoretical physics, and usually only in conjunction with quantum mechanics or wormholes, also known as Einstein-Rosen bridges. In a more narrow sense, one-way time travel into the future via time dilation is a well-understood phenomenon within the frameworks of special relativity and general relativity, but advancing a large amount of time is not feasible with current technology. The concept was touched upon in various earlier works of fiction, but was popularized by H. G. Wells' 1895 novel \\"The Time Machine\\", which moved the concept of time travel into the public imagination, and it remains a popular subject in science fiction. - Science fiction (often shortened to SF, sci-fi or scifi) is a genre of speculative fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a \\"literature of ideas.\\" It usually avoids the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have a grounding in science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection is now limited to hard science fiction. - Horace Leonard \\"H. L.\\" Gold (April 26, 1914 February 21, 1996) was an American science fiction writer and editor. Born in Canada, Gold moved to the United States at the age of two. He was most noted for bringing an innovative and fresh approach to science fiction while he was the editor of \\"Galaxy Science Fiction\\", and also wrote briefly for DC Comics. - Hard science fiction is a category of science fiction characterized by an emphasis on scientific accuracy. The term was first used in print in 1957 by P. Schuyler Miller in a review of John W. Campbell, Jr.'s \\"Islands of Space\\" in \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\". The complementary term soft science fiction, formed by analogy to hard science fiction, first appeared in the late 1970s. The term is formed by analogy to the popular distinction between the \\"hard\\" (natural) and \\"soft\\" (social) sciences. Science fiction critic Gary Westfahl argues that neither term is part of a rigorous taxonomy; instead they are approximate ways of characterizing stories that reviewers and commentators have found useful. - Technology (\\"science of craft\\", from Greek , \\"techne\\", \\"art, skill, cunning of hand\\"; and , \\"-logia\\") is the collection of techniques, skills, methods and processes used in the production of goods or services or in the accomplishment of objectives, such as scientific investigation. Technology can be the knowledge of techniques, processes, and the like, or it can be embedded in machines which can be operated without detailed knowledge of their workings. - Innovation can be defined simply as a \\"new idea, device, or method\\". However, innovation is often also viewed as the application of better solutions that meet new requirements, unarticulated needs, or existing market needs. This is accomplished through more-effective products, processes, services, technologies, or business models that are readily available to markets, governments and society. The term \\"innovation\\" can be defined as something original and more effective and, as a consequence, new, that \\"breaks into\\" the market or society. It is related to, but not the same as, invention. Innovation is often manifested via the engineering process. The exnovation is the opposite of innovation. - A science fiction magazine is a publication that offers primarily science fiction, either in a hard copy periodical format or on the Internet. - Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe. - Genre (or ; from French \\"genre\\" , \\"kind\\" or \\"sort\\", from Latin \\"genus\\" (stem \\"gener-\\"), Greek , \\"gés\\") - All About the Future is a 1953 anthology of science fiction short stories edited by Martin Greenberg . The stories originally appeared in the magazines Astounding , Galaxy Science Fiction and the Boston University Graduate Journal . - The supernatural (Medieval Latin: \\"superntrlis\\": \\"supra\\" \\"above\\" + \\"naturalis\\" \\"natural\\", first used: 15201530 AD) includes all that cannot be explained by science or the laws of nature, including things characteristic of or relating to ghosts, gods, or other supernatural beings, or to things beyond nature. - Extraterrestrial life, also called alien life (or, if it is a sentient or relatively complex individual, an \\"extraterrestrial\\" or \\"alien\\"), is life that does not originate from Earth. These as-yet-hypothetical life forms may range from simple single-celled organisms to beings with civilizations far more advanced than humanity. Although many scientists expect extraterrestrial life to exist, there is no unambiguous evidence for its existence so far. The science of extraterrestrial life is known as exobiology. - Speculative fiction is a broad umbrella genre denoting any narrative fiction with supernatural or futuristic elements; this encompasses the genres of science fiction, fantasy, horror, alternative history, magic realism, and superhero fiction, as well as combinations of the previous genres. It typically strays strongly from reality and so may feature fictional types of beings like mythical creatures and supernatural entities, technologies that do not exist in real life like time machines and interstellar spaceships, or magical or otherwise scientifically inexplicable elements. The term's popularity is sometimes attributed to Robert Heinlein, who referenced it in 1947 in an editorial essay, although there are prior mentions of speculative fiction, or its variant \\"speculative literature\\". - Martin Greenberg (28 June 1918-20 October 2013) Is an American book publisher and editor of science fiction anthologies. - Galaxy Science Fiction was an American digest-size science fiction magazine, published from 1950 to 1980. It was founded by an Italian company, World Editions, which was looking to break into the American market. World Editions hired as editor H. L. Gold, who rapidly made \\"Galaxy\\" the leading science fiction (sf) magazine of its time, focusing on stories about social issues rather than technology. - Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction.

At the college, he met Barbara Hepworth, a fellow student who would also become a well-known British sculptor, and began a friendship and gentle professional rivalry that lasted for many years. In Leeds, Moore also had access to the modernist works in the collection of Sir Michael Sadler, the University Vice-Chancellor, which had a pronounced effect on his development. In 1921, Moore won a scholarship to study at the Royal College of Art in London, along with Hepworth and other Yorkshire contemporaries. While in London, Moore extended his knowledge of primitive art and sculpture, studying the ethnographic collections at the Victoria and Albert Museum and the British Museum. The student sculptures of both Moore and Hepworth followed the standard romantic Victorian style, and included natural forms, landscapes and figurative modelling of animals. Moore later became uncomfortable with classically derived ideals; his later familiarity with primitivism and the influence of sculptors such as Constantin Brâncuși, Jacob Epstein, Henri Gaudier-Brzeska and Frank Dobson led him to the method of direct carving, in which imperfections in the material and marks left by tools became part of the finished sculpture. Having adopted this technique, Moore was in conflict with academic tutors who did not appreciate such a modern approach. During one exercise set by Derwent Wood (the professor of sculpture at the Royal College), Moore was asked to reproduce a marble relief of Domenico Rosselli's The Virgin and Child by first modelling the relief in plaster, then reproducing it in marble using the mechanical aid known as a \\"pointing machine\\", a technique called \\"pointing\\". Instead, he carved the relief directly, even marking the surface to simulate the prick marks that would have been left by the pointing..., what would be the answer ? The answer is:","response":"The primary motif of Moore's sculpture became direct carving, in which imperfections in the material and marks left by tools became part of the finished sculpture. This technique was influenced by primitivism and the works of sculptors such as Constantin Brâncuși, Jacob Epstein, Henri Gaudier-Brzeska, and Frank Dobson."},{"question":"What is a question about this article?

I am picky as hell when it comes to eating. There aren't many things I like and once I hit upon things I do like I will happily eat them over and over and over ... much to the dismay of my husband.

If you have the option to push mail at a talent agency, on a set, or for production company, take it. If you're practically scraping the scum off the bathroom floor, take it. For starters, you need a job. What's more, you'll meet people and get a feel for the environment. Everybody starts somewhere, and those bills won't pay themselves. Harrison Ford was a carpenter on the set of Star Wars when George Lucas nabbed him for the role of Han Solo. It might not be as easy as that in your case, but it is a step in the right direction. In order to be taken seriously and to have less work on your plate, get an agent. They'll get auditions for you and get your name out there – you just have to do the hard work of showing up and rocking it. A good agent is free. Never pay an agent before you get a gig – they should only get a cut of the gigs they nab you. There is sort of a catch-22 with getting an agent – they have to see you in something. So take whatever small gigs you can get and get them on tape. You can start creating a demo reel to submit to the agents you want. Apart from this, all you can really do is rely on word of mouth and networking. Is there a party on Friday that's supposedly going to be hopping, but you only know one or two people going, and that's only via Facebook? Go anyway. There will be drinking and laughter, and after a while, no one will remember that you're a stranger. You'll meet people, hear about their connections, and possible get a phone number or two to network with later. The more people you know, the better chances you have of getting recommended later. For performers, this will help you get an agent, too. After a few beers, B-rated sitcom star Bobby Whatshisname throws you his agent's business card and says he'll give you a heads up. Every little bit counts, and if you have to do some schmoozing to get ahead, so be it. You're going to hear no's out your ears. You'll practically be swimming in rejections. Even the most famous of celebrities have been told they're not suited for a role at one point or another. Remember that casting directors reject candidates because the latter may not have traits the former are looking for. It's perfectly okay to feel disappointed upon rejection, but it's also okay to spend some time to de-stress, whether it be exercise, food and a drink, talking about it with someone you trust, or partaking in a hobby. You must also believe in yourself and never give up! You made it happen after all, right? The life leading up to the life of a star is rarely glamorous. You'll likely be poor, hate your day job, and consider the littlest of victories huge. And they are! This is a tough gig, but you have to believe that eventually it'll pay off.","response":"This article highlights the importance of location, networking, finding an agent, handling rejection and persistence in order to make it in the challenging yet rewarding world of Hollywood."},{"question":"the remnants of the strongest pga tour field of the year took their best shots at riviera country club on saturday .

A screenplay writer (also called screenwriter for short), scriptwriter or scenarist is a writer who practices the craft of screenwriting, writing screenplays on which mass media, such as films, television programs, comics or video games, are based. Screenwriting is a freelance profession. No education is required to become a professional screenwriter, just good storytelling abilities and imagination. Screenwriters are not hired employees but contracted freelancers. Most, if not all, screenwriters start their careers writing on speculation (spec) and so write without being hired or paid for it. If such a script is sold, it is called a spec script. What separates a professional screenwriter from an amateur screenwriter is that professional screenwriters are usually represented by a talent agency. Also, professional screenwriters do not often work for free, but amateur screenwriters will often work for free and are considered \\"writers in training.\\" Spec scripts are usually penned by unknown professional screenwriters and amateur screenwriters. There are a legion of would-be screenwriters who attempt to enter the film industry, but it often takes years of trial-and-error, failure, and gritty persistence to achieve success. In \\"Writing Screenplays that Sell\\", Michael Hague writes, \\"Screenplays have become, for the last half of [the twentieth] century, what the Great American Novel was for the first half.

The wife of actor Andrew Sachs condemned the BBC last night for bringing Jonathan Ross back to Radio 2 for the first time since he left the BBC following Sachsgate scandal. Melody Sachs said it was a ‘slap in the face’ to give the disgraced presenter a job on the same station on which he insulted her husband six years ago. Ross has been hired to provide holiday cover for Steve Wright’s afternoon music and chat show at the end of the month. 'It's highly inappropriate and disgusting': Melody Sachs, pictured with her husband Andrew Sachs, condemned the BBC last night for bringing Jonathan Ross back to Radio 2. He will be paid an estimated £4,000 to host four three-hour programmes between August 26 and 29. Last night Mrs Sachs, 79, said: ‘It’s highly inappropriate and I think it’s disgusting.’ In 2008, Ross used an appearance on comedian Russell Brand’s Radio 2 show to leave a series of obscene messages on Mr Sachs’s answerphone. The incident provoked 42,000 complaints after Brand boasted of sleeping with the 84-year-old actor’s granddaughter and joked that the Fawlty Towers star might hang himself as a result of the calls. Brand later resigned and Ross was suspended for 12 weeks, later moving to ITV. The BBC was fined £150,000 by Ofcom. Incident: Jonathan Ross (right) and Russell Brand are pictured insulting Mr Sachs on the BBC's Radio 2 show. Although Ross, 53, has said he feels ‘immense regret’, the Sachs family have refused to forgive him and claimed he used the publicity to advance his career. Mrs Sachs added: ‘I’m so surprised that the BBC has welcomed him back. I’m amazed that they could do such a thing. It’s like a slap in the face for us, especially after Andrew spent so much of his working life with the BBC writing, acting and directing. It’s very sad and thoughtless and disrespectful.’ It is the first time since he left the BBC that Ross has been allowed back on Radio 2, although he has appeared on one-off TV. On Monday he appeared as a guest on Radio 4 panel show Just A Minute. Criticism: Tory MP Philip Davies (left) has also criticised the decision to allow Ross (right) back on the airwaves. Last night Tory MP Philip Davies also criticised the decision to allow Ross back on the airwaves. He said: ‘My view is that what he did was completely and utterly unacceptable. He doesn’t appear to have accepted that, and until he does I don’t think the BBC should employ him.’ Ross was never fired from the BBC. Instead he chose to leave in 2010 after the corporation decided not to renew his £18million contract. He later claimed the scandal had made him a ‘better person’. A BBC spokesman said: ‘Jonathan is an experienced and talented broadcaster … [who] is returning for this one-off stint of holiday cover for Steve Wright. There are no plans to bring him back permanently.’ Write highlights for this article.","response":"1.

Here’s what happened when I tried to work legally in America. Peter Britton lives in Vancouver, British Columbia. For as long as I can remember, I’ve heard the American axiom, “Play by the rules and you get rewarded; break the rules and you get punished.” Generally, I believed that to be true. Until this spring, that is. Here’s my story. I live on the west coast of Canada. I am a Canadian citizen, born and bred. My career is in direct marketing. While there are some employment opportunities in my field in Canada, the vast majority of positions are in the United States. Over the years, I’ve had many opportunities and offers to work in the States, and for some, I was able to use the North American Free Trade Agreement’s professional visa program for short-term work. But the door to long-term, full-time employment has been locked to me because of my citizenship. My big brother lives not far from Houston. He was born in Canada but moved to the United States many years ago. He applied for and attained U.S. citizenship in the 1990s. A few years ago — January 2011 to be exact — we discussed a way I could gain a foothold into the United States. He could sponsor me, as his brother, to come south as a legal immigrant. This would allow me to seek and accept employment here. So we filed the required paperwork and paid the 400 fee. For the next four years, nothing happened. The application was sent to an immigration office in California, where it moved through the processing line. I imagined the paperwork walking through one of those mazes you see at the DMV. Finally, this February, my brother and I received a letter from the Department of Homeland Security, telling us that the copy of my brother’s birth certificate he sent was illegible and asking if he could please send a clearer version. So he did. We received a congratulatory letter about three weeks later. The application was approved and moving on to the National Visa Center in New Jersey for processing. Once that was complete, there would be an interview at the U.S. Consulate in Vancouver, and then the visa could be issued. I was told the National Visa Center would send me a letter confirming its participation in the process. Sure enough, 30 days later, a letter arrived. It told me that the center is on the case but that I should not make too many plans for my move to the United States, as there is a waiting time for processing. I was instructed to go to the State Department’s Web site to check on wait times, which it bases on the “priority date” of my application. My priority date was Jan. 9, 2011, the date we filed the original paperwork. After a few clicks I discovered that, for Americans sponsoring siblings from Canada, the wait time is about nine more years. Yes, that’s right: 13 years total processing time. They are now processing priority dates of March 2002, and with my priority date of January 2011, they should get to me by March 2024. Let me quote a former U.S. president: “Our protection is in our fraternity, our armor is our faith; the tie that binds more firmly year by year is ever-increasing acquaintance and comradeship through interchange of citizens and the compact not of perishable parchment, but of fair and honorable dealing, which, God grant, shall continue for all time.” Warren G. Harding spoke those words on a visit to Vancouver on July 26, 1923. He was the first U.S. president to visit Canada. “Interchange of citizens”? “Fair and honorable dealing”? It would seem, in the United States, for one attempting legal emigration from your next-door neighbor to the north, there is a new definition of “fair and honorable.” My brother will turn 74 on his next birthday. For my application to get final approval, he must still be alive. In nine years, he will be 83. I wrote to him the other day, reminding him to eat well, take his vitamins and get some exercise. I would hate for this entire wait to be a waste. Oh, and one last thing: I am glad I do not live in the Philippines. Applicants from that country in the same category — sponsored by a brother — have a wait time of 23 years. So much for playing by the rules. What is a short summary of the above article?","response":"The article is a personal account of a Canadian citizen, Peter Britton, who tried to legally work in the United States. Despite having a career in direct marketing and taking the proper immigration steps through his brother's sponsorship, Peter faced numerous delays, inefficient bureaucratic processes, and a total of 13 years of processing time. This highlights the frustrating experiences faced by individuals attempting to legally immigrate and work in the United States, even those from neighboring countries like Canada."},{"question":"- credits is young political editor '' the irish times '' political correspondent journalist of the year '' irish examiner '' - url is http://www.harrymcgee.com/ - education is ba , llb -lrb- 1993 -rrb- -lrb- 1987 -rrb- , hdip -lrb- 1989 -rrb- - birth place is salthill , county galway - alma mater is university college galway - occupation is political journalist Given the details above, guess who could this information be about.

Question: When we add more cars to the road the pollution levels decrease or increase? Text: Greater use of oil and other fossil fuels causes more pollution. A:","response":"Based on the given text, when more cars are added to the road, the pollution levels increase. This is because most cars run on fossil fuels like oil, which release harmful pollutants when burned to create energy. As the statement points out, \\"Greater use of oil and other fossil fuels causes more pollution.\\" When there are more cars on the road, it means more fuel is being consumed. Fossil fuels, such as gasoline or diesel, are derived from oil and are widely used for powering vehicles. When these fuels are combusted in car engines, they release greenhouse gases, particulate matter, and other harmful pollutants into the atmosphere. Some of the most common pollutants from car exhaust include carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO2), particulate matter (PM), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). These pollutants contribute to air pollution, which can negatively affect human health, the environment, and climate change. As the number of vehicles on the road increases, so does the consumption of fossil fuels and the production of these harmful emissions. In addition to worsening air quality, more cars on the road can lead to increased traffic congestion, which further amplifies the pollution problem. This happens because cars tend to emit more pollutants when they are in slow-moving or stop-and-go traffic, as their engines work less efficiently under such conditions. To reduce the pollution caused by the transportation sector, several solutions are being explored and implemented across the world. These include promoting alternative, cleaner transportation modes, such as walking, biking, or public transport; encouraging the use of cleaner fuels and energy-efficient technologies in vehicles, like hybrid and electric cars; and implementing strict emission standards and regulations. In conclusion, adding more cars to the road contributes to an increase in pollution levels due to the combustion of fossil fuels. This in turn leads to the release of harmful pollutants and an adverse impact on the environment, public health, and the global climate. To mitigate this problem, we need to work on adopting cleaner and more sustainable transportation systems that minimize our reliance on fossil fuels and reduce the overall pollution levels."},{"question":"I loved this movie.

Sarah: It does sound far-fetched, but there are some theories in physics that suggest it might be possible. For example, have you ever heard of wormholes? Ben: Vaguely, but I'm not too familiar with the concept. Sarah: Wormholes are hypothetical passages through space-time that connect two separate points in space and time. If we could somehow create or find a stable wormhole, we might be able to travel through it to a different time period. Ben: Alright, let's say wormholes do exist. How on earth would we be able to create or harness one? Sarah: That's the challenging part. Some theories suggest that we would need a form of \\"exotic matter\\" with negative energy density to keep a wormhole stable. But so far, such matter has not been observed in any experiments.

It was launched in 1991 by All Media Guide which later became All Media Network. - A multi-instrumentalist is a musician who plays two or more musical instruments at a professional level. Multi-instrumentalists who play closely related instruments, a practice known as doubling are common in orchestra (e.g., flute players who double on piccolo and percussion players, who play snare drum, cymbals, bass drum, etc.), in jazz (e.g., saxophone players who double on clarinet or flute; or double bass players who also play electric bass); in music theatre pit orchestras (e.g., reed players who are required to play numerous reed instruments); and in other areas of classical music (e.g., church piano players are often expected to play the church's pipe organ or Hammond organ as well). Popular music composers and songwriters are often multi-instrumentalists. In pop and rock, it is more common than in classical or jazz for performers to be multi-instrumentalists on instruments that are not from the same family: it is common for pop and rock musicians to play both guitar and keyboards. Many bluegrass musicians are multi-instrumentalists. Some musicians' unions or associations specify a higher rate of pay for musicians who double on two or more instruments for a performance or recording. - A record producer or music producer oversees and manages the sound recording and production of a band or performer's music, which may range from recording one song to recording a lengthy concept album. A producer has many roles during the recording process. The roles of a producer vary. He or she may gather musical ideas for the project, collaborate with the artists to select cover tunes or original songs by the artist/group, work with artists and help them to improve their songs, lyrics or arrangements. - Albums of recorded music were developed in the early 20th century, first as books of individual 78rpm records, then from 1948 as vinyl LP records played at rpm. Vinyl LPs are still issued, though in the 21st century album sales have mostly focused on compact disc (CD) and MP3 formats. The audio cassette was a format used from the late 1970s through to the 1990s alongside vinyl. What is the relationship between 'camille davila' and 'singer'?

With the encouragement of Arista's management they stripped back down to a five-man core group and were reborn as an arena rock band. John Dalton left the band before finishing the sessions for the debut Arista album. Andy Pyle was brought in to complete the sessions and to play on the subsequent tour. Sleepwalker, released in 1977, marked a return to success for the group as it peaked at number 21 on the Billboard chart. After its release and the recording of the follow-up, Misfits, Andy Pyle and keyboardist John Gosling left the group to work together on a separate project. Dalton returned to complete the tour and ex–Pretty Things keyboardist Gordon John Edwards joined the band. In May 1978, Misfits, the Kinks' second Arista album, was released. It included the US Top 40 hit \\"A Rock 'n' Roll Fantasy\\", which helped make the record another success for the band. The non-album single \\"Father Christmas\\" has remained a popular track. Driven by session drummer Henry Spinetti's drumming and Dave Davies' heavy guitar the song \\"Father Christmas\\" has become a classic seasonal favorite on mainstream radio. Dalton left the band permanently at the end of their UK tour, and Gordon John Edwards followed. Ex-Argent bassist Jim Rodford joined the band before the recording of Low Budget, on which Ray Davies played the keyboard sections. Keyboardist Ian Gibbons was recruited for the subsequent tour, and became a permanent member of the group. Despite the personnel changes, the popularity of the band's records and live shows continued to grow. Beginning in the late 1970s, bands such as the Jam (\\"David Watts\\"), the Pretenders (\\"Stop Your Sobbing\\", \\"I Go to Sleep\\") and the Knack (\\"The Hard Way\\") recorded covers of Kinks songs, which helped bring attention to the group's new releases.

A suitable task could be the \\"Leaning Tower of Blocks\\" challenge. Step 1: Explain the task In this task, the participant is provided with a set of n identical rectangular blocks. Their objective is to stack the blocks in such a way that they create the maximum horizontal overhang possible without the structure collapsing. Step 2: Describe the materials needed - n identical rectangular blocks (chosen by the test administrator) - A flat, stable surface (e.g., a table) Step 3: Define the rules - The blocks must be arranged in a single stack, with each block's length aligned with the length of the blocks below it. - The blocks must remain in contact with the surface or other blocks at all times. - The participant can adjust the placement of the blocks as many times as needed, but the final configuration must be stable without any external support. Step 4: Design the evaluation metrics Assess participants' performance based on: - The degree of horizontal overhang achieved (measured as a multiple of the length of a single block) - The stability of the final structure - The time taken to complete the challenge Step 5: Explain why this task tests physical reasoning The Leaning Tower of Blocks challenge tests physical reasoning ability because it requires participants to have an understanding of concepts such as center of mass, balance, and friction. Participants need to carefully place the blocks while considering the forces acting on the structure, and predict how adjustments will affect the overall stability.

They are proud of their healthy color when they return home after the holiday. But they also know that a certain amount of sunshine is good for their bodies and general health. In ancient Greece people knew about the healing powers of the sun, but this knowledge was lost. At the end of the nineteenth century a Danish doctor, Niels Finsen, began to study the effect of sunlight on certain diseases, especially diseases of the skin. He was interested not only in natural sunlight but also in artificially produced rays. Sunlight began to play a more important part in curing sick people. A Swiss doctor, Auguste Rollier, made full use of the sun in his hospital at Lysine. Lysine is a small village high up in the Alps. The position is important: the rays of the sun with the greatest healing power are the infra-red and ultra-violet rays; but ultra-violet rays are too easily lost in fog and the polluted air near industrial towns. Dr. Roller found that sunlight, fresh air and good food cure a great many diseases. He was particularly successful in curing certain forms of tuberculosis with his \\"sun-cure\\". There were a large number of children in Dr. Roller's hospital. He decided to start a school where sick children could be cured and at the same time continue to learn. It was not long before his school was full. In winter, wearing only shorts, socks and boots, the children put on their skis after breakfast and left the hospital. They carried small desks and chairs as well as their school books. Their teacher led them over the snow until they reached a slope which faced the sun and was free from cold winds. There they set out their desks and chairs, and school began. Although they wore hardly any clothes, Roller's pupils were very seldom cold. That was because their bodies were full of energy which they got from the sun. But the doctor knew that sunshine can also be dangerous. If, for example, tuberculosis is...

Martin is unsure of Ripley, but Ripley's goddaughter, Alexandra Korolenko (Radha Mitchell), who is also Victor's daughter, convinces him otherwise, although Ripley does not like that the two are getting close. Ripley tells Martin the plan, that they are going to steal from a Russian museum that has been smuggling Russian treasures into the country and bribing the NYPD with large donations and expensive equipment. The two infiltrate a party at the museum posing as cops, with Ripley as Lt. Weber (Robert Forster), a cop who has a particular vendetta against Ripley, to gather information about their vault.

The state has been first to pass major public health initiatives that have spread throughout the country. California was first to require smog checks for clean air, pass anti-tobacco initiatives and bike helmets laws. While these laws were met with skepticism and ridicule, they've often become standard practice in other states. The Golden State was first to ban smoking in workplaces, bars and restaurants in 1998. Now similar rules exist throughout the country. Some advocates tout the state as a forward-thinking vanguard in which its health and safety laws are routinely emulated by other states. \\"There have been progressive legislations in tobacco, environment and obesity prevention,\\" said Mark Horton, a lecturer at the University of California Berkeley School of Public Health. \\"In some respect, the rest of the country looks to California as a laboratory for moving forward with those various types of initiatives.\\" But some critics liken the Golden State to a nanny state.

Octavian (played by Chris Hemsworth), a determined young man with an unyielding ambition, leads a formidable empire sprawling over the remains of the fallen Roman Republic. Together, they plan a voyage to the far reaches of the world, seeking untapped resources and potential allies to strengthen their dominion. As the movie begins, Agrippa receives news of an ancient and mythical land hidden deep within the vast oceans to the west. Believing it could change the tide of history, Octavian tasks Agrippa with commanding the Roman fleet to explore and conquer these uncharted territories. Assembling his crew of seasoned sailors and valiant warriors, Agrippa sets sail on a perilous journey that will test both their mettle and resolve. On their voyage, Agrippa's fleet encounters wonders and dangers alike. As they navigate the treacherous seas, the crew soon discovers there is more to the world than they had ever imagined. Lush, unspoiled lands full of undiscovered resources promise great rewards for the empire, while an array of mythical creatures and perilous terrain obstacles lurk behind every corner, forcing Agrippa to make difficult decisions to protect his men and achieve their ultimate goal. Along the way, the fleet encounters ancient civilizations, each with their unique beliefs, cultures, and treasures. Through diplomacy and strategy, Agrippa will need to forge alliances with these peoples, who can either aid in Octavian's expansionist ambitions or pose a threat to his global domination. Among these new lands, Agrippa meets a powerful and enigmatic queen, Amphitrite (played by Lupita Nyong'o). Over time, an unlikely bond begins to form between the two, complicating the crew's mission. As the film progresses, the fleet discovers a darker force that is threatening to conquer not only the mythical lands but the entire ancient world. Recognizing the impending danger, Agrippa and Amphitrite must rally their forces, bring together a coalition of allies from across the realm, and face the greatest battle the world has ever seen. During that process, internal deceit, betrayal, and a rising rebellion back home challenge Octavian's rule, fate of the Roman Empire, and the loyalty and bond between Octavian and Agrippa. In the climactic battle, Agrippa must display his prowess as a fleet commander and tactician to outmaneuver the enemy undefeated and reveal an astonishing truth behind the mysterious force: a malevolent conqueror (played by Ralph Fiennes) who seeks to rule all that's known and unknown as vengeance against Octavian and his empire. The film concludes with a bittersweet victory, as Agrippa and Octavian succeed in defending their empire.

Options: - music store - assay office - tidal wave - butcher shop - bathroom Reasoning process:","response":"To find out where Bill works based on the given options and the information provided, let's analyze each option: 1. Music store: A music store primarily deals with instruments, audio gear, and related products. There is no connection between putting meat on a scale and working in a music store. 2. Assay office: An assay office is responsible for testing and evaluating the purity of precious metals. Since putting meat on a scale is not related to the primary functions of an assay office, this is not a plausible option. 3. Tidal wave: A tidal wave is a natural phenomenon and not a workplace. Therefore, Bill cannot work at a tidal wave. 4. Butcher shop: A butcher shop is a place where meat is cut, prepared, and sold. Weighing meat on a scale is a common activity in a butcher shop, as customers often buy meat based on its weight. This option is strongly related to the information provided. 5. Bathroom: A bathroom is not a typical workplace, and there is no connection between putting meat on a scale and working in a bathroom.

It can be used to describe a scene, weather conditions, or a general environment. Snow is precipitation in the form of ice crystals, formed when water vapor in the atmosphere cools and condenses into solid crystals. Snow is associated with cold temperatures and is a key characteristic of winter in many parts of the world. After a whiteout, which is an extreme weather condition characterized by heavy snowfall and strong winds, resulting in reduced visibility, there are several things that you need to do, primarily centered around your safety, assessment of surroundings, and recovery. Here are some points to consider: 1. Check for personal safety: Ensure that you and those around you are unharmed and safe. Attend to any injuries sustained during the whiteout and administer first aid if necessary. 2. Assess your surroundings: After the whiteout clears, take the time to assess your immediate environment. Check for any damages to structures, vehicles, trees, or power lines. Make note of any potential hazards that may arise from these damages. 3. Evaluate road conditions: Snowy weather conditions can make roads slippery and dangerous for travel. If you need to venture out, assess the road conditions by checking the amount of snow and ice accumulated, as well as whether the roads have been plowed or salted. 4. Clear snow from important areas: Remove snow from areas that are critical for your safety, like walkways and driveways. Also, clear snow from your car and check its mechanical systems to ensure it is functioning properly. 5. Inspect your home for damages: Check your roof, gutters, and other areas around your house for any snow or ice buildup as it can cause damage or leaks. Clean your home's heating system and perform any necessary repairs, if needed. 6. Stay informed: Keep yourself updated with the latest weather forecasts and come up with a plan of action for any potential emergencies. Listen to local authorities' instructions and be prepared to evacuate if deemed necessary. 7. Keep warm and ensure a proper supply of food and essentials: Make sure that you have enough warm clothing, blankets, food, and water supply, especially in the aftermath of a severe snowstorm. Store extra supplies in case of power outages or extended periods of extreme cold. 8. Help your community: Offer assistance to neighbors or others in need, especially elderly or disabled individuals who may not be able to clear their driveways or walkways. Cooperation with others can help establish a sense of community and make the aftermath of a whiteout more manageable. 9. Report damages: If you've noticed significant damages to infrastructure or property, report them to the relevant authorities so they can be addressed promptly. 10. Proactively prepare for future whiteouts: Learn from the experience of going through a whiteout and take measures to be better prepared in the future. This might include investing in a generator, stocking up on emergency supplies, or taking preventative measures like insulating your home to retain heat during periods of extreme cold. In summary, the aftermath of a whiteout calls for a proactive and safety-first approach. By taking the necessary steps to ensure personal safety, assess your surroundings, recover from damages, and remain prepared for future occurrences, you can effectively navigate the challenges brought about by snowy weather conditions."},{"question":"Translate \\"Ver los artículos relacionados en \\"Superkart te aconseja\\" en el fondo de la página\\" from Spanish to English.","response":"Step 1: Identify the individual words and phrases in the given Spanish text. - Ver: to see or view - los artículos: the articles - relacionados: related - en: in - Superkart te aconseja: Superkart advises you - el fondo: the bottom - de la página: of the page Step 2: Check for any idiomatic expressions or phrases that need special attention.

This leads to a situation where the exchange rate for the foreign currency is much higher than the rate set by the government, and therefore creates a shadow currency exchange market. As such, it is unclear whether governments have the ability to enact effective exchange controls.[1] Now, I have a new situation: Pakistan tried to control the foreign exchange market and India didn't. By creating the foreign exchange control department, Pakistan tried to stop the devaluation of their currency. India chose to not interfere and let the exchange market regulate itself. Answer this question please: Which country was more regulated in regards to foreign currency exchange? Answer:","response":"In the given situation, Pakistan was more regulated in regards to foreign currency exchange compared to India. This is because Pakistan's government established the foreign exchange control department in an attempt to prevent the devaluation of their currency. By creating this department, Pakistan actively intervened in their foreign exchange market to regulate and control foreign currency transactions. On the other hand, India allowed the exchange market to operate independently and self-regulate without interference from the government. In this scenario, Pakistan's efforts to maintain control over foreign exchange aimed to stabilize their currency value and reduce potential economic risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates. By implementing these regulations, Pakistan hoped to keep the exchange rate within a targeted range and deter speculators and manipulators from destabilizing the market. In contrast, India chose to follow a more liberal policy of non-interference in their foreign exchange market. This approach allows market forces to determine currency values and rates based on factors such as supply and demand, business climate, and economic growth. By refraining from exerting direct control over their foreign exchange market, India aimed to achieve a more flexible exchange rate regime that could adapt to changing economic conditions. However, it is important to note that neither approach is inherently good or bad, and both have their own merits and potential drawbacks. More regulated markets like Pakistan's might offer stability and security, but could also lead to the formation of black markets and limit the economy's ability to respond efficiently to market changes. Less regulated markets like India's could benefit from greater market flexibility, but might also be more exposed to the risks associated with currency volatility. In conclusion, in the given situation, Pakistan was more regulated in regards to foreign currency exchange as a result of its efforts to implement foreign exchange controls, whereas India opted for a more liberal, market-driven approach that allowed the exchange market to self-regulate. Despite their differing approaches, each country's strategy comes with its own set of trade-offs that may impact the overall economic landscape and financial stability."},{"question":"Here's a complex question that requires someone to reason about the input, can you answer it? Which director is of the Swiss nationality, Alain Tanner or Stan Brakhage? The answer to this question is:","response":"Alain Tanner.

Stan Brakhage, on the other hand, was an American experimental filmmaker born on January 14, 1933, in Kansas City, Missouri, USA. Brakhage is widely recognized as one of the most significant figures in American avant-garde filmmaking and was a pioneer in creating experimental, non-narrative films. He made over 350 films during his lifetime, ranging from very short pieces to longer works such as \\"Window Water Baby Moving\\" (1959), \\"Mothlight\\" (1963), and \\"Dog Star Man\\" (1961-1964). Brakhage's work often focused on themes of birth, death, light, and the human experience, utilizing a unique combination of visual techniques and experiments, such as painting directly onto film stock.

If you have any self respect and trust me a little, please do not order the chicken here. That chicken was in a dish of thin rice noodles which were equally disgusting. They tasted like someone throw a coating of old fish sauce on them and then served them up right from the ocean. It reeked of fish oil and juice and it was an injustice to serve this stuff to the public. Fried rice be damned, I'm taking my business as far away as possible from this punk ass fake ripoff place.

If the answer is 'no'; explain the reasoning:","response":"No, biochemistry does not study gluons. The reasoning for this is because biochemistry and gluons belong to distinct fields of science. Biochemistry focuses on the chemical processes and substances that occur within living organisms. It examines molecules such as carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, along with their interactions and the molecular mechanisms that facilitate various physiological and metabolic processes. On the other hand, gluons are subatomic particles studied in the field of particle physics. They are massless particles responsible for the strong nuclear force, which is the force holding protons and neutrons together within an atomic nucleus. Particle physics delves into the study of the fundamental particles that make up the universe and the forces that govern their interactions. In summary, biochemistry does not study gluons because gluons are related to particle physics, whereas biochemistry focuses on the chemical processes within living organisms."},{"question":"Premise: In addition to seeking clarification of various operational issues, some agencies raised questions concerning the statements of our audit and access authorities cited in the protocols. Hypothesis: The access authorities had left some of the agencies feeling uneasy when it was mentioned in the protocols. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","response":"When determining whether a premise entails a hypothesis, it's essential to evaluate whether the information presented in the premise logically leads to the conclusion or hypothesis. Premise: In addition to seeking clarification of various operational issues, some agencies raised questions concerning the statements of our audit and access authorities cited in the protocols. This premise states that agencies raised questions about operational issues and the statements of audit and access authorities mentioned in the protocols. It shows that there is some level of concern with both operational and authority-related matters. Hypothesis: The access authorities had left some of the agencies feeling uneasy when it was mentioned in the protocols. In this hypothesis, it is stated that some agencies are uneasy due to the access authorities mentioned in the protocols. This hypothesis is a more specific version of the concerns stated in the premise, which revolved around both operational issues and statements regarding audit and access authorities. Now, let's analyze if the premise entails the hypothesis: The premise suggests that some agencies have raised concerns about audit and access authorities cited in the protocols, while the hypothesis states that the access authorities specifically made some agencies feel uneasy. It can be inferred that the questions raised from the mentioned agencies indicate that they might have some discomfort or unease with the statements about audit and access authorities. In conclusion, based on the information provided in the premise, it can be reasonably assumed that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. That means the premise provides support for the hypothesis since the concerns of the agencies about the access authorities' statements can be linked to a certain level of uneasiness. However, it is important to recognize that the premise does not exclusively mention the access authorities causing unease, but rather includes broader concerns about operational issues and audit authorities as well."},{"question":"Tasmanians are being warned not to become complacent in milder conditions as bushfires continue to burn across the state.

On July 16, 1862, Congress passed legislation authorizing the U.S. federal government to purchase land for national cemeteries for military dead, and put the U.S. Army Quartermaster General in charge of this program. In May 1864, Union forces suffered large numbers of dead in the Battle of the Wilderness. Quartermaster General Montgomery C. Meigs ordered that an examination of eligible sites be made for the establishment for a large new national military cemetery. Within weeks, his staff reported that Arlington Estate was the most suitable property in the area. The property was high and free from floods (which might unearth graves), it had a view of the District of Columbia, and it was aesthetically pleasing. It was also the home of the leader of the armed forces of the Confederate States of America, and denying Robert E. Lee use of his home after the war was a valuable political consideration. The first military burial at Arlington, for William Henry Christman, was made on May 13, 1864, close to what is now the northeast gate in Section 27. However, Meigs did not formally authorize establishment of burials until June 15, 1864. Arlington did not desegregate its burial practices until President Harry S. Truman issued Executive Order 9981 on July 26, 1948. Question: who was the first person to be buried at arlington national cemetery?

Meigs."},{"question":"Given the question: Question: \\"When was the contract promised?\\" Context: \\"Extraordinary circumstances called for extraordinary sacrifice: in one of the many crises of the Second Punic War, Jupiter Capitolinus was promised every animal born that spring (see ver sacrum), to be rendered after five more years of protection from Hannibal and his allies. The \\"contract\\" with Jupiter is exceptionally detailed. All due care would be taken of the animals. If any died or were stolen before the scheduled sacrifice, they would count as already sacrificed, since they had already been consecrated. Normally, if the gods failed to keep their side of the bargain, the offered sacrifice would be withheld. In the imperial period, sacrifice was withheld following Trajan's death because the gods had not kept the Emperor safe for the stipulated period. In Pompeii, the Genius of the living emperor was offered a bull: presumably a standard practise in Imperial cult, though minor offerings (incense and wine) were also made.\\" Answer: The answer is:","response":"The contract was promised during the Second Punic War, a period which lasted from 218 BC to 201 BC. In an effort to seek protection from Hannibal and his allies, the Romans made an extraordinary vow to Jupiter Capitolinus, vowing to sacrifice every animal born in that particular spring season after five more years of protection. The Roman commitment demonstrates the gravity of the situation they faced during the Second Punic War and the importance of safeguarding their people and territories from Hannibal's forces. The contract made with Jupiter is described as exceptionally detailed, ensuring that the Romans would fulfill their promises in every aspect and care for the animals in the meantime. In the mentioned agreement, it is stated that if any of the animals died or were stolen before the scheduled sacrifice, they would still be considered as already sacrificed since they had been consecrated to Jupiter. Such provisions highlight the Romans' belief in the power of their gods and the earnestness with which they sought divine intervention to turn the tide of war in their favor. The Romans believed that if the gods did not uphold their end of the bargain, the offered sacrifice could be withheld. A similar incident occurred in the imperial period following Emperor Trajan's death, as the gods had not protected him for the stipulated period, leading to the withholding of the sacrifice. In Pompeii, it was a standard practice in the Imperial cult to offer a bull to the living emperor's Genius, reflecting the centrality of sacrifice in the Romans' religious practices and the desire to maintain favorable relationships with the divine. Alongside these significant offerings, minor ones such as incense and wine would also be made as an acknowledgment of their devotion to the gods. In conclusion, the contract with Jupiter Capitolinus was promised during the Second Punic War, a time of great struggle and challenge for the Romans. It was a detailed and binding commitment that reflected their strong belief in the power of the gods and their willingness to make significant sacrifices for the sake of their people and the empire."},{"question":"U.N. rights council condemns Syrian abuses U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva sit in special session to discuss Syria (CNN) -- The U.N. Human Rights Council decried a wide range of human rights violations in Syria on Friday and called for U.N. bodies to consider a recent report detailing the abuses and take\\" appropriate action.\\" The council passed a resolution that \\"strongly condemns the continued widespread, systematic and gross violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms by the Syrian authorities, such as arbitrary executions, excessive use of force and the killing and persecution of protesters, human rights defenders and journalists, arbitrary detention, enforced disappearances, torture and ill-treatment, including against children.\\" There were 37 yes votes, four against and six abstentions at the meeting in Geneva, Switzerland. The group convened to consider action against Syria after a troubling report issued Monday by the Independent International Commission of Inquiry, a body appointed by the council. That report concluded security and military forces \\"committed crimes against humanity\\" against civilians. The resolution recommends that U.N. bodies \\"urgently consider\\" the commission report and \\"take appropriate action.\\" The group decided to send the Commission of Inquiry report to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon \\"for appropriate action and transmission to all U.N. relevant bodies.\\" It backs \\"efforts to protect the population of the Syrian Arab Republic and to bring an immediate end to gross human rights violations.\\" And, it urged Syria \\"to protect its population\\" and \\"to immediately put an end to all human rights violations.\\" The resolution also decided \\"to establish a mandate of a Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Syria and urges Syria to cooperate with it. Before the resolution was adopted, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay told the council Syria faces a \\"full-fledged civil war\\" if the regime's \\"continual ruthless repression\\" against peaceful demonstrators and civilians isn't stopped now. She noted with concern the reports of \\"increased armed attacks by the opposition forces, including the so-called Free Syrian army, against the Syrian military and security apparatus.\\" \\"In light of the manifest failure of the Syrian authorities to protect their citizens, the international community needs to take urgent and effective measures to protect the Syrian people,\\" Pillay said. \\"The United Nations secretary-general has urged the international community to act as one and take action in a collective and decisive manner to protect the Syrian people against the violations of their human rights and fundamental freedoms. All acts of murder, torture and other forms of violence must be stopped immediately. \\" The government crackdown began in mid-March as popular discontent against ruling powers spread across the Arab world. The regime of President Bashar al-Assad has blamed the violence on armed gangs. Pillay said \\"more than 4,000 people have reportedly been killed, thousands have been arrested, and more than 14,000 are reported to be in detention as a result of the crackdown.\\" She said many have had to flee their homes, at least 12,400 to neighboring countries and \\"tens of thousands\\" internally. Among those killed, she said, are 307 children. That prompted a reaction from the U.N. Children's Fund, which said it is \\"greatly disturbed by the confirmed reports of violent attacks on children in Syria.\\" \\"These include acts of killings, torture, rape and other forms of sexual violence, imprisonment, or other forms of severe deprivation of liberty and enforced disappearances throughout the country since March of this year,\\" she said. Even though it was denied access into Syria, the Commission of Inquiry interviewed \\"223 victims and witnesses, including military and security forces who had defected and testified to the role of Syrian forces in the use of lethal violence against peaceful protests. \\" The council resolution also called on Syrian authorities \\"to fully cooperate with the Office of the High Commissioner, including through the establishment of a field presence\\" in Syria. Russia, China, Cuba and Ecuador voted against the resolution. Uganda, Philippines, India, Cameroon, Bangladesh, and Angola abstained. Among the countries voting for the resolution were Western nations like the United States and Italy and Syria's fellow Arab nations of Jordan, Kuwait, Libya, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia. Alastair Burt, the UK Foreign Office minister for the Middle East, called the council's vote \\"extremely significant.\\" He noted international efforts to put pressure on the Syrian government. The Arab League, Turkey, the European Union, and the United States are imposing sanctions on Syrian people and entities. \\"I welcome the strong action taken by the Council, and the hard-hitting resolution which it passed today by a very large majority. The resolution supports the Arab League's efforts to end the bloodshed in Syria and lays out exactly why the EU and U.N. General Assembly have taken such robust measures. It sends a very strong signal from countries across the world, including Arab partners, that they utterly condemn the horrific violations perpetrated by the Assad regime, and will continue to increase pressure on it. Today's resolution adds to the mounting pressure which the international community is bringing to bear on Syria.\\" Pillay told CNN that sanctions by neighboring states are \\"very important.\\" She also noted that Russia had called \\"on the Syrian government to address these serious violations and to stop them.\\" \\"That's an important voice. What I'm looking for is pressure building up on all sides,\\" she said. Syrian activists reported assaults by security personnel Friday. The Local Coordination Committees of Syria said at least nine people were killed on Friday, including a child and a woman. There were three fatalities in Homs, two in both Latakia and Daraa, and one each in Hama and Idlib, the group said.

Article: Washington: A research conducted at the University of Maryland looks at the numerous complex reasons as to why young children decide to include or exclude other kids from their group of friends. It suggests that the kids' decision-making process is much more complex than previously believed. \\"They take into account group information, ranging from cliques and networks, when deciding what makes a group work well. Sometimes kids are excluded because they lack social skills, but a lot of time it has nothing to do with that. Instead it has to do with what we refer to as 'group membership' such as gender, race, nation, and culture,\\" says Professor Melanie Killen, the Associate Director of the Centre for Children Relationships and Culture at Maryland, who led the 4-year project. Reporting their findings in the journal, the researcher said whatever was the reason, individuals who experienced long-term exclusion from the group of friends suffered from depression, anxiety and loneliness. The study looked at two models to define how children make decisions regarding acceptance of other kids in their group -- the individual social _ model and the inter-group social cognition model. While the former says that children's rejection occurs due to social deficits like shyness, wariness or fearfulness, the latter says that it happens because of group dynamics, prejudice and exclusion. It was also found that the age of children was also a factor that influenced their decisions regarding other kids' acceptance as friends. \\"With age, kids become more aware of group dynamics, conventions, customs, and rituals. With this comes a greater concern about group functioning, which can lead to exclusion which can be negative from a social justice viewpoint,\\" says Killen. The researcher believes that her study may have many benefits, as it could provide insights into how to help when children are rejected by their peers.

Hypothesis: Although not listed as alive, they did hear from her soon after the sinking. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","response":"The premise states that the staff of the hospital were surprised to see her name in the list of the saved from the Lusitania. They expected her to arrive and take up her position at the hospital, and were further surprised at not receiving any communication from her. This suggests that they had anticipated news or an update on her situation based on her being listed as saved. However, the hypothesis suggests a slightly different scenario - that even though her name was not listed as alive (which seems to contradict the initial premise), the staff still heard from her soon after the tragedy. Now, let's break down the hypothesis further to better understand if it follows the premise or not. 1. Her name was not listed as alive: This part of the hypothesis contradicts the premise, which stated that her name was in the list of the saved. 2. They heard from her soon after the sinking: The premise does not mention any contact from her, only that the staff were surprised at her absence and not receiving any news from her. Based on this analysis, the premise does not entail the hypothesis, as there are discrepancies between the two statements. The premise indicates that the staff expected her to be alive due to her appearing in the list of saved individuals and were surprised by her not showing up or offering any communication. This does not confidently imply that they heard from her soon after the sinking, as the hypothesis suggests.

The cabinets provide more shelf space than the closets, because the","response":"cabinets are specifically designed to optimize storage capacity by utilizing the available space more efficiently. In comparison, closets are often designed with a more general purpose in mind and can cater to a variety of storage requirements, but may not be as efficient in terms of shelf space. The main advantage of cabinets over closets is their customized design, allowing for a better organization of items. Cabinets usually comprise several compartments, drawers, and small or adjustable shelves, all of which contribute to maximizing the storage capacity within the given space. This highly organized structure ensures that items can be stored vertically as well as horizontally, making the most of every potential storage inch. In contrast, closets are often constructed with a more uniform internal layout and may only provide a single hanging rod and a few shelves. As a result, the space within a closet may not be as fully utilized, leading to wasted storage potential. Moreover, the height difference between shelves in a closet might not be optimal for certain items, leaving gaps of unused space while other items struggle to fit in. Another factor that contributes to the superiority of cabinet shelf space over closet space is the flexibility in customization. Cabinets can be easily tailored to suit specific needs, whether it's adjusting the height of shelves or adding extra drawers and compartments. This allows homeowners to create storage solutions that accommodate their unique belongings, ultimately improving organization and accessibility. On the other hand, modifying the configuration of a closet can be more challenging, especially if it is a built-in or walk-in closet with limited flexibility. Making significant changes to a closet's design might require hiring a professional to reconstruct it, whereas cabinets can often be easily upgraded or adjusted as needs change. Furthermore, cabinets typically offer greater visibility and easier access, as they are designed with doors that swing open to reveal the full breadth and depth of the storage space within. This makes it easier to locate and retrieve items, whereas closets usually have sliding or bifold doors that only reveal a part of the stored contents at one time. This can lead to items getting lost or overlooked, rendering the available shelf space less effective. In summary, the cabinets provide more shelf space than closets due to their specific designs targeted at optimal storage utilization, customization options, and improved organization and accessibility. While closets can offer a wide range of storage possibilities, their less specialized designs and layout constraints often result in less efficient use of the available interior space. Consequently, homeowners seeking versatile and efficient storage solutions may find cabinets to be a superior option over closets."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who planned to work with his longtime librettist? The one-act opera genre had become increasingly popular in Italy following the 1890 competition sponsored by publisher Edoardo Sonzogno for the best such work, which was won by the young Pietro Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana. With Tosca essentially completed by November 1899, Puccini sought a new project. Among sources he considered, before proceeding with Madama Butterfly, were three works by French dramatist Alphonse Daudet that Puccini thought might be made into a trilogy of one-act operas.After Butterfly premiered in 1904, Puccini again had difficulty finding a new subject. He further considered the idea of composing three one-act operas to be performed together, but found his publisher, Giulio Ricordi, firmly opposed to such a project, convinced that it would be expensive to cast and produce. The composer then planned to work with his longtime librettist, Giuseppe Giacosa, on an opera about Marie Antoinette, a project frustrated by the librettist's illness. Puccini wrote in November 1905, \\"Will we go back to it? [Maria Antonietta] If I find three one-act works that suit me, I'll put off M.A.\\" Puccini pursued neither project, as Giacosa's illness led to his death in September 1906.In March 1907, Puccini wrote to Carlo Clausetti, Ricordi's representative in Naples, proposing three one-act operas based on scenes from stories by Russian novelist Maxim Gorky. By May the composer had set aside this proposal to concentrate on the project which became La fanciulla del West, although he did not wholly abandon the idea of a multiple-opera evening. His next idea in this vein, some years later, was for a two-opera bill, one tragic and one comic; he later expanded this to include a third opera with a mystic or religious tone. By November 1916 Puccini had completed the \\"tragic\\" element, which became Il tabarro, but he still lacked ideas for the other two works. He considered staging Il tabarro in combination with his own early work Le Villi, or with other two-act operas which might be used to round out the evening's...

Despite the pessimistic viewpoints, investors' faith in the country's thriving economy is well-founded. This article will break down some prominent factors that justify the robust nature of American stocks. Step 1: Analyzing Market Resilience Amidst various financial crises and temporary setbacks, the stock market exhibits a trend of rebounding and eventually yielding profitable outcomes. One example of this resilience is the swift recovery from the 2020 market crash, which saw stocks rise to all-time highs. Therefore, the US market possesses a unique ability to bounce back from adversity, providing stability and growth to investors. Step 2: Innovations and Developments The American market sets itself apart due to the continuous advancements and inventions across diverse sectors such as technology, healthcare, and renewable energy. As a result, American stocks benefit from these growth opportunities, ensuring a bright future for investors who are willing to trust in the nation's ingenuity. Step 3: Global Presence and Influence US-based companies, such as Apple, Amazon, and Google, are examples of influential corporations that have expanded globally, dominating their respective industries. Investing in these companies assures investors of their long-term potential and value growth, putting American stocks on an upward trajectory. Step 4: Diversified Investments One of the most appealing factors of investing in American stocks is the wide range of industries and market options available to investors. This allows for a well-diversified portfolio that can withstand market fluctuations better and, in turn, minimize potential risks and losses. Step 5: Government Policies and Economic Stability The United States government remains committed to maintaining a stable economic environment, enabling businesses to prosper. Government initiatives, such as tax reforms and financial aid packages in challenging times, demonstrate the prioritization of supporting industries and companies, ultimately benefiting shareholders. Conclusion: The long-standing stability, cutting-edge innovations, and global influence of the American market make investing in US stocks a prudent decision. Despite the uncertainties and market volatility, investors can rest assured that American stocks are not only surviving but thriving as well. Thus, it is high time that we debunk the misconception that American stocks are a bad investment and acknowledge the immense potential they hold for investors seeking long-term growth and rewarding returns."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Is this product review positive?

Since 2001, the band's line-up has included vocalist and rhythm guitarist Duff McKagan (Velvet Revolver and Guns N' Roses), lead guitarist Mike Squires (formerly of Nevada Bachelors and Alien Crime Syndicate) and bassist Jeff Rouse (formerly of Alien Crime Syndicate, Sirens Sister, and Vendetta Red). Since 2009, Isaac Carpenter (formerly of Loudermilk, Gosling, and The Exies) has been the band's drummer, replacing Geoff Reading (formerly of New American Shame and Green Apple Quick Step). McKagan first formed Loaded to be his touring band in support of his unreleased solo album Beautiful Disease. Duff McKagan was previously a member of Guns N' Roses from the mid-1980s to late 1990s. Guns N' Roses achieved international success, going on to sell over 100 million albums worldwide, but the strain between singer Axl Rose and the rest of the band led to a number of members leaving or being fired, with McKagan departing in 1997. McKagan moved back to Seattle, reforming previous group 10 Minute Warning, releasing one self-titled album on Sub Pop in 1998, before recording his second solo album Beautiful Disease the same year. Featuring collaborations with former Faith No More drummer Mike Bordin, former Black Flag singer Dez Cadena and his former Guns N' Roses band mates Slash and Izzy Stradlin, Beautiful Disease was scheduled to be released through Geffen in 1999. McKagan formed Loaded, initially as The Gentlemen, to be his band for the tour supporting the album. With McKagan performing lead vocals and bass duties, Loaded's line-up consisted of guitarists Dez Cadena and Michael Barragan as well as drummer Taz Bentley. McKagan began promoting the album; however, following the merger between Geffen and Interscope Records, he was dropped from the label and lost all commercial rights to release the record with only a few promo copies being leaked. Loaded continued to tour and released a live album, Episode 1999: Live, independently, which was recorded and mixed by Nick Raskulinecz. They re-recorded half of Beautiful Disease and received offers from four labels. However, they disbanded before the end of the year, with McKagan and Bentley becoming part of Izzy Stradlin's rhythm section for his tour of Japan supporting Ride On.

No Neymar means no trophy and no trophy means no escaping the nightmare which has haunted Brazil for 64 years — ever since the last time they failed to win the World Cup on home soil. That appeared to be the consensus as celebrations that followed a 2-1 win against Colombia in a pulsating quarter-final were tinged with sadness. Neymar’s injury had swiftly been confirmed as a broken vertebra, an X-ray was broadcast on television to prove the point and president Dilma Rousseff took to social media to offer her best wishes for a speedy recovery. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch videos of Neymar after his World Cup ending injury. Emotional: David Luiz hugs Neymar as he waits to board an ambulance after Friday's win over Colombia. Cynical: With the ball nowhere near Juan Zuniga smashes his knee into the lower part of Neymar's back. Agony: Neymar clutches his back after going down injured during Brazil's win over Colombia on Friday. Carried away: Neymar was stretchered off the pitch and taken to hospital after Brazil's quarter-final win. ‘Forca Neymar,’ she tweeted, as did others such as model Gisele Bundchen, Miami Heat basketball star LeBron James and German footballers including Mesut Ozil and Lukas Podolski, who must have been secretly delighted to learn Brazil’s best player cannot face them in Tuesday’s semi-final. Hundreds of bright yellow replica No 10 shirts on market stalls and hawked by street sellers seemed to sag in disappointment, crested hairstyles drooped around Brazil and bookmakers, for the first time, decided the hosts could no longer be considered favourites to win. Neymar will not play again in this tournament. The initial diagnosis predicted an absence of about six weeks from football and, while parallels can be drawn with Pele — the original No 10 who also hailed from the Santos club and was fouled out of a World Cup, ending Brazilian hopes in 1966 — others tried to lift the gloom. Leading the campaign was David Luiz, climbing the popularity polls with a statesmanlike air. Get well soon: Thiago Silva hugs Neymar as the Brazil team wish their star man well after his injury. Precaution: Neymar is wheeled into hospital and appears to be on a drip as doctors attend to the injured star. Not only is he scoring precious goals, like the brilliant free-kick against Colombia, but the centre-half has a canny knack for connecting with the masses. ‘To play in a semi-final of the World Cup is a dream,’ said Luiz. ‘When I was young, I dreamed of days like this but I am sad because Neymar is out of the competition. 'He is like my brother. He is a great guy, a great person and a great player who brings the good things to football: happiness and magic. ‘Brazil will suffer a lot from this loss but Neymar will help us with his happiness. We have made a pact to support him. He will grow taller from this moment. It would be great if we could win it and celebrate with him.’ Moving: Neymar was flown to Sao Paulo by helicopter to begin his recovery. Devastated: Neymar is transported from an ambulance to a military helicopter to be airlifted home. Thanks: Neymar managed a wave as he left for Sao Paulo. Inside the squad, Neymar is so much more than an icon of youth culture. You can see that the warmth and affection colleagues reserve for him is genuine when you watch them training, where he laughs if one of his tricks fails and he is teased like anyone else. True, he is their most gifted creative force, capable of lifting Brazil out of the ordinary, but he also grafts and offers more humility than you might expect for a diamond-studded 22-year-old whose image appears at every turn and who is adored by millions. ‘Neymar is a boy who fights a lot,’ said Luiz. ‘He dreamed about playing in a World Cup and now he is out because of a foul the defender probably should have avoided.’ Colombia’s Juan Zuniga is Brazil’s new public enemy, the man who rammed his knee into the base of Neymar’s spine as they contested the ball near the end of the quarter-final. Support: Brazilian model Gisele Budnchen said she was praying for a fast recovery for her compatriot. Team spirit: Leo Messi also took to social media to wish his Barcelona teammate a speedy recovery. Manager Luiz Felipe Scolari claimed his star man had been ‘hunted’ by opponents after his terrific start to the tournament. Neymar suffered a knee injury against Chile when he was cut down in full flight. The Brazil manager, however, swerved the fact that his own side had employed strong-arm tactics on Friday in a bid to silence James Rodriguez, of Colombia. Luiz added: ‘I never crucify players. You do things when you are emotional and don’t think. 'I will just say if he did it with bad intentions because he wanted to injure him, then I think he will feel sad. If he just tried to stop the game that’s natural, that’s football.’ Brazil captain Thiago Silva offered support for Zuniga. ‘I know him from Serie A and he does not have any nastiness in him,’ said PSG defender Silva, who was formerly at AC Milan. ‘What he did was rash but I know it can be difficult to get the ball from Neymar.’ The challenge is to prove there is life after Neymar for a team that have come to rely rather too heavily on his invention and goal threat. Without him, they will fret about how much they can create from open play. National icon: The Barcelona forward is by far the most popular player in Luiz Felipe Scolari's squad. Against Chile and Colombia, the goals came from centre-halves Luiz, who scored twice, and Silva, all from set-pieces. Who wins most of these free-kicks and corners? Neymar, by dribbling at defenders. In his absence, there will be a greater onus on others. Oscar is expected to return to a central role, which he will relish, and his Chelsea team-mate Willian is among the candidates to come in against Germany in Belo Horizonte. Almost as bad for Scolari is the loss of Silva. The captain is suspended after picking up a yellow card for interfering with a kick by Colombia goalkeeper David Ospina. Broken: The x-ray showing Neymar's injured back, highlighting the broken bone. Silva was magnificent in the quarter-final on Friday. He is the team’s strongest and most reliable defender, providing the stability which allows Luiz to step forward and contribute on the counter-attack. The loss will be eased by the return of defensive midfielder Luiz Gustavo after a one-match ban but will still be keenly felt. ‘This is the moment to show the strength of the squad,’ said Silva. ‘This moment could mark the start of a revolution for us. 'We have proposed to win the World Cup for Neymar. This could unite us. It could give us more determination to win.’ Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","response":"The article provides a detailed account of the events surrounding Neymar's injury during the 2014 FIFA World Cup quarter-final match between Brazil and Colombia. Neymar's injury, a broken vertebra, was a turning point for Brazil, as the star player was unable to play for the rest of the tournament, causing his teammates and the nation to rally behind him for a speedy recovery. Many high-profile supporters, including Brazil's president Dilma Rousseff and athletes like LeBron James, expressed their solidarity with Neymar on social media. The article also discusses the impact of Neymar's absence on Brazil's gameplay, as the team struggled in subsequent matches without their iconic player's creativity and goal-scoring prowess. The article highlights the sportsmanship of Brazil captain Thiago Silva, who supported his teammate Neymar but also defended the Colombian player who caused the injury, Juan Zuniga. The piece concludes by discussing the team's determination to win the World Cup for Neymar and to prove their resilience in the face of adversity."},{"question":"Please answer a question about the following article about Southeast Asia: Homo sapiens reached the region by around 45,000 years ago, having moved eastwards from the Indian subcontinent.

The National Transportation Safety Board released a preliminary report Thursday on the New Jersey Turnpike crash that badly injured Morgan and killed one of his friends, comedian James McNair, in the early morning hours of June 7. Morgan, 45, suffered broken ribs, a broken nose and a broken leg. His condition has been upgraded from critical to fair, his publicist Lewis Kay said this week. The condition of another limo passenger, Jeff Millea, has also improved to fair, Kay said. Hospitalized Tracy Morgan upgraded to fair condition A criminal complaint filed by police said driver Kevin Roper had been awake for more than 24 hours at the time of the crash. Roper, 35, pleaded not guilty to charges that include vehicular homicide and assault by auto. He is free on 50,000 bond. The NTSB report said the 2011 Peterbilt truck owned and operated by Walmart was speeding at 65 mph for the 60 seconds before the crash. Roper allegedly ignored a sign a mile earlier warning that lanes were closed ahead for construction and another sign a half-mile later reducing the speed limit from 55 mph to 45 mph, the report said. The 2012 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter limo carrying Morgan and five other passengers had slowed down because of congestion caused by the center and right lanes being shut down to allow contractors to work on a large overhead sign nearly 3 miles down the road, the NTSB said. The truck struck the rear of Morgan's limo, and the \\"two vehicles moved forward and were involved in secondary impacts with other vehicles that were slowed in the traffic queue,\\" the report said. \\"The limo van rolled over and came to rest on its left side, facing east, across the center and right lanes.\\" Roper, who lives in Georgia but was based in Delaware, reported for work at 11:22 a.m. on June 6, according to the NTSB report. He made deliveries to Walmart stores in New Jersey, Delaware and Pennsylvania before the wreck 13 hours, 32 minutes later, it said. Federal rules limit interstate commercial drivers to 14-hour shifts before they must rest, the report said. His total driving time that day was 9 hours, 37 minutes, which is below the 11 hours allowed by federal limits, the report said. The NTSB, however, is also looking at how long Roper was awake and driving before he reported to work the day before the crash, officials told CNN on Thursday. He lives in Georgia and commutes to his job more than 700 miles away in Smyrna, Delaware, NTSB spokesman Keith Holloway said. Federal investigators based their preliminary findings largely on the small computer on board the truck that records speed, engine performance, brakes and other information, the report said. Walmart said last week that it believed Roper was operating within federal rest guidelines but said it would take full responsibility if the investigation shows its truck was to blame. \\"The details are the subject of the ongoing investigation, and we are cooperating fully with the appropriate law enforcement agencies,\\" said Brooke Buchanan, a spokeswoman for the company. The NTSB also released new images of the truck and van based on 3-dimensional scans of them after the crash.

The statuses we assume often vary with the people we encounter,and change throughout life.Most of us can,at very high speed,assume the statuses that various situations require.Much of social interaction consists of identifying and selecting among appropriate statuses and allowing other people to assume their statuses in relation to us.This means that we fit our actions to those of other people,based on a constant mental process of _ and interpretation.Although some of us find the task more difficult than others.most of us perform it rather effortlessly. A status has been compared to ready-made clothes.Within certain limits the buyer can choose style and fabric.But an American is not free to choose the costume of a Chinese peasant or that of a Hindu prince.We must choose from among the clothing presented by our society.Further more,our choice is limited to a size that will fit,as well as by our pocketbook.Having made a choice within these limits,we can have certain alterations made,but apart from minor adjustments.We tend to be limited to what the stores have on their racks.Statuses too come ready made,and the range of choice among them is limited.

First, I will initialize two variables, 'max_val' and 'min_val', to store the maximum and minimum values found so far in the list. I will set them to the first integer in the list, which is -84. 2. I will iterate through the list starting from the second integer, comparing each number to 'max_val' and 'min_val'. If we find a greater value than 'max_val', we will update it with the new value. Similarly, if we find a smaller value than 'min_val', we will update it with the new value. 3. After iterating through the list, we will calculate the maximum absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values we found, which is the absolute value of 'max_val' - 'min_val'. 4.

Hypothesis: People are wary of checking accounts and have not believed in them for a long time. Step 2: Identify the key concepts in the premise and hypothesis Premise: believe, checking accounts, sacrosanct, not been for a long time Hypothesis: wary, checking accounts, not believed, long time Step 3: Compare the key concepts in the premise and hypothesis - Both the premise and hypothesis mention checking accounts as the center of discussion. - The premise states that people want to believe checking accounts are sacrosanct, while the hypothesis states that people are wary of checking accounts. - Both indicate a negative aspect towards checking accounts for a long time. Step 4: Determine if the premise entails the hypothesis - The premise suggests that people desire to believe checking accounts are protected and secure, but they ultimately know they haven't been for a long time. - The hypothesis, on the other hand, posits that people are already mistrustful of checking accounts and that this lack of trust has persisted for a long time. Upon comparing the key concepts and analyzing the relationship between the premise and hypothesis, I can determine that the premise does not fully entail the hypothesis. The premise hints at people's desire for security in their checking accounts but acknowledges the reality that they haven't been. Meanwhile, the hypothesis asserts that people are wary and do not believe in checking accounts. The premise doesn't necessarily imply that people are wary; it merely acknowledges the accounts' flawed status over time."},{"question":"Is \\"The foxes have gotten very bold.\\" true if \\"The foxes are getting in at night and attacking the chickens.

The idea of combining motion pictures with recorded sound is nearly as old as film itself, but because of the technical challenges involved, synchronized dialogue was only made practical in the late 1920s with the perfection of the Audion amplifier tube and the introduction of the Vitaphone system. During silent films, a pianist, theatre organist, or, in large cities, even a small orchestra would often play music to accompany the films. Pianists and organists would either play from sheet music or improvise; an orchestra would play from sheet music. What entity does 'drew casper' has the relation 'occupation' with?

Monica relished her freedom. [B]. Emily relished her freedom.","response":"Monica loved her life as a successful, independent woman. It wasn't that she was against marriage, but she had an exciting career, a group of close friends, and a passion for traveling the world. Naturally, the concept of settling down seemed tedious and mundane for her adventurous soul. On the other hand, Emily, Monica's best friend from childhood, had chosen a different path. She got married at a relatively young age, and although Emily was happy with her family, she occasionally looked back on her carefree unmarried days with a touch of nostalgia. When the two friends spent time together, Emily found herself living vicariously through Monica's thrilling stories and experiences. While this may seem like a setup for jealousy and envy, Monica did not envy Emily's married life, nor did she pity her friend for her perceived loss of freedom. In fact, Monica admired Emily's unwavering commitment and dedication to her family. She saw how Emily's sterling qualities shaped a nurturing and loving environment for her husband and their two lovely children. Monica cherished her personal and professional growth, as it allowed her to lead a fulfilling life, filled with many accomplishments and experiences she would recall fondly. The sense of freedom she acquired from living on her own terms was something she could not imagine trading for anything else. Embracing her own freedom, Emily, too, found solace in the stability and joys she shared with her family. Her husband's support, mirthful laughter during Friday pizza nights, and the heartwarming feeling of snuggling under blankets during family movie time, assured her that she made the right decision for herself. When Monica and Emily openly talked about their respective lives, they both understood that their individual journeys were not better or worse than the other's; they were simply different. Each of them was writing their own unique story, filled with challenges, triumphs, and cherished memories. Over the years, Monica and Emily supported each other in their chosen paths. Monica would occasionally babysit Emily's kids, giving her friend some much-needed downtime. Emily would listen with rapt attention to Monica's tales of her latest solo adventure, happy to sharing vicarious excitement. Through their mutual respect and understanding of each other's choices, their friendship became even stronger. Monica did not envy Emily's married life, just as Emily did not envy Monica's single life. The two friends chose to focus on what truly mattered to each of them, finding happiness in their individual paths while maintaining their deep bond of friendship. So, as Monica looked forward to her next voyage and Emily prepared for another cozy weekend with her family, they knew that they could always count on each other for support, understanding, and camaraderie. Their friendship was truly a testament to the power of empathy and respect to bridge the differences that life's decisions may impose on two ultimately indefatigable spirits."},{"question":"Background: John Charles Wiltshire-Butler (born 1 April 1975), known professionally as John Butler, is an Australian singer, songwriter, and music producer. He is the front man for the John Butler Trio, a roots and jam band, which formed in Fremantle, Western Australia in 1998. The John Butler Trio has recorded five studio albums including three that have reached number one on the Australian charts: Sunrise Over Sea, Grand National and April Uprising. His recordings and live performances have met with critical praise and have garnered awards from the Australian Performing Right Association and Australian Recording Industry Association. Context: The early sessions for the John Butler Trio's sixth studio album commenced in mid-2013, following the band's largest tour of the US. For the first time in the band's lifetime, the members began with a blank songwriting slate, rather than using the initial ideas of Butler that had been introduced. Butler gathered with Luiters and Bomba at The Compound in Fremantle, Western Australia, which serves as the band's headquarters and the frontman's artistic space, and co-wrote material for the first time, deviating from the Butler-centric process of the past: \\"I had always brought the material.\\" After contributing a large portion of work towards the album, Bomba eventually left the Compound space to work on his Melbourne Ska Orchestra project and was replaced by Grant Gerathy. Butler explained in an interview during the band's US tour: But a lot of these songs on this album I kind of magpied. Magpies are this bird in Australia that takes shiny things from anywhere and builds its nest, and so that's kind of what I do. I'll take a little of my own experience of having some heavy party time with certain friends, and then I'll hear some other stories about addicts or other intense relationships. I'll put them into the mixing pot and make up these characters to explore different possibilities and emotional landscapes. One of the songs on the album, \\"Wings Are Wide\\", was written as a dedication to his grandmother, who gave Butler his grandfather's Dobro guitar that became the foundation for his songwriting. Butler admitted that \\"I wasn't at all into roots music or playing the slide or anything when I got it, and it sat under my bed for a long, long time.\\" Released in Australia on 8 February 2014, Flesh and Blood was produced by Jan Skubiszewski and features a vocal duet with Ainslie Wills.

Brisbane A:","response":"Title: Depths of Deception Genre: Action-Thriller Plot Summary: After retiring from his career as a top-level CIA operative, Kyle Adams relocates to Brisbane, Australia, hoping to leave the world of espionage behind. He starts a new life as a small business owner of a coastal tour company, only to find himself drawn back into the world of international intrigue when a mysterious Russian submarine unexpectedly docks in Brisbane. As Kyle begins to investigate, he unwittingly becomes entangled in a tangled web of double-crosses, high-stakes diplomacy, and nuclear threats that will force him to confront his past and determine the fate of nations. Act I: Kyle Adams, a former CIA operative with a storied career, arrives in Brisbane, Australia, seeking a new start away from the dangerous world of espionage. He befriends several locals and starts his own coastal tour company. Life seems normal and mundane until one day, a Russian submarine unexpectedly surfaces near the coast of Brisbane. Alarmed by this occurrence so far from Russian waters, Kyle reluctantly starts investigating, thinking his expertise might be of some help. Act II: Using his extensive knowledge and connections, Kyle manages to infiltrate the submarine base and discovers secret plans to destabilize the Australian government through a joint operation between rogue elements within the Russian Navy and an unknown enemy. To further complicate matters, Kyle uncovers evidence suggesting that a former lover and CIA colleague, Alyssa Clarke, is now in cahoots with the Russians and may be spearheading this operation. As Kyle immerses himself in the complex conspiracy, he is captured by Alyssa and taken aboard the Russian submarine. During his captivity, Kyle learns that the submarine is equipped with a newly developed nuclear device capable of producing a devastating electromagnetic pulse, which would render all electronics in Australia useless and exponentially weaken the country's defense systems. Act III: While on the submarine, Kyle and Alyssa clash over their opposing views and past emotions. Alyssa reveals her reasons for betraying the CIA: her disenchantment with the agency's corruption and disillusionment with global politics. The submarine's captain, Captain Volkov, begins to question the motives behind this mission, ultimately siding with Kyle. With the clock ticking, Kyle, Alyssa, and Captain Volkov devise a plan to thwart the rogue operation and prevent the nuclear device from being activated. In a thrilling climax, Kyle confronts the mastermind, who turns out to be a high-ranking Australian official seeking to consolidate power by inciting a war between Australia and Russia. The ensuing battle results in the submarine's sinking, but not before the nuclear device is disarmed by our heroes. Epilogue: With the plan foiled and the Australian official exposed, Kyle and Alyssa reconcile their differences, though Alyssa must face the consequences of her actions. In recognition of his role in preventing a potential international crisis, Kyle is offered a high-level position within the CIA. However, he declines, choosing instead to return to the peaceful life he forged in Brisbane, truly putting the past behind him. As they part ways, Alyssa whispers to Kyle, \\"Thank you for saving me. Maybe one day we can rebuild our lives together.\\" With a sad smile and a final farewell, they walk away from each other into the uncertainty of their futures.

Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning? Pick from: I. It's easy! Just cut the four corners off the wood at a 30 degree angle. with a saw. II. It's easy! Just cut the four sides off the wood at a 30 degree angle. with a saw.","response":"Between the two solutions provided, the second option (II) is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning for making a hexagon shape out of a piece of wood. However, neither option is entirely accurate. Here's a detailed description of how to properly make a hexagon shape: 1. Prepare the wood: Begin by selecting a good-quality piece of flat, smooth wood, which is suitable for your desired hexagonal project. The selected wood should be free of cracks, knots, and other imperfections. 2. Determine the desired side lengths and angles: Measure and decide on the desired side length of your hexagonal shape. Since a hexagon has six sides of equal length and equally spaced internal angles of 120 degrees, you can easily calculate the angles needed for cutting (120° / 2 = 60°). 3. Calculate the dimensions: You can use basic geometry formulas to calculate the length of your wood and other dimensions. For example, to find the distance between two opposite sides, you can use the formula (side length x square root of 3) / 2. 4. Mark the cuts: Use a measuring tape, a carpenter's square, and a pencil to mark the locations of the six angled cuts, thus forming a hexagonal shape on your piece of wood. Given the measurements of your hexagonal shape, you might want to use a protractor to help ensure precise angles of 60 degrees for each cut. 5. Make the first cut: With a miter saw or a table saw with a miter gauge, set the saw to a 60-degree angle. Align the wood and carefully make the first cut along the marked line. Use a saw with a fine, sharp blade to ensure smooth cuts and to avoid tearing or splintering the wood. 6. Rotate and continue cutting: After making the first cut, rotate the wood and align the next marked line with the saw blade. Ensure that the angle is still set at 60 degrees before making the next cut. Continue this process for each of the six angles. 7. Sand the edges: Once all six cuts are made and you have your hexagonal shape, you'll want to smooth any rough or jagged edges with sandpaper. Be sure to maintain the precise angles and side lengths of your hexagon while sanding. 8. Finishing touches: Once the edges are smooth and the shape is well-defined, you can proceed with any staining, painting, or finishing treatments that suit your project. So, in conclusion, option II is closer to the correct process but still requires adjustments and more accurate angle measurements for cutting a hexagon shape out of a piece of wood."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

These include: 1. Advertising on the local rock radio station: The band has the backing of a local rock radio station, which suggests that in the weeks leading up to the event, they will have advertisements and announcements broadcasted on the station to promote the CD release party and encourage people to attend. 2. Live remotes from the show: It seems that the local rock radio station will have live remotes from the show, indicating that they might have interviews, discussions, or other live coverage related to the event before it starts. This will serve as a promotional tool, creating more excitement and interest among the listeners. 3. Door prizes: The passage mentions that there will be door prizes, so arrangements for these gifts will need to be made before the event starts. This could involve purchasing or partnering with sponsors to provide attractive door prizes to encourage more people to attend. 4. Other stuff to sell: As they have mentioned other items for sale, there may be some preparation related to merchandising, like designing and producing merchandise or arranging for a vendor to handle sales during the event. The merchandise can also serve as a promotional tool, giving people a tangible item to remember the event by. 5. Coordination with the cover band and Guitar Hero contest: As they have managed to get a great cover band to follow up the night, and organized a Guitar Hero contest, they will likely need to coordinate with the involved parties regarding schedules, set up, and rules for the contest.

Options: - understand details - being able to use - loss of money - economic boom - spending money The answer is \\"being able to use\\" because Answer:","response":"After purchasing a product, reading the manual is highly beneficial because it enables the user to understand its full functionality and utilize it effectively and efficiently. Among the available options, \\"being able to use\\" is the most accurate selection, as it highlights the primary aim of reading a product manual. There are several reasons behind this premise: 1. Familiarization: Manuals typically provide a comprehensive overview of the product, its features, and components. By going through this information, users become familiar with their purchase and can better comprehend its purpose and workings. 2. Proper Assembly: If the product requires assembly, a manual will include step-by-step instructions to guide users in putting it together correctly and safely. This ensures that the product operates as intended and reduces the risk of accidents or damage. 3. Safe Operation: Manuals often lay out specific safety precautions that need to be followed while using the product. By adhering to these guidelines, users can prevent accidents, malfunctions, or injuries. 4. Optimal Use: A well-written manual will explain how to best utilize the product to maximize its performance and lifespan. Understanding these suggestions allows users to get the most value out of their purchase and ensures that it operates at peak efficiency. 5.

The review then goes on to say that \\"Beat Street\\" is still a dull show, which indicates a negative sentiment. 3. It acknowledges that the film is cashing in on the breakdancing craze; however, it also mentions some entertainment value from the plot and characters. This suggests a somewhat mixed sentiment. 4. The reviewer states that the director, Stan Lathan, and the cast are struggling with the story and characters. This indicates a negative sentiment. 5. The review credits the funky music and fresh dancing for providing some entertainment. This suggests a slightly positive sentiment. 6.

The ancient bacteria were found frozen in the world's oldest known tracts of ice, the glaciers of Antarctica. Professor Bidle and his colleagues found and revived two samples of bacteria from the glacial ice. The first was a hundred thousand years old, and the second was around eight million years old.

One of my fellow volunteers, a girl from Tanzania, seemed a little unhappy, so I asked what the problem was. She told me she had a friend back home who had financial difficulties and maybe it was impossible for her to complete her university courses. So this friend of mine had sent all her money to Tanzania to support her friend! This meant that she didn't have much food to eat and no money to go anywhere outside the village. I was so touched and I felt I had to do something. So, during my next trip to one of the nearby towns I walked into a shop. I didn't have much money left myself but I thought I'd buy her an extra box of chocolate we both liked and some rice. I started talking to the woman(also a volunteer)working in the shop and eventually told her about my friend. The woman looked at me, amazed. \\"Does she eat pasta?\\" she asked. \\"Yes,\\" I replied. She immediately started loading a bag with pasta, cookies, and other things until the bag was full. \\"Give her this for me. It's my treat!'' I couldn't believe it but accepted with happiness. As I left the shop to go home with my unexpected bag of food, I asked the woman her name. \\"Just Gloria,\\" she said. Imagine my friend's face when I arranged the gifts on my kitchen table and fetched her from her room to see! I had never seen her so happy!

Answer:","response":"C) Because the writer was moved by her kind act. The writer decided to help the girl from Tanzania because they were touched and inspired by the girl's selfless act of sending all her money to support her friend back home, despite facing financial difficulties herself. The writer's decision to help was not simply because they were a volunteer or shared the same living space, but because they were deeply moved by the Tanzanian girl's demonstration of kindness, compassion, and sacrifice. In the story, the writer goes above and beyond their own limited resources to provide not only a small gift but also assistance in overcoming the girl's financial situation. This aid took the form of unexpected generosity from Gloria, another volunteer at the shop, who filled a bag with food for the Tanzanian girl as a gesture of kindness and solidarity. The connection between compassion and action is the central theme of this story, with the writer being emotionally affected by the Tanzanian girl's act and in turn, extending their help. The writer embarked on this journey not out of obligation or proximity, but because they genuinely cared for the well-being of their fellow volunteer. The acts of kindness from both the writer and Gloria illustrate the power of empathy and connection, leaving a lasting impression on those involved."},{"question":"Premise: A football team stands on the field with a referee as fans in bright yellow attire stand idly by waiting for a response.

Bulger stands accused of 19 killings, out of which 17 are known to have ended in fatal shots. Step 3: Expand on the facts In some of the most gripping parts of the trial, the medical examiner narrates the gruesome manner in which the victims were killed. Each account, a chilling reminder of the potency of violence, provides explicit illustrations of the fatal shots fired by Bulger and his accomplices. In an attempt to establish an unassailable case against the accused, the prosecution unfolds the specifics, bullet by bullet, body by body.

The graphic narration seemed to visibly disturb many on the jury, with several members squirming in their seats. This reaction underscores the graphic and dreadful nature of the crimes, pointing to the heavy emotional toll exacted on those obliged to listen to the grim details. Step 5: Conclude the article, adding a hint of what the trial's outcome could mean The Bulger trial is a stark reminder of a time in history where the mafia reigned with terror. As the facts are laid bare by the medical examiner, it reveals not just the path of Bulger's terror but the monstrous nature of mob violence in general.

Would it require more strength for a construction worker to move a heavy load of bricks with a pulley that used 1 rope segment? or 10 rope segments?","response":"To understand the role of rope segments in a pulley system, it's crucial to first clarify the basic principles of how pulleys function. In general, pulleys are used to modify the impact of force necessary to move heavy loads. They work by transforming force along an extended distance, resulting in a smaller amount of force needed for a given task. This principle can be seen in the mechanical advantage provided by various pulley configurations. To directly address your question: Yes, it would require significantly more strength for a construction worker to move a heavy load of bricks using a pulley system with just one rope segment compared to a system that employs ten rope segments. The efficacy of a given pulley system can be determined by analyzing its mechanical advantage. Mechanical advantage (MA) denotes the force amplification achieved by employing a specific pulley system. In simple terms, it refers to the ratio of output force (i.e., the force acting upon the load) to input force (i.e., the minimum force applied by the person pulling the rope). To calculate the mechanical advantage of a pulley system, count the number of rope segments contributing to the lifting process. For example, if there are 1 rope segment in the pulley system, then the mechanical advantage is 1:1. In this case, the worker would have to exert the same force as the weight of the load to lift it. In essence, the pulley wouldn't be providing any significant assistance in terms of reducing the necessary effort. On the other hand, if the pulley system consists of 10 rope segments, the mechanical advantage would be 10:1. This means that the construction worker would only have to apply 1/10th of the load's weight as force to achieve the same lifting process. Consequently, the system comprising 10 rope segments would require far less strength and effort on the part of the worker. However, it is important to note that increased mechanical advantage also results in a greater distance over which force must be applied. In other words, while the worker should exert less force in a system with more rope segments, they would have to pull the rope over a longer distance to effectively move the load. This trade-off is inherent in the design of pulley systems and must be taken into account when determining the most appropriate configuration for a specific task. In conclusion, a construction worker would require more strength to move a heavy load of bricks using a pulley system with just one rope segment as opposed to one containing ten rope segments. The increased mechanical advantage provided by the latter system enables the worker to exert a smaller amount of force, although the distance over which this force must be applied is proportionally greater."},{"question":"Can you tell me the answer to who wrote im in love with my car??","response":"To find the answer, I will perform the following steps: 1.

Even though it's sunny outside he's going to have to bundle up due to the cold temperature. In his closet there is a large black coat and a large white coat. He can't decide which coat to wear. But I can use this background: Light may transfer its energy to matter rather than being reflected or transmitted by matter. This is called absorption . When light is absorbed, the added energy increases the temperature of matter. If you get into a car that has been sitting in the sun all day, the seats and other parts of the car’s interior may be almost too hot to touch, especially if they are black or very dark in color. That’s because dark colors absorb most of the sunlight that strikes them. What is an answer for this question: Which coat will absorb more sunlight? The answer is:","response":"The large black coat will absorb more sunlight than the large white coat. According to the given background information, when light is absorbed by matter, its added energy increases the temperature of that matter. Dark colors, such as black, have a higher tendency to absorb most of the sunlight that strikes them. This absorption leads to a significant increase in temperature, which can be observed when touching dark surfaces or objects that have been exposed to sunlight for an extended period of time. In contrast, light colors, such as white, reflect more sunlight and tend to absorb less light energy. This is because these colors have a higher albedo, which is the proportion of the incident light that is reflected by a surface. With a higher albedo, more light is reflected, and therefore, less energy is absorbed by the material. This results in a cooler temperature for the light-colored items when compared to their darker counterparts. Considering all these factors, if Johnathan were to wear the large black coat, it would absorb more sunlight, making it warmer when compared to the large white coat. In the winter season, insulation and warmth are desirable features to stay protected from the cold temperature. Thus, the large black coat would be a better choice for Johnathan as it would absorb more sunlight and help keep him warm while walking to work in the cold winter weather."},{"question":"Sentence 1: It was written by Tom Spezialy and Marc Cherry and was led by Jeff Melman .

The Industrial Revolution indeed initiated an era of per-capita economic growth in capitalist economies. However, it did not directly address the major obstacles facing the Industrial Revolution. To give you a comprehensive understanding of the major obstacles faced during the Industrial Revolution, here are some key challenges: 1. Technological limitations: During the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, technology was relatively primitive. Early machines were inefficient and required constant supervision. It took time, resources, and innovations to improve and refine the machinery. 2. Limited access to raw materials: The availability of raw materials played a crucial role in the advancement of industrialization. Countries without abundant natural resources faced difficulties in fueling their factories and found themselves dependent on importing goods like coal and iron ore. 3. Poor infrastructure: Transporting raw materials and finished goods was a major challenge due to inadequate and underdeveloped transportation infrastructure. The lack of good quality roads and railways resulted in higher costs and delays in bringing products to markets. 4. Labor exploitation: An increased demand for labor led to the exploitation of workers, including long working hours, low wages, and poor working conditions. The lack of labor rights and regulations led to many social and political issues. 5. Resistance to change: Many traditional industries and workers faced displacement due to the rise of mechanized production. The Luddite movement, for example, saw skilled textile artisans protesting against the adoption of labor-saving machines, as they feared unemployment and loss of skills. 6. Environmental impact: As industries expanded, environmental pollution and degradation became a major concern. Air and water pollution caused by coal burning and industrial waste resulted in public health issues, eventually prompting governments to introduce regulations aimed at controlling pollution. 7. Lack of finance and investment capital: The Industrial Revolution demanded substantial financial investment to establish new factories and industries. In the early stages, many entrepreneurs faced difficulties obtaining sufficient financing, often relying on personal funds or obtaining loans from local banks. Addressing these obstacles was an essential part of the Industrial Revolution's progress, as each challenge encountered required innovative solutions to pave the way for growth and development."},{"question":"Question: The answer to the question: What are the names of the two Decepticons that detect a signal activated by Charlie? is inside the article: On the planet Cybertron, the Autobot resistance, led by Optimus Prime, is on the verge of losing the civil war against the Decepticons and prepare to evacuate the planet.

However, to accurately support the hypothesis \\"Rice wine is a favorite drink of people in the region,\\" we must examine both the cultural context of the region and the role of rice wine within that context. The Gawai Festival, or the Rice Harvest Festival, is an annual event celebrated in Sarawak, which is located in Malaysian Borneo. This festival predominantly involves the native Iban and Dayak people, who have a rich cultural history that spans many generations. This cultural celebration marks the end of the rice harvesting season and allows people to gather together in gratitude, as well as to pray for a bountiful harvest in the coming year. The festival is an amalgamation of various traditional practices and rituals, such as offering thanks to the gods, honoring ancestors, and organizing various forms of entertainment. One of the key components of the Gawai Festival is the consumption of rice wine, also known as 'tuak.' Tuak is a traditional alcoholic beverage that is made by fermenting glutinous rice with yeast. During the Gawai Festival, this traditional rice wine is served in abundance, and people consume it as a means of festive celebration. It is not only enjoyed by the natives but also the visitors to the region who participate in the festival. The presence of rice wine is not restricted to the Gawai Festival alone; it is also served during other significant social and religious events, such as weddings and spiritual ceremonies. In this context, the hypothesis \\"Rice wine is a favorite drink of people in the region\\" seems plausible. This is primarily due to the cultural significance of rice wine and the integral role it plays in various aspects of Sarawak's communal life. The consumption of rice wine is a deeply-rooted tradition and its importance can be witnessed during the Gawai Festival and other occasions in the region. However, it is essential to analyze the hypothesis from a wider perspective. Sarawak is a region with diverse cultural backgrounds, ethnicities, and traditions, and therefore, it might be hasty to generalize that rice wine is the favorite drink of all people in the region. Preferences for beverages may vary based on factors like ethnicity, religion, personal taste, and more. In conclusion, while the given premise implies that rice wine is indeed an important and widely enjoyed beverage during the Gawai Festival, it is essential to consider the degree to which the entire population of the region consumes and appreciates rice wine. Moreover, personal preferences may still dictate whether rice wine is the favorite drink of all people in the region or not. Therefore, the hypothesis that \\"Rice wine is a favorite drink of people in the region\\" may be accurate in some aspects, but it must be considered with a broader perspective and acknowledgment of Sarawak's cultural complexity."},{"question":"Generate short a sentence that can be linguistically classified as [b].

London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly. - A parish church in the Church of England is the church which acts as the religious centre for the people within the smallest and most basic Church of England administrative region, the parish since the 19th century called the ecclesiastical parish (outside meetings of the church) to avoid confusion with the civil parish which many towns and villages have. - The Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead is a Royal Borough of Berkshire, in South East England. It is home to Windsor Castle, Eton College, Legoland and Ascot Racecourse. - Windsor Castle is a royal residence at Windsor in the English county of Berkshire. It is notable for its long association with the English and later British royal family and for its architecture. The original castle was built in the 11th century after the Norman invasion of England by William the Conqueror. Since the time of Henry I, it has been used by the reigning monarch and is the longest-occupied palace in Europe. The castle's lavish early 19th-century State Apartments were described by the art historian Hugh Roberts as \\"a superb and unrivalled sequence of rooms widely regarded as the finest and most complete expression of later Georgian taste\\". Inside the castle walls is the 15th-century St George's Chapel, considered by the historian John Martin Robinson to be \\"one of the supreme achievements of English Perpendicular Gothic\\" design. - The Council of the Royal County of Berkshire also known as the Berkshire County Council was the top-tier local government administrative body for Berkshire from 1889 to 1998. A strategic authority, with responsibilities for education, social services, public transport, planning, emergency services and waste disposal, it was composed of 87 members.

The counties typically have populations of 300,000 to 1.4 million. The term \\"shire county\\" is, however, an unofficial usage. Many of the non-metropolitan counties bear historic names and most end in the suffix \\"-shire\\" such as Wiltshire or Staffordshire. Of the remainder, some counties had the -shire ending and have lost it over time; such as Devon and Somerset. \\"Shire county\\" is, strictly, a dual-language tautology since the French-derived \\"county\\" means the same as the older Anglo-Saxon word \\"shire\\". - Crossrail is a railway line under development in London and the home counties of Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Essex.

Letters patent are issued for the appointment of representatives of the Crown, such as governors and governors-general of Commonwealth realms, as well as appointing a Royal Commission. In the United Kingdom they are also issued for the creation of peers of the realm. A particular form of letters patent has evolved into the modern patent (referred to as a utility patent or design patent in United States patent law) granting exclusive rights in an invention (or a design in the case of a design patent). In this case it is essential that the written grant should be in the form of a public document so other inventors can consult it to avoid infringement and also to understand how to \\"practice\\" the invention, i.e., put it into practical use. - In England, an unparished area is an area that is not covered by a civil parish (a small administrative division of local government, not to be confused with an ecclesiastical parish). Most urbanised districts of England are either entirely or partly unparished. Many towns and some cities in otherwise rural districts are also unparished areas and therefore no longer have a town council or city council. Some cities and towns which are unparished areas in larger districts (i.e. not districts of themselves) have charter trustees to maintain a historic charter, such as city status (an example being in Bath) or simply the mayoralty of a town. - Maidenhead is a large town and unparished area in the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead, in Berkshire, England. It lies south of the River Thames, but at Maidenhead, the river runs north-south and so the town is in fact on its west bank. The town has a population in 2011 of 67,404.

Where the air temperature is higher than the water temperature, shallow water may be warmed by the air and the sunlight but deeper water remains cold resulting in a lowering of temperature as the diver descends. This temperature change may be concentrated over a small vertical interval, when it is called a thermocline.[3][4] Where cold, fresh water enters a warmer sea the fresh water may float over the denser saline water, so the temperature rises as the diver descends.[3] In lakes exposed to geothermal activity, the temperature of the deeper water may be warmer than the surface water. This will usually lead to convection currents.[3] and the situation: Deep lake presents geothermal activity, while Shallow lake has mixing of saline water with fresh water. Deep lake had more instances of divers having problems because of thermoclines. Answer the following question: Which lake has more geothermal activity? Answer:","response":"Based on the provided background and situation, Deep lake has more geothermal activity. As mentioned in the background description, in lakes exposed to geothermal activity, the temperature of the deeper water may be warmer than the surface water. This usually leads to the occurrence of convection currents. The situation states that Deep lake experiences geothermal activity, which is consistent with the presence of thermoclines causing problems for divers in that lake. On the other hand, Shallow lake experiences a mixing of saline water with fresh water, but there is no mention of geothermal activity in that lake. The thermoclines in Shallow lake, where the temperature rises as divers descend due to the colder fresh water floating over the denser saline water, do not indicate geothermal activity. In conclusion, based on the information provided, Deep lake has more geothermal activity compared to the Shallow lake."},{"question":"Q: In this task, you are given a sentence in Persian, and your task is to translate it into English. نگهداري از کيف را ميسپارم به تو دارم از اينجا ميرم .

A member of the Democratic Party, he was elected in 2010, holding the same position his father, Mario Cuomo, held for three terms from 1983 to 1995. - The Governor of the State of New York is the chief executive of the U.S. state of New York. The governor is the head of the executive branch of New York's state government and the commander-in-chief of the state's military and naval forces. - A governor is, in most cases, a public official with the power to govern the executive branch of a non-sovereign or sub-national level of government, ranking under the head of state. In federations, \\"governor\\" may be the title of a politician who governs a constituent state and may be either appointed or elected. The power of the individual governor can vary dramatically between political systems, with some governors having only nominal and largely ceremonial power, while others having a complete control over the entire government. - A commander-in-chief is the person or body that exercises supreme operational command and control of a nation's military forces or significant elements of those forces. In the latter case, the force element is those forces within a particular region, or associated by function. As a practical term; it refers to military competencies that reside in a nation-state's executive leadershipeither a head of state, a head of government, a minister of defence, a national cabinet, or some other collegial body. Often, a given country's commander-in-chief (if held by an official) need not be or have been a commissioned officer or even a veteran. This follows the principle of civilian control of the military. - A head of state (or chief of state) is the public persona that officially represents the national unity and legitimacy of a sovereign state. In developing the current Constitution of France (1958), former French president Charles de Gaulle said the head of state should embody \\"the spirit of the nation\\" (\\"\\"). In some countries, typically those with parliamentary governments, the head of state is a ceremonial figurehead that does not actually guide day-to-day government activities and may not even be empowered to exercise any kind of political authority (e.g., Queen Elizabeth II in the United Kingdom). In other countries, the head of state is also the head of government, such as in the U.S., where the president is both a public figurehead and the actual highest ranking political leader who, in practice, oversees the executive branch. - A federation (also known as a federal state) is a political entity characterized by a union of partially self-governing states or regions under a central (federal) government. In a federation, the self-governing status of the component states, as well as the division of power between them and the central government, is typically constitutionally entrenched and may not be altered by a unilateral decision of either party, the states or the federal political body. Alternatively, federation is a form of government in which sovereign power is formally divided between a central authority and a number of constituent regions so that each region retains some degree of control over its internal affairs. - Charles J.

A Quinnipiac University poll showed the Vermont senator with 41 percent, Clinton at 40 percent and Vice President Joe Biden with 12 percent even though he’s not an official candidate. The same poll in July had Sanders at 33 percent and Clinton at 52 percent. Sanders, who turned 74 Tuesday, said even he was amazed by the new figures. “You want me to tell you the truth — yes, I’m stunned,” he said on CNN. In the Republican race, Donald Trump grabbed 32 percent, followed by Ben Carson with 19 in the latest CNN/ORC poll. None of the other 15 GOP candidates broke double-digits, including Jeb Bush, who had 9 percent. The Quinnipiac poll is just the latest to show extraordinary gains for Sanders, who topped Clinton 41-32 in an NBC/Marist College poll issued Monday for New Hampshire, the first primary state. The poll numbers are raising alarm in Clinton’s camp. The candidate has scheduled a series of one-on-one media interviews, sharpened attacks on Republicans and apologized for her private e-mail server. “This is a slog. If you’re not on the edge of your seat or the tip of your toes as part of the Hillary crowd, you’re nuts,” Democratic strategist Peter Fenn, who keeps touch with Clinton’s camp, told The Post. “But panicsville is the wrong reaction.” With the e-mail mess brewing and Clinton’s Benghazi hearing testimony on tap, Marist pollster Lee Miringoff warned, “There’s a lot of potential minefields between now and the [Iowa] caucus.” Sanders’ vow to take on business elites and the establishment is proving tough for Clinton to match. “Senator Bernie Sanders has become the Eugene McCarthy of 2016,” said Peter Brown, who conducted the Iowa poll. “He is the candidate of the Democratic left, against his own party’s bosses and their prized presidential candidate, Secretary Hillary Clinton.” Write a one or two sentence summary.","response":"Bernie Sanders has recently edged past Hillary Clinton in the Democratic presidential race in Iowa according to a Quinnipiac University poll, while Donald Trump leads the Republican race with 32%, followed by Ben Carson with 19%.

Answer:","response":"Ben Wilson, born in 1963 in Cambridge, England, is a renowned painter and found wood sculptor known for his unique contributions to the fields of outsider art and pavement art. Growing up in an artistic environment, Wilson developed an affinity for self-expression through various creative methods. Wilson's father was an esteemed sculptor and architect, which likely played a role in fostering Ben's interest in art. As a young artist, Ben Wilson honed his skills in traditional painting and sculpture, later finding inspiration in less conventional art forms. Wilson's distinct style is marked by his ability to create art using found or discarded materials, transforming them into beautiful works that challenge the viewer's perception of what art should encompass. Over the years, Wilson's career as an artist has evolved, and he has become well-known for his pavement art, particularly his \\"chewing gum art\\" series. This unique form of art involves painting on discarded chewing gum stuck to pavements in various locations. Wilson transforms these unattractive and seemingly worthless materials into vibrant, detailed, and thought-provoking miniatures, capturing the imagination of pedestrians and art enthusiasts alike. One can find an example of this unique art form in the image of Ben Wilson lying on the pavement in Muswell Hill Broadway, engrossed in transforming a piece of chewing gum into a remarkable piece of art. This image, titled \\"Ben Wilson Chewing Gum Artist at Work.jpg,\\" has an accompanying caption of \\"Wilson at Work in Muswell Hill Broadway,\\" providing context and insights into the artist's process. Wilson's innovative approach to art and his commitment to highlighting traditionally disregarded materials challenged the norms of the art world, propelling him to become a leading figure in outsider art. By taking ordinary elements and breathing new life into them, Wilson invites viewers to take a closer look at the world around them and appreciate the hidden beauty in seemingly mundane objects. In addition to his pavement art, Wilson is also known for his found wood sculptures, which involve the transformation of discarded wood scraps into intricate and captivating pieces. His dedication to re-envisioning and repurposing materials otherwise deemed \\"trash\\" showcases not only his creativity but his environmental consciousness and appreciation of the world around him. Throughout his life, Ben Wilson has remained unbound by traditional artistic methods and styles, redefining what it means to be an artist and continually challenging the status quo.

The scientist used the microscope to study the beetle instead of the butterfly. The","response":"beetle, with its iridescent wings and unusual markings, had piqued his interest as it wasn't a species he recognized from his years of research. He carefully placed the insect on the viewing platform and adjusted the magnification on the microscope. Step 1: Prepare the insect for observation He makes sure the beetle is safely and comfortably secured on the platform, ensuring that no harm comes to it during the process. He does this because he values the well-being of living creatures and wants to avoid causing any undue stress. Step 2: Adjust the microscope settings The scientist adjusts the magnification on the microscope to get a better view of the beetle's exoskeleton, wings, and other features. He does this to study the beetle's anatomy and look for any unique characteristics that might help in identifying the species. Step 3: Carefully study the features of the beetle He begins analyzing the structure of the beetle, paying close attention to the coloration and patterns on the wings and exoskeleton. He notes the specific details in a journal for future reference. He meticulously observes these features to learn more about the insect and possibly determine its evolutionary history or place within the ecosystem. Step 4: Consult reference materials The scientist consults with the existing literature and searches through his extensive collection of entomology books to compare the beetle to known species. He wants to ensure that this beetle is genuinely unfamiliar and not just a variation of an existing species. Step 5: Collaborate with colleagues As the beetle remains unidentified, the scientist decides to consult with fellow researchers in the field, sharing the details and images of the beetle. He values the knowledge of his peers and seeks their input, as they may be able to provide insights or recognize the species from their own work. Step 6: Pursue DNA analysis Realizing that traditional methods may not be sufficient to identify the beetle, the scientist considers using modern DNA analysis techniques. This would involve carefully extracting a sample of the beetle's DNA and comparing it to a database of known species. It would increasingly help in narrowing down the possibilities and potentially provide a conclusive identification. Step 7: Document the findings and publish the research Upon identifying the beetle or finding that it represents an entirely new species, the scientist compiles his findings and drafts a research paper outlining the details of the insect. He aims to share his discoveries with the scientific community and contribute to the broader understanding of the world's biodiversity. Throughout this process, the scientist remains driven by his passion for understanding the natural world and unlocking the mysteries hidden within the seemingly small and mundane. His curiosity leads him to dedicate his time and expertise to the study of this enigmatic beetle, ultimately enriching the collective knowledge of entomology."},{"question":"You are given a dialog between 2 or more individuals.
