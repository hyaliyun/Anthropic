Mr Fry said: \\"We are at the very early stages of the investigation and it could be a complex inquiry. \\"The body had been there for some time. The circumstances suggest this is a murder case and we are looking at missing persons reports and cold cases both locally and nationwide.\\" Residents expressed their shock at the discovery of human remains in woodland on the Queen’s country retreat in Norfolk. A major police inquiry was launched after a dog walker discovered the woman's remains on New Year’s Day just a mile from the Royal Stud and less than two miles from the estate’s main residence. Officers are carrying out a “detailed search” throughout the area of woodland in Anger, near King’s Lynn, which is east of Sandringham House, where members of the Royal Family had gathered. The operation was kept secret for more than 24 hours as detectives worked to establish how the body was so close to the Royal residence. A large area of the woodland had been cordoned off. The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, who are currently staying on the 20,000-acre (8,000-hectare) estate for their Christmas break, were informed of the discovery on Monday night. The body was discovered shortly after the Royals attended a church service on Sunday. A post mortem is due to take place later. It remains unclear how long the woman's body has been there. The dog walker has also not been named. Residents told The Daily Telegraph that the large police operation had been shrouded in secrecy. One resident, who did not want to be named, said: “There is a heavy police presence even 24 hours after the discovery. \\"You couldn't get very close to the site. Police said they expected to be there on tomorrow (Tuesday). \\"It is just a stone's throw from the Stud and the Royals' house. It is very close.\\" Another resident, who also did not want to be named, said locals were shocked at the discovery. \\"I spoke to several of my friends who work on the estate and they were at work on Monday and didn't hear anything about it,\\" he said. \\"No one knows anything about it. It has been quite a secret operation. \\"The area is only used by people who work nearby, dog walkers and local residents.\\" He added: \\"It is quite a bit of a shock, given the proximity to the grounds itself. The area is really not that far from Sandringham House. \\"We are all a bit stunned to be honest. It is just a really quiet area.\\" Mike Berman, the Chairman of Norfolk Ramblers, added: \\"I believe Anmer did once have a burial site which is no longer used so perhaps that may shed some light on the discovery.\\" A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman declined to comment, referring inquiries to police. The details emerged just days after the Duke, 90, left Papworth Hospital, Cambridgeshire, where he was treated for a blocked artery after suffering chest pains. The Duke’s heart scare forced him to miss the annual celebrations, including the annual Boxing Day shoot. He was airlifted to hospital from Sandringham on December 23 and kept under observation for four nights after undergoing the “minimally invasive procedure” of coronary stenting, which was declared a success. The Queen, who makes it her official base until February, was seen riding on the estate on Monday morning. The 85-year-old year-old wore only a headscarf and the hood of her long blue waxed jacket for protection as she rode a chestnut coloured horse. She emerged in the winter sunshine a few minutes later on horseback, accompanied by a smartly-dressed male groom on a white horse who was wearing a proper black riding hat in case he fell off. Sandringham has served as a private residence for Royal Family since 1862. King George V, the queen's grandfather, once called \\"dear old Sandringham ... (the) place I love better than anywhere in the world\\". Around half of the estate is let to farm tenants, with much of the remainder used for forestry. In October The Daily Telegraph disclosed that the remains of an American man had been lying near Buckingham Palace for years. Robert James Moore sent hundreds of letters to the Queen and was driven by his obsession to set up home within sight of Buckingham Palace, on an island in St James’s Park. But somehow his camp that he set up by went unnoticed until a tree surgeon uncovered the remains of his body in October, as many as three years after his death. ||||| British police are treating the discovery of a body on the queen's Sandringham estate as murder. A woman's body was found on the vast estate in eastern England on New Year's Day, and Detective Chief Inspector Jes Fry said authorities are examining missing person reports and unsolved cases around the country to see if there are any links. \\"We are at the very early stages of the investigation and it could be a complex inquiry,\\" Fry said Tuesday. \\"The body had been there for some time.\\" Authorities were doing a post-mortem Tuesday on the body. A member of the public found the body in a woodland at Anmer, a tiny village 115 miles (185 kilometers) northeast of London. The village is part of the Sandringham estate where the royal family spends some of its holidays. The hamlet of Anmer is home to several dozen people and sits around three miles (4.8 kilometers) from Sandringham House, which has served as a private residence for British monarchs since 1862. Queen Elizabeth II and her husband Prince Philip spent part of the holiday season there and were at Sandringham House on New Year's Day. Sandringham Estate's website says the entire estate is spread over 8,000 hectares (19,768 acres) in Norfolk. Sandringham House and its gardens make up 24 hectares (59 acres), and there are 240 hectares (590 acres) of woods and open countryside in a section that is open to the public free of charge all year. There are also two stud farms and a fruit farm. The estate employs over 100 full-time staff. Buckingham Palace referred all questions about the body's discovery back to police. ||||| What is a summary?","response":"A woman's body was found on the Queen's Sandringham estate in Norfolk, eastern England, on New Year's Day, launching a major police investigation that is being treated as a murder case.

Donald Trumps political vision https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDB3J... ||||| Mitt Romney to give speech on state of the GOP race Thursday posted at 10:01 pm on March 2, 2016 by John Sexton Mitt Romney has announced that he’ll be giving a speech Thursday to discuss the state of the GOP race with a focus on Donald Trump. Last week, Romney suggested there could be a possible “bombshell” in Trump’s taxes. On Monday he criticized Trump’s response over the weekend to a question about the KKK, calling it “disqualifying.” A disqualifying & disgusting response by @realDonaldTrump to the KKK. His coddling of repugnant bigotry is not in the character of America. — Mitt Romney (@MittRomney) February 29, 2016 With that as recent history, you won’t be surprised to learn Romney intends to lay out the case against nominating Trump when he speaks at the University of Utah tomorrow. Bloomberg Politics reports: With Trump’s convincing victories on Tuesday, the single biggest day of voting in the Republican race, Romney was motivated to make a more formal case against him in hopes of keeping him from coalescing more support, according to a Republican source familiar with Romney’s plans. Romney has voiced criticism for Trump in recent months, including his attack last week on the New York businessman’s refusal to release his tax returns. Romney doesn’t believe Trump is the right person to lead the party, the Republican source said. A number of mainstream Republicans are falling in line with Trump, and Romney wants to speak up before more people go that route, the source said. While making the case against Trump at the Hinckley Institute of Politics Student Forum at the University of Utah, Romney will not endorse one of his opponents, two people familiar with the former Massachusetts governor’s plans said. Romney will, however, praise Florida Senator Marco Rubio, Texas Senator Ted Cruz, and Ohio Governor John Kasich. Romney’s comments will be focused on “the state of the race,” likely echoing past criticism of Trump for failing to release his tax returns, and not decisively distancing himself from the Ku Klux Klan. Trump is not waiting to hear what Romney has to say. He lashed out at Romney on Twitter Wednesday afternoon: Failed Presidential Candidate Mitt Romney is having a news conference tomorrow to criticize me. (1/2) — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 2, 2016 Just another desperate move by the man who should have easily beaten Barrack Obama. (2/2) — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 2, 2016 Trump supporters on Twitter have started circulating video of Romney praising Trump: This video comes from February 2012 when Trump was endorsing Romney for President. While it’s true Romney is reversing himself on Trump, it’s also true that Trump has reversed himself on Romney. Back in 2012 Trump said, “It’s my honor, real honor, and privilege to endorse Mitt Romney…Mitt is tough, he’s smart, he’s sharp. He’s not going to allow bad to continue to happen to this country that we all love.” It’s hard to imagine this is going to have any impact on Trump. If the Pope’s suggestion that Trump is not a real Christian had no discernible impact, how much is the word of a former politician who lost the last election going to matter? Trump will call Romney a loser a few more times and move on. Romney might be more effective if he were to endorse an alternative candidate. As it is he’s not throwing his support behind someone, he’s throwing it against someone. But he’s been doing that for a week already. Has it mattered so far? Related Posts: ||||| The Republican party descended into full-scale civil war on Thursday, with its last presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, launching withering attacks against current front-runner Donald Trump, who responded with fury. “Let me put it plainly, if we Republicans choose Donald Trump as our nominee, the prospects for a safe and prosperous future are greatly diminished,” Romney said in an extraordinary broadside, delivered in Salt Lake City, Utah, designed to halt Trump's march to the nomination. Romney, the chairman of Lexington, Massachusetts-based Solamere Capital, described Trump as vulgar, sexually debased, and out of step with America. “Dishonesty is Donald Trump's hallmark,” he said. Hours later, at a campaign rally in Maine, Trump blasted Romney with his own flurry of insults, calling him a \\"failed candidate\\" who \\"let us down\\" after running a \\"horrible campaign,\\" and also recalled meeting with the former Massachusetts governor during the 2012 campaign when Romney sought and received his endorsement. “I could’ve said, 'Mitt, drop to your knees,' he would have dropped to his knees,\\" Trump said, adding that, \\"If somebody hits me, I'm going to hit them back harder.\\" The spectacle of the party's former standard-bearer and the man who hopes to fill that role trading insults was unlike anything in recent memory in American politics, and sent Republicans scrambling to choose sides in the skirmish. Senator John McCain, who battled Romney to win the party's 2008 nomination, wrote on Twitter after Romney's speech that he shared the same concerns. “Hope American ppl think hard about who they want as commander-in-chief,” McCain wrote. McCain's running mate, Sarah Palin, defended Trump and said he shouldn't “take the bait.” “It's not about you,” she wrote to Trump in a Facebook message. “It's about us. And we've got your back.” Stern warning Calling Trump a bully who was motivated by greed, Romney asked voters to imagine their children and grandchildren acting like the outspoken former TV reality show host. Romney tore into his party's front-runner, saying Trump's plan to let Russia lead the fight against the Islamic State was “the most ridiculous and dangerous idea of the entire campaign season,” and urged voters to back any other candidate they believed had the best chance of beating the New York businessman. “His imagination must not be married to real power,” Romney said. “If Donald Trump's plans were ever implemented, the country would sink into a prolonged recession.” While Trump did not respond to Romney's criticism of his foreign policy proposals, he zeroed in on the former Massachusetts governor's insistence that a Trump presidency would prove disastrous for international trade and throw the U.S. economy into recession. \\"When Mitt made the statement, 'he will ruin free trade'— ruin free trade? If I'm losing 505 billion with China, if I'm losing 58 billion a year with Mexico in terms of deficits, what do I want that kind of trade for anyway?\\" Trump asked rhetorically. \\"Who needs that kind of trade?\\" Trump also sought to cast doubt on Romney's fitness for the White House as some Republicans wonder if he may enter the race and challenge the front-runner. \\"He doesn't have what it takes to be president,\\" Trump said. Romney said he was not announcing his own candidacy and would not make an endorsement of any single candidate. Instead, he named all three of Trump's remaining rivals: Florida Senator Marco Rubio, Texas Senator Ted Cruz, and Ohio Governor John Kasich. “One of these men should be our nominee,” Romney said. Party in crisis The back-and-forth exchange was a spectacle of the Republican Party's identity crisis, playing out in full view of the public. Trump can rightly say that his unorthodox candidacy has brought new voters to the polls for the Republican primaries, voters attracted to his tough talk and promise to “make America great again.” And it's an open question whether Romney is the best messenger to take down Trump. For one, Romney, a founder of Bain Capital, is viewed—and views himself—as a protector of a Republican establishment that many of Trump's voters would say has lost touch with their day-to-day concerns. Romney's own run against President Barack Obama in 2012 never really came close to unseating the president, in part because Romney was easily painted as a wealthy elitist who benefited from Wall Street ways—the very thing voters in both parties are rebelling against this year. Also threatening to undermine his message: Romney publicly praised Trump in 2012 while seeking, and winning, the endorsement from the New York businessman. Romney did not mention the endorsement in his speech. Keep up with the best of Bloomberg Politics. Get our newsletter daily.

You will now receive the Game Plan newsletter But it was Romney's refusal to back one of the other rivals that partly explains why Trump has been so successful. With support from the party's traditional, pro-business wing splintered between several candidates for most of the past year, Trump quickly assumed front-runner status by winning support from a small plurality in the polls. The constant bickering within the establishment let Trump largely avoid any early, significant attacks, and his strength has only grown: He's won 46 percent of the delegates in the first 15 states that have held nominating contests. House Speaker Paul Ryan, who was Romney's running mate four years ago, said he wasn’t “going to get into who endorsed who in 2012. If you’re the nominee of the party you want everybody’s endorsement. That’s just how it works.” “Mitt’s one of our leaders, he’s a principled conservative,” Ryan said on Fox News. “He’s worried about the future of our party.” Romney's speech at the University of Utah comes as many in the party fear that Trump can essentially end the contest if he pulls out victories in Ohio and Florida, two large, battleground states that hold primaries on March 15. As the party's 2012 nominee, Romney is the most significant figure in a rapidly intensifying effort by the Republican establishment to take down Trump. His criticism marks the bluntest attempt so far by the Republican establishment to slow Trump’s momentum after his victories on Tuesday, the single biggest day of voting in the Republican race. Romney offered a litany of reasons why Trump would be bad for the country: Trump's tariffs would touch off a trade war and kill export jobs; his tax plan would balloon the deficit and national debt; his plans overall “would be very bad for American workers and for American families. “After all, this is an individual who mocked a disabled reporter, who attributed a reporter's questions to her menstrual cycle, who mocked a brilliant rival who happened to be a woman due to her appearance, who bragged about his marital affairs, and who laces his public speeches with vulgarity,” Romney said. “There is dark irony in his boasts of his sexual exploits during the Vietnam War while John McCain, whom he has mocked, was imprisoned and tortured.” Eager audience Romney's speech was delivered on a crisp, overcast morning, with snow-covered peaks as a backdrop. Hundreds of students and community leaders lined up two-and-a-half hours early to see the former Massachusetts governor, and packed a 680-chair music hall. Many in the line that snaked around buildings on the austere campus were registered Republicans who expressed disgust with Trump's raw rhetoric and his lack of foreign policy experience. “One of the most disgusting things to me is his refusal to denounce the KKK,” said Nick Clayson, 21, a political science student at Utah State University and registered Republican. “That's a huge issue for me. If it came down to Clinton or Trump I would want a third party candidate to enter the race.” “Trump tells it like it is, he's not politically correct—he says what people want to hear and doesn't hold anything back,” said John Greene, 47, who owns a real estate business in Salt Lake City. “With his lack of foreign policy experience he could run this country into the ground.” Others in the queue flew in from out of town the night before and were undecided about who they would support in their state's upcoming primary election. “I came to see if he can change the tide,” said Rachel Walston, a financial adviser from North Carolina and registered Republican who turns 37 today. “For the first time in my life I might vote for a Democrat if it comes down to Trump.” Several pointed to a groundswell of support in Salt Lake City, the home of the Mormon church, for Romney to enter the race. The Bain Capital founder is a favorite son in Utah—a prominent Mormon who gained fame after he turned a scandal-plagued 2002 Winter Olympics into a profitable venture. “I wish Romney would run,” said Don Gilbert, 77, a retired loan manager who has lived his entire life in Salt Lake City. “As far as honesty and dealing with people and he's had good experience in government. Trump is a little scary.” Many agreed, however, that if forced to choose between Trump and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, they would hold their nose and vote for the former reality TV star. “If it came down to it I would probably vote for Trump,” said Josh Brewer, 34, a business management major at Utah Valley University. “I have to make my vote count.” —With assistance from Toluse Olorunnipa and Jonathan Stearns. ||||| (CNN) Mitt Romney delivered a sweeping broadside against Donald Trump on Thursday, laying into the Republican presidential front-runner with a sharper attack than any of the party's 2016 contenders have made against the billionaire business mogul. \\"Here's what I know: Donald Trump is a phony, a fraud,\\" Romney said. \\"His promises are as worthless as a degree from Trump University. He's playing members of the American public for suckers: He gets a free ride to the White House, and all we get is a lousy hat.\\" Romney said that \\"dishonesty is Donald Trump's hallmark,\\" pointing to his \\"bullying, the greed, the showing off, the misogyny, the absurd third-grade theatrics.\\" There's irony in Romney's speech: Just four years ago, he courted Trump's endorsement -- even after Trump had led the \\"birther\\" controversy against President Barack Obama, insisting that Obama release his birth certificate to prove he is an American citizen. Trump returns fire \\"He was begging for my endorsement. I could have said, 'Mitt, drop to your knees' -- he would have dropped to his knees,\\" he said. He said of 2012: \\"That was a race, I have to say, folks, that should have been won ... I don't know what happened to him. He disappeared. He disappeared. And I wasn't happy about it, I'll be honest, because I am not a fan of Barack Obama, because I backed Mitt Romney -- I backed Mitt Romney. You can see how loyal he is.\\" He said Romney thought about running again in 2016, but \\"chickened out.\\" Romney tweeted after his own speech but before Trump's that had the New York businessman made similar statements about the KKK and others in 2012, he would not have accepted the endorsement. \\"If Trump had said 4 years ago the things he says today about the KKK, Muslims, Mexicans, disabled, I would NOT have accepted his endorsement.\\" If Trump had said 4 years ago the things he says today about the KKK, Muslims, Mexicans, disabled, I would NOT have accepted his endorsement — Mitt Romney (@MittRomney) March 3, 2016 Cruz, Kasich and Rubio But now Romney, the 2012 GOP nominee, is attempting to play the role of party elder during a speech at the University of Utah. He said any of the party's other candidates -- Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich -- would be suitable choices. He also amplified the stakes of the election, arguing that a Hillary Clinton presidency would be damaging, as well. The remarkable speech reflected the splintering of the Republican Party, as party leaders and statesmen increasingly rebuke their front-runner. Romney didn't endorse a candidate -- saying that, due to the party's delegate apportionment process, he'd vote for Rubio in Florida or Kasich in Ohio, if he lived in any of those states, when they vote on March 15. It was, in effect, an argument for a contested convention, which would come only if Trump couldn't win enough delegates to capture the nomination on the first ballot.

MUST WATCH Romney: Trump's promises are worthless 01:37 \\"If the other candidates can find common ground, I believe we can nominate a person who can win the general election and who will represent the values and policies of conservatism,\\" he said. Trump, meanwhile, is winning over working-class whites and evangelical voters who are angry with Washington's political class -- breaking turnout records in primaries along the way. Despite Romney's scathing speech, there are few signs it will dissuade Trump's loyal core of supporters who so far have greeted his most eyebrow-raising antics with swelling support. National security threat Nonetheless, Romney lambasted Trump on foreign policy, casting him as \\"very, very not-smart\\" in his comments about allowing ISIS to take out Syria's leadership and for proposing the slaughter of the families of terrorists. \\"Mr. Trump is directing our anger for less-than-noble purposes. He creates scapegoats in Muslims and Mexican immigrants. He calls for the use of torture. He calls for the killing of innocent children and family members of terrorists. He cheers assaults on protestors,\\" he said, adding that Trump would trample First Amendment protections. Romney also said Trump's remarks on CBS' \\"60 Minutes\\" on Syria and ISIS \\"has to go down as the most ridiculous and dangerous idea of the campaign season: Let ISIS take out Assad, he said, and then we can pick up the remnants.\\" \\"Think about that: Let the most dangerous terror organization the world has ever known take over a country? This is recklessness in the extreme,\\" Romney said. Trump prebuttal Even before Romney spoke, Trump kicked off an anti-Romney social media tirade late Wednesday night, posting a Facebook video accusing the former Massachusetts governor of being soft on cornerstone conservative issues, including immigration and abortion.

Trump on Wednesday, March 2, 2016 Then he knocked Romney on social media Thursday morning ahead of the speech The business mogul, who himself has changed positions on abortion, continued hitting Romney and the Republican establishment Thursday morning in a series of tweets. \\"I have brought millions of people into the Republican Party, while the Dems are going down.

I would also echo the many concerns about Mr. Trump's uninformed and indeed dangerous statements on national security issues that have been raised by 65 Republican defense and foreign policy leaders,\\" McCain said in a statement. McCain, citing a letter penned by conservative national security experts published Wednesday night, added, \\"I want Republican voters to pay close attention to what our party's most respected and knowledgeable leaders and national security experts are saying about Mr. Trump, and to think long and hard about who they want to be our next commander-in-chief and leader of the free world.\\" Unprecedented speech The extraordinary effort by Romney to take down the Republican front-runner comes amid a last-ditch rush among the party's donors and loyalists to stop Trump from capturing the nomination. After the remarks, Kasich tweeted, \\"Well said, @MittRomney.\\" His attack on Trump was an amalgamation of all of the attacks that other candidates and party members have made in recent weeks. One of his top aides in the 2012 race, Katie Packer, is heading a super PAC that is launching attack ads against Trump. Another super PAC and the hardline conservative Club for Growth are also airing ads critical of Trump. It could be too late: Trump has already won 10 of the first 15 states to vote, and he has a clear lead nationally over Rubio and Cruz. Romney cast the coming months' elections as a crucial moment in history, citing Ronald Reagan and saying that this nominating contest is \\"a time for choosing\\" -- laying waste along the way to Reagan's fabled \\"11th Commandment\\" that Republicans not speak ill of other Republicans. Meeting with Ryan Adding to the intrigue: Romney's 2012 vice presidential running mate House Speaker Paul Ryan had a private dinner with Romney in Salt Lake City Utah last weekend, CNN has learned. The dinner occurred while Ryan was on a trip out West to help campaign for House candidates, an aide said. But the aide maintained that the speaker only learned last night that Romney was planning to deliver a speech strongly criticizing Trump. At his weekly press conference that happened at the same time as Romney's blistering attack on Trump, Ryan was asked about any talks he's had with Romney and the 2012 GOP's nominee's message about Trump, but he said he hadn't \\"seen the content of the speech.\\" \\"Mitt Romney is one of our party leaders, and he cares deeply about the future of the Republican party and the country,\\" Ryan said, adding that \\"Mitt and I are very close friends.\\" JUST WATCHED Romney: Dishonesty is Trump's hallmark Replay More Videos ...

No he isn't, and no he doesn't. His bankruptcies have crushed small businesses and their workers. He inherited his business; he didn't create it,\\" Romney said. Romney also pointed to Trump's exchange about white supremacists with CNN's Jake Tapper last Sunday on \\"State of the Union\\" as a general election liability. \\"The video of the infamous Tapper-Trump exchange on the Ku Klux Klan will play 100,000 times on cable and who knows how many billion times on social media,\\" he said. ||||| A summary of this is?","response":"Mitt Romney, who was a presidential candidate in the past, said some mean things about Donald Trump.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose gene manipulation achieved happens, how will it affect greater lung capacity. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","response":"The perturbation hypothesis you've proposed suggests that gene manipulation could potentially lead to increased lung capacity. If this were achieved, it could indeed have both direct and indirect effects on the process of respiration. Direct effects: 1. Enhanced lung capacity: The increased volume of air that the lungs can hold would allow for a more efficient exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide. This means that with each inhalation, more air would enter the lungs, providing a greater amount of oxygen for the body to use. 2. Improved gas exchange: With greater lung capacity, the surface area of the alveolar sacs (where the oxygen is transferred to the capillaries) could also increase. This would improve the efficiency of gas exchange, allowing more oxygen to be absorbed by the blood and more carbon dioxide to be removed. Indirect effects: 1. Enhanced physical performance: With more oxygen available to the body, an individual could potentially experience improved physical performance, endurance, and reduced muscle fatigue due to more efficient oxygen and nutrient delivery to the organs and muscles. 2. Adaptation to high altitudes: Greater lung capacity could prove advantageous in situations where oxygen is scarce, such as at high altitudes or during intense physical activities. An increased lung capacity might alleviate some of the negative impacts of these situations by providing larger oxygen reserves and more efficient gas exchange. It is essential to note that while gene manipulation may hold promise for enhancing lung capacity in theory, many ethical, safety, and scientific concerns would need to be addressed before such an intervention could be considered viable. In addition, the interactions between genetics, environment, and individual variables would need to be carefully examined to evaluate the specific effects of gene manipulation on lung capacity and respiration."},{"question":"News article: Uber Technologies Inc.’s board has voted to appoint Expedia Inc.

Uber’s board on Sunday had been considering either Mr. Khosrowshahi or Meg Whitman, chief executive of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co., ultimately choosing the lesser-known executive who has been... ||||| By Miguel Helft and Biz Carson Uber's board of directors on Sunday selected Expedia's Dara Khosrowshahi as the company's new CEO, according a person familiar with the decision. Khosrowshahi, a surprise candidate, will replace former CEO and co-founder Travis Kalanick, who resigned more than two months ago amid a series of scandals and controversies that have rocked the ride-hailing company for much of this year. Uber declined to comment. Earlier, a spokesperson for Uber's board said the company wanted to inform employees of its decision before publicly announcing the name of the new CEO. Khosrowshahi, who is 48, has led Expedia since 2005, through a period of rapid expansion. An Iranian-American, Khosrowshahi is a graduate of Brown University who previously worked at IAC and Allen & Company. Earlier this year, he gained notoriety for his strong condemnation of Donald Trump. The board selected Khosrowshahi (see full profile here) after a weekend of twists and turns in the convoluted plot that the Uber CEO search had become. Earlier on Sunday, the leading candidate, former GE CEO Jeff Immelt, announced on Twitter that he “decided not to pursue a leadership position at Uber.” Immelt added: \\"I have immense respect for the company & founders - Travis, Garrett and Ryan.\\" (Those are the first names of Kalanick, Garrett Camp and Ryan Graves.) In his stead, Meg Whitman, the CEO of Hewlett Packard Enterprise and an early favorite of various board members, who said earlier this month that she did not want the job, was said to have re-emerged as a leading contender for the position. Published reports suggest Immelt didn't have the votes necessary to secure his position and that he had become increasingly worried about infighting on the board. Two factions, one led by Kalanick, and one led by early investor Benchmark, are battling in court over control of the company. Whitman, a favorite of Benchmark, met with the board over the weekend, according to reports. Ultimately, it was Khosrowshahi who got the nod. Khosrowshahi could bring much needed stability to a company that has been in turmoil for much of this year. He faces enormous challenges. While Uber's business continues to grow at a brisk pace, it continues to lose hundreds of millions of dollars each quarter. The company has also lost several top executives in recent months, including its chief financial and chief operating officers, and faces a critical legal challenge from Google spin-off Waymo, which accused Uber of stealing its intellectual property. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","response":"Imagine you had a classroom full of kids and you had to pick a new class leader because the old one had to leave.

When your dog does urinate or defecate, give your dog lots of verbal praise and attention so your dog associates going to the bathroom outside with being praised. In order to make your French bulldog a good household member, begin potty training your dog as soon as you get it. If you wait to begin training and let your dog toilet on puppy pads, it will take longer to potty train it and you dog will be confused about where to toilet.

Most dogs will show signs that they need to toilet, so watch your French bulldog to become familiar with your dog's specific signs. You should also be in the habit of frequently giving it the opportunity to toilet. Signs that your dog needs to toilet include: Panting Pacing or sniffing around the house Barking Wandering off to a quiet area If you didn't notice your dog's cue to toilet or your dog accidentally goes in the house, thoroughly clean up the mess. You'll need to use a product designed for pet messes or a special pet-urine enzymatic cleaner.

The question and answer pair are described below.","response":"Question: Who cut off his ear, Vincent van Gogh or Edvard Munch? Answer: Vincent van Gogh cut off his ear, not Edvard Munch. Rationale: Vincent van Gogh (1853-1890) was a Dutch post-impressionist painter who is considered one of the most influential and well-known artists in the history of Western art. On December 23rd, 1888, Vincent van Gogh cut off a part of his own left ear in a fit of mental instability. This incident took place in Arles, France, where he was living at the time. The act of self-mutilation was likely a result of a variety of factors, which might include extreme mental distress, personal turmoil, and issues with his fellow artist, Paul Gauguin. Gauguin and van Gogh lived together for a brief period, but their relationship was marked by constant tension and disagreement. van Gogh's mental health had also been deteriorating in the months leading up to the incident, and there are several hypotheses about the underlying reasons. On the other hand, Edvard Munch (1863-1944) was a Norwegian painter and printmaker who is best known for his highly emotive and psychological works, particularly his painting \\"The Scream.\\" Though Munch also experienced significant personal turmoil and struggled with mental health throughout his life, there is no connection between him and the act of cutting off an ear. In summary, it was Vincent van Gogh who cut off his own ear, while Edvard Munch, though a troubled artist in his own right, did not engage in such an act of self-mutilation."},{"question":"Given those answer options, answer the question: Based on this review, would the user recommend this product? === Review: Crime DOES pay if you buy this book.Support murder and drug dealing by buying this book.If you want to know what really happens in Southie go talk to the kids- they'll give you the real deal, not some Soprano Wannabe who is trying to go Hollywood.Give your money to the South Boston Boys and Girls Club instead!

After carefully analyzing the given review, it is apparent that the user would not recommend this product. The answer is option B: No, the user would not recommend the product. The reviewer displays a strong negative stance towards the book, stating that it supports crime such as murder and drug dealing. By suggesting that it promotes harmful and illegal activities, the reviewer is clearly trying to dissuade potential readers from purchasing the book. The user also criticizes the book's portrayal of South Boston (Southie), insinuating that the author tries to imitate the popular TV show 'The Sopranos' and has an agenda to go Hollywood. This further reinforces the disapproval of the product as it seems inauthentic and sensationalized, according to the reviewer. Moreover, the suggestion to \\"go talk to the kids\\" in South Boston for a genuine understanding of the area demonstrates that the user believes the book does not accurately represent the place and the events that occur there. The reviewer questions the credibility of the book and implies it is exploitative rather than informative. Lastly, when the user urges potential readers to donate their money to the South Boston Boys and Girls Club instead, it shows that they believe there are better ways to spend money and support the Southie community rather than buying this book. This reinforces that the user does not recommend this product and instead advocates for contributing to a local organization that benefits the community directly.

Once her father died, Cinderella's stepmother became very mean to her and made her do all of the chores around the house, like cleaning up after her two evil stepsisters. One day the King sent out a message to all of the single women to attend the Royal Ball in honor of his son, to find a wife. Of course, Cinderella didn't get to go, but her stepsisters did. Cinderella was very upset and thought that there was no way she could attend the Royal Ball, until her fairy godmother appeared. So she did some magic and made Cinderella into a beautiful woman, but she had to be back by midnight because that is when the magic changes back. While at the Royal Ball, Cinderella loses track of time and the clock strikes midnight, so she runs out of the palace and loses her glass slipper. Then the King orders the duke to find the women who wore that slipper. The duke searched every house, but finally found the women who it belonged to, Cinderella. Clyde Geronimi, Wilfred Jackson, and Hamilton Luske directed one of the best animated Disney films in 1950. This film is about a magical fairytale. In the beginning of the film Cinderella was a servant to her own family and had nobody to love her, but with a little bit of magic her whole life changed around and finally found love. My favorite thing about \\"Cinderella\\" is the music. When Cinderella's fairy godmother appeared doing her magic, she sang the song Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo. When I was a child, it was one of my favorite songs to sing around my house, so I will never forget it. I also loved the part when Cinderella and the Prince were singing the song So This is Love while they were dancing because they realized that they are in love.

A police is a person not to stole the goods. A: Sentence A","response":"It seems that the original question might be related to the role of the police officer in society. The statement provided, \\"A police is a person not to stole the goods,\\" suggests that the topic of discussion is the responsibility of a police officer to prevent theft and maintain law and order. To understand the answer, we can break it down into two parts: 1. A police officer is a person: This implies that a police officer is a human being with emotions and responsibilities, similar to other members of society. Their role is vital in ensuring the safety and security of the community they serve. 2. Not to steal goods: This indicates that the duties of police include preventing theft and maintaining law and order.

When it comes to exercise, many people seem to fall into two distinct camps: those who love a vigorous, sweat-soaked workout and those who view it as a form of torment. With hopes of getting more people up and moving, scientists are looking at the body's biological and chemical processes for clues to understanding what's behind differing attitudes toward exercise. That could mean there are factors beyond motivation and discipline to explain why some people enjoy exercising and others don't. One finding so far: How people interpret their body's sensations during and after exercise plays a large role in whether they enjoy it. Also, researchers at Iowa State University found that people's physical capacity could be much lower than many realize, so many people push beyond their limits without realizing it. For example, for sedentary people, just cooking dinner could count as exercise and they need to build up to even walking, the researchers found. Dan Cederholm has tried for years to find some type of exercise he could stick with. He finds the gym boring and basketball and baseball leagues unappealing. As for running? \\"My shins always hurt like hell,\\" says Mr. Cederholm, 38, a Web designer from Salem, Mass. His friend Rick Johnson, on the other hand, competes in 20 road races a year. He remembers that even as a kid, when he was told to run a lap during gym class, he would ask to do extras. \\"To me, it seems very foreign to say I don't enjoy sweating or running,\\" says Mr. Johnson, 41, an editor who also lives in Salem. From couch potatoes to Olympic athletes, everyone has a physical capacity for exertion, beyond which the body becomes stressed and begins to feel bad. How much stems from genetic factors—things like lung capacity, oxygen transport and the rate at which oxygen is used in the muscle cells—is still a subject of scholarly debate. Estimates vary from 10% to 50%, says Panteleimon Ekkekakis, a professor of kinesiology at Iowa State who has been studying the psychophysiology of exercise. But many sedentary people push beyond their intrinsic range when they try to exercise too quickly or intensely, which can make them hate the activity and want to stop, says Dr. Ekkekakis. The idea hinges on something called the \\"ventilatory threshold.\\" Normally when people breathe, they expel an amount of carbon dioxide that is equal to the amount of oxygen taken in. But beyond the ventilatory threshold, the release of carbon dioxide begins to exceed the body's intake of oxygen. This excess release of carbon dioxide is a sign that the muscles have become more acidic, which the body finds stressful. For most individuals, the ventilatory threshold is around 50% to 60% of the way to their maximum capacity, though there is tremendous individual variation. For elite athletes, the threshold may be as high as 80%, while sedentary people may hit it at 35%. By using tricks such as listening to music, people can continue to feel good even slightly past their ventilatory threshold, Dr. Ekkekakis and his colleagues have found. As people approach their maximum capacity, however, the feel-bad reaction is unavoidable. And while both ventilatory threshold and maximum capacity can be slowly increased, people have to have enough positive experiences to stick with exercise over time so they actually can boost these limits. In continuing studies of obese, sedentary but otherwise healthy middle-aged women, Dr. Ekkekakis found that some individuals reach their ventilatory threshold after just one minute at a slow pace on a treadmill. Some women's thresholds are so low that they would reach their maximum capacity simply by doing the dishes or cooking, says Dr. Ekkekakis. This means that though many weight-loss interventions suggest walking as the primary form of physical activity, it is probably too hard for many people. How people interpret some of the physical sensations of exertion or fatigue, such as buildup of lactic acid in muscle or increases in body temperature, can also influence whether they stick with an exercise routine. Some people tend to read such physical cues as a sign of a good workout or progress, whereas many sedentary people just find them uncomfortable or painful, say researchers. Elite athletes have even been dubbed \\"benign masochists\\" because they appear to enjoy the pain of exertion, says Dominic Micklewright, a researcher and curriculum director at the Centre for Sports & Exercise Science at the University of Essex in the U.K. The sensation of how hard one is working also can be influenced by some surprising external factors. In one study published in the journal Environmental Science and Technology last year, Dr. Micklewright and his team examined how the color of the imagery participants viewed while cycling would affect their mood and perceived feelings of exertion. After viewing scenes that involved green trees, participants reported feeling happier and their exercise less difficult than when the same scenes appeared in black-and-white or red, suggesting that exercising in nature or simulated green spaces could be helpful for exercisers, says Dr. Micklewright. It wasn't until age 48 that Sharon Weinbar (in black) of Hillsborough, Calif., found a workout she looked forward to: rowing. Researchers have found several other psychological factors and cognitive tricks that can help boost the motivation to move. Three that appear critical include how competent a person feels, whether he or she feels they have some control or choice in the matter and, for many, whether the activity fosters social relatedness, says Sarah Ullrich-French, a professor in kinesiology at Washington State University in Pullman, Wash. Adults can be discouraged from exercising by not knowing what to do or how to do it. Those who were athletic in childhood may be frustrated by how their abilities have deteriorated over time. Dr. Ullrich-French suggests that adults try new activities where they won't be comparing themselves. For Mr. Cederholm, the Web designer from Salem, going back to hockey, which he had enjoyed as a boy, wasn't an option. But the first time he played squash was an epiphany. \\"It was fun at the level that you don't even realize you're sweating your butt off,\\" says Mr. Cederholm, who now plays three to four hours a week with a friend or practices shots by himself on the court. Sharon Wienbar, a venture capitalist in Hillsborough, Calif., became a rower at the age of 48 because she enjoys the feeling of speeding along on the water, discussing her workout routines with her teammates and having a coach who helps her get better. \\"A couple months into rowing, it was like a light switch going on in my head,\\" she says. Once a \\"geeky, bookish\\" child who was always picked last for gym, Ms. Wienbar says rowing is now part of her identity and has prompted her to think of herself as an athlete. And at age 51, she says she enjoys the physical feeling of pushing herself. \\"I don't even feel like I've reached the maximum,\\" says Ms. Wienbar. \\"I'm in better shape now than I was 10 years ago. Maybe I'll be in even better shape in a decade.\\" Write to Shirley S.

His best-known works include Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso (1863), the Second Piano Concerto (1868), the First Cello Concerto (1872), Danse macabre (1874), the opera Samson and Delilah (1877), the Third Violin Concerto (1880), the Third (\\"Organ\\") Symphony (1886) and The Carnival of the Animals (1886). Saint-Saëns was a musical prodigy; he made his concert debut at the age of ten. After studying at the Paris Conservatoire he followed a conventional career as a church organist, first at Saint-Merri, Paris and, from 1858, La Madeleine, the official church of the French Empire. After leaving the post twenty years later, he was a successful freelance pianist and composer, in demand in Europe and the Americas. As a young man, Saint-Saëns was enthusiastic for the most modern music of the day, particularly that of Schumann, Liszt and Wagner, although his own compositions were generally within a conventional classical tradition. He was a scholar of musical history, and remained committed to the structures worked out by earlier French composers. This brought him into conflict in his later years with composers of the impressionist and dodecaphonic schools of music; although there were neoclassical elements in his music, foreshadowing works by Stravinsky and Les Six, he was often regarded as a reactionary in the decades around the time of his death. Saint-Saëns held only one teaching post, at the École de Musique Classique et Religieuse in Paris, and remained there for less than five years. It was nevertheless important in the development of French music: his students included Gabriel Fauré, among whose own later pupils was Maurice Ravel. Both of them were strongly influenced by Saint-Saëns, whom they revered as a genius., what would be the answer ?

A mall Santa had a heart attack at work and was rushed to the Emergency Room in full cardiac arrest. Let me explain that a person playing Santa is generally a certain age (white beard) and body type (round) that is predisposed to cardiac disease. We did everything we could but ultimately our efforts were futile. The mall Santa rode his sleigh into the great beyond. A mother, there to visit another patient, was insistent that her 7–8 year old son be allowed back to visit his grandmother. We had a strict 12 year old age limit visitation policy. I was called to speak with her. ”Why do you have such a stupid Draconian policy?” She insisted. “The Emergency Room is no place for a child ma’am. Besides, the germs and infections he may be exposed to, there are things he may see or hear that a child would have a hard time processing,” I explained. “Like what?” She argued. “Well, there are people in pain moaning,” I answered. “And drunks cursing at the staff.

Her child looked in and saw Santa’s lifeless body, ET tube sticking out of his throat, boots still on but costume cut to shreds and strewn across the room. The child lost it! “Mom, Santa Claus is Dead!” He cried. “I’m not going to get anything for Christmas.” “Why would someone open the curtain?” The mother demanded. “I warned you,” I said. “That’s why we have a 12 years and above visitation policy.” She was not happy. Come to find out the child had his picture made with that very Santa a few days prior. Very ironic. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

Now, I will evaluate the story with both middle statements. - Story with Middle 1: Sara wanted her kids to have a great Christmas. The toy store gave Sara all the toys in the store for free. She returned all of the presents for cheaper ones. (It doesn't make sense for Sara to return the toys she got for free and replace them with cheaper ones.) - Story with Middle 2: Sara wanted her kids to have a great Christmas. But then she ran into some financial trouble. She returned all of the presents for cheaper ones.

Article: Every profession or trade, every art, and every science has its technical vocabulary, the function of which is partly to refer to things or processes which have no names in ordinary English, and partly to secure greater exactness in expression. Such special dialects, or jargon, are necessary in technical discussion of any kind. Being universally understood by the devotees of the particular science or art, they have the precision of a mathematical formula . Besides, they save time, for it is much more economical to name a process than to describe it. Thousands of these technical terms are very properly included in every large dictionary, yet, as a whole, _ Different professions, however, differ widely in the character of their special vocabularies. In trades and handicrafts and other professions, such as farming and fishing, that have occupied great numbers of men from remote times, the technical vocabulary is very old. It consists largely of native words, or of borrowed words that have worked themselves into the very fiber of our language, hence, though highly technical in many particulars, these vocabularies are more familiar in sound, and more generally understood than most other technicalities. The special dialects of law, medicine, and philosophy have also become pretty familiar to cultivated person, and have contributed much to the popular vocabulary. Yet, every profession still possesses a large body of technical terms that remain essentially foreign, even to educated speech. And the proportion has been much increased in the last fifty years, particularly in the various departments of natural and political sciences and in the mechanic arts. So new terms are coined with the greatest freedom, and abandoned with indifference when they have served their turn. Most of the new coinages are restricted to special discussions and seldom get into general literature or conversation. Yet no profession is nowadays, as all profession once were, a closed guild . The lawyer, the physician, the man of science, and... Question: From the passage, we can learn that _ . Answer: pick from the following.

The figure, from the universities of Bath and Essex, was worked out by using data from government departments. Dr Jonathan James, of the University of Bath, said he hoped the economic calculation could \\"act as a catalyst for policy makers in the UK\\". The report said more needed to be done to address the social factors leading to binge drinking, which it defined as the consumption of 12 or more units of alcohol in any one period of drinking, typically on a Friday or Saturday night among individuals aged 18 to 30. The research found binge drinking increased the average daily number of injury-related admissions to A&E by 8% - equivalent to 2,504 additional daily admissions nationally. It also caused the average number of road accidents to go up by 17% - equivalent to 82 additional accidents a day nationally - while the average number of alcohol-related arrests increased by 45%, equivalent to 786 additional arrests per day nationally. The problems associated with binge drinking also lead to the number of police officers on duty having to be increased by around 30%, equivalent to an additional 3.2 police officers on duty at the weekend for every 10,000 people in the country, researchers said. Dr Jonathan James, of the University of Bath, said: \\"Much is known about the effects and costs of sustained heavy drinking in relation to increased risks of chronic diseases, the damage to social relationships and the increased burden placed on public services. \\"However, little is known about the economic and social effects of binge drinking. \\"We hope this calculation of the economic costs can act as a catalyst for policy makers in the UK to take targeted action that reduce the cost of binge drinking to society.\\" The figure does not take the long-term costs of binge drinking into account, such as reduced productivity, lost employment and health problems. The study said to offset these costs, policy recommendations such as including a 52 pence minimum unit price for alcohol and an increase in alcohol excise duty directly in line with alcohol strength should be considered. This could see a pint of beer increase by 23 pence, and a bottle of wine by 99 pence. Summary:","response":"Researchers found out that when people drink a lot of alcohol quickly, called binge drinking, it causes problems. These problems include more people going to the hospital, more car accidents, and more people getting arrested. Binge drinking is very expensive because it causes more police officers to work and other issues. The researchers suggested that making alcohol more expensive might help people drink less and save money."},{"question":"If \\"A snowboarder is taking a picture in front of some trees.\\" does that mean that \\"Someone is taking a picture in front of trees.\\"?

Week after week the convoys had straggled unmolested through the difficult country between Sarras and the advanced base. No attack had been made upon the brigade at Akasha. No enterprise was directed against its communications. This fatal inactivity did not pass unnoticed by Wad Bishara, the Governor of Dongola; but although he was nominally in supreme command of all the Dervish forces in the province he had hardly any means of enforcing his authority. His rebukes and exhortations, however, gradually roused Hammuda, and during May two or three minor raids were planned and executed, and the Egyptian position at Akasha was several times reconnoitred. Bishara remained unsatisfied, and at length, despairing of infusing energy into Hammuda, he ordered his subordinate Osman Azrak to supersede him. Osman was a Dervish of very different type. He was a fanatical and devoted believer in the Mahdi and a loyal follower of the Khalifa. For many years he had served on the northern frontier of the Dervish Empire, and his name was well known to the Egyptian Government as the contriver of the most daring and the most brutal raids. His cruelty to the wretched inhabitants of the border villages had excluded him from all hope of mercy should he ever fall into the hands of the enemy. His crafty skill, however, protected him, and among the Emirs gathered at Firket there was none whose death would have given greater satisfaction to the military authorities than the man who was now to replace Hammuda.

Below is a step-by-step guide to creating a tape roll end holder: 1. Designing the holder First, decide on the type of tape roll end holder you would like to create. There are many designs to choose from, such as wall-mounted, desk-mounted, or handheld. Sketch your design on paper or use a digital design tool like SketchUp. Include key design elements in your sketch, such as dimensions, the method of attaching or mounting the holder, space for the tape roll, and an additional area to hold the end of the tape for easy access. Consider the size of the tape roll you'll be using, and ensure that the holder's design can comfortably accommodate that size. 2. Choosing materials Select appropriate materials for your tape roll end holder based on your design and the desired sturdiness. Possible materials include plastic, metal, or wood, depending on factors like availability, cost, and personal preference. Ensure the chosen material is strong enough to support the weight of the tape roll and does not damage or compromise the tape's adhesive properties. 3. Gathering tools and supplies To create your tape roll end holder, gather the necessary tools and supplies. These may include: - A saw, jigsaw, or CNC machine for cutting the material - A drill or screwdriver for making holes and attaching parts - Sandpaper to smooth edges and surfaces - A measuring tape or ruler for taking accurate measurements - A pencil or marker for marking cutlines and holes - Adhesive, screws, or nails for securing parts together - Paint, stain, or a finish coating to protect and enhance the appearance of the holder 4. Cutting the material Based on your design, measure and mark the points where you need to cut your material. Use the appropriate cutting tool, such as a saw, jigsaw, or CNC machine, to carefully cut the material along the marked lines. Ensure that the edges are straight, and remove any burrs or rough spots by sanding the cut surfaces with sandpaper. Double-check your measurements before cutting, as inaccurate cuts may result in a poorly fitting or non-functional holder. 5. Assembling the holder Now, it's time to assemble the various parts of your tape roll end holder. Line up the pieces according to your design, using appropriate fasteners such as screws, nails, or adhesive to secure the parts together. For wall-mounted or desk-mounted holders, attach a mounting bracket or plate to the holder's back. Be mindful of weight distribution and balance to prevent the holder from being top-heavy or tipping over. 6. Finishing touches After assembling the holder, apply paint, stain, or a protective coating to give it a polished look and protect the material from wear. Allow the finish to dry completely before adding the tape roll to your holder. 7. Mounting or placing the holder Once your tape roll end holder is complete, mount or place it in a convenient location for easy access. Depending on the holder's design, you may need to screw it into a wall or affix it to a desk or table with adhesive or brackets. By following these steps, you will have successfully crafted a functional and attractive tape roll end holder, making it easier to access and use your tape rolls while keeping your workspace organized."},{"question":"This is some data: (66063) 1998 RO1, meanTemperature, 265.0 (kelvins); (66063) 1998 RO1, apoapsis, 254989570.60815 (kilometres).

It's not related to the formation of a diploid zygote. - (B) Plant reproduction: Although plant reproduction involves the formation of a zygote, it is too broad an option to be specific to a diploid zygote. - (C) diploid sperm and egg: Diploid cells contain two sets of chromosomes, but sperm and egg cells are haploid with only one set of chromosomes. Therefore, this option is incorrect. - (D) mate with females: Mating with females might be a part of sexual reproduction, but it doesn't specifically describe the formation of a diploid zygote. - (E) Leptospirosis: Leptospirosis is a bacterial infection that affects humans and animals. It has no connection to the formation of a diploid zygote. - (F) haploid sperm and egg: This is a possibility since haploid sperm and egg cells each contain one set of chromosomes. When these cells fuse during fertilization, they can create a diploid cell with two sets of chromosomes – the zygote. - (G) triploid sperm and egg: Triploid cells have three sets of chromosomes, but the fusion of triploid cells would result in a hexaploid zygote, not a diploid zygote. - (H) two haploid eggs: The fusion of two haploid eggs would lead to an incorrect number of chromosomes in the resulting cell and is biologically unlikely.

Let's answer step by step:","response":"Step 1: Calculate the time it takes for Ellen to rise the dough for 4 balls Each ball of dough takes 3 hours to rise. Therefore, the total time for rising 4 balls of dough one after another is: 3 hours x 4 balls = 12 hours Step 2: Calculate the time it takes for Ellen to bake the 4 balls of dough Each ball of dough takes 2 hours to bake. Therefore, the total time for baking the 4 balls one after another is: 2 hours x 4 balls = 8 hours Step 3: Add the dough rising time and baking time to find the total time To find the total hours Ellen spends rising and baking the dough, add the time it takes to rise the dough (12 hours) and the time it takes to bake the dough (8 hours): 12 hours + 8 hours = 20 hours The total time Ellen spends making 4 balls of dough and baking them one after another is 20 hours."},{"question":"Given the question: Information: - A domain name is an identification string that defines a realm of administrative autonomy, authority or control within the Internet. Domain names are formed by the rules and procedures of the Domain Name System (DNS). Any name registered in the DNS is a domain name. Domain names are used in various networking contexts and application-specific naming and addressing purposes. In general, a domain name represents an Internet Protocol (IP) resource, such as a personal computer used to access the Internet, a server computer hosting a web site, or the web site itself or any other service communicated via the Internet. In 2015, 294 million domain names had been registered. - The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) is a department of ICANN, a nonprofit private American corporation that oversees global IP address allocation, autonomous system number allocation, root zone management in the Domain Name System (DNS), media types, and other Internet Protocol-related symbols and Internet numbers. - The DNS root zone is the top-level DNS zone in the hierarchical namespace of the Domain Name System (DNS) of the Internet. - The European Commission (EC) is an institution of the European Union, responsible for proposing legislation, implementing decisions, upholding the EU treaties and managing the day-to-day business of the EU. Commissioners swear an oath at the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg, pledging to respect the treaties and to be completely independent in carrying out their duties during their mandate. - Cybersquatting (also known as domain squatting), according to the United States federal law known as the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act, is registering, trafficking in, or using an Internet domain name with bad faith intent to profit from the goodwill of a trademark belonging to someone else. The cybersquatter then offers to sell the domain to the person or company who owns a trademark contained within the name at an inflated price. - The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical decentralized naming system for computers, services, or any resource connected to the Internet or a private network. It associates various information with domain names assigned to each of the participating entities. Most prominently, it translates more readily memorized domain names to the numerical IP addresses needed for the purpose of locating and identifying computer services and devices with the underlying network protocols. By providing a worldwide, distributed directory service, the Domain Name System is an essential component of the functionality of the Internet, and has been in use since the 1980s. - EURid vzw / asbl ( European Registry for Internet Domains ) is a non-profit organisation appointed by the European Commission on 8 April 2003 as the domain name registry to operate the new . eu top - level domain .

In October 2006 , they opened their first branch office in Stockholm . Two further branch offices have been opened in Italy and the Czech Republic . There are four associate members : the Academic and Research Network of Slovenia ( ARNES ) , the registry for . si , the national top - level domain for Slovenia , CZ.NIC , the registry for . cz , the national top - level domain for the Czech Republic , ISOC - ECC , the European chapter of the Internet Society , and BUSINESSEUROPE , a confederation of 39 industry - related federations from 33 countries . EURid uses the Extensible Provisioning Protocol ( EPP ) which enables registrars to perform operations on . eu domain names directly .

It is a \\"network of networks\\" that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries an extensive range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and peer-to-peer networks for file sharing. - The Internet Protocol (IP) is the principal communications protocol in the Internet protocol suite for relaying datagrams across network boundaries. Its routing function enables internetworking, and essentially establishes the Internet. - A fully qualified domain name (FQDN), sometimes also referred to as an \\"absolute domain name\\", is a domain name that specifies its exact location in the tree hierarchy of the Domain Name System (DNS). It specifies all domain levels, including the top-level domain and the root zone. A fully qualified domain name is distinguished by its lack of ambiguity: it can be interpreted only in one way. - The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) is a nonprofit organization that is responsible for coordinating the maintenance and procedures of several databases related to the namespaces of the Internet, ensuring the network's stable and secure operation. ICANN performs the actual technical maintenance work of the central Internet address pools and DNS root zone registries pursuant to the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) function contract. The contract regarding the IANA stewardship functions between ICANN and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) of the United States Department of Commerce ended on October 1, 2016, formally transitioning the functions to the global multi-stakeholder community. - A country code top-level domain (ccTLD) is an Internet top-level domain generally used or reserved for a country, sovereign state, or dependent territory identified with a country code. - .eu is the country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for the European Union (EU). Launched on 7 December 2005, the domain is available for organisations in and residents of EU member states. The TLD is administered by EURid, a consortium originally consisting of the national ccTLD registry operators of Belgium, Sweden, and Italy, joined later by the national registry operator of the Czech Republic. Trademark owners were able to submit registrations through a sunrise period, in an effort to prevent cybersquatting. Full registration started on 7 April 2006. - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency. - A top-level domain (TLD) is one of the domains at the highest level in the hierarchical Domain Name System of the Internet. The top-level domain names are installed in the root zone of the name space. For all domains in lower levels, it is the last part of the domain name, that is, the last label of a fully qualified domain name. For example, in the domain name www.example.com, the top-level domain is com. Responsibility for management of most top-level domains is delegated to specific organizations by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), which operates the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), and is in charge of maintaining the DNS root zone. - A domain name registry is a database of all domain names and the associated registrant information in the top level domains of the Domain Name System (DNS) of the Internet that allow third party entities to request administrative control of a domain name. Most registries operate on the top-level and second-level of the DNS. - The European Court of Justice (ECJ), officially just the Court of Justice, is the highest court in the European Union in matters of European Union law.

Before, they used to have big teams called \\"divisions\\" where these teams had a mix of different players with different skills. Now, the army is changing to smaller teams called \\"brigades.\\" This means that it will be easier to organize and control the teams. The teams will not have to stay with only the players that have been in their team for a long time, but they can work with players from any other team.

Premise: Further information The given premise indicates that there might be additional information that is to be provided or accessed. It suggests that the current information may not be sufficient or complete and that there could be more information relevant to a certain topic or situation. The premise does not state whether this further information is readily available or not, so one cannot be certain about its accessibility. Hypothesis: We don't have more information at this time The stated hypothesis asserts that additional or more information is currently unavailable or simply not present. This could mean the accessible information pool is limited and that, at this moment, there is no other information to provide or gather about the situation or topic. Now, let's analyze if the premise entails the hypothesis. Entailment occurs when the truth of one statement (premise) guarantees the truth of another statement (hypothesis), i.e., if the premise is true, then the hypothesis must also be true. In this case, the premise refers to the existence of further information, while the hypothesis relates to the unavailability or absence of more information at the moment. Therefore, the truth of the premise does not guarantee the truth of the hypothesis. In fact, they appear as contrasting views on the availability of further information. The premise has an implication that there might be more information, and the hypothesis states that no such information is present or accessible. However, it's important to note that these statements could be contextually compatible depending on the circumstances under discussion. For example, it's possible that there exists additional information, but it is not possible to obtain or access it at this time. In this scenario, the premise and hypothesis could co-exist.

While fighting world hunger continues to be the matter of vital importance according to a recent report from the World Health Organization (WHO), more people now die from being overweight, or say, from being extremely fat, than from being underweight. It's the good life that's more likely to kill us these days. Worse, nearly l8 million children under the age of five around the world are estimated to be overweight. What's going on? We really don't have many excuses for our weight problems. The dangers of the problem have been drilled into us by public-health campaigns since 2001 and the message is getting through--up to a point. In the 1970s, Finland, for example, had the highest rate of heart disease in the world and being overweight was its main cause. Not any more. A public-health campaign has greatly reduced the number of heart disease deaths by 80 per cent over the past three decades. Maybe that explains why the percentage of people in Finland taking diet pills doubled between 2001 and 2005, and doctors even offer surgery of removing fat inside and change the shape of the body. That has become a sort of fashion. No wonder it ranks as the world's most body-conscious country. We know what we should be doing to lose weight--but actually doing it is another matter. By far the most popular excuse is not taking enough exercise. More than half of us admit we lack willpower. Others blame good food. They say: it's just too inviting and it makes them overeat. Still others lay the blame on the Americans, complaining that pounds have piled on thanks to eating too much American-style fast food. Some also blame their parents--their genes. But unfortunately, the parents are wronged because they're normal in shape, or rather slim. It's a similar story around the world, although people are relatively unlikely to have tried to lose weight. Parents are eager to see their kids shape up. Do as I say--not as I do. The answer is:","response":"According to the article, what factors contribute to the increase in overweight people and related health issues? A. Lack of public-health campaigns B. Insufficient exercise and willpower C. American-style fast food D. Genetic factors from parents E. B, C, and D Answer: E.

My older sister Ann had settled deep in the recliner, and she glared at me too, blaming me for winding him up. The jam box sat on the rolling tray table and my father was working the remote as he talked, backing up my newly burned CD and letting it spin forward to play a few seconds of low fidelity trombone solo. \\"You know the tune, of course,\\" he said. \\"'King Porter Stomp.'\\" Those childhood years of listening to him play Glenn Miller on the console phonograph were finally paying off. \\"He muffed the notes the same way on the Victor version.\\" \\"So why can't it be Miller?\\" I asked. \\"He wouldn't have played with a rabble like that.\\" The backup musicians teetered on the edge of chaos, playing with an abandon somewhere between Dixieland and bebop. \\"They sound drunk.\\" My father had a major emotional investment in Miller. He and my mother had danced to the Miller band at Glen Island Casino on Long Island Sound in the summer of 1942, when they were both sixteen. That signature sound of clarinet and four saxes was forever tied up for him with first love and the early, idealistic months of the war. But there was a better reason why it couldn't have been Miller playing that solo. If the date on the original recording was correct, he was supposed to have died three days earlier. The date was in India ink on a piece of surgical tape, stuck to the top of a spool of recording wire. The handwritten numerals had the hooks and day-first order of Europe: 18/12/44.

From the text, we can deduce that the narrator brought the record to his father after winning the eBay auction. This is evident when the passage states, \\"I'd won it on eBay the week before as part of a lot that included a wire recorder and a stack of 78s by French pop stars like Charles Trenent and Edith Piaf.\\" The passage does not provide enough information on when the narrator brought the record to his father in relation to dancing with his mother or going to Glen Island Casino. These events are mentioned to give context to the father's connection to Glenn Miller's music and are not directly related to when the narrator brought the record to him."},{"question":"A plume of black smoke rose over Cairo early Friday after a powerful explosion hit the city's police headquarters, killing at least four people and wounding more than 50 others, Egyptian authorities said. The blast struck a key symbol of authority in a country that has been shaken by political turmoil and violent unrest in recent years. It was followed by two smaller explosions near police stations in the Cairo area, one of which killed one person. And later, a fourth explosion outside a movie theater in Giza city, near Cairo, killed one person and injured seven others, state television said. The blasts took place at a time of high tension -- the day before the third anniversary of the 2011 revolution that eventually brought down authoritarian leader Hosni Mubarak. And they come amid the instability ushered in by the military's overthrow last year of the democratically elected former President, Mohamed Morsy, and the ensuing crackdown by security forces on the Islamist movement that supported him, the Muslim Brotherhood. Suicide bomber suspected. The first blast appeared to have been caused by a suicide attacker who tried to drive a vehicle laden with explosives into the police headquarters, said Maj. Gen. Hany Abdel Latif, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry, citing preliminary reports. Guards stationed in front of the headquarters in the Abdeen district of Cairo opened fire at the vehicle, and the explosion went off in the building's vicinity rather than inside, he told state news agency Egynews. The blast destroyed the front of the first and second floors of the eight-story building, he said, and damaged the third floor. Most of the building's windows appeared to have been blown out. Air-conditioning units dangled by cables from the shattered facade. At least 51 people were wounded in the explosion, state-run broadcaster Masriya TV reported, citing the Health Ministry. Visiting the ruined building, Egyptian Interior Minister Mohamed Ibrahim condemned the bombing. \\"These are nothing but desperate attacks in an attempt to create chaos, but the citizens here will remain resilient,\\" he told Masriya TV. Ibrahim said security forces will ensure that Egyptians will be able to celebrate the anniversary of the revolution Saturday \\"as if nothing happened today.\\" A powerful blast. CNN's Reza Sayah said the blast appeared to be \\"the most powerful bomb attack that we've seen here in central Cairo in recent memory.\\" Speaking from near the scene of the blast, he said the attack will probably intensify the fight between Egypt's military-backed government and the groups that oppose it. It wasn't immediately clear who was behind that bombing. Friday is a holiday in Egypt, so the police headquarters is unlikely to have been as busy as it would have been on a weekday. The blast happened around 6:30 a.m., according to state media. Hundreds of people -- some stunned, some angry -- gathered around the scene, Sayah said. Many of those in the crowd were quick to blame the Muslim Brotherhood, despite no official word on who might be to blame. The Muslim Brotherhood denied responsibility for the bombing and issued a statement condemning it. \\"The Muslim Brotherhood condemns any acts of violence or killing, regardless of who are the perpetrators, and the (Muslim Brotherhood) emphasizes that the revolution that has continued for seven months is a peaceful revolution and it will insist to remain peaceful.\\" Separately, the Muslim Brotherhood called for protests and sit-ins across multiple sites in and out of Cairo in a show of defiance. The group said security forces fired live ammunition on demonstrators in Beni Suef on Friday; surrounded and mistreated worshippers at a mosque in Suez on Friday; and thugs attacked a funeral in Alexandria on Thursday, among other grievances. Police arrested 111 protesters across the country, the Interior Ministry said. Egypt's armed forces condemned the bombings, as did the U.S. government. \\"It should be clear to all ... Egyptians that violence has not and will not move Egypt's political transition forward,\\" White House spokesman Jay Carney said. \\"Ongoing unrest and cycles of violence surrounding protests hurt Egypt's prospects for political and economic stability.\\" A U.S. State Department official said that Washington is \\"aware of reports\\" that one of its citizens \\"has been detained in Egypt.\\" But the official said the U.S. government wouldn't comment any more than that. Fears of more turmoil. Friday's second explosion was much smaller and went off near a police station in Dokki, a residential area of Cairo, wounding several people, authorities said. And in the Al-Haram district of Giza city, a small bomb was thrown at a moving police vehicle near a police station, killing one person, deputy Giza security chief Mahmoud Farouk told state TV. This new wave of violence follows a referendum earlier this month in which Egyptian voters overwhelmingly approved a new constitution proposed by the military-backed government, according to the country's electoral commission. But supporters of the now-banned Muslim Brotherhood had boycotted the vote in response to a continuing government crackdown. Rights groups have expressed concern about what they call an increasingly repressive environment in Egypt, where more than 2,200 people have been killed since Morsy's ouster. Some anti-government groups have resorted to violence. Bomb attacks and shootings against the security apparatus have taken place across the country in recent months -- a situation described by some as a low-level insurgency. The government has blamed the Muslim Brotherhood for many of the attacks, even though the movement has condemned them. The bombing of the Cairo police headquarters suggested the violence is taking on a more serious, high-profile form. \\"The fear is there's a very difficult and tumultuous phase ahead for this country,\\" Sayah said.

The statement says that Hooper is accused of posing as a potential home buyer, which means he pretended to be interested in purchasing a home. This act of posing as a potential buyer does not imply that he actually went through with the purchase or completed any transaction to own a house in Portland.

In order to determine whether Hooper bought a house in Portland, further information would be needed, such as documentation related to the transaction, mortgage details, transfer of ownership, or any other relevant records that can confirm the purchase.

She could read and write fairly well, and had been used to helping her husband the under-steward with his accounts at Muro, but even if she had looked at the recipe she would have understood nothing of the doctor's hieroglyphics and abbreviated Latin words. The prescription was for a preparation of arsenic, which Matilde had formerly taken for some time. The chemist would not make any difficulty about preparing twenty doses of it for the Countess Macomer, though the whole quantity of arsenic contained in so many would probably be sufficient to kill one not accustomed to the medicine, if taken all at once. But though Matilde was so anxious to have the stuff before luncheon, she had a number of doses of it put away in a drawer, which she took out and counted, after Elettra had gone. She opened one of the little folded papers and looked at the fine white powder it contained, took a little on the end of her finger and tasted it. Then, from the same drawer, she took a package done up in coarser paper, and opened it likewise, looked at it, smelt it, and touched it with the tip of her tongue very cautiously indeed. It was white, too, but coarser than the medicine. She was very careful in tasting it, and she immediately rinsed her mouth with water, before she tied up the package again, shut the drawer, and put the key into her pocket.

Scatarie Island is an island in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia , located off the coast of Baleine , Cape Breton Island . Cape Breton Island is an island located in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia , off the coast of Baleine , Scatarie Island .","response":"While both sentences are referring to geographical locations in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia, they are not describing the same thing. The first sentence is about Scatarie Island, while the second sentence is about Cape Breton Island. Here is a detailed comparison of the two sentences: 1. Scatarie Island is an island in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia, located off the coast of Baleine, Cape Breton Island. This sentence informs us that Scatarie Island is an island within the Canadian province of Nova Scotia. This island is situated in the Atlantic Ocean, and its geographical location is specifically off the coast of Baleine, a region on the southeastern extremity of Cape Breton Island. Cape Breton Island itself is also a part of the Canadian province of Nova Scotia, and it is one of the largest islands in Canada. 2. Cape Breton Island is an island located in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia, off the coast of Baleine, Scatarie Island. In contrast, this sentence is describing Cape Breton Island, which is an island within the Canadian province of Nova Scotia. It is worth noting that the sentence construction is not entirely accurate and appears to be attempting to relate the locations of Cape Breton Island and Scatarie Island. Cape Breton Island, mentioned in both sentences, is the northern part of the Canadian province of Nova Scotia and measures approximately 10,311 square kilometers. It is connected to the mainland of Nova Scotia by the Canso Causeway, a long narrow strip of land that carries the Trans-Canada Highway. Cape Breton Island is well-known for its natural beauty, featuring the famous Cape Breton Highlands National Park, which includes breathtaking coastal landscapes. Scatarie Island, on the other hand, is a much smaller island with an area of approximately 42 square kilometers. It is situated off the northeastern coast of Cape Breton Island and specifically off the coast of the region of Baleine. In summary, these sentences are referring to different islands in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia. Scatarie Island is a smaller island off the coast of Cape Breton Island, while Cape Breton Island is a much larger island in Nova Scotia, of which Baleine is a part."},{"question":"Here is a list of all of KF Tirana's Cup seasons from 1939 till end of most recent season.

Her greyhound is slim, her rottweiler is heavy. The dog that gets faster more quickly is the (A) rottweiler (B) greyhound. What is the most sensical answer between \\"greyhound\\" and \\"rottweiler\\"? Answer:","response":"The most sensical answer between \\"greyhound\\" and \\"rottweiler\\" is \\"greyhound\\" (B). Greyhounds are known for their incredible speed and acceleration. They are bred and trained specifically for racing and are able to reach top speeds in only a few seconds. Their lean, muscular build, along with their long and slender legs, enables them to generate rapid acceleration and maintain high speeds during a race. In fact, greyhounds are considered the fastest breed of dog, capable of reaching speeds of up to 45 miles per hour (72 km/h). Rottweilers, on the other hand, are not known for being particularly fast runners. They are a large, powerful breed with a muscular build designed for strength and endurance rather than speed. While they can still run at a decent pace, it is unlikely that a rottweiler would be able to compete with a greyhound in terms of acceleration or overall speed. Rottweilers are more suited to tasks that require power, such as herding or protection work, rather than racing. In the context of the short story presented, Tina's greyhound would be the dog that gets faster more quickly due to the inherent qualities of the breed that have been developed and honed for speed and agility. Greyhounds have a natural advantage in this situation, as their physical attributes and instincts make them exceptional racers. It is important to note, however, that individual dogs within each breed can still vary considerably. Factors such as age, health, fitness, and previous training can all impact an individual dog's abilities. Nonetheless, given the information provided in the short story, it is reasonable to assume that the greyhound would be the faster of the two dogs in terms of both acceleration and overall speed."},{"question":"Complete the following sentence. Mona had a panic attack while public speaking and found out she was agoraphobic. The","response":"discovery of her agoraphobia, a type of anxiety disorder characterized by overwhelming fear and avoidance of places or situations where escape might be difficult or help might not be available, came as a shock to her and her loved ones. This newfound revelation about her mental health led her to contemplate and reevaluate various aspects of her life, including her career choices, relationships, and daily routines. As a result, Mona began to understand the importance of seeking help and addressing her mental health concerns. She reached out to a therapist who specialized in anxiety disorders and started attending regular therapy sessions. Her therapist helped her unpack the layers of her anxiety and identify the potential causes, triggers, and coping mechanisms that would best suit her condition. Over time, Mona and her therapist delved into her past experiences and discovered that her fears stemmed from a traumatic childhood event. It was through this exploration that she realized her anxiety had been silently impacting her choices and relationships for years, without her even being truly aware of it. Recognizing this connection allowed Mona to take concrete steps towards overcoming her agoraphobia. Mona began to slowly expose herself to situations that triggered her anxiety, with the support and guidance of her therapist. She started with small exercises, like visiting crowded places with a trusted friend or practicing breathing and grounding techniques to keep her anxiety in check. Eventually, Mona worked her way up to confronting her fear of public speaking by enrolling in a public speaking class designed for individuals with anxiety issues. During her journey to manage her agoraphobia, Mona realized the significance of support from her family and friends. She took the initiative to open up to her loved ones about her condition and encouraged them to be a part of her healing process. This not only helped them understand her struggles but also strengthened their bonds and enabled her support system to grow. Moreover, Mona sought solace and inspiration from others who had gone through similar experiences. By attending support groups and connecting with individuals who had faced and conquered their agoraphobia, she found motivation and practical insights that could guide her through the process of overcoming her fears. As Mona continued to work on her agoraphobia, she discovered a new sense of resilience and empowerment within herself. Not only did this experience foster a deeper understanding of her own mental health, but it also ignited a passion for helping others who may be struggling with similar issues. With time, she began volunteering for mental health organizations and sharing her story with others to raise awareness about agoraphobia and the importance of seeking help. In conclusion, Mona's panic attack while public speaking revealed her agoraphobia and started a profound and transformative journey of self-discovery, healing, and personal growth. By addressing her anxiety, seeking professional help, and building a supportive network, she not only learned to manage her agoraphobia but also found a new purpose in advocating for mental health awareness and support."},{"question":"Data: name = Cotto, food = Italian, customer rating = average, near = The Portland Arms.

By that reckoning, six weeks is almost an eternity. For fans of one of English football's oldest clubs, it certainly feels that way. On Boxing Day 2012, former European champions Nottingham Forest lined up to play Leeds United in a second flight match in the English Championship. After going a goal behind, Forest roared back to an emphatic 4-2 victory that had a certain swagger about it. Watching at the time, it was hard to escape the feeling that things were finally coming together for a side that has come to embody the term 'sleeping giant'. One point and one place outside the playoffs, that afternoon Forest fans would have tucked into their turkey sandwiches with a sense of satisfaction and thoughts of good things to come. But just hours after the final whistle the club's Kuwaiti owners, the Al Hasawi family, fired the club's quietly progressive manager, Sean O'Driscoll. Baffling decision. For fans and observers alike it was a baffling decision. \\"We cannot speak highly enough of Sean as a man,\\" said Chairman Fawaz Al Hasawi. \\"He was appointed at an extremely difficult time for the club and can count himself unlucky to have lost his job with the team just one point away from the top six. But we have a responsibility to look to the future for this great Club because we have huge ambitions for it.\\" Fast forward just a few weeks, and O'Driscoll's replacement, Alex McLeish, has followed his predecessor to the exit. January had also seen the sudden and unceremonious exits of Forest's CEO, its head of recruitment, and the popular club ambassador (and former player and manager) Frank Clark. McLeish departed 'by mutual consent' after just one win in seven games and a transfer window that bordered on farcical, as key target George Boyd's switch to the club foundered after the player apparently failed an eye test. Forest fans took to social media once more in a bewildered daze as headlines painted a picture of a shambolic club in disarray. Days later another former Forest manager, the combative Billy Davies, was reinstalled in this hottest of managerial hot seats. But before he could properly take charge his team duly lost 2-0 to a Bristol City side now, somewhat poetically, managed by none other than Sean O'Driscoll. Blackburn woes. This odd story will have particular resonance in England's north west, where another of English football's most venerable institutions, Blackburn Rovers, has collapsed from mid table comfort in the English Premier League (EPL) to relegation and ignominy. The club's owners, India's Venky's Group, began their tenure by sacking the widely respected Sam Allardyce in December 2010. Since then they appear to have embarked on a kamikaze PR strategy, which has led to ridicule off the pitch and confusion on it. In the latest chapter, Shebby Singh, the former TV pundit brought in by Venky's as the club's 'global advisor', is reportedly at loggerheads with managing director Derek Shaw, amid allegations of interference with football matters and disputes over players' contractual deals. The culture clash between the old and the new sides of the club looks wider than ever. Rovers are now onto their third manager of the season and a swift return to the EPL looks wildly improbable. Venky's and the Al-Hasawi family are the latest in a wave of foreign owners taking control of clubs in the English leagues. Few on the growing list are strangers to controversy. Mixed feelings. Cardiff City's new Malaysian owners changed the club's colors from blue to red, causing outrage -- but perhaps they will be forgiven as they are currently well set for promotion to the EPL. The Glazer family's takeover of Manchester United sparked a supporter's revolt that saw the formation of a completely new team -- FC United of Manchester -- by fans alarmed at the level of debt (currently around Â£360million - 550m) foisted upon the club. Then there's Roman Abramovich's Chelsea, whose phenomenal success has been tempered by the owner's propensity to fire managers; and Sheikh Mansour of Manchester City, whose investments in the club stretch UEFA's concept of Financial Fair Play to the limit, and very probably beyond. The attitude of football fans to these types of investor is pretty schizophrenic. On the one hand the very prospect of a new owner, awash with cash, coming in and transforming a club's fortunes would get many salivating, regardless of where the money is from and who is taking the reins. English football, or at least the Premier League, is an enormously attractive stage and clubs make for interesting playthings for the super-rich. Meanwhile, fans are attracted to the idea of quick-fix success. Community connection. On the other hand, with spiraling ticket prices driven largely by players' wages and the increasingly erratic pictures being painted by some of these new owners, there is a sense that clubs' connections with the communities in which many have existed for over a century are being undermined. Then of course there's the idea of what constitutes super rich in the context of football. Away from the financial machinations of the Glazers, Randy Lerner's more straightforward commitment to Aston Villa appears to have run dry, with the team staring at a relegation battle and the purse strings tied tightly shut. In the Championship, Watford's owners have enjoyed remarkable success by filling their side with loan signings from another club, Italy's Udinese, which they also own. And then, in England's League One, there's Portsmouth. If the Glazer's ownership of Manchester United appears complex, the background to Portsmouth's stewardship is positively arcane. An excellent blog by Portsmouth fan SJ Maskell recently dissected the baffling raft of creditors currently being pored over in the English courts. The club, which enjoyed a Premier League berth and an FA Cup win just five years ago, is facing relegation to England's fourth tier and possible ruin. It has seen a succession of owners, offshore companies, and paper trails leading all over the world drive it into successive demotions and financial collapse. Wayward club. A group of fans has formed the Portsmouth Supporters' Trust, which is looking to gain control of this wayward club and finally wrestle it back from a course to apparent doom. All logic points to their being given the chance to do so, but this is a club that has defied logic for years and a decision in their favor is by no means certain. The Portsmouth Supporters Trust faces a battle, but it is perhaps this kind of institution that points to a more stable future for clubs and the sport of football in England. The problem with many of the new wave of owners in English football is not that they are foreign. Football is a global game, and the EPL is filled with players from all over the world, so it would be illogical to deny owners from overseas the chance to take part too. But the disconnect between the fans that pay to watch these clubs, the communities in which they operate, and even the armchair fans that follow them from afar, is an issue. A report launched this week by the football community trust Supporters Direct outlines a range of measures primarily focused on the physical manifestations of clubs -- the stadia in which they play, and the various off-shoots of these buildings. At the report's core are recommendations designed to protect the relationship between clubs and their communities, including joint ownership of stadia, 'golden shares' to be held by supporters collectively, and clubs that are owned by or formed as so-called Community Benefit Societies. In essence, it is about taking a degree of control into the hands of supporters. The sentiment behind this applies not just to the bricks and mortar of a football stadium. Clubs like Barcelona in Spain and throughout Germany's Bundesliga are protected from extreme and erratic behavior by the fact that fans are directly involved in a democratic ownership arrangement. The worst excesses of owners, who can act on a whim to often disrupt and damage the course of some of the long established institutions at the heart of communities, can be curbed by what is basically a democratic, rather than autocratic structure. Allied to initiatives such as UEFA's Financial Fair Play rules, perhaps this will see a game in England that is balanced less precariously, and fit for a long term and sustainable future. For now, however, English football fans should perhaps be careful what they wish for. Highlights:","response":"- Nottingham Forest faced some unexpected changes as the Al Hasawi family fired the club's manager, Sean O'Driscoll, after a 4-2 victory against Leeds United in 2012. - English football has seen multiple instances of foreign owners taking control, leading to mixed feelings and controversy among fans. - High-spending owners can lead to an unstable environment for clubs and their connection to their communities. - To regain stability, some suggest a more democratic ownership structure, allowing fans more control and involvement in the clubs."},{"question":"Add punctuation: This would have an adverse effect on business activity and employment and lead to a fall in the prices and wages which would reinforce the direct effects of the pricespecieflow mechanism","response":"This would have an adverse effect on business activity and employment, and lead to a fall in the prices and wages, which would reinforce the direct effects of the price-specie-flow mechanism."},{"question":"Esityslistalla on seuraavana Castagnettin laatima työllisyys- ja sosiaaliasiain valiokunnan mietintö (A4-0135/98) ehdotuksesta neuvoston päätökseksi vuorottelukoulutukseen, mukaan lukien oppisopimuskoulutus, liittyvien eurooppalaisten koulutusjaksojen kehittämisestä (KOM(97)0575 - C4-0064/98-97/0321(SYN)).

This is sometimes referred to as “checking labs,” “doing bloodwork,” or even “checking blood.” Most older adults have been through this. For instance, it’s pretty much impossible to be hospitalized without having bloodwork done, and it’s part of most emergency room care. Such testing is also often done as part of an annual exam, or “complete physical.” Last but not least, blood testing is usually — although not always — very helpful when it comes to evaluating many common complaints that affect aging adults. Fatigued and experiencing low energy? We should perhaps check for anemia and thyroid problems, among other things. Confused and delirious? Bloodwork can help us check on an older person’s electrolytes (they can be thrown off by a medication side-effect, as well as by other causes). Blood tests can also provide us with information related to infection, kidney function, and much more. Like much of medical care, blood testing is probably overused. But often, it’s an appropriate and an important part of evaluating an older person’s health care concerns. So as a geriatrician, I routinely order or recommend blood tests for older adults. Historically, laboratory results were reviewed by the doctors and were only minimally discussed with patients and families. But today, it’s becoming more common for patients to ask questions about their results, and otherwise become more knowledgeable about this aspect of their health. In fact, one of my top recommendations to older adults and family caregivers is to always request a copy of your laboratory results. (And then, keep it in your personal health record!)

In particular, such a task should challenge an individual's spatial awareness, problem-solving skills, and grasp of fundamental physics concepts. Below are some examples of tasks that test physical reasoning ability: 1. Puzzle assembly: Assembling a complex 3D puzzle (like a Rubik's Cube or a mechanical puzzle) requires the ability to analyze and manipulate objects in three-dimensional space, as well as a strong understanding of spatial relations and mechanical properties. 2. Building a bridge: Designing and constructing a small-scale bridge made from a limited variety of materials (e.g., toothpicks, popsicle sticks, or straws) challenges an individual's understanding of balance, force, tension, compression, and other principles of engineering. The objective is to build a bridge capable of supporting a given weight. 3. Designing a Rube Goldberg machine: Developing a Rube Goldberg machine, or an elaborate and over-engineered contraption designed to perform a simple task, requires creativity and an understanding of the interaction between objects, forces, and energy transfers. This task involves identifying the potential energy sources and predicting the sequence of events leading to the desired outcome. 4. Projectile motion: A projectile-launching task, such as hitting a target using a slingshot, catapult, or trebuchet, tests an individual's ability to calculate the projectile's trajectory, taking into account factors such as the angle of launch, initial velocity, air resistance, and gravity. 5. Balancing objects: Some tasks involve balancing objects, such as stacking irregularly shaped rocks or placing a series of objects on a beam so that the beam remains balanced on a pivot point. This activity challenges the participant's understanding of the center of mass, weight distribution, and torque. 6. Navigating through a maze or obstacle course: Moving through a complex environment with various physical challenges (e.g., climbing over walls, crawling under barriers, or walking on narrow beams) tests spatial awareness and the ability to plan and adapt movements based on the understanding of the surroundings and the individual's physical capabilities. 7. Estimating physics quantities: Participants could be asked to estimate the mass, volume, or density of objects, the force required to move them, or the time it would take for an object to fall from a given height. This task involves an understanding of the principles governing these quantities and the ability to make reasonable approximations. 8. Constructing simple machines and mechanical systems: Building a working model of a mechanical system, such as a pulley system, a lever, or a hydraulic system, demonstrates a solid understanding of the principles of mechanics and the ability to apply them to real-world problems. In summary, a task that tests someone's ability to perform physical reasoning should involve complex physical interactions and require the individual to understand and apply fundamental principles of mechanics and spatial awareness to solve problems or complete tasks. These activities can be designed in a variety of ways and made more or less difficult depending on the desired level of challenge."},{"question":"Please answer this question: who played young vito corleone in godfather ii?","response":"Robert De Niro portrayed the character of young Vito Corleone in the critically acclaimed film \\"The Godfather: Part II,\\" released in 1974. This film was directed by Francis Ford Coppola and based on Mario Puzo's novel, \\"The Godfather.\\" Set as both a prequel and a sequel to the 1972 film \\"The Godfather,\\" the narrative tells two parallel stories. In one, we see the early life and origins of Vito Corleone, and in the other, his son Michael Corleone's journey continues as he attempts to expand and consolidate the family's power in the 1950s. Robert De Niro, known for his exceptional acting prowess, won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor in 1974 for his role. His character, young Vito Corleone, represents the early life of the Mafia boss, originally played by Marlon Brando in the first film. De Niro's portrayal brings energy and depth to the character as he rises from humble beginnings in Sicily and New York, showcasing Vito's transformation into a powerful Mafia don. Throughout \\"The Godfather: Part II,\\" we see a young, ambitious Vito as he struggles to support his family, soon navigating the complex world of organized crime and gaining control of a rival crime family. Eventually, Vito builds an empire that he bequeaths to his children, with Michael taking over the family business. De Niro's performance as young Vito Corleone is widely celebrated as one of the actor's most memorable and impressive roles, while \\"The Godfather: Part II\\" is often considered one of the greatest films in world cinema.

Now let's use these steps to solve the task: Step 1: Understand the two actions (A) Demanding adult children to help around the house because you pay for things (B) Blocking someone on social media or in communication Step 2: Compare the ethical implications (A) This action can be seen as a reasonable expectation from parents for adult children still living at home or benefiting from their support. On the other hand, it can also be argued that adult children should have the autonomy to decide how to contribute. (B) Blocking someone on social media or in communication can have varying ethical implications depending on the reason. If it's for personal boundaries or self-protection, it can be seen as ethical. However, if it's done out of spite or to avoid a necessary conversation, it can be seen as less ethical. Step 3: Choose the action that is considered less ethical Between the two actions, it's difficult to determine which one is definitively the least ethical without more context. However, in general terms and without further information given, we can assume that blocking someone might be considered less ethical in cases where the reason is unclear or trivial.

That's the pledge the magazine's staff made in its latest edition, after a push led by a Maine 14-year-old to combat the practice of tweaking pictures and picking models whose appearance give teens an unrealistic perspective on what is beautiful. \\"We vow to ... never change girls' body or face shapes. (Never have, never will),\\" the magazine states as part of its \\"Body Peace Treaty\\" from its August edition, a copy of which CNN obtained Thursday. The treaty and accompanying note by editor-in-chief Ann Shoket promise that Seventeen will \\"celebrate every kind of beauty\\" and feature \\"real girls and models who are healthy,\\" while vouching that the magazine always has done just that. But the more than 84,000 people who signed a Change.org petition, started by teenager Julia Bluhm, clearly believed Seventeen and other publications didn't always present the full, unvarnished truth. \\"Those 'pretty women' that we see in magazines are fake,\\" the petition said, in requesting \\"one unaltered -- real -- photo spread per month.\\" \\"They're often Photoshopped, air-brushed, edited to look thinner and to appear like they have perfect skin. A girl you see in a magazine probably looks a lot different in real life.\\" Retouching photographs is nothing new -- especially in magazines and, increasingly, on the Internet. Adobe Photoshop and other digital image manipulation programs are widely employed by professionals and everyday users. The petition claims that disseminating such altered images to impressionable teens can pose a real danger, helping to spawn a culture that touts unrealistic beauty and contributes to eating disorders, extreme dieting, depression and more. On YouTube, teens ask the world: Am I ugly? \\"I know how it affects girls and ... my friends,\\" Julia told CNN in May, shortly after meeting with Shoket and presenting the signatures to her. \\"We don't realize it sometimes when we're just looking at the magazine and having fun. It can lower self-esteem.\\" But not all teenage girls think retouching photographs is a problem. Alexis Jones of Alpharetta, Georgia, said Thursday she'd worry that, if magazines portrayed young women who were overweight or had acne as being beautiful, some girls may think it's OK to live an unhealthy lifestyle. In fact, she feels making models' bodies thinner and their skin clearer can serve as positive motivation for people to take better care of themselves. \\"Some people use that ideal image as motivation to get fit, eat healthy and stuff, while some use it as a crutch,\\" said the 18-year-old, a rising freshman at Georgia State University. \\"You just have to be strong-minded.\\" In addition to going \\"more public\\" in its commitment, Seventeen states in its latest edition it is partnering with the National Eating Disorders Association and the Commission for Positive Images of Women and Girls. The magazine's treaty also vows it will \\"be totally upfront about what goes into our photo shoots\\" and it understands that, \\"regardless of clothing size, being healthy is about honoring your natural shape.\\" \\"We vow to ... give you the confidence to walk into any room and own it. Say bye-bye to those nagging insecurities that you're not good enough or pretty enough.\\" Even as she pushed another petition urging Teen Vogue to make a similar public pledge, Julia celebrated the proposals made by Seventeen. \\"'Seventeen' listened!\\" she said in an update of her online petition. \\"They're saying they won't use Photoshop to digitally alter their models! This is a huge victory, and I'm so unbelievably happy.\\" The magazine said that it will continue make small changes to photos, like erasing a stray hair or changing background colors, even as it insists it still won't make big changes to a person's body or face. Yet by not taking any responsibility for having presented anything but \\"authentic\\" beauty in the past, the magazine \\"doesn't really address (the) criticism\\" from many that it hasn't always lived by those rules, said former model Jenna Sauers. \\"Seventeen essentially says that it's never had any issues with the way it's Photoshopped ... celebrities and models but that, just to be on the safe side, it will continue not altering the bodies of the people photographed,\\" said Sauers, a contributor to the female-focused, commentary-driven online magazine Jezebel.com. \\"It seems like 84,000 people who signed that petition seem to be of the opinion that there were some issues.\\" Sauers said photo-editing tools have \\"made it incredibly easy to alter all kinds of things about image including body shape, size, skin color, skin tone, to erase wrinkles. And sometimes the effects are downright creepy.\\" The practice is widely used, and accepted, in the fashion and magazine industry -- such that many people now almost assume that most any image of a beautiful person is somehow doctored, Sauers told CNN. \\"We've gotten used to the idea over the past 10 years or so that every single image we see in a magazine, particularly in women's magazines, is going to be an altered, hyper-real, impossible idealized version of how that person actually looks,\\" she said. Empowering young girls online. \\"For young girls, that's not a healthy visual culture to be growing up in.\\" New York-based celebrity publicist Marvet Britto said on HLN's \\"Evening Express\\" that magazine editors generally are \\"not selling reality, they're selling where the consumer desires to be.\\" \\"As much as we would like to think that (media would show) a more diverse array of the American public to young girls, that's simply not going to happen,\\" Britto said, asserting you'll find \\"pretty much the same type of individual\\" on covers of magazines such as Seventeen. Emma Stydahar -- a teen activist affiliated with Spark, a movement devoted to ending \\"the sexualization of women and girls in media\\" for whom Bluhm has blogged -- acknowledged on HLN that altered images are widespread and do negatively affect girls. Still, she expressed excitement about Seventeen's new public declaration and anticipation that it will spur other publishers to follow suit. And if it doesn't, she promised, young women such as she and Julia Bluhme will keep pushing to affect change. \\"I definitely see that in the future,\\" Stydahar said. \\"I know that, myself personally and my co-workers at Spark will not change until this capitalization off of young woman's body image stops.\\" What do you think about excessive editing in commercial photography? Has it had an effect on you? Let us know in the comments below.

If we assume that the first sentence is true, it suggests that the actor being discussed gave a performance that wasn't always funny in \\"The World According to Garp.\\" This implies that the actor indeed played a serious part in the movie. \\"The World According to Garp\\" is a 1982 American dramedy film based on John Irving's novel of the same name. The film has elements of both comedy and drama and stars Robin Williams, who was known for his comedic roles. However, in this film, he portrayed T.S. Garp, a character who experiences a range of emotions and situations. While there might be some funny moments in the movie, the overall tone is a mix of serious and comedic moments.

Answer the above question based on the context below: A series of murders of rich young women throughout the area of Globe, Arizona bear the distinctive signature of a serial killer. Clues lead Detective Charles Mendoza to visit Paul White, a sound expert installing hi-fi systems in wealthy people's homes. His special talent is to make a noise which echoes through the air cavities in his head and shows him where the sound of the speakers should come from and echo in the room. He is married to Joan, whom, ten years earlier, he had seduced away from Mike DeSantos, who was her then boyfriend. Joan and Paul have a daughter, Danielle, together. Paul, installing equipment at Dr. Sutter's home, proximal to the most-recent murder, is approached by Detective Mendoza-- they have a cordial conversation about sound equipment, but it turns abruptly, when Mendoza asks Paul if he still hunts. Mendoza questions Paul about whether he knew the victim, and then asks him about the tires on his van-- a tread pattern that has been located at the scene of the murder. Mendoza meets with his partner Phil at the police station, where Phil has gathered criminal record information on Paul-- they speculate on what kind of person he might be based on that information. Mendoza, working from photos of the crime scene, begins to identify some aspects of the killer's M/O. Paul visits Fred, proprietor of the local diner-- Fred mentions that Ann Mason has been asking after Paul, ostensibly to work on her satellite system.

During a partial lunar eclipse, only a portion of the Moon enters Earths umbra. When the Moon passes through Earths penumbra, it is a penumbral eclipse. Since Earths shadow is large, a lunar eclipse lasts for hours. Anyone with a view of the Moon can see a lunar eclipse. So unlike a solar eclipse, it doesnt get dark on Earth. Instead it gets dark on the Moon. Partial lunar eclipses occur at least twice a year, but total lunar eclipses are less common. The Moon glows with a dull red coloring during a total lunar eclipse. Do you have any questions?","response":"Hey there, little buddy! A lunar eclipse is like a big game of shadow and light. It happens when the Earth comes between the Sun and the Moon, and it makes a shadow on the Moon. There are three types of lunar eclipses: 1. TOTAL Lunar Eclipse: The Earth's shadow covers the entire Moon. It's like the Moon is wearing a dark blanket! 2. PARTIAL Lunar Eclipse: Only part of the Moon is covered by Earth's shadow. It's like the Moon is wearing a hat or an eye patch! 3. PENUMBRAL Lunar Eclipse: The Moon passes through Earth's lighter shadow called the \\"penumbra.\\" It's a little bit dim, but not as dark as the other eclipses. You can see a lunar eclipse if you have a nice view of the Moon. It doesn't make everything dark on Earth like a solar eclipse does, but it makes the Moon look darker and sometimes even red!

The works have much in common: they are all just over 30 minutes long, brass instruments are a key component of the orchestration, and they all exhibit unusual changes in tonality, which heighten the dramatic tension. From its opening bars, Symphony No. 1 (Op. 7, 1890–92), while reflecting the influence of Grieg and Brahms, shows Nielsen's individuality. In Symphony No. 2 (Op. 16, 1901–02), Nielsen embarks on the development of human character. Inspiration came from a painting in an inn depicting the four temperaments (choleric, phlegmatic, melancholic, and sanguine).The title of Symphony No. 3, Sinfonia Espansiva (Op. 27, 1910–11), is understood by the English composer Robert Simpson to refer to the \\"outward growth of the mind's scope\\". It fully exploits Nielsen's technique of confronting two keys at the same time and includes a peaceful section with soprano and baritone voices, singing a tune without words. Symphony No. 4, The Inextinguishable (Op. 29, 1914–16), written during World War I, is among the most frequently performed of the symphonies. In the last movement two sets of timpani are placed on opposite sides of the stage undertaking a kind of musical duel. Nielsen described the symphony as \\"the life force, the unquenchable will to live\\".Also frequently performed is the Symphony No. 5 (Op. 50, 1921–22), presenting another battle between the forces of order and chaos. A snare drummer is given the task of interrupting the orchestra, playing ad libitum and out of time, as if to destroy the music. Performed by the Danish Radio Symphony Orchestra conducted by Erik Tuxen at the 1950 Edinburgh International Festival, it caused a sensation, sparking interest in Nielsen's music outside Scandinavia. In Symphony No. 6 (without opus number), written 1924–25, and subtitled Sinfonia Semplice (Simple Symphony), the tonal language seems similar to that in Nielsen's other symphonies, but the symphony... Guess a valid title for it!","response":"Considering the context provided and the themes explored in Nielsen's previous symphonies, a valid title for Symphony No. 6 could be \\"The Essence of Humanity.\\" This title would reflect the continuation of the exploration of human character and emotions, while also highlighting the 'simple' aspect of the subtitle, Sinfonia Semplice, as it gets to the core essence of what it means to be human."},{"question":"Question: Information: - Albula Pass (Romansh: \\"Pass d'Alvra\\" or ) (el. 2315 m) is a Swiss mountain pass in the canton of Graubünden.

The film takes place during a 24-hour period. Henry Hackett is the metro editor of the New York Sun, a fictional New York City tabloid. He is a workaholic who loves his job, but the long hours and low pay are leading to discontent. He is at risk of experiencing the same fate as his editor-in-chief, Bernie White, who put his work first at the expense of his family. The paper's owner, Graham Keighley, faces dire financial straits, so he has Alicia Clark, the managing editor and Henry's nemesis, impose unpopular cutbacks. Henry's wife Martha, a fellow Sun reporter on leave and about to give birth, is fed up because Henry seems to have less and less time for her, and she really dislikes Alicia Clark. She urges him to seriously consider an offer to leave the Sun and become an assistant managing editor at the New York Sentinel, another fictional newspaper (based on The New York Times), which would mean more money, shorter hours, and more respectability, but might also be a bit boring for his tastes. Minor subplots involve Alicia, Bernie, and Sun columnist Michael McDougal. McDougal is threatened by an angry city official named Sandusky whom McDougal's column had been tormenting for the past several weeks. Their drunken confrontation in a bar (later in the film) leads to gunfire, which gets Alicia shot in the leg through the wall.

UFO are an English rock band that was formed in London in August 1969. They became a transitional group between early hard rock and heavy metal and the new wave of British heavy metal. The band's current lineup includes vocalist Phil Mogg, lead guitarist Vinnie Moore, bass guitarist Rob De Luca, keyboardist and rhythm guitarist Paul Raymond and drummer Andy Parker. They have gone through several line-up changes, leaving Mogg as the only constant member, and had two hiatuses (1983-1984 and again from 1989 to 1991). Tensions had begun to grow between Mogg and Schenker in the late 1970s, possibly from Schenker often leaving before or during shows. Soon after UFO's show in Palo Alto, California on 29 October 1978, Schenker left the band. He made a brief return to the Scorpions before going on to form his own Michael Schenker Group. After Schenker's exit, UFO rehired Paul \\"Tonka\\" Chapman on guitar who brought over unused track ideas from Lone Star's drummer Dixie Lee. Shortly after, they released their next LP, No Place to Run in January, 1980. Produced by former Beatles producer George Martin, No Place To Run failed to match up to the success of its predecessors, though it fractionally missed the UK Top 10. Paul Raymond left the band at the end of the No Place To Run tour and was replaced by John Sloman from Uriah Heep for a couple of months and then by former Wild Horses guitarist and keyboardist Neil Carter, who helped fill the void in the songwriting left by Schenker's departure. Carter debuted with UFO on stage at the three-day Reading Festival on 23 August 1980, when the band played as the Saturday night headline act. At the beginning of the following year, UFO released the self-produced The Wild, the Willing and the Innocent, which had a lighter pop rock sound, which was popular at the time. The album achieved mild success in the UK, reaching the UK Top 20, and the single \\"Lonely Heart\\" was released. In February 1982 the band released Mechanix. It was very successful in the UK, where it reached No.8, the band's highest ever placing. Later that year, founding member Pete Way left the band to form Fastway with Motorhead guitarist \\"Fast\\" Eddie Clarke and then his own band, Waysted. He was replaced by Talas bassist, Billy Sheehan. UFO released Making Contact in 1983, but the album was a critical and commercial failure. Thus, that March, UFO decided to disband. The band played a UK farewell tour with Paul Gray (ex Eddie and the Hot Rods and The Damned bassist). However, there was a hint that this might not be permanent, when UFO released a compilation album featuring songs by UFO (as well as other groups featuring ex-members of UFO) entitled Headstone, the sleeve of which showed a headstone, denoting UFO with their formation date but an incomplete end date. This proved to be a short hiatus as, just short of two years later, in late 1984, Mogg assembled a new UFO line-up, featuring Paul Gray on bass again, ex-Diamond Head drummer Robbie France (replaced in 1985 by former Magnum drummer Jim Simpson), and Atomik Tommy M (Tommy McClendon), a former roadie who also wrote lyrics for Loudness, on guitar, with Paul Raymond rejoining shortly after and released Misdemeanor. This was followed by the 1988 EP Ain't Misbehavin. Despite the renewed activity of the band, neither release was financially successful and they officially disbanded again in 1989 after a string of guitarists replacing McClendon: Myke Gray of Jagged Edge in late 1987, in 1988 former Legs Diamond guitarist Rik Sanford and Tony Glidewell, while Pete Way rejoined on bass, and finally in 1989 future Cold Sweat guitarist Erik Gamans.

The statement asserts that alcohol use among emergency department patients is a problem that cannot be solved by a single discipline, which implies that it is indeed a problem that exists and requires a multi-disciplinary approach to tackle. Alcohol use among emergency department patients can manifest in numerous ways and pose various challenges to the proper functioning of an emergency department. Some of the problems associated with alcohol use in this context are: 1. Acute Intoxication: Patients who visit the emergency department while intoxicated may present symptoms similar to those of other medical conditions such as head injuries, strokes, or diabetic emergencies. This could result in misdiagnosis, delayed treatment, or unnecessary tests being conducted. 2. Behavioral Issues: Intoxicated patients may become aggressive, uncooperative, or agitated, leading to stress among emergency department staff, and potentially making it challenging to provide care to these patients and others. 3. Chronic Alcoholism: Long-term alcohol use can result in various health complications – such as liver disease, gastrointestinal bleeding, or alcohol-related seizures – which can necessitate visits to the emergency department. These cases often require specialized care, further emphasizing the need for a multi-disciplinary approach. 4. Alcohol Withdrawal: Emergency departments may see patients experiencing alcohol withdrawal, which can be a life-threatening condition if not managed appropriately. Treatment of withdrawal may require expertise from several disciplines, including psychiatry and internal medicine. 5. Underlying Medical Conditions: Alcohol use may exacerbate pre-existing medical conditions and necessitate visits to the emergency department. Addressing the interplay between alcohol use and these underlying conditions – such as heart disease and diabetes – would require expertise from different medical specialists. 6. Secondary Consequences: Alcohol use can lead to various injuries and trauma – from motor vehicle accidents and falls to domestic violence and self-harm – which can create additional strain on already overcrowded emergency departments. The complexity of these issues highlights the importance of an integrated and comprehensive approach that extends beyond a single discipline to manage the challenge of alcohol use among emergency department patients. Collaboration among healthcare professionals, including emergency physicians, nurses, social workers, substance abuse counselors, and mental health professionals, can create a more efficient and effective response to this multifaceted problem. Additionally, implementing preventive measures, such as public health campaigns and early intervention strategies, can also contribute to reducing the impact of alcohol use on emergency department patients and healthcare systems."},{"question":"I have a new situation: Alexander is conducting reactions in his college chemistry class. In his first reaction, reaction A, he uses a high strength burner so the temperature of the reaction is high. In the second reaction, reaction B, he uses a weaker model of burner, so the temperature of the reaction is low. But I can use this background: Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in matter. In everyday usage, temperature indicates a measure of how hot or cold an object is. Temperature is an important parameter in chemistry. When a substance changes from solid to liquid, it is because there was an increase in the temperature of the material. Chemical reactions usually proceed faster if the temperature is increased. Many unstable materials (such as enzymes) will be viable longer at lower temperatures. What is an answer for this question: Which reaction will proceed slower? A:","response":"Reaction B will proceed slower because it has a lower temperature, which means the average kinetic energy of the particles is lower. This typically leads to a slower rate of chemical reactions."},{"question":"Instructions: In this task you will be given a list of integers.

Larry falsely claims Bernie as his uncle, so he can get some of Bernie's possessions including Bernie's credit card. At the insurance company, Larry and Richard are quizzed by their boss and Arthur Hummel, the company's internal investigator, who ask the two if they have the US2 million that Bernie embezzled. They deny knowing where the money is, but their boss believes they're lying and fires them. He also sends Hummel after them, giving him two weeks to prove their guilt. Over dinner (paid for with Bernie's credit card, in one of its many uses), Larry tells Richard he found a key to a safe deposit box in St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands and asks Richard if he will use the computer at work to see if the 2 million is in Bernie's account. At first Richard refuses but ultimately gives in. Meanwhile, in the Virgin Islands, a voodoo queen named Mobu is hired by mobsters to find the money Bernie stole. She sends two servants—Henry and Charles (Tom Wright)—to go to New York, get Bernie's body, use a voodoo ceremony to reanimate him, and bring him back to her so he can lead her to the money. Their attempts to bring Bernie back are plagued by accidents. They prepare in a bathroom at a sleazy porno theater for the voodoo ceremony, but having lost the sacrificial chicken, they use a pigeon instead.

Plot title: EXistenZ Movie plot: In the near-future, organic virtual reality game consoles known as \\"game pods\\" have replaced electronic ones. The pods are attached to \\"bio-ports\\", outlets inserted at players' spines, through biotechnological umbilical cords. Two game companies, Antenna Research and Cortical Systematics, compete against each other. In addition, a group of \\"realists\\" fights both companies to prevent the \\"deforming\\" of reality. Antenna Research's Allegra Geller (Jennifer Jason Leigh), the world's preeminent game designer, is testing her latest virtual reality game, eXistenZ, with a focus group at a seminar.

As Dichter is gunned down by the security team, security guard (and marketing trainee) Ted Pikul (Jude Law) rushes to Geller and escorts her outside. Allegra discovers that her pod, which contains the only copy of the eXistenZ game, may have been damaged due to an \\"UmbyCord\\" being ripped out as the game was being downloaded. To test it, she must plug into the game in tandem with another player she can trust, and talks a reluctant Pikul into installing a bio-port in his own body so he can play the game with her.

In an exceptional display of courage and humankind's compassion, the passengers of a luxury cruise ship, along with its crew, cheered as they changed course to come to the stranded sailor's rescue – a miraculous intervention that likely saved his life.

Realizing the severity of the situation, the seasoned sailor sent out a distress call, knowing full well that his chances of survival hung in the balance. In a stroke of immense fortune, the distress call caught the attention of a nearby luxury cruise ship, which swiftly changed course to locate and save the beleaguered sailor.

Zapata County Sheriff Sigifredo \\"Sigi\\" Gonzalez said Sunday that Tiffany Hartley was subjected to 12 hours of questioning by Mexican investigators Friday in an effort to \\"intimidate and discourage her from doing anything.\\" Hartley is scheduled to meet with Mexican prosecutors and investigators today, Gonzalez said. He said the questions asked by Mexican investigators were not aimed at resolving the Sept. 30 incident, when Hartley says her husband, David, was shot by Mexican pirates. His body has not been recovered. \\"It's wrong. It makes no sense,\\" Gonzalez said. He said he received an account of the meeting from U.S. officials who attended the session in McAllen, Texas. Mexican officials could not be reached for comment Sunday. Gonzalez's account contradicts a statement released Saturday by the Mexican attorney general's office. It said Hartley's wife provided new information about the Jet Ski outing on Falcon Lake, which spans the U.S.-Mexican border. \\"Mrs. Hartley provided valuable information that will allow federal investigations to continue,\\" the Mexican government's statement said. The statement did not elaborate on the nature of the information provided by Hartley, who has expressed concern that the investigation and search would be abandoned. Tiffany Hartley has said she and her husband were attacked when they ventured into Mexican waters on Jet Skis to photograph the ruins of a church. She said her husband was shot in an assault by gunmen in boats. She said she tried but failed to pull her husband onto her Jet Ski and fled to the Texas side of the border as the gunmen continued firing on her craft. Gonzalez said the gunmen are believed to be members of the violent Zetas drug cartel. Last week, the Mexican inquiry into the Hartley shooting was shaken when the severed head of the commander in the case, Rolando Flores Villegas, was found. Gonzalez said Villegas' killing is one of the reasons Mexican authorities do not want to proceed with the investigation. During the questioning Friday, Gonzalez said, Mexican investigators asked Hartley to participate in a re-enactment of the incident. Gonzalez said the request was inappropriate because it posed a clear risk to Hartley's safety. \\"She's never hinted at not cooperating with them,\\" he said. \\"But she's not going to go do that, and you can't blame her.\\" \\"They don't want to investigate this,\\" Gonzalez said. \\"Their position is, 'We hope we can discourage her enough so that she won't continue to go forward with it.' \\" You share in the USA TODAY community, so please keep your comments smart and civil.

He has no idea that Ed Sheeran is one of the performers and kicks him off the stage for violating the one-song rule. Ed, who's in town for the Spirit of Detroit Music Festival, then tweets out, \\"If you see this rude bar owner, give him a smack from me,\\" which leads to nearly every person who stops by the bar hitting Justin in the head. Nicki's getting married this weekend, and Justin's pretty bummed out, so Danny tries to cheer him up by watching Scandal. Only, Danny flips out upon learning that Justin thinks Scott Foley is better looking than him. A super-hot girl (Victoria Justice) at the next table overhears his tantrum and thinks the best friends' banter is hilarious. This prompts the two idiots to try to one up each other for the lovely Amanda's affections. Amanda's a backup singer in town for the musical festival, so of course, Justin immediately starts singing. When Amanda leaves, Danny announces he's going to bow out of the competition so Justin has a chance with her. This infuriates Justin, leading to a face-off between the roommates. If Amanda picks Justin, Danny has to wax his chest, and if she picks anyone else, Justin has to wax his chest… live. Meanwhile, Brett complains that people from Detroit are horrible tippers, but Leslie kindly reminds him that he's not exactly the nicest bartender. At a table nearby, Shelly's retirement home coworkers Zach (Zach Braff) and Donald (Donald Faison) agree with Leslie - Brett was a bitch to them, too! So nice-guy Shelly challenges the snarky Brit to see who can earn the most tips by the end of the night. Shelly, being the adorable teddy bear that he is, quickly fills up his bucket with tips from pretty ladies (Christa Miller and Minnie Driver - Version 1; Christa Miller and Kate Walsh Version 2) while Brett's is totally empty. Dr. Drew, who's been sitting at the bar, notices and tells Shelly he's worried about Brett, prompting Shelly to give his bucket money to Dr. Drew to give to Brett. Dr. Drew pockets most of it, but throws a 50 at Brett, making him the winner! Upstairs, Candace is hiding a big secret: her ex-boyfriend Trent! When Leslie and Burski spot him they're livid - Trent's an absolute jackass who treated Candace terribly. Candace swears he just needed a place to crash and they're not getting back together. Leslie and her new boyfriend Mike (Mike Catherwood) explain that Candace is just backsliding, but that'll all change the second she meets someone who makes her forget about him. Downstairs, Justin preps for Amanda's return by trying out pick-up lines on Candace. Only, she inadvertently gets sucked in by his charm and Leslie realizes Candace is definitely not thinking about Trent anymore... But when Amanda comes back, Justin comes on a bit too strong, while Danny's smooth moves win him a movie date. Burski tells Danny that he should do what Shelly did - let his best friend win because it means more to him. Danny reluctantly agrees and decides to coach Justin into beating him. He suggests picking on his insecurities and then brings out the big guns: TV's Scott Foley! Scott gives Justin a pep talk, slaps him for Ed Sheeran and then convinces Danny to drive him to the airport just by using the power of his intoxicating green eyes. When Amanda stops by for her date with Danny, Justin tries out Danny's aggressive approach but quickly realizes he's not being himself. He apologizes to Amanda and spills that he's just a guy looking for a serious relationship. Unfortunately, Amanda's not looking for anything serious, and while Danny was at the airport with TV's Scott Foley, she made other plans. Looks like nobody won, so Justin doesn't have to wax his chest. But Danny clarifies that the bet was if Amanda ended up with anyone else... and she ditched Danny for Trent!

Seeking shelter to recover from his injuries, Michael steals a kitchen knife from an elderly couple's house and kills their teenage neighbor. He learns that Laurie is at the local hospital after listening to a radio broadcast and heads there. Paramedic Jimmy Lloyd (Lance Guest) starts to develop romantic feelings for Laurie, despite the chagrin of head nurse Virginia Alves (Gloria Gifford) and explains to her about Michael; he soon realizes Laurie is in a comatose state. When Loomis sees Ben Tramer (who is wearing a mask similar to Michael's) walking towards him, he mistakes him for Michael and attempts to shoot him, but Sheriff Leigh Brackett (Charles Cyphers) tries to stop him when an oncoming police car hits a van and explodes, accidentally killing Ben. Once Michael arrives at the Haddonfield Memorial Hospital, he cuts the phone lines, and after killing most of the hospital personnel using various tools and methods, he reaches Laurie's room, but finds it empty. When Jimmy goes to get help, he discovers Mrs. Alves's corpse in the surgery room. While trying to run out of the room, he slips in a pool of blood on the floor and loses consciousness. Meanwhile, Dr. Loomis follows clues Michael left at a school he broke into when his colleague Marion Chambers (Nancy Stephens) and a marshal (John Zenda) arrive with orders to transport Loomis back to Smith Grove's Sanitarium. During the drive, Marion tells him that Laurie Strode is Michael's sister.

Answer:","response":"In the movie Halloween II, Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) experiences flashbacks of a burning body while being treated at the Haddonfield Memorial Hospital. These flashbacks are specifically of the burning body of Michael Myers (Dick Warlock), the masked killer who attacked her earlier on October 31, 1978, and who has continued to terrorize the town in search of her. These flashbacks are symbolic of Laurie's ongoing trauma and fear, knowing that Michael is still alive and may come for her again. After Michael Myers discovers Laurie's location at the hospital, he proceeds to kill most of the hospital staff and eventually reaches Laurie's room. Laurie, realizing she is in danger, manages to elude Michael and escape her room before he can harm her. Throughout the movie, characters such as Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence) and paramedic Jimmy Lloyd (Lance Guest) are involved in the efforts to stop the relentless killer and protect Laurie from the terror that she continuously faces. As the climax of Halloween II unfolds, it is revealed that Laurie Strode is actually Michael Myers' younger sister, providing a further explanation for Michael's relentless pursuit of Laurie as he seeks to kill the last remaining member of his family. With this knowledge, Dr. Loomis and Laurie must work together to confront Michael and put an end to the horrifying ordeal unfolding in Haddonfield."},{"question":"Add punctuation: Water sports clubs present themselves at the Weser Kutterpuller rowing a race and look forward to landlubbers who want to try on the belt and the extinguishing of the fire boat Bremen demonstrated the publics willingness deletion","response":"Water sports clubs present themselves at the Weser Kutterpuller, rowing a race, and look forward to landlubbers who want to try on the belt.

If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\". Gaddafi briefly studied History at the University of Libya in Benghazi, before dropping out to join the military. Despite his police record, in 1963 he began training at the Royal Military Academy, Benghazi, alongside several like-minded friends from Misrata. The armed forces offered the only opportunity for upward social mobility for underprivileged Libyans, and Gaddafi recognised it as a potential instrument of political change. Under Idris, Libya's armed forces were trained by the British military; this angered Gaddafi, who viewed the British as imperialists, and accordingly he refused to learn English and was rude to the British officers, ultimately failing his exams. British trainers reported him for insubordination and abusive behaviour, stating their suspicion that he was involved in the assassination of the military academy's commander in 1963.

Think carefully first, then make a decision:","response":"Step 1: Finding the total height John climbs up 9 flights of stairs, with each flight having a height of 10 feet. We first need to find the total height climbed. Total height = Number of flights × Height of each flight = 9 × 10 = 90 feet Step 2: Convert total height to inches Since the height of each step is given in inches, we need to convert the total height from feet to inches. 1 foot = 12 inches Total height in inches = 90 feet × 12 inches/foot = 1080 inches Step 3: Calculate the number of steps Each step has a height of 18 inches. To find the number of steps John climbs, we divide the total height in inches by the height of each step. Number of steps = Total height in inches / Height of each step = 1080 inches / 18 inches/step = 60 steps So, John climbs up 60 steps."},{"question":"Write an article based on this \\"Arrange to have a skid steer and operator come to the location. Load the rocks in the skid steer. Drive the skid steer to the desired location and unload it.\\" Article:","response":"Title: A Comprehensive Guide to Efficiently Transporting Rocks with a Skid Steer Introduction A skid steer is an invaluable piece of machinery when it comes to efficiently moving and transporting rocks. This versatile piece of equipment, which can be fitted with various attachments, is an ideal asset for many construction, landscaping, and agricultural projects. This article will guide you step-by-step on how to arrange for a skid steer and operator, load rocks safely, and transport them to their desired location. Step 1: Arrange to Have a Skid Steer and Operator Come to the Location To begin the rock relocation process, you'll need to make arrangements for a skid steer and operator to come to your project site. Start by researching local rental companies or contractors that offer skid steer services. Compare their rates, experience, and customer reviews to determine the best fit for your needs. It's essential to ensure that the operator you choose is skilled and knowledgeable about operating a skid steer efficiently and safely. Once you have selected a suitable service provider, discuss your project's specific requirements and schedule a convenient time for them to bring the skid steer to your location. Step 2: Load the Rocks in the Skid Steer Prior to loading the rocks into the skid steer, make sure that you have carefully inspected the rocks and identified any possible risks or hazards. Flag any sharp edges or irregularly shaped rocks that might need extra caution while handling. When loading rocks, it's crucial to remember basic safety guidelines, such as: - Using proper lifting techniques to prevent injuries - Wearing appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), including gloves, safety glasses, and hard hats - Ensuring that the skid steer and its attachments are in good working condition and free of defects With these safety measures in place, guide the operator in loading the rocks. Communicate effectively about the correct positioning of the skid steer bucket and any constraints in the loading area. Make sure the operator uses a slow and controlled approach to minimize the risk of any accidents or damage to the machinery. Step 3: Drive the Skid Steer to the Desired Location Once the rocks have been safely loaded into the skid steer, it's time to transport them to their desired destination. To ensure a smooth and efficient drive, be sure to: - Clear the intended path of any obstacles that might impede movement - Plan the route in advance, taking into account any site-specific restrictions, such as weight limits on bridges or steep inclines - Communicate with the operator and any other team members about the plan, so that everyone is aware of the journey ahead As the operator drives the skid steer, it's essential to maintain proper speed and control. Keep an eye on the terrain conditions, and make necessary adjustments to avoid any accidents or potential hazards. Step 4: Unload the Rocks at the Desired Location Once you've reached your destination, it's time to unload the rocks. Carefully instruct the operator on where the rocks should be placed, factoring in any specific guidelines, such as maintaining a minimum distance from structures or avoiding sensitive areas. The unloading process should be slow and controlled to avoid damaging the machinery, surrounding areas, or the rocks themselves. Conclusion With these steps, you can successfully transport rocks with a skid steer, ensuring both efficiency and safety throughout the process. This reliable piece of machinery, combined with a skilled operator and thorough planning, can significantly simplify the task of moving and transporting rocks to wherever they are needed."},{"question":"Answer the following question: What would be the ★-rating of this review (★ being the lowest and ★★★★★ being the highest)? \\"This apps\\" Answer:","response":"★"},{"question":"Write the next sentence.

Reality Check says: There is evidence for this and charging fees for employment tribunals has led to a bigger fall in the number of claims than the government expected. The fees were introduced when they were in government with the Conservatives in July 2013 - taking a case to an employment tribunal had previously been free. At the time one of the reasons it gave was that fees could: \\"disincentivise unreasonable behaviour, like pursuing weak or vexatious claims\\". Weak claims are presumably ones that are less likely to be successful, while strong ones would be more likely to be successful. The Labour manifesto said the party would \\"reverse the unfair employment tribunal fees which literally price people out of justice\\". There was no mention of employment tribunals in the Conservative or UKIP manifestos. Employment tribunals are devolved - we'll start with the situation in England and Wales. Individual claimants now have to pay a claim fee of £160 or £250 depending on the type of case and a further £230 or £950 if the case goes to a hearing. There is means-tested help available with paying tribunal fees. If you win the case then your employer might be forced to pay your tribunal fees but that is not automatic. After the fees were introduced the average number of total cases fell from about 5,000 a month to about 1,500 a month. The government had a review earlier this year to look at the impact of charging fees. It concluded that the introduction of fees had been successful in the sense that it had raised £8.5m to £9m a year and encouraged people to use free mediation services, but it also said that: \\"The fall in claims has been significantly greater than was estimated when fees were first introduced.\\" As a result, the government is consulting on whether changes are needed to the Help with Fees scheme to make it easier for people on lower incomes to get their fees paid. Brian Doyle, president of employment tribunals in England & Wales said in his submission to the review: \\"We do not consider that there has been a reduction in weak or unmeritorious claims. Had that been the case we would have expected the percentage of successful claims to have risen, whereas in fact it has declined slightly.\\" Statistics presented as part of the review show that the proportion of successful claims fell from an average of 15.3% in the nine months before the introduction of charging (62.6% were withdrawn before a hearing) to an average of 12.6% since then (with 59.0% being withdrawn). \\"Cases are being upheld in the same proportions as ever - there are just fewer winners and fewer losers,\\" Gareth Brahams from Brahams Dutt Badrick French, who is chair of the Employment Lawyers Association told BBC News. In Scotland, fees are also charged for employment tribunals. The Scottish National Party has promised to abolish them but has not yet done so. It gained the power to do so as part of last year's Scotland Act. The SNP has also pledged to abolish the fees as part of its Westminster campaign, which means it wants to see them abolished in England and Wales as well. It is also consulting on proposals to move some of its functions to the First-tier Tribunal for Scotland, which brings together a number of other legal functions, although there has been some opposition to this.

He wrote and recorded the songs \\"Me and Bobby McGee\\", \\"For the Good Times\\", \\"Sunday Mornin' Comin' Down\\" and \\"Help Me Make It Through the Night\\". Kristofferson composed his own songs and collaborated with Nashville songwriters such as Shel Silverstein. In 1985, Kristofferson joined fellow country artists Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson and Johnny Cash in forming the country music supergroup The Highwaymen. In 2004, Kristofferson was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame. He is also known for his starring roles in \\"Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore\\" and \\"A Star Is Born\\", the latter for which he won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor. - The Nashville sound originated during the mid 1950s as a subgenre of American country music, replacing the chart dominance of the rough honky tonk music which was most popular in the 1940s and 1950s with \\"smooth strings and choruses\\", \\"sophisticated background vocals\\" and \\"smooth tempos\\". It was an attempt \\"to revive country sales, which had been devastated by the rise of rock 'n' roll.\\" - Willie Hugh Nelson (born April 29, 1933) is an American musician, singer, songwriter, author, poet, actor, and activist. The critical success of the album \\"Shotgun Willie\\" (1973), combined with the critical and commercial success of \\"Red Headed Stranger\\" (1975) and \\"Stardust\\" (1978), made Nelson one of the most recognized artists in country music. He was one of the main figures of outlaw country, a subgenre of country music that developed in the late 1960s as a reaction to the conservative restrictions of the Nashville sound. Nelson has acted in over 30 films, co-authored several books, and has been involved in activism for the use of biofuels and the legalization of marijuana. - Johnny Cash (born J. R. Cash; February 26, 1932 September 12, 2003) was an American singer-songwriter, guitarist, actor, and author. He was widely considered one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century and one of the best-selling music artists of all time, having sold more than 90 million records worldwide. Although primarily remembered as a country music icon, his genre-spanning songs and sound embraced rock and roll, rockabilly, blues, folk, and gospel. This crossover appeal won Cash the rare honor of multiple inductions in the Country Music, Rock and Roll, and Gospel Music Halls of Fame. - Shotgun Willie is a 1973 album by Willie Nelson. The recording marks a change of style for Nelson, who later stated that the album \\"cleared his throat\\". When Nelson refused to sign an early extension of his contract with RCA in 1972, the label decided not to release any further recordings. Nelson hired Neil Reshen as his manager, and while Reshen negotiated with RCA, Nelson moved to Austin, Texas, where the ongoing hippie music scene at the Armadillo World Headquarters renewed his musical style. In Nashville, Nelson met producer Jerry Wexler, vice president of Atlantic Records, who was interested in his music. Reshen solved the problems with RCA and signed Nelson with Atlantic Records as their first country music artist. - \\"Me and Bobby McGee\\" is a song written by Kris Kristofferson and Fred Foster, originally performed by Roger Miller. Others performed the song later, including the Grateful Dead, Kristofferson himself, Kenny Rogers and The First Edition and most famously by Janis Joplin, whose posthumously released version topped the U.S. singles chart in 1971, making the song the second posthumously released No. 1 single in U.S. chart history after \\"(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay\\" by Otis Redding. \\"Billboard\\" ranked Joplin's version as the No. 11 song for 1971. - Outlaw country is a subgenre of American country music, most popular during the 1970s and early-1980s, sometimes referred to as the outlaw movement or simply outlaw music. The music has its roots in earlier subgenres like honky tonk and rockabilly and is characterized by a blend of rock and folk rhythms, country instrumentation and introspective lyrics. The movement began as a reaction to the slick production and popular structures of the Nashville sound developed by record producers like Chet Atkins. - Sings Kristofferson is a studio album recorded by Willie Nelson in 1979 consisting of all covers of Kris Kristofferson songs . It reached # 5 on the US Country albums chart , # 42 on the US Pop albums charts , and was certified gold in Canada and platinum in the US . The cover is very simple , a single picture of Nelson 's face against a black background , with the song titles to the right of his face . The back cover is the same background with both Nelson and Kristofferson 's faces together . - Red Headed Stranger is a 1975 album by American outlaw country singer Willie Nelson. After the wide success of his recordings with Atlantic Records, coupled with the negotiating skills of his manager, Neil Reshen, Nelson signed a contract with Columbia Records, a label that gave him total creative control over his works. The concept for the album was inspired by the \\"Tale of the Red Headed Stranger\\", a song that Nelson used to play as a disk jockey on his program in Fort Worth, Texas. After signing with Columbia he decided to record the song, and arranged the details during his return to Austin, Texas, from a trip to Colorado. It was recorded at low cost at Autumn Sound Studios in Garland, Texas. The songs featured sparse arrangements, largely limited to Nelson's guitar, piano and drums. Nelson presented the finished material to Columbia executives, who were dubious about releasing an album that they at first thought was a demo.

Article: One reaction to all the concern about tropical deforestation is a blank stare that asks the question, \\"Since I don't live there, what does it have to do with me?\\" The answer is that your way of life, wherever you live in the world, is tied to the tropics in many ways. If you live in a house, wash your hair, eat fruits and vegetables, drink soda, or drive a car, you can be certain that you are affected by the loss of tropical forests. Biologically, we are losing the richest regions on earth when, each minute, a piece of tropical forest, the size of ten city blocks, disappears. As many as five million species of plants, animals, and insects (40 to 50 percent of all living things) live there, and are being lost faster than they can be found and described. Their loss is immeasurable. Take rubber for example. For many uses, only natural rubber from trees will do. _ are not good enough. Today over half the world's commercial rubber is produced in Malaysia and Indonesia, while the Amazon's rubber industry produces much of the world's four million tons. And rubber is an important material in making gloves, balloons, footwear and many sporting goods. Thousands of other tropical plants are valuable for their industrial use. Many scientists strongly believe that deforestation contributes to the greenhouse effect -- or heating of the earth from increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. As we destroy forests, we lose their ability to change carbon dioxide into oxygen. Carbon dioxide levels could double within the next half-century, warming the earth by as much as 4.5 degrees. The result? A partial melt-down of polar ice caps, raising sea levels as much as 24 feet; even 15 feet could threaten anyone living within 35 miles of the coast. Unbelievable? Maybe.

Valentine attempts to kill the Hunter, only to be nearly killed instead, but he makes it alive. The group then splits up: Valentine and Lee go to meet the paramilitary force while Tammy, Hillary, Freckles, Garrison and Figgus try to escape through a set of tunnels. Garrison gets lost in the tunnels and killed by the Alien but the others make it to the hunterâs ship to their dismay. There they find a second Alien that's nearly dead and figure out that to get rid of the Hunter they need to kill the Alien and take a ray gun from the ship.

Step 1: Analyze the sentence In the given sentence, \\"Two men carrying a briefcase talk to another man in a white t-shirt on a porch.\\", there are a few details we can observe: a) There are two men carrying a briefcase. b) The two men are talking to another man, who is wearing a white t-shirt. c) This conversation is taking place on a porch.

However, it does not provide any concrete information as to whether these two men carrying the briefcase are businessmen. While it can be assumed that they may be businessmen because they are carrying a briefcase, it is still speculative as this is not explicitly mentioned in the sentence.

He died at Newark Castle, Nottinghamshire, and with him the main reason for the fighting. Louis now seemed much more of a threat to baronial interests than John's nine-year-old son, Prince Henry. While Eleanor of Brittany, the grown daughter of John's late elder brother Geoffrey, imprisoned by John since 1202, posed another potential candidate for the crown, the barons passed her over just like their ignorance of her conditions when the Magna Carta was issued, leaving her still in prison. Pierre des Roches, Bishop of Winchester, and a number of barons rushed to have the young Henry be crowned as King of England. London was held by Louis and therefore could not be used for this coronation so, on 28 October 1216, they brought the boy from the castle at Devizes to Gloucester Abbey in front of a small attendance presided over by a Papal Legate, Guala Bicchieri . They crowned Henry with a band of gold made from a necklace. On 12 November 1216 the Magna Carta was reissued in Henry's name with some of the clauses omitted, including clause 61. The revised charter was sealed by the young king's regent William Marshal. A great deal of the country was loyal to Prince Louis, with the southwest of England and the Midlands favouring Henry. Marshal was highly respected and he asked the barons not to blame the child Henry for his father's sins. The prevailing sentiment, helped by self-interest, disliked the idea of depriving a boy of his inheritance. Marshal also promised that he and the other regents would rule by Magna Carta. Furthermore, he managed to get support from the Pope, who had already excommunicated Louis. Who was Prince Henry's father?","response":"Prince Henry's father was King John of England. King John contracted dysentery on October 18, 1216, an illness that would ultimately lead to his death. His demise occurred at Newark Castle, in Nottinghamshire. John's death marked the cessation of the main cause for the fighting that had been occurring during his reign, as it posed a renewed challenge to the baronial interests which now considered Prince Louis as a greater threat compared to King John's nine-year-old son, Prince Henry. King John was notably engaged in confrontations with the barons during his reign, leading to the signing of the Magna Carta, a charter of rights, in 1215. However, the discord persisted resulting in the barons inviting Prince Louis of France to invade England and replace John as king. Upon John's death, the Bishop of Winchester, Pierre des Roches, and several barons took swift action to ensure the continuity of the English crown within the Angevin dynasty by crowning King John's son, Prince Henry, as King Henry III of England. This occurred on October 28, 1216, only ten days after the death of King John, establishing Prince Henry, then a minor, as the new king. The coronation took place in Gloucester Abbey, overseen by papal legate Guala Bicchieri, and as London was held by Louis, it could not serve as the location for the coronation. Following this, the Magna Carta was reissued under Henry's name on November 12, 1216, with alterations which included the omission of clause 61, under the governance of his regent William Marshal. This action solidified Henry's reign, ensured adherence to the principles of the Magna Carta, and helped combat the dominance of Louis, who had significant support within parts of the country. Marshal was a greatly respected figure, and he appealed to the barons not to attribute King John's misdemeanors to the young king, and made a commitment to abide by the Magna Carta during his regency. His stance, as well as the general reluctance to dispossess a child of his inheritance, elicited support for Henry's kingship. Marshal secured additional backing from the Pope, who had previously excommunicated Louis."},{"question":"Q:This is a correct answer to the following question about Basis point. Yes or no?

This line appears in his magnum opus, the epic poem \\"Paradise Lost,\\" which was first published in 1667. The poem is a rich and imaginative retelling of the biblical story of the Fall of Man, which revolves around the expulsion of Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden and the rise of Satan's rebellion against God's rule. In \\"Paradise Lost,\\" the quote in question is said by Satan, the chief antagonist who spearheads a rebellion against God and is ultimately defeated and sentenced to eternal damnation in Hell. Milton's depiction of Satan as a complex, charismatic, and relatable character has given \\"Paradise Lost\\" its enduring appeal and has sparked numerous debates on the nature of evil, free will, and personal agency. The quote occurs in Book I, line 263, when Satan addresses his followers after their defeat in Heaven and their subsequent banishment to Hell. He asserts that it is better to be a ruler in the realm of suffering and torment (Hell) than a servant in the domain of bliss and divine light (Heaven). By uttering these words, Satan demonstrates his immense pride, determination, and defiance toward God's authority. His perspective encapsulates the philosophical and moral dilemma faced by those who value personal freedom and autonomy, even if it means facing negative consequences or alienation. Throughout \\"Paradise Lost,\\" Satan's character evolves, presenting various facets of his motivations, desires, and emotions. His journey, filled with suffering and internal conflict, has led readers and scholars to examine the idea of heroism, the role of free will, and the consequences of disobedience. The question of whether Satan should be considered a tragic hero or a villain has been debated for centuries, and the quote \\"Better to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven\\" plays a significant role in this discussion."},{"question":"Answer this question: who sang the song respect before aretha franklin??","response":"Before Aretha Franklin sang the song \\"Respect,\\" it was originally sung by a man named Otis Redding.

The tale is mainly about the French Revolution in 1789, where the poor rose up against the king and the nobles. Dickens showed deep sympathy for the poor and deep hatred for the cruelty of the upper class, though he wrote quite a lot about the love triangle between Lucie, Charles and Sydney. In this novel, Dickens wrote some lively characters like Sydney and those crazy revolutionaries. In this tale, we can't see any absolute roles. Charles, though he's a brave and good man, obviously he hasn't as much ability as Sydney. Sydney, a typical tragic man, a man like him, usually has great ability. But he has some weak points on characters and the worst is that he always loves a woman he shouldn't love and 99.99% die for her at last in an extremely heroic or tragic way. The revolutionaries are not as full of justice as usual. They get mad when they can get revenge for their unfair treatment. The fire of hatred burns everything. When they're at the bottom of the society, they're calling for justice, for fair treatment, for freedom, but when they're in charge of the society, their world is up-side-down. They hate everything that is connected to the very people against them, even including Charles' wife, Dr. Manette's daughter. So _ have no difference from those former governors at heart. Though Dickens told us how the authority is recycling over and over again in some way, the novel is about something good. Love from Sydney to Lucie is one of the only few bright points in the novel and it's really great. A man can sacrifice his life to save his lover's husband. He doesn't have any personal purpose and just for his lover's happiness. So Dickens may imply us, only love can solve the problems between people, between the poor and the rich, love is everything.

Michael Avenatti filed the papers in federal court in California. In the documents, he seeks to depose Trump and Trump attorney Michael Cohen about a 130,000 payment made to Stormy Daniels days before the 2016 presidential election. \\"We expect to be placing the president and his fixer under oath in the coming months,\\" Avenatti said in a statement picked up by NBC News. Avenatti wants to question each for \\"no more than two hours.\\" In the filing, he says the depositions are needed to establish if Trump knew about the payment and if he consented to it. Cohen has said he paid the 130,000 out of his own pocket, while asserting Trump never had sex with the porn actress. It's rare for a president to be deposed: It happened most recently to then-President Clinton in 1998 during the Paula Jones sexual harassment suit, reports the AP. A hearing on Avenatti's motion is set for April 30. He tweeted, \\"We are confident that the Court will permit the requested discovery after applying Supreme Court precedent and the well established law in the Ninth Circuit.\\" (Daniels detailed her alleged affair with Trump on Sunday.)","response":"Title: Adult Film Star's Attorney Seeks Deposition of President Trump Introduction In a move that could have significant repercussions in American politics, Michael Avenatti, the attorney representing adult film star Stormy Daniels, filed a motion on Wednesday, seeking to depose both President Donald Trump and his attorney, Michael Cohen. The depositions would require Trump and Cohen to testify under oath about a 130,000 payment made to Daniels prior to the 2016 presidential election. Background: The Stormy Daniels Controversy Stormy Daniels, born Stephanie Clifford, has made headlines in recent months after alleging a sexual encounter with Donald Trump in 2006. While both Trump and Cohen have denied the claims, they have admitted to paying Daniels a sum of 130,000, a payment which they assert is not an admission of guilt, but rather a silent settlement to spare Trump's reputation during the crucial months leading up to the 2016 election. Legal Developments: Avenatti's Motion for Deposition Michael Avenatti, Daniels' attorney, filed the motion for deposition in a federal court in California, seeking to depose both Trump and his attorney Michael Cohen for a period of \\"no more than two hours.\\" According to court documents, the depositions are required to understand if President Trump was aware of the payment to Daniels, and whether he consented to it. Avenatti announced his plans in a statement widely reported by the media, saying, \\"We expect to be placing the president and his fixer under oath in the coming months.\\" The attorney seems confident, recently tweeting, \\"We are confident that the Court will permit the requested discovery after applying Supreme Court precedent and the well-established law in the Ninth Circuit.\\" Significance: Deposing a Sitting President It is worth noting that deposing a sitting president is a rare occurrence in American history. The most recent example was in 1998 when then-President Bill Clinton was deposed in the Paula Jones sexual harassment suit. That deposition, along with Clinton's subsequent testimony before a grand jury, led to his impeachment for perjury and obstruction of justice by the House of Representatives. Clinton was later acquitted by the Senate. Upcoming Hearings A hearing on Michael Avenatti's motion for deposition of President Trump and Michael Cohen is set for April 30. The outcome of that hearing may pave the way for a wider investigation into the alleged affair between Stormy Daniels and Donald Trump, and whether the payment made to Daniels was an attempt to keep her quiet about the alleged relationship. Regardless of the outcome, the controversy surrounding the case is likely to have far-reaching implications for the Trump presidency and American politics in general."},{"question":"Write a sentence not in English.","response":"Esta es una oración en español.

They tried all to like John.","response":"By the strictest standards, the sentence \\"They tried all to like John\\" would not be considered correct by a linguist for a variety of reasons. Language is based on a system of rules known as grammar, morphology, syntax, and semantics. Each component contributes to the construction of well-formed sentences that convey clear meanings. Let us look at the issues present in the given sentence and provide a corrected version. 1. Syntax issues: Syntax is the study of the arrangement of words and phrases to create coherent sentences in a language. The given sentence has incorrect word order, leading to confusion about its intended meaning. Corrected version: \\"They all tried to like John.\\" In the corrected version, the word \\"all\\" is placed before the verb \\"tried\\" to modify the noun \\"they,\\" which clarifies the subject of the action. 2. Semantics issues: Semantics is the study of meaning in language. In the given sentence, it is unclear whether \\"all\\" refers to a group of people's collective effort to like John or a single individual trying with their entire being to like John. Corrected version: \\"They all tried to like John.\\" The semantics issue is resolved in the corrected version, as \\"all\\" now clearly modifies \\"they,\\" indicating that each person in the group made an effort to like John. 3. Diction issues: Diction refers to word choice and the way words are used in speech and writing. In the given sentence, \\"all\\" is not the best word to convey the intended meaning. Alternate versions: - \\"Everyone tried to like John.\\" - \\"Each of them tried to like John.\\" These alternate versions improve diction by using \\"everyone\\" or \\"each of them\\" to describe the group's effort more explicitly. In conclusion, the given sentence would not be considered correct by a linguist, mainly due to syntax and semantics issues. By reordering the words and carefully selecting the appropriate diction, the sentence can be corrected to effectively convey the intended meaning. The corrected version of the sentence is \\"They all tried to like John,\\" with alternate versions being \\"Everyone tried to like John\\" or \\"Each of them tried to like John.\\""},{"question":"You are considering whether to buy a product.

If all else was the same, the wire that Ron had more resistance or less resistance.? Assuming that: Longer wires have more resistance than shorter wires. The answer to this question is:","response":"Based on the assumption that longer wires have more resistance than shorter wires, the wire that Ron ran would have more resistance than the wire that Chris ran. Let's look deeper into the concept of resistance and the factors that influence it to better understand the situation. Resistance (R) is a property of a material that opposes the flow of electric current. It depends on several factors, including the length (L) of the wire, the cross-sectional area (A) of the wire, and the resistivity (ρ) of the material it is made of. The relationship between these factors can be expressed using the formula: R = (ρ * L) / A In this case, the length of Chris's wire is 3 feet and the length of Ron's wire is 10 feet. Since all else is the same (the resistivity and cross-sectional area of the wires are equal), we can compare their resistances directly using their lengths: R_Chris = (ρ * 3) / A R_Ron = (ρ * 10) / A Since ρ and A are the same for both wires, we can relate their resistances directly as: R_Ron = (10 / 3) * R_Chris Because 10 is greater than 3, this equation tells us that: R_Ron > R_Chris In other words, the wire that Ron had (10-foot long) has more resistance than the wire that Chris had (3-foot long). It is important to note that this conclusion is based on the assumption that longer wires have more resistance than shorter wires, and other factors such as resistivity and cross-sectional area remain consistent."},{"question":"This parity stripe is a set of data that the controller can use to extrapolate what all the other stripes are Please fix the punctuation.","response":"This parity stripe is a set of data that the controller can use to extrapolate what all the other stripes are.

Championship events include nordic skiing's three disciplines: cross-country skiing, ski jumping, and nordic combined (the latter being a combination sport consisting of both cross-country and ski jumping). From 1924 to 1939, the World Championships were held every year, including the Winter Olympics. After World War II, the World Championships were held every four years from 1950 to 1982. Since 1985, the World Championships have been held in odd-numbered years. - Cortina d'Ampezzo (Ladin: \\"Anpezo, Ampëz\\"), commonly referred to as Cortina, is a town and \\"comune\\" in the heart of the southern (Dolomitic) Alps in the Veneto region of Northern Italy. Situated on the Boite river, in an alpine valley, it is a popular winter sport resort known for its skiing trails, scenery, accommodation, shops and après-ski scene, and for its jet set and aristocratic European crowd. - Finland , officially the Republic of Finland, is a sovereign state in Northern Europe. A peninsula with the Gulf of Finland to the south and the Gulf of Bothnia to the west, the country has land borders with Sweden to the northwest, Norway to the north, and Russia to the east. Estonia is south of the country across the Gulf of Finland. Finland is a Nordic country situated in the geographical region of Fennoscandia, which also includes Scandinavia. Finland's population is 5.5 million (2014), staying roughly on the same level over the past two decades. The majority of the population is concentrated in the southern region. In terms of area, it is the eighth largest country in Europe and the most sparsely populated country in the European Union. - Nordic skiing pertains to skiing disciplines that use equipment where the toe of the ski boot is fixed to the binding in a manner that allows the heel to rise off the ski, unlike Alpine skiing, where the boot is attached to the ski from toe to heel. Recreational disciplines include cross-country skiing and Telemark skiing. - Nordic combined is a winter sport in which athletes compete in cross-country skiing and ski jumping. Nordic combined at the Winter Olympics and the FIS Nordic Combined World Cup are ongoing. - Northern Europe is the northern part or region of Europe. Although no definitive borders or definition exists for the term, geographically, Northern Europe may be considered to consist approximately of all of Europe above the 52nd parallel north; which includes (from west to east) most or all of: Iceland, the Republic of Ireland, the Isle of Man, the United Kingdom, the Faroe Islands, the Netherlands, northern Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, northern Poland, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and northwest Russia. However, narrower definitions may also be used based on other geographical factors, such as climate and ecology. Greenland, geographically a part of North America, is politically a part of the Kingdom of Denmark, and may be included depending on the definition. - The FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 1927 took place between February 2 and February 5 , 1927 in Cortina d'Ampezzo , Italy . Neither Finland nor Norway took part in these championships . - Norway (; Norwegian: (Bokmål) or (Nynorsk); Sami: \\"Norgga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Norway, is a sovereign and unitary monarchy whose territory comprises the western portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula plus the island Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard. The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262). It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468. It also included the following provinces, now in Sweden: Jämtland, Härjedalen and Bohuslän. - Shetland , also called the Shetland Islands, is a subarctic archipelago that lies northeast of the island of Great Britain and forms part of Scotland, United Kingdom. - A winter sport or winter activity is a recreational activity or sport which is played during cold weather months. Most such sports are variations of skiing, ice skating and sledding. Traditionally such sports were only played in cold areas during winter, but artificial snow and artificial ice allow more flexibility. Artificial ice can be used to provide ice rinks for ice skating, ice hockey and bandy in a milder climate. - Ski jumping is a form of Nordic skiing in which athletes descend a specially constructed takeoff ramp (known as the \\"inrun\\"), jump from the end of it (the \\"table\\") with as much power as they can generate, and \\"fly\\" as far as possible down a steeply sloped hill. Points are awarded for distance and style by five judges, with competition sanctioned by the International Ski Federation (FIS). To enable the athletes (who are known as \\"ski jumpers\\") to effectively glide such long distances and land safely, the skis they use are considerably wider and longer than their cross-country and alpine skiing counterparts. Ski jumping is predominantly a winter sport and has been part of the Winter Olympic Games since its inception in 1924 for men and since 2014 for women. Since 1954 it is possible to ski jump in summer on artificial surfaces made from plastic. Along with cross-country skiing, ski jumping is one of two sports which form the Nordic combined discipline. Holmenkollbakken in Oslo is the holy place of this sport, which is most popular in Austria, Germany, Finland, Japan, Norway, Poland and Slovenia.

The new Defense Department narrative released by the White House, and read at a White House news briefing on Tuesday, said that one of Bin Laden’s wives was shot in the leg as she charged members of the commando team on the third floor of the compound. “In the room with Bin Laden, a woman – Bin Laden’s wife – rushed the U.S. assaulter and was shot in the leg but not killed,” the brief statement said. “Bin Laden was then shot and killed. He was not armed.” The narrative was released as tensions escalated between the U.S. and Pakistan, with Pakistani officials accusing the U.S. of “an unauthorized unilateral action” in its territory that would not be tolerated again, and a U.S. envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan, Marc Grossman, telling Pakistani officials that patience was wearing thin with them in Congress. In releasing the new narrative of the raid, Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, tried to correct statements by administration officials who had suggested that Bin Laden was armed during the attack. Under questioning, Mr. Carney said that the White House stood by its claim on Monday that Bin Laden had resisted capture, but said that “resistance does not require a firearm.” Mr. Carney said that the new narrative was the result of “fresh” information. “I want to make clear that this is, again, information that is fresh and, you know, we will continue to gather and provide to you details as we get them and we’re able to release them,” Mr. Carney said. “The resistance was throughout, as I said.” On Monday, John O. Brennan, the top counterterrorism adviser to President Obama, said he believed that Bin Laden’s wife had been killed while trying to shield the terror leader during the 40-minute raid. But the narrative released Tuesday by Mr. Carney suggested that the woman who died in the raid was part of another family living at the compound. The narrative says that woman was shot and killed on the first floor, not the third floor, where Bin Laden was found and killed. “On the first floor of Bin Laden’s building, two Al Qaeda couriers were killed along with a woman who was killed in cross-fire,” Mr. Carney said. “Bin Laden and his family were found on the second and third floor of the building. There was concern that Bin Laden would oppose the capture operation, and indeed he resisted.” Neither the Defense Department narrative nor Mr. Carney made any mention of the woman who was killed having been used as a “human shield” during the firefight, as previously described. Administration officials also changed their description of how much information Mr. Obama and other senior officials in the White House had in Washington as the operation was unfolding in Pakistan. On Monday, Mr. Brennan repeatedly said that he and others in the Situation Room were monitoring the situation “in real time.” Mr. Brennan would not say on Monday whether the officials could see or hear the operation. “We were able to monitor the situation in real time and were able to have regular updates and to ensure that we had real-time visibility into the progress of the operation,” Mr. Brennan told reporters on Monday. But on Tuesday, Leon E. Panetta, the director of the Central Intelligence Agency, said in an interview on the “Newshour” on PBS that “once those teams went into the compound, I can tell you there was a time period of almost 20 to 25 minutes where we really didn’t know just exactly what was going on, and there were some very tense moments as we were waiting for information.” “But finally,” Mr. Panetta said, “Admiral McRaven came back and said that he had picked up the word ‘Geronimo,’ which was the code word that represented that they got Bin Laden.”","response":"\\"Correcting the Official Account: Bin Laden Unarmed and Wife Not Killed in Raid\\""},{"question":"Es ist mir nicht plausibel.

The instant pot, a versatile and time-saving kitchen appliance, has gained immense popularity in recent years, thanks to its ability to cook a wide variety of dishes in a fraction of the time it would take using traditional cooking methods. Alice, like many others, was initially hesitant to incorporate this device into her kitchen routine, but once she did, she found herself surprised by the impressive results it yielded. As Alice placed her ingredients into the instant pot, the magic began to happen. The appliance works by creating a sealed environment and using pressure to raise the boiling point of water, thereby cooking the food at higher temperatures and in much less time. This method of cooking doesn't only benefit from speed; it also allows the flavors of the ingredients to better penetrate each other and create a depth of taste that might not be achieved in regular stovetop or slow cooker recipes. The efficiency of the instant pot not only surprised Alice but also opened up a world of new culinary possibilities for her.

If the student council sells the erasers for 0.75 each, how much money will they make? What is the step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the answer: 864?","response":"To arrive at the answer, we follow a step-by-step reasoning process as shown below: Step 1: Determine the total number of erasers. We are given that there are 48 boxes of erasers and 24 erasers in each box. To find the total number of erasers, we multiply the number of boxes (48) by the number of erasers per box (24). Total number of erasers = 48 boxes * 24 erasers per box = 1,152 erasers Step 2: Calculate the total revenue generated by selling all erasers. The student council sells each eraser for 0.75. To find the total revenue, we multiply the total number of erasers (1,152) by the selling price per eraser (0.75). Total revenue = 1,152 erasers * 0.75 per eraser = 864 Hence, the student council will make 864 by selling all the scented erasers."},{"question":"Michael Mike Caputo (born September 18 1957) is a Democratic member of the West Virginia House of Delegates representing the 43rd District since 1996.

Just after he bought the house with his ill gotten gains from his band's over-hyped, over-marketed, and over-bought sophomore Disc, he drove me out to see it in his beautiful but nauseating '70 Datsun 240 Z. All the smog combined with the pinball effects of winding up the hill at teeth-numbing speeds had me puking for an hour after we got there. I took the last turn at the top of the hill and watched the rising sun crest over the black blocks of the city, her angel wings soiled and cheapened with the soot of 12 million get-away drivers. Rick's house came into view out of the fog, its large glass panes sparkling like the last clean surface of an oversized ashtray. I parked between a blue hatchback and Rick's favorite toy: a 350 horsepower Impreza he had smuggled here from Japan.

You need to output the first i elements of A, starting with the 1st element in A. i will always have a value less than the length of A Problem:4, ['5749', 'Q', 'W', 'Q', '645', '6993', 'Z', '9929'] Solution:","response":"To solve this problem, we first understand the definition that we need to output the first 'i' elements of A, where 'i' is an integer and 'A' is a list. In this case, i = 4 and A = ['5749', 'Q', 'W', 'Q', '645', '6993', 'Z', '9929']. Following the definition, we need to output the first 4 elements of A, starting with the 1st element. Therefore, we use slicing to extract the first 4 elements of the list A. List slicing allows us to extract specific portions of a list by specifying the start and end indices. In Python, list slicing is done using the following syntax: list_name[start:end]. So in our case, we slice the list A to get the first 4 elements as follows: A[0:4] Applying the slicing, we get A[0:4] = ['5749', 'Q', 'W', 'Q'] The output is the first 4 elements of the list A: ['5749', 'Q', 'W', 'Q']"},{"question":"Question: Both gross and tragic. The 1980 Bank Robbery in Central Nyack that was medically managed at the Nyack Hospital where I responded to the ONLY Code 66 of my career. That “66”indicated for us an external disaster about to unload in our emergency room. The two policemen who were mortally injured and died on our stretchers were personal friends and one the boyfriend of one of the nurses. Their injuries were from machine guns where the flesh is riddled with explosive elements as opposed to a gunshot wounds where there is both an entry and exit site. In our Trauma and Triage Course we never learned about machine gun injuries. Additionally there were the criminals who were also injured and of course we needed to treat them as any other patient regardless of their behavior. The friends of the injured policemen were trying to get to these villains and it was just the most awful evening of my life. To this day I remember feeling nauseous in a way I had never felt before. We had debriefing sessions for weeks and of course were very upset for months. The wounds we had to address, the insertion of chest tubes and everything else all in such a rapid manner was indeed a more than gross situation. There was even open heart massage. Private doctors reported to help; many are not trained or current in emergency medicine; much is left to critical care nurses in a community hospital that is not a teaching institution with residents and interns on staff. Recently one of the women involved in this crime came up for parole. Of course there was great opposition from the community relative to her release. She was young and that was 38 years ago. I believe people deserve a second chance, but of course this is a very controversial matter. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

According to the China National Space Administration, the development of the system would be carried out in three steps:\\" Answer: The answer to this question is:","response":"Chen Fangyun is a prominent Chinese scientist, engineer, and one of the pioneers in the Chinese satellite navigation system. With his remarkable vision, technical expertise, and leadership, Chen Fangyun played a crucial role in the conception and development of the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS), which has put China on the global stage in satellite navigation technology. During the 1980s, China recognized the growing importance of satellite navigation technology for both military and civilian applications. Relying on foreign systems such as GPS (United States) or GLONASS (Russia) raised concerns about national security and technological independence. To address these concerns, Chen Fangyun and his colleagues, leveraging their extensive knowledge in satellite systems and related fields, proposed the development of a homegrown Chinese satellite navigation system. Chen's plan was ambitious and consisted of a three-step development strategy to ensure the success of this monumental project. The China National Space Administration adopted this strategy, highlighting the importance of Chen Fangyun's contribution to the country's navigation satellite technology. Step 1: Experimental Satellite System In the first phase, a two-satellite experimental system was created, which laid the foundation for the subsequent development of a comprehensive and operational satellite navigation system. By successfully launching two experimental satellites in 2000 and 2003, China demonstrated its capability to develop and deploy its own satellite navigation system. Step 2: Regional Satellite Navigation System The second phase focused on developing and deploying a regional satellite navigation system. This system would provide navigation, positioning, and timing services for the Chinese territory and the surrounding areas. Between 2009 and 2012, China successfully launched 10 more satellites, gradually extending the coverage of the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System to the Asia-Pacific region. Step 3: Global Satellite Navigation System In the final phase, China aimed to expand the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System into a global network, offering seamless, worldwide navigation services. With the help of additional satellites, the system extended its coverage to other continents, ultimately resulting in a complete global constellation of BeiDou satellites. This ambitious goal was achieved in 2020, with the successful launch of the last BDS-3 satellite into orbit. Chen Fangyun's foresight and dedication to the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System have been instrumental in its conception, development, and successful deployment. Under his guidance, China successfully transitioned from relying on foreign satellite navigation systems to becoming a major player in the field. Today, the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System is one of the four major satellite navigation systems globally, alongside GPS (United States), GLONASS (Russia), and Galileo (European Union). This achievement is a testament to Chen Fangyun's outstanding engineering and leadership skills and his unquestionable legacy in the field of satellite navigation technology."},{"question":"Information: - The Office of the First Minister was a portfolio within the Scottish Government .

Could you help me answer this question? If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\". Plot title: The Great Raid Movie plot: In 1944, American forces were closing in on the Japanese-occupied Philippines. The Japanese held around 500 American prisoners who had survived the Bataan Death March in a notorious POW camp at Cabanatuan and subjected them to brutal treatment and summary execution, as the Japanese view surrender as a disgrace. Many prisoners were also stricken with malaria. The film opens with the massacre of prisoners of war on Palawan by the Kempeitai, the Imperial Japanese military's secret police (though factually, it was committed by the Japanese Fourteenth Area Army). Meanwhile, at Lingayen Gulf, the 6th Ranger Battalion under Lt. Col Mucci is ordered by Lt. Gen. Walter Krueger to liberate all of the POWs at Cabanatuan prison camp before they are killed by the Japanese. The film chronicles the efforts of the Rangers, Alamo Scouts from the 6th Army and Filipino guerrillas as they undertake the Raid at Cabanatuan. Throughout the film, the viewpoint switches between the POWs at Cabanatuan, the Rangers, the Filipino resistance and the Japanese. In particular, the film covers the resistance work undertaken by nurse Margaret Utinsky, who smuggled medicine into the POW camps. The Kempeitai arrested her and sent her to Fort Santiago prison. She was eventually released, but spent six weeks recovering from gangrene as a result of injuries sustained from beatings. My question: Where was Margaret sent after her arrest?

At Birmingham, Oliphant's team had reached a different conclusion. Oliphant had delegated the task to two German refugee scientists, Rudolf Peierls and Otto Frisch, who could not work on Oliphant's radar project because they were enemy aliens and therefore lacked the necessary security clearance. Francis Perrin had calculated the critical mass of uranium to be about 40 tonnes (39 long tons; 44 short tons). He reckoned that if a neutron reflector were placed around it, this might be reduced to 12 tonnes (12 long tons; 13 short tons). Peierls attempted to simplify the problem by using the fast neutrons produced by fission, thus omitting consideration of moderator. He too calculated the critical mass of a sphere of uranium in a theoretical paper written in 1939 to be \\"of the order of tons\\".Peierls knew the importance of the size of the critical mass that would allow a chain reaction to take place and its practical significance. In the interior of a critical mass sphere, neutrons are spontaneously produced by the fissionable material. A very small portion of these neutrons are colliding with other nuclei, while a larger portion of the neutrons are escaping through the surface of the sphere. Peierls calculated the equilibrium of the system, where the number of neutrons being produced equalled the number escaping.Niels Bohr had theorised that the rare uranium-235 isotope, which makes up only about 0.7% of natural uranium, was primarily responsible for fission with fast neutrons, although this was not yet universally accepted. Frisch and Peierls were thus able to revise their initial estimate of critical mass needed for nuclear fission in uranium to be substantially less than previously assumed. They estimated a metallic sphere of uranium-235 with a radius of 2.1 centimetres (0.83 in) could suffice. This amount represented approximately 1 kilogram (2.2 lb) of uranium-235. These results led to the Frisch–Peierls memorandum, which was the initial step in the development of the nuclear arms programme in Britain. This...

High speed cameras allow researchers to see things that they would normally miss, from the beating wings of a hummingbird to how a boat cuts through water. Now researchers in Japan have developed what they believe is the world’s fastest camera, which can take 4.4 trillion images a second. The device uses a new technique to take high-speed images so it can capture chemical reactions and heat conduction, which were impossible to photograph before. Researchers in Japan have developed what they believe is the world’s fastest camera, which can take 4.4 trillion images a second. The large machine contains a pulse source, temporal and spatial mapping devices and an image sensor (illustrated) to take high resolution photographs at the rate of 4.4 trillion frames a second. The new camera uses a technique called motion-based femtophotography to capture movement. It visually maps the movement of an object over time in a ‘burst stream’ of timed photographs organised in the correct sequence, to show an object’s ‘time varying spatial profile’. The device claims to be 1,000 times faster than the previous ‘fastest’ camera, while still being able to produce high resolution images. The previous fastest cameras used a ‘pump-probe process’ where light is pumped at the object being photographed and then ‘probed’ for absorption by a laser, in order to collect vital data used to construct an image. Up until now, the fastest cameras used a ‘pump-probe process’, where light is pumped at the object being photographed and then probed for absorption by a laser, in order to collect vital data used to construct an image, Phys.org reported. But this technique relies on repetitive measurements to construct an image. Instead, the new camera uses a technique called motion-based femtophotography to capture movement. The camera visually maps the movement of an object over time in a ‘burst stream’ of timed photographs organised in the correct sequence, to show an object’s ‘time varying spatial profile,’ according to the journal Nature Photonics. It was developed by scientists at the University of Tokyo and Keio University in Japan. The new camera will make it possible for scientists to capture chemical reactions and heat conduction that occurs at a sixth of the speed of light. One day it could also be used in medicine and to gain new insights into the manufacturing of computer chips (pictured) including their tiny semiconductors. The device claims to be 1,000 times faster than the previous ‘fastest’ camera. It has high pixel resolution of 450 x 450 pixels to provide scientists with a lot of detail about the object they are photographing. The new camera is called Sequentially Timed All-optical Mapping Photography (Stamp) and will be used to capture chemical reactions and heat conduction that occurs at a sixth of the speed of light. It has taken three years to develop and the next step is make the device smaller, as it measures around three square feet (one square metre). The experts who developed the machine believe it could one day be used in medicine and to gain new insights into the manufacturing of semiconductors, for example. The computer chip components are tiny and by looking at detailed images of the manufacturing process, experts might be able to spot opportunities to make efficiencies. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","response":"Researchers in Japan have created a super fast camera that can take 4.4 trillion pictures in just one second! This amazing camera is a thousand times faster than the previous fastest camera. It can help scientists see things that happen really, really quickly, like chemical reactions and heat conduction. Right now, the camera is very large, but the scientists want to make it smaller in the future.

A dark-haired woman (Harring) escapes her own murder, surviving a car accident on Mulholland Drive. Injured and in shock, she descends into Los Angeles and sneaks into an apartment that an older, red-headed woman has just vacated. An aspiring actress named Betty Elms (Watts) arrives at the same apartment and finds the dark-haired woman confused, not knowing her own name. The dark-haired woman assumes the name \\"Rita\\" after seeing a poster for the film Gilda (1946), starring Rita Hayworth. To help Rita remember her identity, Betty looks in Rita's purse, where she finds a large amount of money and an unusual blue key. In what seems to be a scene from a different narrative, set at a diner called Winkies, a man (Patrick Fischler) tells his companion (Michael Cooke) about a nightmare in which he dreamt there was a horrible figure behind the diner. When they investigate, the figure appears, causing the man with the nightmare to collapse in fright. As the principal narrative resumes, Hollywood director Adam Kesher (Justin Theroux) has his film commandeered by apparent mobsters, who insist he cast an unknown actress named Camilla Rhodes (Melissa George) as the lead in his film. After he resists, he returns home to find his wife having an affair and is thrown out of his house. He later learns that his bank has closed his line of credit and he is broke. He agrees to meet a mysterious figure called The Cowboy, who urges him to cast Camilla Rhodes for his own good.

Hypothesis: Vacationers enjoy a day at the beach. .Can we conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true?","response":"If the premise is true, we know that there is a line of people carrying luggage on the side of the road; however, we cannot directly conclude that the hypothesis is true from this premise alone. The hypothesis suggests that these vacationers are enjoying a day at the beach. There are several factors to consider and additional information needed before making such a conclusion. 1. Location: The first thing to consider is the location of this line of people. Are they close to a beach, or are they in an area where access to a beach is not feasible? Knowing their location would provide more context to accurately determine if they are indeed heading to the beach. 2. Type of luggage: Analyzing the type of luggage being carried by the people can offer some clues as to the nature of their destination. If the luggage mainly consists of beach-related items such as beach umbrellas, towels, swimming suits, and sunscreen, it might be more likely that they are indeed going to the beach. Conversely, if the luggage predominantly contains non-beach related items, then the hypothesis may not hold true. 3. Season and weather: Considering the time of year and the current weather conditions can also help inform the hypothesis. If it is the summer season and the weather is warm and sunny, it might be more likely that people would head to the beach for leisure. However, if it is a cold and rainy day, it seems less plausible for vacationers to be enjoying a day at the beach. 4. Alternative explanations: Beyond assessing the location, luggage type, and weather conditions, it is essential to consider other possible explanations for the line of people carrying luggage on the side of the road. They could be waiting for a bus, a taxi, or some form of transportation for a different destination altogether. Alternatively, they could be a part of a guided tour or participating in an organized outdoor event, which requires them to carry luggage. 5. Further investigation: To obtain a more substantiated conclusion, it would be helpful to gather more data through direct observation or questioning the individuals in the line. This could reveal insights about their planned activities for the day or their intended destination, further solidifying or refuting the hypothesis. In conclusion, we cannot confirm the hypothesis \\"Vacationers enjoy a day at the beach\\" based solely on the premise \\"A line of people carrying luggage on the side of the road.\\" While the premise might provide some hints about the situation, it does not offer complete certainty. We need more contextual information and possibly direct observation or interaction with the subjects to determine whether the hypothesis holds true."},{"question":"Q: Joe was a weasel, but he wasn't the sort who you kept was a pet. He was the sort that used complex words that carried multiple different meanings. Where might you find Joe Options: - chicken coop - law firm - classroom - terrarium - museum A: law firm Explain how we arrive at this answer:","response":"We can arrive at the answer \\"law firm\\" by analyzing each option and considering the clues given in the question. 1. Joe was a weasel: The term \\"weasel\\" can be used figuratively to describe a person who is cunning, sly, or deceiving. This doesn't necessarily mean that Joe is an actual weasel (the animal), but rather that his behavior is similar to that of one. 2. Not the sort who you kept as a pet: This confirms that the question is not referring to an actual weasel (the animal), as they are sometimes kept as pets. 3. Uses complex words that carried multiple different meanings: This gives us an idea of Joe's occupation or environment. A place where people use complex words with different meanings is often a professional setting with emphasis on language and communication. Now let's evaluate the options. - Chicken coop: This option does not fit any of the criteria mentioned above. It is a place for housing chickens, not a person with cunning behavior or complex language skills. - Law firm: This option fits all the criteria. Lawyers and other legal professionals are often known for their cunning behavior and using complex, multi-layered language, which is necessary for dealing with legal issues, negotiations, and drafting contracts. - Classroom: While complex language might be used in a classroom, it is not a place specifically known for cunning behavior, so this does not fit all the criteria. - Terrarium: This is a place for keeping reptiles or small animals, which again does not fit the criteria given in the question. - Museum: Although a museum can be a place of learning and may involve complex concepts, it is not commonly associated with cunning behavior or the use of complex language in the same way as a law firm.

People there easily have heart trouble and other kinds of health problems during this month. In the Northeast and the Middle West, it is hot at some times and very cold at other times. People in those states will have heart trouble after the weather changes in February or March. The weather can also influence intelligence. For example, in a 1983 study by scientists, the IQ scores of some college students were very high during storm, but after the storm, their scores were low. Storms can increase intelligence. Very hot weather, on the other hand, can decrease it. Students in many schools of the United States often do badly in exams in the hot months of the year(July and August).

If your arrhythmia doesn’t respond to medication, the medications produce too many side effects, or your doctor determines that you’re at risk for serious complications that require more than medication, then they will discuss your options. Which option is right for you will depend on your medical history and type of arrhythmia. If none of the anti-arrhythmic medications have effectively controlled your arrhythmia, then you may be a candidate for electrical cardioversion. Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter are the most common forms of arrhythmia that respond to electrical cardioversion. The procedure involves delivering a small electrical signal to your heart to stabilize the rhythm. An electrophysiologist can use catheter ablation to correct a variety of arrhythmias, including AFib, atrial flutter, and ventricular tachycardia, which is potentially life threatening. For this procedure, your doctor will insert a small catheter into your heart and deliver high-frequency currents to the tissue causing the arrhythmia. This essentially “disconnects” the faulty pathway, resulting in a normal heartbeat. Because this procedure is more invasive than electrical cardioversion, your doctor may try the latter option first, followed by ablation if necessary. This is a short procedure (two to four hours), and you can typically resume normal activities within a few days with a low risk of any complication. If your arrhythmia causes your heart to beat too slowly, then your doctor will likely discuss the option of a pacemaker. Unfortunately, no medications are available to treat a slow heart rate (bradycardia). A pacemaker includes a very small set of wires that measure the electrical activity in your heart. They connect to a small pulse generator that delivers a signal to normalize your heart’s rate whenever it detects an abnormality. Though it sounds very invasive, the procedure is considered very safe and requires only one night in a hospital while the team monitors your heart rate and rhythm to ensure proper functioning of the device. Because of their ability to interfere with your pacemaker, you should avoid strong magnetic fields and power-generating equipment (getting an MRI or using arc welding equipment, for instance). You should also avoid storing an electronic device such as your cell phone in your chest pocket next to your pacemaker. An ICD is similar to a pacemaker (leads inserted into the heart connected to a pulse generator), but they are used to treat a wider range of arrhythmias, especially ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, both of which can be life threatening. Before you consider an ICD, your arrhythmia must be life-threatening and originate from an uncorrectable cause such as: acute myocardial infarction (heart attack), myocardial ischemia (inadequate blood flow to the heart muscle), or electrolyte imbalance and drug toxicity. If you choose an ICD, you can maintain a normal lifestyle, including taking part in sports and exercise. Your ICD may need to get checked several times a year, although their batteries last between five and seven years. To help protect the ICD’s pulse generator, you will need to avoid large magnetic fields and energy-generating equipment (such as MRIs and arc welding equipment, for example). You should also avoid placing your cell phone or headphones within six inches of the device. If nothing else has controlled your atrial fibrillation, then your doctor may discuss the option of a heart Maze procedure, which can be minimally invasive cardiac surgery or is an open heart surgery. In the surgery, the doctor creates small cuts that are stitched together and scar tissue forms, which interferes with abnormal impulses.","response":"Your doctor will first attempt to control your arrhythmia using medications before considering invasive therapy or inserting a rhythm-stabilizing device. If medications don't work or cause side effects, options like electrical cardioversion, catheter ablation, pacemaker, ICD, or heart Maze procedure may be considered depending on your medical history and type of arrhythmia. Electrical cardioversion involves using a small electrical signal to stabilize the heart rhythm, while catheter ablation disconnects the faulty pathway causing the arrhythmia. Pacemakers and ICDs involve inserting wires into the heart and using a pulse generator to normalize the heart rate, with ICDs being used for more severe cases. Heart Maze procedures involve small cuts creating scar tissue to interfere with abnormal impulses. Precautions with pacemakers and ICDs include avoiding strong magnetic fields and keeping electronic devices away from them."},{"question":"Premise: (Financial Accounting Standards Board, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. Hypothesis: Standards for financial accounting Does the premise entail the hypothesis?

Context: What are the worst examples of false advertising you've seen? Did you fall prey to their claims? Rather that vouch for myself - my story is trite, and not particularly interesting - I'll relay the tale one of my nurses shared with me when I was laid up in the hospital for a few weeks. Call her R. R was from an Eastern European country. We chit-chatted a lot, while she was taking my blood pressure readings and stuff. Lots of fun stories! But she relayed to me one of her first U.S. memories: She wanted to lose weight. She was impressed by some things the U.S. had to offer - \\"you have actual nutritional information on everything!\\" - and thus figured everything she encountered was on the level. And she found a \\"miracle cure\\" company who was along those lines! \\"These are AWESOME miracle shoe inserts! Wear them, and the pounds will melt away!\\" She saved her pennies and dimes; she sprung for the inserts. She received them... and they were shoe inserts; that much was true. But then there was their documentation: \\"using these insoles, combined with a 1200 calorie-per-day diet....\\" Like a 1200-calorie diet won't likely involve weight-loss, no matter what else you did, shoe inserts aside. The inserts did nothing, obviously. It was a sham. At which point she knew she was snookered, but really had no recourse. She wasn't explicit about it, but I got the feeling that it was a leading factor towards her chosen profession. \\"I might not have been the most sage medical person ever, but I'm gonna rectify that, and if ever I hear someone falling for that sort of gambit again, I'll be there to nip those sentiments in the bud with my own anecdotes.\\" Which is awesome. I still feel for her. I wish I had contact information, so I could touch base, and express those thoughts personally.

Answer: Answer:","response":"It is probably true that R was initially naive about false advertising and believed in the claims made by the \\"miracle cure\\" company.

Only the US government constitutionally has power to make treaties with the Native American nations. The lands consisted of Grand Island and several smaller islands in the Niagara River. In November 1993, the Tonawanda Band of Seneca Indians moved to join the claim as a plaintiff; it was granted standing as a plaintiff. In 1998, the United States intervened in the lawsuits on behalf of the plaintiffs in the claim. This was to allow the claim to proceed against New York; the state had asserted that it was immune from suit under the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution. After extensive negotiations and pre-trial procedures, all parties to the claim moved for judgment as a matter of law. By decision and order dated June 21, 2002, the trial court held that the Seneca ceded the subject lands to Great Britain in the 1764 treaties of peace after the French and Indian War (Seven Years' War). Thus the disputed lands were no longer owned by the Seneca at the time of the 1794 Treaty of Canandaigua. The court found that the state of New York's \\"purchase\\" of the lands from the Seneca in 1815 was intended to avoid conflict with them, but the state already owned it by virtue of Great Britain's defeat in the Revolution and cession of its lands to the United States (and by default to the states in which the colonial lands were located.

We are now embroiled in a full-scale standoff with Russia not seen since the Cold war. Some are beginning to question our involvement. Why should we care about a bankrupt nation thousands of miles away with a trouble ridden history? Don’t we have our own problems? One particularly confused analyst at a big consulting firm even suggested that Ukraine’s demographics doom it to economic decline and that we should leave it to the Russians. Some of these sentiments the result of Putin’s relentless propaganda campaign, which has been so egregious that a news anchor for the Kremlin-backed channel Russia Today resigned in protest. Others are “armchair realists”, with little understanding of the history, politics and economics of the region. Yet anyone with any knowledge and experience in Eastern Europe would see that these arguments are deeply flawed and, in fact, irresponsible. We and our allies have real and important stakes in Ukraine and the recent Russian actions there should be met with vigorous and sustained action to impose serious costs on Putin and his regime. First, the Russian incursion in Crimea is not only deeply destabilizing, but the continuation of a pattern of behavior that must be stopped in its tracks. First came the wars in Chechnya and the Russian backed separatist movement in Transnistria. More recently, Russia invaded the Georgian Republic. Each time Putin has acted under the guise of protecting his people. As Hillary Clinton and others have pointed out, this is the same rationale Hitler used to justify his own incursion into the Sudetenland. To understand just how bankrupt Putin’s logic is, you don’t have to take the word of western governments, you can look to the few allies Russia has left. Kazakhstan issued a statement critical of Russian actions and so has Armenia. Even China has doesn’t support Russia’s invasion. The reason that Putin’s allies don’t support him is that they understand how destabilizing Putin’s actions—and his logic—are. Many countries have sizeable Russian minorities that date back to Stalin’s mass relocations. If he can do it in Ukraine, he can do it anywhere, undermining the system of international law that we’ve built since World War II. Second, the argument that Ukraine is doomed to be a basket case is deeply flawed. It is, in fact, Russian interference that has stood in its way. After the Orange Revolution in 2004, Putin shut off the gas twice to impose his will. Yanukovych’s kleptocratic regime ruled with Russia’s backing and looted the country, greatly contributing to its present financial woes. What would Ukraine look like if it wasn’t under Putin’s yoke? You only have to look to Poland, the next door neighbor which also shares deep cultural, historical and economic ties with Ukraine to see its enormous potential. I lived in Poland during the late 90’s and many of the same arguments were hurled against it then that are being applied to Ukraine now. Poland was thought of as too corrupt and incapable of reform.” It had too many problems, lacked western values and on and on. Yet those who made those arguments have now been unmasked for the fools that they were. Poland is now a leading member of the EU, with the union’s 6th largest economy. In fact, as the only EU country not to fall into recession during the financial crises, it now plays a crucial role as an engine of growth. It’s a tremendous asset. Could Ukraine do the same? I think recent history clearly shows that it can. In the early 2000’s, the country was an economic juggernaut, one of the fastest growing economies in the world. It has a highly capable workforce, Elance ranks it third in the world for high skilled outsourcing. Ukraine has an enormous amount to offer. And while it’s true that Ukraine has enormous problems, they are far overblown. Daft analysis of its demographics confuse correlation and causality. When I ran a large business in Ukraine, I would lose some of my best young employees to emigration each and every month. Silicon Valley is full of Ukrainian transplants. Corruption as well is a very fixable problem. All of the EU expansion countries had similar issues, yet now have highly capable governance. We have successfully dealt with these challenges before and we will be even better equipped to solve them in Ukraine with the Poles, who bring their own experience, leading the way. Make no mistake. Putin will not stop in Crimea. He is already busing in his own citizens to Eastern Ukraine. As Time earlier reported, many of the so-called supporters at pro-Russian rallies are paid by the Kremlin. So its important that we understand the stakes in Ukraine and act accordingly. First, we should work with our European allies to strengthen economic sanctions, including visa bans, asset freezes and trade restrictions. Russia shouldn’t be allowed to enjoy the benefits of the same free societies it is actively working to undermine and destabilize. Second, we should build up military resources in the region. Secretary of Defense Hagel has already announced expanded military exercises in the region. This should lead to a further action in Poland, the Black Sea and the Baltics, including the insertion of advanced missile defense systems and other next generation equipment. Third, the US needs to accelerate plans to export liquid natural gas to Europe, taking away Putin’s ability to wreak havoc with gas politics and help Ukraine to develop its own substantial energy resources. We have crucial interests at stake in Ukraine. Putin, with his weakened economy and decrepit military, finds himself at the helm of a second rate power. It is only through jingoist adventures in his crusade for a “greater Russia” that he can appear strong at home. If unopposed, he will surely continue to destabilize Europe. Yet we can stop him. As the last week has shown, Russia is extremely vulnerable. Its markets tumbled last week even as US stocks rose to record highs. By continuing strong action against Russia, it will likely fall into recession and restrain Putin’s ability to cause further mischief. The choice is clear. We must stop Putin now. Update 1: CNN reports on the continued military agitation in Crimea and The New York Times gives a great overview of Russia’s economic weakness. Among other things, it says “Europe can replace this gas with liquefied natural gas, gas from Norway and shale gas. If the European Union sanctioned Russia’s gas supply to Europe, Russia would lose 100 billion or one-fifth of its export revenues, and the Russian economy would be in rampant crisis.” Update 2: US Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff stated that additional warships and aircraft were being sent to the region and refused to rule out US military involvement Ukraine Demo (Photo credit: blu-news.org) What are the most important parts of this news article?","response":"The most important parts of this news article are: 1.

The Admiral Clarey Bridge enabled the Navy to develop a 331 million Pacific tsunami warning center named after Senator Daniel Inouye, replacing the aging facility on ʻEwa Beach. The center's location is controversial because of its location in a tsunami-vulnerable area and the Navy's tsunami-evacuation plan calls for the island's only access point—the Admiral Clarey Bridge—to be opened for ship evacuation (making the bridge inaccessible to land vehicles). The island also continues to host a military brig.Nominally based in Alaska, the Sea-based X-band Radar (SBX-1) arrived on Ford Island in 2006 for maintenance and repairs and has returned several times since.

With all factors being equal, except exposure to modern civilization, our results showed that living in civilized societies has a significant negative effect on hearing; the severity is directly proportional to the years of exposure. The median hearing thresholds of natives always living on the island (men and women combined) was found to be similar to those of female citizens of the United States; there was no significant difference in hearing thresholds between men and women among these natives. These results suggest that there are no significant inherent racial differences nor significant inherent differences between males and females in the sensitivity of hearing. A relationship between aging and hearing was noted and interpreted as true or intrinsic presbycusis. There were no cases of otosclerosis, Meniere's disease, or exostoses of the external ear canal among natives who had always lived on the island. Pure natives were found not to be prone to otitis media in spite of having an extremely high incidence of severe upper respiratory tract allergies.

Question: What happened when there was a forced coupling of children? Context: The Greek kingdom of Bactria began as a breakaway satrapy of the Seleucid empire, which, because of the size of the empire, had significant freedom from central control. Between 255-246 BCE, the governor of Bactria, Sogdiana and Margiana (most of present-day Afghanistan), one Diodotus, took this process to its logical extreme and declared himself king. Diodotus II, son of Diodotus, was overthrown in about 230 BC by Euthydemus, possibly the satrap of Sogdiana, who then started his own dynasty. In c. 210 BC, the Greco-Bactrian kingdom was invaded by a resurgent Seleucid empire under Antiochus III. While victorious in the field, it seems Antiochus came to realise that there were advantages in the status quo (perhaps sensing that Bactria could not be governed from Syria), and married one of his daughters to Euthydemus's son, thus legitimising the Greco-Bactria dynasty. Soon afterwards the Greco-Bactrian kingdom seems to have expanded, possibly taking advantage of the defeat of the Parthian king Arsaces II by Antiochus. The answer is:","response":"The answer to the question \\"What happened when there was a forced coupling of children?\\" isn't clearly written in the context provided. There is mention of a marriage between Antiochus's daughter and Euthydemus's son but it doesn't specify whether this was forced. The consequence of this union was the legitimising of the Greco-Bactria dynasty."},{"question":"Q: In this task, you are given a question. You have to answer the question based on your information.

The first six rounds were played between 27 November and 14 December 2001, and the final match started on 16 January and ended on 23 January 2002. The Ukrainian Grandmaster Ruslan Ponomariov, aged 18, won the championship and became the youngest FIDE World Champion. - Taiwan, officially the Republic of China (ROC), is a state in East Asia. Neighbors include China (officially the People's Republic of China, abbreviated as PRC) to the west, Japan to the northeast, and the Philippines to the south. Taiwan is the most populous state that is not a member of the United Nations, and the one with the largest economy. - Hong Kong, officially the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China, is an autonomous territory on the Pearl River Delta of East Asia. Macau lies across the delta to the west, and the Chinese province of Guangdong borders the territory to the north. With a total land area of and a population of over 7.3 million of various nationalities, it ranks as the world's fourth most densely populated sovereign state or territory. - China, officially the People's Republic of China (PRC), is a unitary sovereign state in East Asia. With a population of over 1.381 billion, it is the world's most populous country. The state is governed by the Communist Party of China, and its capital is Beijing. It exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and two mostly self-governing special administrative regions (Hong Kong and Macau), and claims sovereignty over Taiwan. The country's major urban areas include Shanghai, Guangzhou, Beijing, Chongqing, Shenzhen, Tianjin and Hong Kong. China is a great power and a major regional power within Asia, and has been characterized as a potential superpower. - Guangdong (Simplified ) is a province on the South China Sea coast of the People's Republic of China. Formerly romanised as Canton or Kwangtung, Guangdong surpassed Henan and Sichuan to become the most populous province in China in January 2005, registering 79.1 million permanent residents and 31 million migrants who lived in the province for at least six months of the year; the total population was 104,303,132 in the 2010 census, accounting for 7.79 percent of Mainland China's population.

The population increase since the census has been modest, the province at 2014 end had 107,240,000 people. - Shenzhen is a major city in Guangdong Province, China. The city is located immediately north of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and holds sub-provincial administrative status, with powers slightly less than a province. - Singapore, officially the Republic of Singapore, and often referred to as the \\"Lion City\\" or the \\"Little Red Dot\\", is a sovereign city-state in Southeast Asia, and the world's only island city-state. It lies one degree (137 km) north of the equator, south of the southernmost tip of continental Asia and peninsular Malaysia, with Indonesia's Riau Islands to the south. Singapore's territory consists of a diamond-shaped main island along with 62 other islets. Since independence, extensive land reclamation has increased its total size by 23% (130 km), and its greening policy has covered the densely populated island with tropical flora, parks and gardens. - Guangzhou , traditionally romanised as Canton, is the capital and largest city of the Province of Guangdong in southeastern China. Located on the Pearl River about north-northwest of Hong Kong and north of Macau, Guangzhou was a major terminus of the maritime Silk Road and continues to serve as a major port and transportation hub. - Mainland China, also known as the Chinese mainland or simply the mainland, is the geopolitical area under the direct jurisdiction of the People's Republic of China (PRC). It generally excludes the Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and Macau; however, it usually includes Hainan. The term \\"mainland China\\", which avoids calling the area simply \\"China\\" and thereby recognizing the founding of the PRC as \\"the\\" \\"China\\", was coined by the Kuomintang (KMT) after receiving control of Taiwan from Japan after World War II. By 1949, the KMT-led Republic of China (ROC) government was defeated in the Chinese Civil War in mainland China and fled to the island of Taiwan where the KMT pledged to \\"retake the Mainland\\". The KMT considers both sides of the Taiwan Strait (including Taiwan), as (one) \\"China\\" and one country, whereas Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) considers only mainland China as \\"China\\" and Taiwan (ROC) as \\"Taiwan\\" and maintains that they are different countries. - Hou Yifan (born 27 February 1994, Xinghua, Jiangsu, China) is a Chinese chess grandmaster and former chess prodigy. She is the current Women's World Chess Champion, the youngest ever to win the title, as well as the youngest female player ever to qualify for the title of Grandmaster. - Romanization or Latinization (or romanisation, latinisation: see spelling differences), in linguistics, is the conversion of writing from a different writing system to the Roman (Latin) script, or a system for doing so. Methods of romanization include transliteration, for representing written text, and transcription, for representing the spoken word, and combinations of both. Transcription methods can be subdivided into \\"phonemic transcription\\", which records the phonemes or units of semantic meaning in speech, and more strict \\"phonetic transcription\\", which records speech sounds with precision. - Pinyin, or Hàny Pnyn, is the official romanization system for Standard Chinese in mainland China, Malaysia, Singapore, and Taiwan. It is often used to teach Standard Chinese, which is normally written using Chinese characters. The system includes four diacritics denoting tones. Pinyin without tone marks is used to spell Chinese names and words in languages written with the Latin alphabet, and also in certain computer input methods to enter Chinese characters. - Chongqing, formerly transliterated as Chungking, is a major city in Southwest China and one of the Five national central cities in China. Administratively, it is one of China's four direct-controlled municipalities (the other three are Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin), and the only such municipality in inland China. - Zhang Zhong (born 5 September 1978 in Chongqing) is a Chinese-born Singaporean chess grandmaster, a twice Chinese champion and the 2005 Asian champion. - A board game is a tabletop game that involves counters or moved or placed on a pre-marked surface or \\"board\\", according to a set of rules. Some games are based on pure strategy, but many contain an element of chance; and some are purely chance, with no element of skill. - An input method (or input method editor, commonly abbreviated IME) is an operating system component or program that allows any data, such as keyboard strokes or mouse movements, to be received as input. In this way users can enter characters and symbols not found on their input devices. Using an input method is obligatory for any language that has more graphemes than there are keys on the keyboard. - A chessboard is the type of checkerboard used in the classic board game chess, and consists of 64 squares (eight rows and eight columns) and 32 pieces. The squares are arranged in two alternating colors (light and dark). Wooden boards may use naturally light and dark brown woods, while plastic and vinyl boards often use brown or green for the dark squares and shades such as buff or cream for the light squares. Materials vary widely; while wooden boards are generally used in high-level games; vinyl, plastic, and cardboard are common for low-level and informal play. Decorative glass and marble boards are available but rarely accepted for games rated by national or international chess federations. Each square on the board has a name from a1 to h8. - Standard Chinese, also known as Modern Standard Mandarin or Standard Mandarin, also often referred to as Putonghua, Guoyu or simply Mandarin, is a standard language that is the sole official language of both China and Taiwan, and also one of the four official languages of Singapore. The pronunciation of the standard is based on the Beijing dialect, its vocabulary is drawn from Mandarin dialects, and the grammar is based on literature in the modern written vernacular. - The South China Sea is a marginal sea that is part of the Pacific Ocean, encompassing an area from the Karimata and Malacca Straits to the Strait of Taiwan of around . The area's importance largely results from one-third of the world's shipping sailing through its waters and that it is believed to hold huge oil and gas reserves beneath its seabed. - The classical Latin alphabet, also known as the Roman alphabet, is a writing system originally used by the ancient Romans to write the Latin language. The Latin alphabet evolved from the visually similar Cumaean Greek version of the Greek alphabet, which was itself descended from the Phoenician abjad, which in turn was derived from Egyptian hieroglyphics. The Etruscans who ruled early Rome adopted the Cumaean Greek alphabet which was modified over time to become the Etruscan alphabet, which was in turn adopted and further modified by the Romans to produce the Latin alphabet. - Yu Shaoteng ( Chinese : ; Pinyin : Yú Shoténg ; born March 26 , 1979 in Guangzhou , Guangdong ) is a Chinese chess Grandmaster , and is the personal trainer of chess prodigy Hou Yifan .

Try to make your responses similar to the given correct answer. To this end, try to keep both the length and the style as similar as possible between the correct and the incorrect answer. To make your incorrect answers more difficult, try to incorporate words from context. To avoid being predictable or repetitive, try to add more variations and complexity. Problem:Context: You ever wonder how something got its name ? Me too . As I was preparing to walk from the car to the store , I found a long - neglected umbrella under the seat and used it , as Tropical Storm Fay would ' ve soaked me through in the 15 second walk . And I start wondering why it 's called an umbrella , and then as the word is repeated in my head , it eventually sounds nonsensical , like any word you repeat over and over again . Question: Why did they have an umbrella under their seat ? Correct Answer: They had used it before while it was raining . Solution:","response":"Part #1: Craft one incorrect answer. Usage: They found the umbrella for protection from the sun. Explanation: This answer is incorrect because the context mentions using the umbrella during Tropical Storm Fay, which implies rain rather than sun protection. However, it still uses words from the context like \\"umbrella\\" and \\"protection.\\" Part #2: Use words from the context as much as possible, or similar words used in the correct answer. Usage: They discovered the umbrella to shield themselves from tropical weather. Explanation: This answer uses words from the context such as \\"umbrella,\\" \\"shield,\\" and \\"tropical weather,\\" which makes it seem relevant to the context. Part #3: Keep the length and style as similar as possible between the correct and the incorrect answer. Usage: They had the umbrella for shielding from dust storms. Explanation: Both the correct and this incorrect answer have the same number of words and a similar structure. This makes it harder to distinguish between the correct and incorrect answers based on length and style alone. Part #4: Incorporate words from context. Usage: They placed the umbrella there in case of future storms like Fay. Explanation: This answer incorporates the words \\"umbrella\\" and \\"storms\\" from the context and uses the specific example of Tropical Storm Fay, making it seem more connected to the context. Part #5: Add more variations and complexity. Usage: They had stored the umbrella after a previous unpredictable storm. Explanation: By adding the elements of the umbrella being stored and an unpredictable storm, this incorrect answer adds more variation and complexity to how the umbrella ended up under the seat."},{"question":"OPT: (A). You will take courses in math, english, and science. The honors classes you receive in high school will help to give you advanced course credit, which can also help you reach your english final. (B). The program allows high school students to take classes with college-level work in a high school setting. At the end of the year, you take a test given by the college board, and if you make a high enough score, you can receive high school credit. (C). Students attending high school will take courses that cover a wide variety of subjects. These courses will help your electives get more advanced and can make it easier to participate in extracurricular activities. (D). This program puts you on the hook for ap credits in large part because it enables you to complete multiple courses in one year. These courses can allow you to stay up-to-date on college credits.Choose from options above and answer: What most naturally follows? How to earn college credits in high school Sign up for ap courses. One way to get college credit in high school is to sign up for ap classes, which may overlap with dual enrollment classes. The advanced placement program (ap) is through the college board. Answer:","response":"Option B most naturally follows the given information. Earning college credits in high school allows students to pursue higher education at a more advanced level, save money on college tuition, and potentially graduate earlier. Taking advantage of Advanced Placement (AP) courses is an excellent way for high school students to achieve these goals. The AP program, as mentioned in Option B, enables high school students to take college-level courses within a high school setting. These courses not only challenge students academically but also prepare them for the rigor and expectations they will face once they enroll in a college or university. AP courses cover a wide range of subjects, such as Mathematics, English, Sciences, Social Studies, World Languages, and more. At the end of each AP course, students take a standardized exam administered by the College Board. Exams are scored on a scale of 1 to 5, with a score of 3 or higher often considered as \\"passing\\". Colleges and universities typically award college credit or advanced placement for scores of 3 or above, depending on their policies. This means that successful AP students can enter college with a significant number of credits already completed, giving them a head start on their higher education journey. In addition to AP courses, high school students may also consider dual enrollment programs to earn college credits. These programs allow students to enroll in college courses at local colleges or universities while still in high school. Upon successful completion of dual enrollment courses, students will receive both high school and college credits. Dual enrollment programs can offer an even broader range of subjects and levels than AP courses and can provide students with a more realistic college experience, as they will be attending classes on a college campus. To earn college credit in high school, students should work closely with their school counselors, teachers, and parents to identify the best courses and programs that align with their academic goals and interests. By taking advantage of these opportunities, students can gain a competitive edge as they prepare for their future in higher education and beyond."},{"question":"You can thaw the bananas for use at a later date.

You do not need to saturate the banana in lemon juice. Adding more lemon does not equal better preservation. Adding too much will make your banana taste sour. For sweeter alternatives, replace lemon juice with pineapple, orange, or apple juice. These are all acidic enough to slow the browning process without needing to be diluted. Apple juice is also mild enough to be nearly undetectable; opt for the other juices if you plan on later mixing the banana with other fruit. This also uses acidity to preserve the banana but uses vinegar instead of fruit juice. Using vinegar is a nice alternative if other fruit juices are distorting the taste too much. Simply add ¼ cup of vinegar for every cup of water. Dip the banana, sliced or whole, into the water for about three minutes. Avoid leaving bananas in the vinegar water solution for longer than three minutes. Submerging the banana can cause it to become too soft and can impart a strong vinegary taste, which is likely less appetizing than lemon or lime juice. If you don't have access to other fruits or vinegar, vitamin C can achieve a similar effect when dissolved in water. Crush a single vitamin C tablet with a spoon and sprinkle it in a glass of water. Stir the solution with a spoon and dip your bananas in the water for a few seconds. {\\"smallUrl\\":\\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/5/5a/Keep-Bananas-from-Ripening-Too-Fast-Step-9Bullet1-Version-2.jpg/v4-459px-Keep-Bananas-from-Ripening-Too-Fast-Step-9Bullet1-Version-2.jpg\\",\\"bigUrl\\":\\"/images/thumb/5/5a/Keep-Bananas-from-Ripening-Too-Fast-Step-9Bullet1-Version-2.jpg/aid3423340-v4-728px-Keep-Bananas-from-Ripening-Too-Fast-Step-9Bullet1-Version-2.jpg\\",\\"smallWidth\\":460,\\"smallHeight\\":306,\\"bigWidth\\":\\"728\\",\\"bigHeight\\":\\"485\\",\\"licensing\\":\\"<div class=\\"mw-parser-output\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\"nofollow\\" class=\\"external text\\" href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use\\">Fair Use</a> (screenshot)<br>n</p></div>\\"} Effervescent vitamin C tablets work especially well for this.

Everyone called it the Little Pink House. It was bordered by two streams, and just across the dirt lane of Willard Avenue sat a dairy farm. Not far to the south, the trolley from downtown Washington made its last stop at Friendship Heights, which in the 1940s was nothing more than a filling station and a Howard Johnson's at the intersection of Western and Wisconsin avenues on the District line. Today, the Little Pink House still stands, bordered by two soaring apartment buildings. Across Willard -- now a traffic-clogged four-lane road -- squats Geico's massive office complex. The Metro long ago replaced the trolley. Along Wisconsin, the nearly completed Chevy Chase Center boasts the region's most opulent shopping palazzo, home to the glittering facades of boutiques such as Christian Dior, Ralph Lauren, Barneys Co-op, Louis Vuitton and Jimmy Choo. People sometimes take notice of the Little Pink House, but few know why it still stands, or who its owner is, and how she ranks among the most important developers in the history of Washington. There she is now: a little old lady watering her roses this particular morning; or maybe, later in the day, waxing the grill of her white Rolls-Royce convertible. Her name is Thelma Edwards, but everyone calls her Tim. She is 89 years old. She has lived in Friendship Heights for nearly 60 years. And she is not so little, really, when you see her up close. A thin woman, 5 feet 8, with a dancer's stiff posture, she ties her shirts around her waist, matches coral lipstick to her metallic nails and prances around the house in slip-on mesh sneakers. Known in the soaring 1960s as Friendship Heights' \\"unofficial mayor,\\" she was the only woman in the multimillionaire developers' club of the day, a shrewd businesswoman who flew a Piper Cub to scout land for Lord & Taylor, argued for a Metrorail stop at Friendship Heights and brokered deals for Geico's headquarters and the very high-rises that now tower above her cozy 1,400-square-foot cottage. \\"Everyone thinks it's just a sweet old house,\\" Edwards says sharply, tapping a nail on the kitchen's black granite countertop, \\"but this one is the key to assembling the block.\\" In development terms, \\"assembling\\" means gathering together neighboring lots to create a large enough base for commercial property. But Edwards, who bought the cottage 40 years ago, is holding out. She doesn't need the money. This place, she says, is her sanctuary. The Little Pink House is the developer's last bastion against development. Entering 4607 Willard Ave. feels like stepping into a Florida beach house. Its snow-white wall-to-wall carpet retains the lush stripes of a recent vacuuming. Terra cotta angels preen atop a bamboo end table. On the table sits a hardcover copy of a children's classic: Virginia Lee Burton's picture book \\"The Little House,\\" subtitled on its cover, \\"Her-Story.\\" That story, as you may remember, is a parable of urban development. A strong and well-built pink house starts out life in the country, where she observes the passing of time: \\"the trucks and automobiles going back and forth to the city . . . Everyone and everything moved much faster now than before.\\" She ends up surrounded by a city, with all of its vexations, grime and noise. Generations later, the house is finally moved to a new place back in the country. Edwards bought the book, first published in 1942, because she has always enjoyed reading it to her nine grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren.

The U.S. military routinely offers no comment on reported attacks by drones, or unmanned aircraft. The United States is the only country operating in the region known to have the ability to launch missiles from remote-controlled aircraft. The strike happened in the village of Pasal Kot. That's in North Waziristan, part of Pakistan's volatile tribal region that is the site of previous drone strikes and clashes between the Pakistani military and Islamic militants. It comes a few days after Mehsud appeared in a video the Pakistani Taliban released. In it, he sits next to Humam Khalil Abu-Mulal al-Balawi, the man believed to be the suicide bomber who killed seven CIA employees and a Jordanian army captain at a base in eastern Afghanistan on December 30. The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for that attack. It was carried out out to avenge the death of Mehsud's predecessor, Baitullah Mehsud, who died in a suspected U.S. drone strike last year, according to al Qaeda's commander of operations in Afghanistan, Mustafa Abu Yazid. Baitullah Mehsud and Hakimullah Mehsud are from the same tribe, not from the same family. In the video, al-Balawi said, \\"We will never forget the blood of our leader Baitullah Mehsud, may God have mercy on his soul,\\" according to a CNN translation. \\"It will remain that we take revenge (for his death) in America and outside America. It is a trust on every person who left everything for the sake of God, whom Baitullah Mehsud supported.\\" At one point, the video shows the date of December 20, 2009. That is five days before Nigerian passenger Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab allegedly tried to blow up a Northwest Airlines flight to Detroit, Michigan. The Yemen-based group al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has claimed responsibility for the Christmas Day plot. It is impossible to know whether the date on the video is accurate, or whether al-Balawi was aware of AbdulMutallab's alleged plans. If al-Balawi did know about the plot, it could indicate a greater degree of communication between the Pakistani Taliban and al Qaeda than previously thought. Among the seven CIA employees who were killed in the December 30 attack were two members of the private security firm Xe, formerly known as Blackwater. The Jordanian military officer who was killed was Army Capt. Sharif Ali bin Zeid, a cousin of Jordan's King Abdullah II. It was one of the worst attacks ever on America's intelligence community. Jordanian and U.S. intelligence agencies apparently believed al-Balawi had been rehabilitated from his extremist views and were using him to hunt Ayman al-Zawahiri, al Qaeda's No. 2 figure, a former U.S. intelligence official said. Al-Balawi was a Jordanian doctor whom Jordanian authorities had recruited as a counterterrorism intelligence source, a Jordanian official told CNN. He said the video that his faith cannot be sold to bidders, an apparent message to Jordanian and U.S. officials that they had failed to win his allegiance. It puts into question how well the CIA and other intelligence agencies can penetrate al Qaeda. Journalist Nasir Dawar contributed to this report. Write highlights for this article.","response":"1.

As the words left Magrat's lips, the rusty iron helmet seemed to take on a life of its own. The once dull and lifeless wings sprouted feathers of vibrant greens and blues that shimmered and changed colors with every subtle movement. Magrat felt the energy within the helmet as though it whispered to her very soul, beckoning her towards a grand adventure. Trembling with excitement and disbelief, Magrat slowly lowered the helmet onto her head, feeling the undeniable connection between herself and the artifact. The whispers grew louder, filling her mind with visions of ages past, when heroes and heroines danced with the gods themselves, their laughter echoing through the vast halls of time. With the helmet securely on her head, Magrat knew that it was time to gather the woman's friends and celebrate the union of two hearts in the sacred ritual of marriage. She called upon the spirits of the neighboring lands, imploring them to join her in a grand procession, worthy of the love that was to be honored that day. From the misty mountains, the hearty laughter of dwarves reverberated, their steins overflowing with ale and their beards adorned with the most exquisite gems and precious metals. The elves gracefully emerged from the ancient forests, their nimble fingers plucking melodies from their harps that carried with them the melancholic beauty of autumn leaves and the joyful songs of birdsong. And from the rolling hills, the halflings brought forth a feast so decadent and bountiful that it would hearten even the most downtrodden of souls. Together, this fantastical procession of beings from kingdoms near and far arrived at the wedding celebration, their joy and camaraderie permeating the very air itself. And so, they danced under the endless canopy of stars, the music and laughter melding together into a symphony of love, friendship, and unity. As the sun began to rise, painting the sky with hues of rosy pinks and warm oranges, the ethereal glow of the magical helmet began to fade, much like the embers of a dying fire. Magrat knew that the time had come to return the helmet from whence it came. She carefully removed it from her head and, with a whispered word of gratitude, placed it back behind the great shield. The revelry continued for days after, the memory of the enchanted night forever etched in the hearts and minds of all those present. And though the rusty iron helmet with wings may have been returned to its hidden sanctuary, the spirit of unity and celebration that it brought forth lived on, a testament to the power of love and friendship that would continue to stand strong through every trial and tribulation the world faced. For whenever a golden love bloomed and the lady wished to play, they could still dance in the light of the moon, knowing that beyond the barrier of the shield, a rusted iron helmet with wings breathed life into their dreams, waiting for the next time that it might be called upon to weave its magic."},{"question":"Instructions: You are given a sentence in Galician.

Options: 1). semi truck 2). Tesla Model S 3). Ford Explorer 4). Toyota Tundra The answer is:","response":"The Tesla Model S would make less pollution among the given options. Here's a detailed analysis of each vehicle's environmental impact: 1). Semi-truck: Semi-trucks usually run on diesel fuel, which emits various pollutants, such as nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter (PM), and greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide (CO2). In addition, the large engines used in these trucks consume more fuel, leading to higher emissions. Therefore, semi-trucks contribute significantly to air pollution and have a considerable environmental impact. 2). Tesla Model S: The Tesla Model S is an electric vehicle powered by an electric motor, which uses electricity stored in rechargeable batteries. Since electric vehicles (EVs) do not have internal combustion engines, they do not emit tailpipe pollutants. Electricity, as stated in the fact, causes less pollution than gasoline. While the production of electricity may generate some pollution, its overall environmental impact is still lower than that of gasoline. Furthermore, as more renewable energy sources are used to produce electricity, the carbon footprint of EVs will keep decreasing. 3). Ford Explorer: The Ford Explorer is a gasoline-powered vehicle, which means it has an internal combustion engine with emissions including CO2, NOx, and other pollutants. Gasoline vehicles emit considerable greenhouse gases and pollutants that contribute to air pollution and climate change. Consequently, the Ford Explorer has a higher environmental impact when compared to electric vehicles like the Tesla Model S. 4). Toyota Tundra: The Toyota Tundra is a large pickup truck with an internal combustion engine powered by gasoline or, in some models, flex-fuel (a blend of gasoline and ethanol). Vehicles of this type usually have lower fuel efficiency, which means they consume more fuel and produce more emissions per mile than smaller, more efficient vehicles. As a result, the Toyota Tundra contributes a significant amount of pollution to the environment. In conclusion, the Tesla Model S would make less pollution among the given options due to its electric-powered motor, zero tailpipe emissions, and the fact that electricity causes less pollution than gasoline. The environmental impact of electric vehicles will continue to decrease as renewable energy sources become more prevalent in electricity production."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Athletics are very competitive these days at all levels, from school sports to the pros. Everybody is looking for that edge that will make them faster, stronger, more physically fit. One approach taken by many athletes is the use of amino acid supplements. The theory is that the increase in amino acids in the diet will lead to increased protein for muscles. However, the only real benefit comes to the people who make and sell the pills. Studies have not showed any advantage obtained by the athletes themselves. You’re much better off just maintaining a healthy diet. A big marathon is being held in Chicago this year, Many people from the area are going to participate and there is a cash prize of 10000 for the winner. A sporting goods store that specializes in amino acid supplements begins advertising more heavily during the time coming up to the race. Given most of the marathon participants are competitive athletes, will sales at the sporting goods store increase or decrease for amino acid supplements? Answer:","response":"It is highly likely that the sales of amino acid supplements at the sporting goods store will increase during the time leading up to the big marathon in Chicago, despite the lack of scientific evidence supporting the effectiveness of these supplements in enhancing athletic performance. The main reasons for this potential increase in sales are as follows: 1. Competitive athletes looking for an edge: As the marathon approaches, competitive athletes participating in the race would be actively seeking any possible way to gain an advantage over their competitors. The ongoing marketing and advertising efforts of the sporting goods store that specializes in amino acid supplements will likely convince these athletes that these supplements might provide them with the extra boost they need to potentially win the 10,000 cash prize. 2. Advertising and marketing influence: Advertising plays a significant role in shaping consumers' perceptions and influencing their purchasing decisions. When a store increases its advertising efforts, it increases the likelihood that its target audience – in this case, the competitive marathon participants – will become more aware of the products being sold and might consider purchasing them. 3. The placebo effect: Even though scientific studies may not have demonstrated any concrete benefits of amino acid supplements for athletes, the belief that these supplements can improve performance might still lead to a psychological \\"placebo effect.\\" This effect can make athletes feel more energetic, motivated, and confident, thinking that they are getting an advantage over their competitors. 4. Peer pressure and social proof: If athletes notice that their fellow competitors or training partners are using amino acid supplements, they might feel the need to keep up and take the supplements themselves. This social proof and peer pressure can contribute to an increase in sales during the time leading up to the marathon. 5. Desire for a quick fix: Athletes might be tempted by the idea of a shortcut to better performance, even if the scientific evidence is lacking. The marketing and advertising of amino acid supplements can capitalize on this desire for a quick fix, convincing athletes they need the product to succeed. In conclusion, the sales of amino acid supplements at the sporting goods store are likely to increase as the big marathon in Chicago approaches. This potential increase in sales can be attributed to a combination of factors, such as competitive athletes looking for an edge, the influence of advertising and marketing, the placebo effect, peer pressure, and the desire for a quick fix. As such, the store may well experience a surge in amino acid supplement sales during this period, even though the actual benefits of these supplements for athletes remain scientifically unproven."},{"question":"Write the following list of characters into a correctly formed sentence: SystemoperatingTAILSvulnerabletode-anonymizing–SeguInfo","response":"The TAILS operating system is designed to be secure, but it can still be vulnerable to de-anonymizing attacks, as demonstrated by the SeguInfo research team."},{"question":"Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question.

She had pain relief as and when needed to make her comfortable and that often results in people ultimately overdosing. Mum had Alzheimer's and was howling and writhing in agony so we were giving her pain relief but daughters knew it would probably result in her death - which they were right about possibly happening and in their grief and panic, started trying to prevent us from doing anything. Didn’t want us getting near her at all and we had to go through an awful scenario of trying to explain what we had to do for Mum and why and when they still wouldn’t have it or allow us near, we had to do what nobody wants and go against their wishes by administering the pain relief anyway. One daughter screamed the place down, threatened to have me arrested and struck off / said she would go to the papers and tell them about how we killed her Mum and in the end she had to be removed from the bedroom. Her Mum was given the pain relief, immediately relaxed and fell asleep then died peacefully in her sleep about 15 mins later.

Options: - carpark - hospital - building - garage - bus stop The answer is \\"bus stop\\" because Answer:","response":"The answer is \\"bus stop\\" because a bus stop is the appropriate location for someone without a car who needs to get somewhere. A bus stop is a designated place where buses stop to pick up and drop off passengers. This allows the person to use public transportation to travel to their desired destination without needing their own car. Other options mentioned are not suitable for this purpose: - Carpark: A carpark is a place where people park their cars, and since the person has no car, this option does not help them with transportation. - Hospital: A hospital is a location for medical care and treatment, and while one can potentially find transportation options there, it is not a primary transportation hub and does not serve all destinations. - Building: A building is a very generic term and could refer to any structure. It does not provide any specific solution for the person's transportation needs. - Garage: A garage is a place generally utilized for parking, repairing or servicing vehicles.

After independence the first Population and Housing Census was carried out in 1991, further rounds followed in 2001 and 2011. The data collection method is to count every person resident in Namibia on the census reference night, wherever they happen to be. This is called the de facto method. For enumeration purposes the country is demarcated into 4,042 enumeration areas. These areas do not overlap with constituency boundaries to get reliable data for election purposes as well. The enumeration areas in Namibia do not overlap with what in order to get reliable data?","response":"The enumeration areas in Namibia do not overlap with constituency boundaries in order to get reliable data. This is done to ensure the data collected is accurate and representative of the entire population within a specific region, without any biases or discrepancies. Constituency boundaries are defined by the political and administrative divisions of a country, and they may change over time due to various factors such as population growth, redistricting, or electoral reforms. On the other hand, enumeration areas are designed specifically for census purposes and should remain consistent throughout the data collection process to achieve statistical reliability and comparability. This separation allows for a clearer understanding of the demographic and socio-economic data gathered during the census. By not overlapping with constituency boundaries, enumeration areas can provide a more accurate and objective representation of the population. This in turn allows for effective planning and resource allocation by the government and other organizations, as well as providing a solid basis for future elections and political representation in the country. Additionally, by avoiding overlaps, the risk of double-counting or excluding residents from the census data is minimized. This ensures that every person residing in Namibia on the census reference night is accounted for, which is critical for the validity and accuracy of the collected data. In summary, the enumeration areas in Namibia do not overlap with constituency boundaries to maintain the integrity, accuracy, and reliability of the census data. This deliberate separation allows for precise population representation, informed decision-making in public policy, and fair political representation based on an accurate understanding of the population's size and distribution."},{"question":"Q: Which of the following two sentences does not make sense?

Now, let me pause here, when I say, “more work” did not mean more of the existing work they already did. “More work” did not mean work of what they already knew, or signed up for when they were hired. More work meant incorporating a completely different role. For me, I’m a programmer. And “management” decided they wanted programmers to also do BA work. Now, mind you, nowhere on my employment contract does it state I’d have to take a BA role. And nowhere on my employment contract did it state taking a BA role would also require me doing all of my programming work. So, after being pushed a few times to attend BA meetings, I got fed up. So I pulled my manager into a meeting and explained this to him. I said, you have two choices: I do two roles, BA and programmer, and I get a new salary to account for the role. When he asked how much, I said, take my salary and multiply by 1.6. Option 2, I go back to programming, and you never pull me into a meeting again on BA work. It’s not what you hired me for, and it’s not what you pay me for. When my boss replied, “Our company is not in the position to pay for two roles”, I told him, then it sounds like Option 2. And by the way, I don’t ever want to have this discussion again. If you want Superman performance, you cannot pay Clark Kent wages. 1 year passed and I was never bothered again about BA roles. Takeaways: Middle managers are one step above one-celled organisms. They can, and will try to get you to do non-role work, with no intention of ever paying you more.

To curb his influence, he was often sent out to deal with military affairs and rebellions far away from the capital. Yet his ideas penetrated mainstream Chinese thought and spurred new interest in Taoism and Buddhism. Furthermore, people began to question the validity of the social hierarchy and the idea that the scholar should be above the farmer. Wang Yangming's disciple and salt-mine worker Wang Gen gave lectures to commoners about pursuing education to improve their lives, while his follower He Xinyin (何心隱) challenged the elevation and emphasis of the family in Chinese society. His contemporary Li Zhi even taught that women were the intellectual equals of men and should be given a better education; both Li and He eventually died in prison, jailed on charges of spreading \\"dangerous ideas\\". Yet these \\"dangerous ideas\\" of educating women had long been embraced by some mothers and by courtesans who were as literate and skillful in calligraphy, painting, and poetry as their male guests.The liberal views of Wang Yangming were opposed by the Censorate and by the Donglin Academy, re-established in 1604. These conservatives wanted a revival of orthodox Confucian ethics. Conservatives such as Gu Xiancheng (1550–1612) argued against Wang's idea of innate moral knowledge, stating that this was simply a legitimization for unscrupulous behavior such as greedy pursuits and personal gain. These two strands of Confucian thought, hardened by Chinese scholars' notions of obligation towards their mentors, developed into pervasive factionalism among the ministers of state, who used any opportunity to impeach members of the other faction from court. answer the following question: What were the full names of the two people who died in prison? Answer:","response":"The full names of the two people who died in prison are Li Zhi (李贄) and He Xinyin (何心隱).

Question: suppose resting and sleeping happens, how will it affect lungs absorbs more oxygen. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect","response":"When a person is resting or sleeping, their body requires less energy, and hence, the demand for oxygen is reduced as compared to when they are active or exercising. This means that the overall rate of oxygen absorption by the lungs will be affected, but not the efficiency of the lungs to absorb oxygen. Step-by-step analysis of the resting and sleeping effects: 1. Resting and sleeping reduces the body's energy consumption. 2. Less energy consumption leads to a lower demand for oxygen. 3. With a lower demand for oxygen, the lungs absorb less oxygen overall, although their efficiency at absorbing oxygen remains the same. 4. The hemoglobin's transportation of oxygen remains unaffected, as it still binds to oxygen at the same rate. 5. Red blood cells, which contain hemoglobin, still transport oxygen efficiently to various parts of the body, as their function is not directly impacted by the person's activity level. 6. The heart still pumps blood throughout the body to deliver oxygen and nutrients as needed, but the overall volume of blood pumped may be reduced because of the lower oxygen demand.

He is best known for his style of harsh, confrontational noise exemplified on his 1996 release, Pulse Demon. Since 1980, he has released over 400 recordings, and has collaborated with various artists. During the European tour in September-October 1989, Merzbow could only bring simple and portable gear; this led to the harsh noise style Merzbow became known for in the 1990s. Cloud Cock OO Grand (1990) was the first example of this new style, Merzbow's first digital recording (on DAT), and the first recording made for the CD format. It also includes live material recorded during the tour. But when I started live in late 1980s I didn't like to use tape on stage. I like only live electronics. So, my studio works changed to more live composition style. I'm still using many tapes in studio works, but difference is I treat tapes and instruments. Before, I used tapes as overdubbing concept. But now tapes are crashing together, no static overdub. I found that style on Cloud Cock OO Grand. Beginning in the mid-1990s, Merzbow began to be influenced by death metal and grindcore. Recordings from this time are mostly recorded at extreme volume, some mastered at levels far beyond standard (Noisembryo, Pulse Demon). In 1994, Akita acquired a vintage EMS synthesizer. From 1996, plans were made to release a \\"10 (or maybe 12)\\" CD box set on Extreme Records. In 2000, Extreme Records released the Merzbox, a fifty CD set of Merzbow records, twenty of them not previously released. Throughout most of the 1990s, Merzbow live was a trio with Reiko A. on electronics and Bara on voice and dance. Masami Akita occasionally played drums for Hijokaidan during the early-mid 1990s. In the early 1990s, Masami Akita composed the soundtracks to numerous kinbaku videos by Fuji Planning (Bu Er Qi Hua , Fuji Kikaku) and seppuku-themed videos by their sub-label Right Brain. Akita also directed Lost Paradise (Shi Le Yuan Cheng Ma Fu Nu Fu Qie ri, Shitsurakuen: Jobafuku onna harakiri) for Right Brain. Some of this music was included on Music for Bondage Performance and Music for Bondage Performance 2, co-credited to Right Brain Audile. Director Ian Kerkhof would use a Merzbow track for his 1992 film La sequence des barres paralleles, and Akita composed original music for Kerhof's 1994 film The Dead Man 2: Return of the Dead Man. Kerkhof made the documentary Beyond Ultra Violence: Uneasy Listening by Merzbow in 1998. Akita also created music for Ilppo Pohjola's Asphalto (1998) and Routemaster (2000).

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose a smaller vessel is used happens, how will it affect FASTER boiling. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","response":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of using a smaller vessel does have an effect on the process, both directly and indirectly, leading to faster boiling of the water in certain conditions. In general, the boiling process depends on various factors such as the size of the vessel, water volume, heat transfer rate, stove efficiency, and surface area of the vessel in contact with the heat source. When a smaller vessel is used, several factors contribute to the faster boiling of water: 1. Direct Effect: A smaller vessel typically has a smaller volume capacity, meaning it would hold a lesser amount of water compared to a larger vessel. Keeping the heat source power constant, the energy required to raise the temperature of a smaller volume of water is less than that for a larger volume, making the water in the smaller vessel heat up and boil faster. This is due to the direct relationship between heat applied, mass of the water, and temperature change, as represented by the formula Q = mcΔT, where Q is the heat applied, m is the mass of the water, c is the specific heat capacity of water, and ΔT is the change in temperature. 2. Increased Heat Transfer Rate: Depending on the material the smaller vessel is made of, it may conduct heat more efficiently, allowing the water to receive more heat energy in a shorter period and, thus, boil faster. Thinner walls can also lead to improved heat transfer rates. 3. Increased Surface Area to Volume Ratio: A smaller vessel usually has a higher surface area to volume ratio, enabling the heat to be more evenly distributed across the water surface. The increased surface area in contact with the heat source can allow a more uniform and efficient transfer of energy, leading to faster boiling. 4. Indirect Effect: The process of observing small bubbles and waiting until the water starts to bubble a lot is affected when using a smaller vessel. As the water heats up faster, these visual cues will appear more quickly, and the user will progress through the process steps more rapidly. It is essential to note that these effects are heavily influenced by other factors like the vessel's shape and material, the heat source intensity, and the specific conditions in which the boiling takes place. In some cases, the difference in boiling time may not be significant if other conditions are unfavorable. Nevertheless, the use of a smaller vessel can lead to faster boiling of water due to the direct and indirect effects that it introduces to the boiling process."},{"question":"Generate a question that has the following answer: Milky and Banjo. for the following movie plot: In 1983, 12-year-old schoolboy Shaun gets into a fight at school after a classmate, Harvey, makes an offensive joke about his father, who died in the Falklands War.

Funerary art tends to be conservative in style, and many grave markers in various cultures follow rather traditional patterns, while others reflect modernism or other recent styles. Public monuments representing collective memorials to particular groups of dead people continue to be erected, especially war memorials, and in the Western world have now replaced individual or family memorials as the dominant types of very large memorials; Western political leaders now usually receive simple graves. Some large memorials are fairly traditional, while those reflecting more contemporary styles include the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, and several Holocaust memorials, such as Yad Vashem in Jerusalem, the Vel d'Hiv Memorial in Paris (1994), the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe in Berlin (2004), and the Judenplatz Holocaust Memorial in Vienna (2000). These are in notable contrast to the style of most war memorials to the military of World War II; earlier modernist memorials to the dead of World War I were sometimes removed after a time as inappropriate. Some war memorials, especially in countries like Germany, have had a turbulent political history, for example the much-rededicated Neue Wache in Berlin and the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo, which is internationally controversial.Several critics detect a crisis in public memorial style from 1945, when the traditional figurative symbolic language, and evocation of nationalist values, came to seem inadequate, especially in relation to genocide, at least on the Western side of the Iron Curtain.

It shares the same 2-oxo-pyrrolidone base structure with pyroglutamic acid. Piracetam is a cyclic derivative of GABA (gamma-Aminobutyric acid). Presently piracetam is used in many European countries, Asia and South America. In the United States, it is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for any medical use and it is not permitted to be sold as a dietary supplement. In the UK, piracetam is prescribed mainly for myoclonus, but is used off-label for other conditions. Evidence to support its use for many conditions is unclear. - Levetiracetam, marketed under the trade name Keppra among others, is a medication used to treat epilepsy. It is used for partial onset, myoclonic, or tonic-clonic seizures. It is the S-enantiomer of etiracetam. - Phenylpiracetam (INN: fonturacetam, brand names Phenotropil, Carphedon), also called is a phenylated analog of the drug piracetam which was developed in 1983 in Russia where it is available as a prescription drug. Research on animals has indicated that phenylpiracetam may have anti-amnesic, antidepressant, anticonvulsant, antipsychotic, anxiolytic, and memory enhancement effects. - Anticonvulsants (also commonly known as antiepileptic drugs or as antiseizure drugs) are a diverse group of pharmacological agents used in the treatment of epileptic seizures. Anticonvulsants are also increasingly being used in the treatment of bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder, since many seem to act as mood stabilizers, and for the treatment of neuropathic pain. Anticonvulsants suppress the rapid and excessive firing of neurons during seizures. Anticonvulsants also prevent the spread of the seizure within the brain. Some investigators have observed that anticonvulsants themselves may cause reduced IQ in children. However these adverse effects must be balanced against the significant risk epileptic seizures pose to children and the distinct possibility of death and devastating neurological sequelae secondary to seizures. Anticonvulsants are more accurately called antiepileptic drugs (abbreviated \\"AEDs\\"), and are often referred to as antiseizure drugs because they provide symptomatic treatment only and have not been demonstrated to alter the course of epilepsy. - Etiracetam is a chemical compound belonging to the racetam family, which was developed as a nootropic drug. It is racemic; its biologically active enantiomeric form is levetiracetam, now marketed as an antiepileptic drug. - Stimulants (also referred to as psychostimulants) is an overarching term that covers many drugs including those that increase activity of the body, drugs that are pleasurable and invigorating, or drugs that have sympathomimetic effects. Due to their rendering a characteristic \\"up\\" feeling, stimulants are also occasionally referred to as \\"uppers\\". Depressants or \\"downers\\", which decrease mental and/or physical function, are in stark contrast to stimulants and are considered to be the functionally opposite drug class. Stimulants are widely used throughout the world as prescription medicines as well as without a prescription (either legally or illicitly) as performance-enhancing or recreational drugs. The most frequently prescribed stimulants as of 2013 were lisdexamfetamine, methylphenidate, and amphetamine. It is estimated that the percent of the population that has abused amphetamines, cocaine and MDMA combined is between .8% and 2.1%. - Motivation is a theoretical construct used to explain behaviour. It gives the reasons for people's actions, desires, and needs. Motivation can also be defined as one's direction to behavior, or what causes a person to want to repeat a behavior and vice versa. A motive is what prompts the person to act in a certain way, or at least develop an inclination for specific behavior. According to Maehr and Meyer, \\"Motivation is a word that is part of the popular culture as few other psychological concepts are.\\" - Nootropicsalso called smart drugs or cognitive enhancersare drugs, supplements, or other substances that improve cognitive function, particularly executive functions, memory, creativity, or motivation, in healthy individuals. The use of cognition-enhancing drugs by healthy individuals in the absence of a medical indication is one of the most debated topics among neuroscientists, psychiatrists, and physicians which spans a number of issues, including the ethics and fairness of their use, concerns over adverse effects, and the diversion of prescription drugs for nonmedical uses, among others. Nonetheless, the international sales of cognition-enhancing supplements exceeded billion in 2015 and the global demand for these compounds is still growing rapidly. - In medicine, an adverse effect is an undesired harmful effect resulting from a medication or other intervention such as surgery. - Epilepsy is a group of neurological diseases characterized by epileptic seizures. Epileptic seizures are episodes that can vary from brief and nearly undetectable to long periods of vigorous shaking. These episodes can result in physical injuries including occasionally broken bones. In epilepsy, seizures tend to recur, and have no immediate underlying cause. Isolated seizures that are provoked by a specific cause such as poisoning are not deemed to represent epilepsy. People with epilepsy in some areas of the world experience stigma due to the condition. The cause of most cases of epilepsy is unknown, although some people develop epilepsy as the result of brain injury, stroke, brain tumors, infections of the brain, and birth defects. Known genetic mutations are directly linked to a small proportion of cases. Epileptic seizures are the result of excessive and abnormal nerve cell activity in the cortex of the brain. The diagnosis involves ruling out other conditions that might cause similar symptoms such as fainting and determining if another cause of seizures is present such as alcohol withdrawal or electrolyte problems. This may be partly done by imaging the brain and performing blood tests. Epilepsy can often be confirmed with an electroencephalogram (EEG), but a normal test does not rule out the condition. Epilepsy that occurs as a result of other issues may be preventable. Seizures are controllable with medication in about 70% of cases. Inexpensive options are often available. In those whose seizures do not respond to medication, then surgery, neurostimulation, or dietary changes may be considered. Not all cases of epilepsy are lifelong, and many people improve to the point that treatment is no longer needed. As of 2013 about 22 million people have epilepsy. Nearly 80% of cases occur in the developing world. In 2013 it resulted in 116,000 deaths up from 112,000 deaths in 1990. Epilepsy is more common in older people. In the developed world, onset of new cases occurs most frequently in babies and the... - A drug is any substance (other than food that provides nutritional support) that, when inhaled, injected, smoked, consumed, absorbed via a patch on the skin, or dissolved under the tongue, causes a physiological change in the body. - Oxiracetam (ISF 2522) is a nootropic drug of the racetam family and very mild stimulant. Several studies suggest that the substance is safe even when high doses are consumed for a long period of time. However, the mechanism of action of the racetam drug family is still a matter of research. Oxiracetam is not approved by Food and Drug Administration for any medical use in the United States. - Executive functions (collectively referred to as executive function and cognitive control) are a set of cognitive processes including attentional control, inhibitory control, working memory, and cognitive flexibility, as well as reasoning, problem solving, and planning that are necessary for the cognitive control of behavior: selecting and successfully monitoring behaviors that facilitate the attainment of chosen goals. Executive functions gradually develop and change across the lifespan of an individual and can be improved at any time over the course of a person's life. Similarly, these cognitive processes can be adversely affected by a variety of events which affect an individual. Neuropsychological tests are used to measure executive functions, and are usually performed as part of a more comprehensive assessment to diagnose neurological and psychiatric disorders. - Racetams are a class of drugs that share a pyrrolidone nucleus. Some, such as piracetam, are considered nootropics. Some such as oxiracetam and phenylpiracetam are also stimulants. Others such as levetiracetam and seletracetam are anticonvulsants. - Etiracetam is a nootropic drug of the racetam family . It is racemic ; its biologically active enantiomeric form is levetiracetam . - Seletracetam (UCB 44212) is a pyrrolidone-derived drug of the racetam family that is structurally related to levetiracetam (trade name Keppra). It was under development by UCB Pharmaceuticals as a more potent and effective anticonvulsant drug to replace levetiracetam but its production has been halted. - In chemistry, an enantiomer, also known as an optical isomer, is one of two stereoisomers that are mirror images of each other that are non-superposable (not identical), much as one's left and right hands are the same except for being reversed along one axis (the hands cannot be made to appear identical simply by reorientation). Organic compounds that contain a chiral carbon atom usually have two non-superposable structures. These two structures are mirror images of each other and are, thus, commonly called enantiomorphs (\\"enantio\\" = opposite ; \\"morph\\" = form), hence this structural property is now commonly referred to as enantiomerism.

Which is a better choice between JBL T100a and T150a? Multi-choice problem: Would you say that these questions are the same? I. no II. yes","response":"The JBL T100A and JBL T150A are in-ear headphones that belong to two different series of JBL's product lineup. There are some differences in their specifications and features, which can make one more suitable for your preferences than the other. Here is a detailed comparison between the two: 1. Driver size: The JBL T100A comes with 8mm drivers, while the JBL T150A features 9mm drivers. The larger driver size of the T150A should generally deliver slightly richer and clearer audio compared to the T100A. 2. Frequency response: Both the T100A and T150A offer a frequency response of 20 Hz to 22 kHz. This means that they cover the standard range of frequency for human hearing, and both should be able to reproduce audio quite well. 3. Impedance and sensitivity: The JBL T100A headphones have an impedance of 16 ohms and a sensitivity of 100 dB, while the T150A comes with an impedance of 18 ohms and a sensitivity of 104 dB. The higher impedance and sensitivity in the JBL T150A might result in a louder and clearer sound output, but also require slightly more power from your audio source device. 4. Microphone and remote control: Both models come equipped with a built-in microphone and a one-button remote control, allowing you to manage phone calls and control playback without having to access your device physically. However, the T150A is equipped with JBL's PureBass technology, which promises to provide deep and powerful bass reproduction. 5. Cable length and design: The JBL T100A features a 1-meter long flat cable that is designed to reduce tangling, while the T150A comes with a 1.1-meter round cable. The T150A's cable seems to be more durable than the flat cable of the T100A. 6. Price: The JBL T100A is generally priced lower than the T150A. However, price differences may vary depending on the region or seller. In conclusion, if you are looking for headphones with slightly better sound quality, especially in the bass department, and a more durable cable, the JBL T150A would be a better choice. However, if budget is a concern and you can compromise on some aspects of sound quality and build, the JBL T100A would serve the purpose well. Regarding the multi-choice problem: I would say that these questions are not exactly the same. While the first part of the inquiry is about the specifications and the differences between the two models, the second part is specifically asking for the better choice between JBL T100A and T150A. The third part of the question is unrelated to the headphones themselves. So, my answer choice would be: I. no"},{"question":"Answer the following question: - clubs is fc as béziers hérault -lrb- football -rrb- parma -lrb- ghana -rrb- emirates sporting club trofense - caps is 3 16 18 0 - position is central midfielder - currentclub is as béziers hérault -lrb- football -rrb- - height is 1.86 m on - years is 2001 -- 2010 2010 2014 -- 2015 2015 - - clubnumber is 14 - youthclubs is fc parma -lrb- ghana -rrb- emirates sporting club - youthyears is 2001 -- 2010 2010 - birth date is 02 may 1993 - fullname is joachim adukor - birth place is tema , ghana - goals is 0 0 1 0 Given the details above, guess who could this information be about.

I never much paid attention to how the film was lit, but on examination I don’t know what I think of the lighting. Maybe i’m totally wrong, but the lighting seems quite obvious when you pay attention to it, which makes me thing it could have been done better? Certainly the lighting is masterfully done, in the way it properly exposes the characters faces and splashes off and around certain props and objects, adding a great deal of dimension to many of the shots. But it does look quite obvious, once you pay attention to it, especially when you can see multiple shadows coming from a single character. All that said, the lighting is still pretty masterful and I’m very intrigued to properly analyse it. The first shot of the scene has extremely beautiful (even though it is obvious 😉 ) lighting. As the cowboy stands in the hallway you can tell that there is a strong key light coming from the left of the frame, that will light his face once he steps out of the shadows. It seems like there is another light, maybe coming from high up near the roof, lighting the right hand side of the frame, near the back of the hallway. Most likely facing towards the character to light him from his right hand side, to seperate him from the background. The lighting setup of this shot is extremely beautiful the way it enhances the various pieces of wood and props within the frame, and how they’ve managed to keep the cowboy drenched in shadows as he sneaks around, even though there is quite a lot of light within the frame. It looks like they may have used a cutter to achieve that effect as its a very specific area, essentially just the top half of the cowboy thats drenched ins shadow.

Conspicuous in the centre of the plate, he is shown being assisted by other boys to insert an arrow into a dog's rectum, a torture apparently inspired by a devil punishing a sinner in Jacques Callot's Temptation of St. Anthony.

The Kansas City-based syndicate recently announced that Salem will move from the editorial side of the business, as the Universal Uclick president drops “Editor” from his title — as a baton is passed to capable hands and the talented John Glynn becomes Editorial Director. Since Salem joined Universal Press Syndicate in 1974, he has helped discover and/or nurture dozens of stellar strips, including Bill Watterson’s “Calvin and Hobbes,” Lynn Johnston’s “For Better or for Worse,” Richard Thompson’s “Cul de Sac” and Mark Tatulli’s “Lio” — as well as editing Garry Trudeau’s “Doonesbury,” which won a Pulitzer the year after Salem arrived. “In the strips Universal launched, the writing was paramount, and Lee had a great eye for lively writers and a real understanding of what makes a comic strip work,” Watterson tells Comic Riffs. LEE SALEM: After 38 years as part of Universal Uclick’s editorial department, the executive transitions from that side of the business. (CAVNA / The Washington Post ) . “Lee has a smart sense of humor and he understands good comic timing,” Johnston tells us. “He can be funny and fun to be with, but he can also be a tough opponent if need be.” And Trudeau tells Comic Riffs: “I’ve depended on Lee’s friendship, guidance, protection and occasional interventions for decades, and I have no intention of giving all that up.” As Salem eases into his transition with his usual wisdom and grace, Comic Riffs asked those five cartoonists to share their thoughts on his legend and legacy, his editorship and his friendship. “I’m in complete denial about his move. I’ve depended on Lee’s friendship, guidance, protection and occasional interventions for decades, and I have no intention of giving all that up. He’ll just have to keep making room for me in his schedule. This isn’t open to discussion.” I think a big part of Lee’s editorial legacy is in bringing to newspapers a new generation of cartoonists — including women — and introducing an entirely new range of subjects and voices to the comics page. In the strips Universal launched, the writing was paramount, and Lee had a great eye for lively writers and a real understanding of what makes a comic strip work. He always seemed to find strips with highly individualistic takes on the world, and a strong sense of voice. This has become more or less the standard model for newspaper comics now, but it was quite different from the plug-in-the-gag, committee-drawn strips of the ‘50s and ‘60s, and I think it brought the comics a new sharpness and relevance. Because I admired and respected so many of Universal’s strips, I completely trusted Lee’s judgment in editing my work: I never argued for a strip he questioned. Of course, his “New England reserve” took some getting used to. In the early days, I’d save a week’s mailing time by handing Lee a stack of roughs to edit whenever he swung through the area on a business trip. He’d read through a month of my cartoons in a few minutes, and he could have been reading obituaries for all the delight he radiated. I’d crawl under the couch and lie in a tight ball until he was back on the plane. You can imagine what it was like to negotiate a contract with him. But of course, that unflappable quality was a real virtue in the other part of his job, which was to step into a circle of furious readers and newspaper editors, and take all the bullets. Lee was a great defender of my work, and I’ll always be grateful for his long and vigorous support. I’ve really enjoyed having Lee as my editor all these years, and he’s been a great friend to cartooning. \\"Lee Salem changed my life. I always wanted to make comics professionally, and I had been trying for syndication for some time. But it wasn't something real until 1997, when I sent a bunch of “Heart of the City” sample strips to Lee through the mail and he called to offer me a development deal. And from then on my life changed. It was because Lee Salem, the first guy with real comic-strip power, said, “Yes.” When I first started to work with Universal Press, Lee Salem was my editor. He was the one who suggested the name “For Better or For Worse\\" for my comic strip, and I have to admit, it suited the work I did. For the first few months, he worked with me to develop something that had consistency and balance. He was an excellent editor. Writing funny stuff is a personal venture, so the editor who says, “Hey, that's not funny!” better be right ... and Lee usually was. Whenever I traveled to Kansas City, he'd come to the airport to meet me [in his car]. It was old and comfortable with evidence of kids and family still in the trunk and the door compartments. The syndicate was then headquartered on the second floor of a plain square building on Squibb Avenue. A dusty plastic jade plant was at the top of the stairs, which gave me comfort. There was a lack of pretense everywhere and a real sense of camaraderie among the staff. Lee's office was small and cramped, but orderly. He had a window with a view of the farmlands outside and a secretary who sometimes put her dresses on backwards. I was lucky enough to have been there when [co-founder] Jim Andrews was alive. In fact, I think it was Jim who went to bat for me when others might have asked me to wait until I had something worth consideration. My first impression of Lee was that he was competent, thoughtful, honest and fair. He still is! I was well out of my league with a daily comic strip, but his confidence and easygoing manner made the job so much easier. Lee has a smart sense of humor and he understands good comic timing. He can be funny and fun to be with, but he can also be a tough opponent if need be. We have disagreed, heartily at times, and yet we have never fought. ... I believe his impregnable stare and calm demeanor — when under duress — is kind of a gift. Managing cartoonists can't be easy. We are all so capable of devastating a weak superior with a withering remark or a hideous drawing that it's best, perhaps, to keep us guessing when the gloves are off! What I'm saying here is...we all appreciate authority when it comes with class. Lee is a class act and I'm grateful to have been one of “the cast.” Late in 2005, out of the blue, I got an e-mail from Lee Salem; his subject line was: “Syndication?” I’d been asking myself the same question since I was about 10 years old, and the answer had always been, “Maybe some other time.” But such is the reputation, sway and authority of Lee Salem that my immediate response was: “Sure!” In the seven years since that e-mail, Lee has gently guided me into a life-changing career in the noblest calling: newspaper comic strip cartoonist. He didn’t do it alone, of course — it’s taken a team of ace specialists to convince me I know what I’m doing. But Lee’s lower-case e-mails encouraged me like nothing else, and his dinnertime conviviality sure helped, too. I’m proud to cal him my editor and friend.” Summary:","response":"Lee Salem, a big helper at Universal Uclick, has been in the company for 40 years and is now changing his job. He used to help pick and take care of many popular comic strips in newspapers that people love, like \\"Calvin and Hobbes\\" and \\"For Better or For Worse.\\" People who make those comic strips are saying nice things about him and telling stories about how he has helped them along the way. They are grateful for his support and friendship and are happy to have worked with him."},{"question":"I can use this background: When a solid substance is involved in a chemical reaction, only the matter at the surface of the solid is exposed to other reactants. If a solid has more surface area, more of it is exposed and able to react. Therefore, increasing the surface area of solid reactants increases the reaction rate. Look at the hammer and nails pictured in the Figure below . Both are made of iron and will rust when the iron combines with oxygen in the air. However, the nails have a greater surface area, so they will rust faster. Now, I have a new situation: John is trying to figure out how the shape of an object affects how it reacts with other elements. For that, he chose two objects, both made of the same element - object A and object B. Object A has a larger surface area, but object B has smaller surface area. He let these objects to react with other reactants to see how the processes work. Answer this question please: Would object A be more or less exposed to the reactants than object B?","response":"Object A, with a larger surface area, would be more exposed to the reactants than object B which has a smaller surface area. Therefore, we can predict that the reaction involving object A is likely to proceed at a faster rate, assuming all other conditions are the same. This is due to the increased surface area which allows more of the substance to be in contact with the reactants, thus expanding the area for potential reaction."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Yes, and I am not proud of it, but grief makes you do some really stupid things.

I was devastated, I was lost, and I was grieving terribly. I had not only lost my wife, but I had also lost my best friend (her, not the asshole so-called friend), and her family. While I was not particularly close to her family (most did not like me according to my ex-wife) I did care about them and they were are part of my life. I absolutely loved her sister and always enjoyed hanging out with her, as well as one of her cousins. Luckily they are both still friends with me on FB so I get to keep in touch. Anyway, I am not proud of the fact that I created a fake FB account to check her page and even talked to her through IM’s. I thought that if I could just talk to her, even if not as me, that I would be okay. However, seeing photos of her with someone else just about broke me. It was a very stupid thing to do and only made matters worse. One day I forgot to block my location and she figured out it was me. I felt so stupid, but I had loved her so much that I needed her in my life. She called me out on it. I was busted. I was the grieving idiot that did not want to give up.

Using its control over education and the media, the Soviet propaganda machine denounced the Georgian rebellion as a \\"bloody adventure initiated by the Georgian Social Democratic Party and other reactionary forces who managed to implicate a small and undereducated part of the population in it.\\" With a new tide of independence movement sweeping throughout Georgia in the late 1980s, the anti-Soviet fighters of 1924, particularly, the leading partisan officer Kakutsa Cholokashvili, emerged as a major symbol of Georgian patriotism and national resistance to the Soviet rule.

A school at the centre of the Islamist ‘Trojan Horse’ takeover plot has refused to accept the findings of an Ofsted report that claimed it is failing to do enough to protect children from extremism. The report - made public yesterday but. leaked to the Daily Mail on Monday - revealed Golden Hillock, in Birmingham,. was doing 'too little to keep students safe from the risks associated. with extremist views'. It was placed in special measures after. Ofsted noted ‘staff views are polarised’ about leadership and that sex. and relationships education was not taught properly. Denial: Golden Hillock school (pictured) has refused to accept the findings of an Ofsted report that claimed it is failing to do enough to protect children from extremism. The charges were rejected as politically motivated. The charges have been rejected by the school’s management as being. politically motivated. A statement from the school said it disputed the. validity of the inspection. Golden. Hillock secondary school in Sparkbrook is one of three managed by the. Park View Educational Trust - all of which are believed to have been. rated inadequate. A. Trust spokesman said Ofsted found no evidence that Golden Hillock. either promoted or tolerated extremism or radicalisation. It added it. did not accept Ofsted findings that the school was inadequate.’ It. said: 'The Trust does not accept the findings of the Ofsted report,. which mischaracterises the school, and is now challenging it through the. appropriate legal channels.' Golden. Hillock was one of 21 schools inspected after a letter - now widely. believed to be a hoax - referred to an alleged plot by hard-line Muslims. to seize control of governing boards in the city, dubbed Operation. Trojan Horse. The. Trojan Horse letter, which was unsigned, undated and first sent to. council officials and teaching unions late last year, has sparked. several separate investigations including by Birmingham City Council,. West Midlands Police, the Department for Education and Ofsted. In. its statement, PVET, said it believed that the inspections had been. conducted 'in a climate of fear created by the 'Trojan Horse' letter'. Controversy: Park View School, which is at the centre of the Trojan Horse plot allegations, has been accused of segregating women and children during lessons. Inspectors. who visited Golden Hillock concluded that the school was not doing. enough to raise students' awareness of 'risks of extremism', according. to PVET's statement. But. the Trust said it was crucial to note that Ofsted's report contained no. suggestion, or evidence, that the school either promotes or tolerates. extremism or radicalisation. It added. that it disputed the inspectorate's finding that there had been slow. progress in ensuring that staff had been trained in recognising the. signs of radicalisation and how to tailor their teaching to counter. this. And it claimed a finding that students are not being properly prepared for life in modern Britain was a 'misrepresentation'. It said: 'On behalf of the staff, students and parents who have worked so hard to improve their school, we are extremely disappointed to confirm that Ofsted has decided to place Golden Hillock in special measures.' Education: Michael Gove has been accused of 'sitting on' warnings of Trojan Horse plots since 2010. 'While we support the role of Ofsted in holding schools to account in a fair and transparent way, we wholeheartedly dispute the validity of these gradings. Golden Hillock is categorically not an inadequate school. It is also crucial to note that the school had been part of Park View Educational Trust for just five months at the time of the Ofsted inspection in March 2014. 'A number of the judgments are based on data and information that pre-date the Trust's involvement.' PVET runs three schools, including Park View Academy which has been at the centre of some of the most serious allegations. In the past, Trust chairman Tahir Alam has called the allegations 'a witch-hunt.' Earlier this week, it was revealed that three other schools inspected by Ofsted had been given a clean bill of health. The Birmingham-based schools published letters received from the watchdog which all found governance and leadership to be either good or outstanding - the highest rating available - and concluding that child-safeguarding standards were being met. Ninestiles School - an academy in Acocks Green - Small Heath School and Washwood Heath Academy were the first to publish the results of their inspections, after Education Secretary Michael Gove sent Ofsted in over the Trojan Horse allegations. A separate over-arching report by the head of Ofsted and Chief Inspector of Schools Sir Michael Wilshaw is expected to be published next week, along with any remaining Ofsted reports for the individual schools concerned. Shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt said: 'Gender discrimination, undue influence of extremist views, the school curriculum influenced by hard-line beliefs. This report confirms that Michael Gove can no longer seek to distance himself from this episode. He is responsible.' 'In 2010, Michael Gove was warned by a highly respected Birmingham headteacher that this was going on. Four years on, he has failed to act and has not explained why.' 'Rightly, his record is now being called into question. Rather than rowing with Theresa May, he needs to answer why he has refused to act.'

What's your favorite political bumper sticker? Do those questions have the same meaning? Options are: + no. + yes.","response":"As an AI, I don't have personal preferences or emotions, but I can provide you with some popular and interesting bumper stickers from the 2000s and political bumper stickers that people liked. The two questions you asked don't have the same meaning and can be considered separately. A popular bumper sticker from the 2000s that many people found amusing or thought-provoking is \\"My karma ran over my dogma.\\" The phrase is a play on the idea that the consequences of one's actions (karma) can sometimes challenge or upend their firmly held beliefs (dogma). It's a light-hearted way of reminding people to be open to change and adapt as life presents new experiences and lessons. Regarding political bumper stickers, there's a range of opinions and preferences, given the diverse nature of politics. One popular political bumper sticker in the United States is \\"E Pluribus Unum,\\" which translates to \\"Out of many, one.\\" This phrase is found on the Great Seal of the United States and reflects the belief that the country is a unified entity formed from individual states and diverse backgrounds. It resonates with many individuals, regardless of their political affiliation, as a reminder of national unity and purpose. Now, regarding the two questions you asked: they do not have the same meaning. The first question inquires about a popular bumper sticker from the 2000s without specifying a category, while the second question focuses specifically on a political bumper sticker. While there might be some overlap, such as a popular bumper sticker from the 2000s that also happens to be political in nature, the two questions are ultimately distinct and explore different aspects of the myriad bumper stickers that exist.

As bishop — a position akin to priest or pastor — Romney presided over a fast-growing flock that included Catalano's wife, Sandy, a new convert. Ronnie, a cigarette smoking, wine-drinking Catholic, had accused Sandy of ruining their family by becoming Mormon. He tried to prevent her from attending church and from donating their money in the Mormon tradition of tithing. Sandy was thinking of leaving her husband and moving to Utah with their two children, an anathema in a faith in which families come first and church leaders are encouraged to bring non-Mormon spouses of church members into the fold. DOCUMENT: Read Romney's Belmont zoning board speech What followed, the Catalanos say, was an extended campaign of kindness and faith that went far beyond what Romney was obligated to do as bishop. Romney took the Catalanos under his wing. He called Ronnie to invite him to church events, gave him tasks such as manning a grill or setting up tables to make him feel included, invented jobs around the church when Ronnie was out of work. He referred Ronnie to passages in the Book of Mormon that spoke to the importance of families, and told the Catalanos that he was praying for them, and even losing sleep over them. In 1991, after 11 years of persuasion, Ronnie Catalano converted to Mormonism. The 67-year-old Budweiser driver is now deeply involved in the church and has given up smoking and drinking, which he says saved his life because his father and brother both died of lung cancer. \\"Mitt was the one who really stood out. He was always caring about my family, my wife, my children,\\" Catalano said in a recent interview. \\"He taught me how to keep my family together.\\" \\"He saved us. He rescued us,\\" added his wife. George W. Bush is a born-again Christian; President Obama has been a regular church-goer for decades; Jimmy Carter taught Sunday school. But no previous president or serious candidate can rival Romney for the time and energy spent in running a religious organization and ministering to its members. Over the course of two decades, Romney served as spiritual and administrative leader for a Boston-area church and then as the head of a dozen Mormon churches. The work often took up 30 hours a week of his time, or more. Had he not entered politics, Romney — a sixth-generation member of the Mormon Church whose ancestors were among the earliest members of the faith — might have put himself on a path to be chosen for the church's governing body in Salt Lake City, the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. Faith-based credentials such as Romney's are normally gold on the campaign trail. Yet Romney does not speak of his time as a church leader in Belmont. His Republican presidential campaign biography doesn't mention any of his church roles, not even his stint as Sunday school teacher. \\"People in his campaign wished he'd never been a Mormon or a Mormon leader,\\" said Ronald B. Scott, a fellow Mormon and the author of a just-published book about Romney, \\"Mitt Romney: An Inside Look at the Man and His Politics.\\" \\"They haven't said, 'How do we turn this sow's ear into a silk purse?' And he doesn't talk about it.\\" Romney knows well the political perils of a Mormon background. According to a Gallup poll, nearly 20% of Republican and independent voters say they wouldn't support a Mormon for president. Others might agree with the Rev. Robert Jeffress, an evangelical Texas preacher who caused a stir in October when he called Mormonism a cult just before introducing Texas Gov. Rick Perry at the Values Voters Summit in Washington. Romney's service to the church \\"is something that most Americans would admire,\\" said David Campbell, associate professor of political science at the University of Notre Dame, who is Mormon. \\"But if he begins to talk about his service, then it would open up all the other questions about his religion.\\" Romney was the bishop of the Belmont ward from 1981 to 1985, the \\"shepherd of the flock,\\" said Kim Clark, president of Brigham Young University-Idaho and a member of the congregation at the time. Romney was not paid for his service in Belmont or Boston; in the Mormon Church, congregation members are responsible for running all pieces of church life as volunteers. His responsibilities included visiting the sick, meeting with youth groups, counseling married couples and delinquent children, arranging Sunday services, church classes and other events, and using Scriptures and the Book of Mormon to guide his congregation. Summary:","response":"Mitt Romney was a leader in his church and helped many people, including Ronnie Catalano, who was having trouble with his family because of their different religions. Romney spent a lot of time and effort helping people, but he doesn't talk about his work in the church much because some people don't like his religion, called Mormonism."},{"question":"Given the following reasoning and answer, what was the question?

In Britain, further experiments in the genre boosted its appeal. House and rave clubs such as Lakota and Cream emerged across Britain, hosting house and dance scene events. The 'chilling out' concept developed in Britain with ambient house albums such as The KLF's Chill Out and Analogue Bubblebath by Aphex Twin. The Godskitchen superclub brand also began in the midst of the early 90's rave scene. After initially hosting small nights in Cambridge and Northampton, the associated events scaled up in Milton Keynes, Birmingham and Leeds. A new indie dance scene also emerged in the 90's. In New York, bands such as Deee-Lite furthered house's international influence. Two distinctive tracks from this era were the Orb's \\"Little Fluffy Clouds\\" (with a distinctive vocal sample from Rickie Lee Jones) and the Happy Mondays' \\"Wrote for Luck\\" (\\"WFL\\") which was transformed into a dance hit by Vince Clarke. The late Robert Miles also produced house tracks such as \\"One and One\\" with Maria Nayler, \\"Fable\\" and his biggest hit, \\"Children\\". In England, one of the few licensed venues was The Eclipse, which attracted people from up and down the country as it was open until the early hours.

Understand how the other person feels. Forgive yourself. Forgive the Taurus. Plan your apology. Think of a solution.\\" Article:","response":"Title: Reconciliation with a Taurus - Owning Your Mistakes and Practicing Forgiveness Introduction When it comes to reconciliation, it's important to remember that different star signs react to apologies and forgiving gestures differently. Taurus individuals are known for their strong-willed and stubborn nature, which can make the process of mending a broken relationship with them quite challenging. However, with the right approach and a genuine desire to make amends, it is possible to rebuild trust and restore harmony. This article will guide you through the essential steps to effectively make amends with a Taurus. 1. Admit What You Did Wrong to Yourself Before you approach a Taurus for reconciliation, it's crucial to acknowledge your own faults and mistakes in the situation. By admitting to yourself what you did wrong, you pave the way for genuine remorse and self-awareness. This honesty with yourself is an essential foundation for a successful apology because it will allow you to offer a sincere apology instead of an empty gesture. 2. Understand How the Other Person Feels Empathy is key when trying to mend a relationship. Take the time to genuinely consider how your actions affected the Taurus and try to empathize with their feelings. By doing this, you will gain invaluable insight into the hurt they experienced and be better equipped to address their emotions during your apology. Additionally, understanding their feelings will help guide you in developing a solution that addresses their needs and concerns. 3. Forgive Yourself Forgiving yourself is a crucial step in the reconciliation process. Beating yourself up over past mistakes won't help mend the relationship but will hinder you from moving forward. Recognize that everyone makes mistakes, and by admitting your faults and taking responsibility, you are taking positive steps towards making things right. Remember that self-forgiveness is essential for personal growth and rebuilding trust. 4. Forgive the Taurus It's equally important to forgive the Taurus for any upset they may have caused you during the conflict. Holding onto resentment or anger towards them will only prevent true healing and restoration. It's important to remember that no one is perfect and everyone makes mistakes, even the most strong-willed Taurus. Genuine forgiveness fosters understanding and paves the way for a stronger relationship. 5. Plan Your Apology Preparing your apology in advance can make all the difference when speaking to a Taurus. Be concise and specific about what you are apologizing for, and make sure to express genuine remorse for your actions. Avoid making excuses or justifying your behavior, as this may come across as insincere. Rehearsing your apology can help you stay on track and ensure that your message comes across with sincerity and conviction. 6. Think of a Solution While apologizing is an important step, it's not the sole solution to mend a broken relationship with a Taurus. Offer tangible steps and actions you plan to take in order to avoid repeating the same mistakes in the future. Your willingness to demonstrate changed behavior will show the Taurus that you are serious about making amends and willing to put in the effort to restore the relationship. Conclusion Rebuilding trust and mending a relationship with a Taurus requires patience, understanding, and genuine remorse. By admitting your mistakes, empathizing with their feelings, and practicing forgiveness for both yourself and your Taurus, you lay a strong foundation for reconciliation. Preparing a thoughtful apology and offering viable solutions will show your commitment to change and improve the relationship. With time and sincere efforts, you can reestablish trust and harmony in your bond with a Taurus."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Question: \\"What had to happen for Moses to see God's manifestation upon the mountain?\\" Context: \\"Moses, in 7:143, comes the way of those who are in love, he asks for a vision but his desire is denied, he is made to suffer by being commanded to look at other than the Beloved while the mountain is able to see God. The mountain crumbles and Moses faints at the sight of God's manifestation upon the mountain. In Qushayri's words, Moses came like thousands of men who traveled great distances, and there was nothing left to Moses of Moses. In that state of annihilation from himself, Moses was granted the unveiling of the realities. From the Sufi point of view, God is the always the beloved and the wayfarer's longing and suffering lead to realization of the truths.\\" Answer: A:","response":"In order for Moses to see God's manifestation upon the mountain, as described in verse 7:143 of the Qur'an and elaborated in Qushayri's Sufi interpretation, several events and conditions had to be fulfilled: 1. Moses' love and longing for God: Moses had a strong desire and love for God, which led him to ask for a vision to witness God's presence directly. This love and longing are essential catalysts in the spiritual journey towards understanding the divine truths. 2. The journey and aspiration of Moses: Moses embarked on a great spiritual journey, filled with trials and tribulations. He traveled far away, both physically and spiritually, overcoming numerous obstacles in order to reach the mountain where he would eventually witness God's manifestation. 3. The state of annihilation (fana) from himself: In accordance with Sufi teachings, Moses was required to lose himself completely and become detached from his self, his ego, and desires. This state of annihilation is essential for any seeker to experience God's divine presence and to be granted a revelation of the ultimate realities. 4. The command to look at other than the Beloved: Moses was first made to suffer by being instructed to look elsewhere ('the mountain') rather than directly at the divine vision he desired. This command was a test of his devotion and commitment to God, and ultimately, it revealed the limitations of Moses' human capacity. 5. The mountain's capability to witness God's manifestation: While Moses himself was initially unable to witness God's presence directly, the mountain before him was able to withstand God's manifestation. The crumbled state of the mountain after witnessing God's presence conveyed the incomprehensible power and majesty of the divine. 6. Moses' fainting as a result of witnessing God's manifestation: Eventually, Moses was granted an indirect encounter with God's divine presence through the mountain's destruction. The immense power and awe of this manifestation caused Moses to faint, further emphasizing the human limitations in the face of God's glory. In conclusion, for Moses to see God's manifestation upon the mountain, he had to demonstrate his love and longing for God, undertake a challenging spiritual journey, achieve a state of self-annihilation, endure the command to look elsewhere, witness the mountain's destruction due to God's presence, and finally, faint from the overwhelming glory of God. Through this experience, Moses gained a profound understanding of divine truths as narrated in the Sufi perspective."},{"question":"Q: Question: where is basque spoken? Would \\"Euskara Batua was created so that Basque language could be used—and easily understood by all Basque speakers—in formal situations (education, mass media, literature), and this is its main use today.\\" be a reasonable answer?

In France, it is spoken in the western part of the Pyrénées-Atlantiques department within the French Basque Country. Euskara Batua, or Unified Basque, was indeed created to help facilitate mutual understanding among Basque speakers and to serve as a standardized version of the language for use in formal situations such as education, mass media, and literature.

Piyush \\"Bobby\\" Jindal (born June 10, 1971) is an American politician who was the 55th Governor of Louisiana between 2008 and 2016, and previously served as a U.S. Congressman and as the vice chairman of the Republican Governors Association. In 1996, Jindal was appointed secretary of the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals and in 1999, at age 28, he was appointed as the youngest president in the history of the University of Louisiana System. In 2001, President George W. Bush appointed Jindal as principal adviser to the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services. He first ran for governor of Louisiana in 2003, but lost in the run-off election to Democratic candidate, Kathleen Blanco. Jindal had been mentioned as a potential candidate for the 2012 presidential election. On December 10, 2008, Jindal indicated that he would likely not run for president in 2012, saying he will focus on his re-election in 2011 and that this would make transitioning to a national campaign difficult, though he did not rule out a possible 2012 presidential bid. Speculation increased when Republicans chose Jindal to deliver the response to President Obama's first address to a joint session of Congress. The Jindal for President Draft Council Inc. PAC was formed in 2009 to raise funds for a future presidential run. Jindal has stated that he has no involvement with the PAC. In April 2010, while speaking at the Southern Republican Leadership Conference, Jindal ruled out running for the Republican nomination for President in 2012. In 2012, Jindal traveled across the country in support of the Mitt Romney-Paul Ryan ticket. Because Louisiana and other Deep South states voted heavily for the GOP, Jindal could hence devote his campaign time elsewhere. In August 2012, Politico reported that \\"Bobby Jindal would be considered [for] and would likely take\\" appointment as United States Secretary of Health and Human Services in a potential Romney cabinet. After the defeat of Romney-Ryan, Jindal called for his party to return to \\"the basics... If we want people to like us, we have to like them first,\\" he said on the interview program Fox News Sunday. As the incoming president of the Republican Governors Association, which had thirty members in 2013, Jindal questioned Romney for having criticized President Obama as having provided \\"extraordinary financial gifts from the government\\". In reply to Romney, Jindal said, \\"You don't start to like people by insulting them and saying their votes were bought.\\" Jindal said that his party must convince a majority of voters that it supports the middle class and the principle of upward mobility. He also criticized what he termed \\"stupid\\" remarks regarding rape and conception made in 2012 by defeated Republican U.S. Senate nominees Todd Akin in Missouri and Richard Mourdock in Indiana.","response":"This text is about Piyush \\"Bobby\\" Jindal, an American politician who served as the 55th Governor of Louisiana between 2008 and 2016.

Witnesses are assigned to a congregation in whose \\"territory\\" they usually reside and attend weekly services they refer to as \\"meetings\\" as scheduled by congregation elders. The meetings are largely devoted to study of Watch Tower Society literature and the Bible. The format of the meetings is established by the religion's headquarters, and the subject matter for most meetings is the same worldwide. Congregations meet for two sessions each week comprising five distinct meetings that total about three-and-a-half hours, typically gathering mid-week (three meetings) and on the weekend (two meetings). Prior to 2009, congregations met three times each week; these meetings were condensed, with the intention that members dedicate an evening for \\"family worship\\". Gatherings are opened and closed with kingdom songs (hymns) and brief prayers. Twice each year, Witnesses from a number of congregations that form a \\"circuit\\" gather for a one-day assembly. Larger groups of congregations meet once a year for a three-day \\"regional convention\\", usually at rented stadiums or auditoriums.

(Associated Press) The lucky trio did not immediately identify themselves, but they bought their tickets in the small working class town of Munford, Tennessee; in the quiet Los Angeles suburb of Chino Hills; and at a supermarket in affluent Melbourne Beach, on Florida's Space Coast. They overcame odds of 1 in 292.2 million to land on all the numbers: 4-8-19-27-34 and Powerball 10. They can let their winnings be invested and thereby collect 30 annual payments totaling an estimated 533 million, or take their third of 983.5 million in cash all at once. Getting such a windfall is the start of a \\"new journey\\" and the winners should be prepared with lawyers, accountants and financial planners before they come forward, California Lottery spokesman Russ Lopez said. Too many lottery winners unaccustomed to sudden wealth have gone bankrupt, been victimized or experienced other losses because they were unprepared for an onslaught of unwanted attention, said Andrew Stoltmann, an Illinois attorney who has represented winners. He compared it to \\"throwing meat into a shark-infested ocean.\\" But they shouldn't wait too long: California gives its top winners up to a year to contact lottery officials before the money automatically goes to schools. Winners in Tennessee and Florida must claim their winnings within 180 days of Wednesday night's drawing. State and local taxes can eat up nearly half the winnings for many lottery players around the country, but these three could be even more lucky if they live in Florida or Tennessee, which have no state income tax, or California, which exempts winnings from lottery tickets bought in-state. They would still owe federal taxes, topping out at 39.6 percent. The huge draw also produced eight 2 million Power Play winners and 73 1 million winners nationwide who matched all five white balls but missed the red Powerball, said Sally Lunsford of the Kansas Lottery. The California ticket was sold at a 7-Eleven; the Florida ticket at a Publix supermarket and the Tennessee ticket at a family-owned grocery store, where the owner, Dana Naifeh, received a 25,000 check. \\"I need to digest this,\\" said Naifeh, who plans to share some of her modest bounty with store employees. Florida's store collects 100,000, and California's 1 million bonus will be shared between the Chino Hills store owner and the 7-Eleven company. California Lottery spokesman Alex Traverso said officials there heard plenty of stories about possible jackpot winners, but no one had come forward to cash in the ticket as of late Thursday afternoon. Munford auto body shop worker Jerry Caudle said he was \\"freaking out\\" when he heard a winning ticket was sold in his town, but then saw that he matched only two numbers and the Powerball, for a prize of 14. He wore a wistful smile as he left the Short Stop gas station and convenience store, where Tipton County's \\"best chicken on a stick\\" costs 3.69. \\"It's been tough,\\" Caudle said. \\"The hardest winter for me here in 17 years.\\" The California store and its surrounding strip mall suddenly became a popular gathering spot in the rural suburb of 78,000, where cows still graze on hillsides. Hundreds of people crowded into the 7-Eleven store, chanting \\"Chino Hills! Chino Hills!\\" Store owner Balbir Atwal worked as an electronics salesman after immigrating from India in 1981, and bought his first 7-Eleven franchise at the age of 27. Now he owns four. He said he has sold winning tickets before, but never like this one. \\"I was just joking, I said, this is the time someone's going to hit it,\\" laughed Atwal. He said he would share his part of the store's bonus with employees and family, and give some to charity. Michael Fahim, 48, real estate broker from Chino Hills, said he bought 20 lottery tickets Wednesday night just up the street. \\"I'm happy it's in Chino Hills. I think it put us on the map — all over the world,\\" he said, adding that his brother called from Australia overnight to learn if he won. Melbourne Beach's 3,100 residents live on a spit of beachfront no bigger than one-square mile. Unlike parts of the Space Coast dominated by high rises, the affluent town has large single-family homes on its beaches. Nobody emerged to claim their winnings, but excitement was palpable outside the Publix where the ticket was sold. \\"The winner could be as close as your neighbors!\\" said Lisa Londini, a professional caregiver shopping at the market. \\"I wish it was me!\\" Ticket sales and payouts had risen steadily as weeks came and went without a winner since Nov. 4, when the jackpot amount was reset at 40 million. In addition to three jackpot winners, more than 26 million other winning tickets will pay out total cash prizes of 273,869,373, Lunsford said. For Wednesday night's drawing alone, Powerball sales totaled 1,270,206,274. People were buying 37,000 Powerball tickets a minute in California, where 386 million in Powerball tickets were sold since Nov. 4, the most of any state and more than California sold in the entire previous fiscal year, spokesman Russ Lopez said. \\"You get a lot of new players with a large jackpot,\\" California Lottery Director Hugo Lopez said. \\"Our goal is to have a lot of people play a little bit.\\" A big chunk of the profits go to schools, although not enough to solve all their budget problems, officials said. Sales for this jackpot generated nearly 115 million since November for education in Florida, which uses the lottery to provide 6 percent of the education budget, Florida Lottery Secretary Tom Delacenserie said. California's share represents 154 million for its schools, Russ Lopez said — not enough \\"to get schools out of trouble.\\" ___ Contributors include David Pitt and Scott McFetridge in Iowa City, Iowa.

The 62-year-old nurse was even identified by her employer, Park Avenue Health & Wellness Center in Pomona, California, who also may have fallen for the prank. Shlomo Rechnitz, right, purchased Powerball tickets for all of his 15,000 employees for Wednesday night’s historic drawing. David Livingston / Getty Images ID: 7772707 The story spread quickly in local news broadcasts and social media, but it began to quickly unravel after details surrounding the ticket emerged. One of the woman’s daughters told the New York Daily News that the ticket, and the picture, had in fact been part of a prank from one of her siblings. California Lottery officials told BuzzFeed News they were skeptical about the win for a couple of reasons, including the fact that no one had come forward to claim the prize. “No one from that group has come forward,” Alex Traverso, assistant deputy director of the California Lottery, told BuzzFeed News. He said a picture of the supposed winning ticket also appeared to have been purchased at the wrong retailer. “We checked out the ticket, and the retailers don’t check out,” he said.

She and her colleagues began to celebrate at the nursing home Wednesday night after the numbers were announced, Nass said, believing she was a big winner. He told BuzzFeed News he and her employer had been unable to contact the woman after news spread she might have been the victim of a prank. “If it is indeed the case that someone pulled a prank on her, that’s reprehensible,” Nass said. At this point, Nass said it was unclear what happened. “She’s a wonderful lady, and an incredible employee,” Nass said. “She stayed to finish her shift.” The real winning ticket was purchased at a 7-Eleven in Chino Hills, California. A picture of the woman’s ticket, however, showed it came from a different store, Traverso said. Two other jackpot winning tickets were purchased in Florida and Tennessee. None of the winners have been identified. Traverso said it is also rare for winners to make any sort of public announcement before claiming the winnings with the California Lottery. “They usually play it really close to the vest,” he told BuzzFeed News. “They don’t want people to know they’re big winners. My assumption is that it’s not a legitimate ticket.” ||||| Revelers celebrate at 7-Eleven where 1.5 billion Powerball jackpot winning ticket sold https://t.co/lGimxMqT72 https://t.co/KJOXwJAU5O — ABC7 Eyewitness News (@ABC7) January 14, 2016 Sorry, your browser doesn't support Flash , needs a Flash update , or has Flash disabled.

About 22 million people die from air pollution each year. Breathing polluted air increases the risk of developing lung diseases such as asthma and lung cancer. Breathing bad air also increases the chances of dying from other diseases. Children are most likely to be affected by air pollution. That’s because their lungs are still developing and growing. Children also take in more air for their size than adults do. Some air pollutants damage the environment as well as the health of living things. The type of damage depends on the pollutant. Air pollution can also harm the environment. Paragraph: Daniel visited two countries. Switzerland and India. There was almost no air pollution at all in Switzerland, while the air in India was almost impossible to breathe it was so polluted. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which country had fewer people develop lung cancer? A:","response":"Based on the information provided in the background and paragraph, it can be reasonably concluded that Switzerland had fewer people develop lung cancer as compared to India. Switzerland experienced almost no air pollution, while the air pollution in India was so extreme that it was almost impossible to breathe. As mentioned, breathing polluted air increases the risk of developing lung diseases, including lung cancer. Consequently, the lower air pollution levels in Switzerland contribute to a reduced likelihood of people developing lung cancer in comparison to India, where air pollution is a significant issue."},{"question":"Sparta is an American rock band from El Paso, Texas, formed in 2001.

Like all creeks in Lycoming County, Larrys Creek served as an area for settlers to establish homesteads and farms. As logging became a major industry in the mid-19th century, the creek was a source of power for sawmills and other mills. The first sawmill on the creek, in what is now Mifflin Township, was built in 1799. The relatively low flow of water in the creek did not allow rafts of logs to be floated downstream to the river and the lumber boom at Williamsport (as they were on Pine Creek to the west).This and the lack of logging railroads along the creek led to the development of many small sawmills: the Larrys Creek watershed once had 53 sawmills within 22 miles (35 km) of the mouth (as well as other industries of the time). No other stream in the country had so many sawmills in so small a territory. Twelve sawmills were on the Second Fork, six on the First Fork, one each on Canoe Run and Lawshe Run, and the rest were on Larrys Creek itself. Eight were structures rebuilt on the site of previous sawmills, and only four were steam powered (the rest were water powered). The earliest of these sawmills was built in 1796 (near Seeley Run), the last in 1902 (on Lawshe Run), and by 1903 just two mills were still standing and only one of those was operating.Lumbering removed the tree trunks, but left many flammable limbs, branches, and stumps behind. On May 2, 1872, a large forest fire destroyed the villages of Carter and Gould, 6 miles (9.7 km) north of Salladasburg on Larrys Creek in Mifflin Township. There are large tracts of second growth forest and small lumber companies still operate in the watershed today.

During and after the composition of The Planets, Holst wrote or arranged numerous vocal and choral works, many of them for the wartime Thaxted Whitsun Festivals, 1916–18. They include the Six Choral Folksongs of 1916, based on West Country tunes, of which \\"Swansea Town\\", with its \\"sophisticated tone\\", is deemed by Dickinson to be the most memorable. Holst downplayed such music as \\"a limited form of art\\" in which \\"mannerisms are almost inevitable\\"; the composer Alan Gibbs, however, believes Holst's set at least equal to Vaughan Williams's Five English Folk Songs of 1913.Holst's first major work after The Planets was the Hymn of Jesus, completed in 1917. The words are from a Gnostic text, the apocryphal Acts of St John, using a translation from the Greek which Holst prepared with assistance from Clifford Bax and Jane Joseph. Head comments on the innovative character of the Hymn: \\"At a stroke Holst had cast aside the Victorian and Edwardian sentimental oratorio, and created the precursor of the kind of works that John Tavener, for example, was to write in the 1970s\\". Matthews has written that the Hymn's \\"ecstatic\\" quality is matched in English music \\"perhaps only by Tippett's The Vision of Saint Augustine\\"; the musical elements include plainsong, two choirs distanced from each other to emphasise dialogue, dance episodes and \\"explosive chordal dislocations\\".In the Ode to Death (1918–19), the quiet, resigned mood is seen by Matthews as an \\"abrupt volte-face\\" after the life-enhancing spirituality of the Hymn. Warrack refers to its aloof tranquillity; Imogen Holst believed the Ode expressed Holst's private attitude to death. The piece has rarely been performed since its premiere in 1922, although the composer Ernest Walker thought it was Holst's finest work to that date.The influential critic Ernest Newman considered The Perfect Fool \\"the best of modern British operas\\", but its unusually short length (about an hour) and parodic, whimsical nature—described by The Times as \\"a brilliant puzzle\\"—put it outside the...

Manni is in a telephone booth and questions her about where she has been since she was supposed to be waiting for him at the spot they had planned on.

Sadly, I soon discovered that the movie was a prime example of how even a star-studded cast and an experienced director can't save a film with a mediocre script and problematic plotlines. Starting off with the storyline, \\"The Hyped Disappointment\\" offers a promising premise, highlighting the action-packed adventures of a group of unlikely heroes who are thrown together to save the world from an imminent, otherworldly threat. However, the writers and director severely underdelivered, leaving us with a jumbled mess of half-baked plotlines that don't build on each other and fail to make any discernible sense. The pacing of the film further derails the watching experience. Character introductions are rushed and unsatisfying, and the pacing rarely pauses for breath or for any non-action scenes. The climax of the film is reached so abruptly that it feels unnatural, like the writers were trying to force a resolution in a lackluster fashion. Unfortunately, this pacing issue hinders any character development, so we never feel invested in the heroes or their motives throughout the film, leaving us indifferent to their struggles and victories. Moreover, \\"The Hyped Disappointment\\" just can't seem to find its voice as it is riddled with comedy that falls flat, dramatic scenes that make us cringe, and action sequences that come off as uninspired. This leads to an odd blend of genre elements colliding in an unpleasant way, making viewers question the genre this film was trying to inhabit. A film's cast can make or break its success, and while this movie features a bevy of talented actors and actresses, it failed to make good use of their skills. Lackluster performances, perhaps stemming from an uninspired script, rendered characters one dimensional and dull. It appeared as if the actors, too, were disappointed with the material they were given, making it even more challenging for the audience to engage with the story. Additionally, the heavy-handed use of CGI in \\"The Hyped Disappointment\\" lent the movie an artificial feel, detracting from its visual appeal. Although it is evident that the production team invested significantly in special effects, their overuse diminished the value of practical effects and overshadowed the human elements of the story. In conclusion, \\"The Hyped Disappointment\\" falls short of expectations in almost every respect, with a weak script, poor pacing, an inconsistent tone, and a squandered cast. With so much potential, it's a genuine shame that this film turned out to be yet another costly misfire for both the fans and the production team. This lackluster offering is one to be missed, and one can only hope that the creators will learn from their mistakes and return to the drawing board for any future attempts in a similar vein."},{"question":"Solve -42*w + 69 = -15 for w. Solve this problem.","response":"Alright, let's solve this problem step by step. We have this equation: -42 * w + 69 = -15 Our goal is to find the value of 'w'. So, we need to get 'w' all by itself on one side of the equal sign. First, let's subtract 69 from both sides of the equation. This will help us get rid of the 69 on the left side: -42 * w + 69 - 69 = -15 - 69 This simplifies to: -42 * w = -84 Now, we need to isolate 'w'. Since -42 is being multiplied by 'w', we can do the opposite, which is dividing by -42, to both sides of the equation. This will cancel out the -42 on the left side: (-42 * w) / -42 = -84 / -42 Now this simplifies to: w = 2 So, the value of 'w' is 2."},{"question":"Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: I watched the DVD (called BLACK WIDOW in the U.S.A.) and felt afterward that it was, indeed, a truly awful movie.

If the speaker is female, use vypnula. b. Verb \\"to talk\\" is in infinitive form, no change needed. 5. Combine the translated elements of each part in the correct word order for Czech, which is subject-verb-object, while maintaining the context: a. Já vypnul to. (Já vypnula to for female speaker) b. Já nechci mluvit s ní. Final translation: \\"Já vypnul to. Já nechci mluvit s ní.\\" (masculine) \\"Já vypnula to. Já nechci mluvit s ní.\\" (feminine) In this translation, I considered Czech grammar, verb conjugation, and word order rules to ensure a faithful and accurate translation."},{"question":"Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema, (; born Lourens Alma Tadema Dutch pronunciation: ['l^ur@ns 'alma: 'ta:d@,ma:]; 8 January 1836 - 25 June 1912) was a Dutch painter of special British denizenship. Alma-Tadema's output decreased with time, partly on account of health, but also because of his obsession with decorating his new home, to which he moved in 1883. Nevertheless, he continued to exhibit throughout the 1880s and into the next decade, receiving a plentiful amount of accolades along the way, including the medal of Honour at the Paris Exposition Universelle of 1889, election to an honorary member of the Oxford University Dramatic Society in 1890, the Great Gold Medal at the International Exposition in Brussels of 1897. In 1899 he was Knighted in England, only the eighth artist from the Continent to receive the honour. Not only did he assist with the organisation of the British section at the 1900 Exposition Universelle in Paris, he also exhibited two works that earned him the Grand Prix Diploma. He also assisted with the St. Louis World's Fair of 1904 where he was well represented and received. During this time, Alma-Tadema was very active with theatre design and production, designing many costumes. He also spread his artistic boundaries and began to design furniture, often modelled after Pompeian or Egyptian motifs, illustrations, textiles, and frame making. His diverse interests highlight his talents. Each of these exploits were used in his paintings, as he often incorporated some of his designed furniture into the composition, and must have used many of his own designs for the clothing of his female subjects. Through his last period of creativity Alma-Tadema continued to produce paintings, which repeat the successful formula of women in marble terraces overlooking the sea such as in Silver Favourites (1903). Between 1906 and his death six years later, Alma-Tadema painted less but still produced ambitious paintings like The Finding of Moses (1904). On 15 August 1909 Alma-Tadema's wife, Laura, died at the age of fifty-seven. The grief-stricken widower outlived his second wife by less than three years. His last major composition was Preparation in the Coliseum (1912). In the summer of 1912, Alma Tadema was accompanied by his daughter Anna to Kaiserhof Spa, Wiesbaden, Germany where he was to undergo treatment for ulceration of the stomach. He died there on 28 June 1912 at the age of seventy-six. He was buried in a crypt in St Paul's Cathedral in London.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What other things inspired his work?","response":"Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema was inspired by many things, such as designing furniture with Pompeian or Egyptian motifs, creating illustrations, textiles, and frame making.

They argue about the Bible but support each other during difficult times. Step 2: Identify possible reasons for contradictions Let's examine some possible reasons for why these contradictions may occur: 1. Diverse perspectives: People come from different backgrounds and have their own views, experiences, and beliefs, which can lead to different interpretations of the same text. 2. Human nature: It's a part of human nature to have some level of inconsistency in beliefs and actions. Often, people may not be aware of the contradictions in their views and actions. 3. Emphasizing personal opinions: Some people may prioritize their own opinions and experiences over official teachings of the church, leading to contradictions. 4. Lack of clear guidance on certain topics: The Bible can sometimes be vague or open to interpretation on certain issues, making it difficult for people to reach a consensus.

Let's analyze the different elements that support this interpretation: 1. \\"trying to make head or tail of the story\\": This part of the phrase suggests that the story is difficult to understand or decipher, which is usually interpreted as a negative aspect. When something is described as challenging to make sense of, it implies that the person expressing this view does not find the content easily accessible or enjoyable. 2. \\"in the hip-hop indie snipes\\": This phrase references the context of the story, and mentioning \\"snipes\\" has a negative connotation because it suggests that there are conflicts or tensions within the hip-hop indie scene. Although this part does not directly express a positive or negative view, it provides a background for the overall negative perspective. 3. \\"is enough to give you brain strain\\": This segment explicitly conveys a negative sentiment. By stating that trying to comprehend the story causes \\"brain strain,\\" the speaker implies that the effort required to understand the narrative is so significant that it may lead to mental discomfort or exhaustion. This part is a strong indicator that the phrase should be considered negative. 4. \\"and the pay-off is negligible\\": This final part of the phrase is also negative in nature, as it conveys that the outcome or reward obtained from trying to understand the story is minimal or insignificant. In other words, the speaker believes that the effort put into making sense of the content is not worth the eventual outcome, highlighting a sense of disappointment or dissatisfaction. In summary, the phrase should be considered negative due to the presence of various elements that express disappointment, difficulty, and dissatisfaction with the story in question. Although there is a mention of the context, it does not significantly impact the overall negative sentiment expressed in the phrase."},{"question":"Premise: Adrin and Jon stood, pistols in hand and swords at the ready as they faced the last of the Sticks.

Buhari is the first sub-Saharan African leader to have a White House summit with Trump, who has been criticized for reportedly making derogatory comments about Africa. During his public remarks with Buhari, Trump focused mostly on common goals and shared interests, such as fighting terrorism and expanding trade. \\"We love helicopters — he loves them more than I do,\\" joked Trump, referring to his administration's decision to approve a 600 million military sales deal to Nigeria. Buhari thanked Trump for approving the deal, which the administration of former President Barack Obama had suspended over allegations of human rights abuses. \\"I worked it out so that now you can buy the helicopters that you want,\\" Trump said, adding, \\"We make the best military equipment in the world, and our friends can now buy it.\\" Human rights groups have accused the Nigerian military of torture, rape and extrajudicial killing in its almost decade-long campaign against the Boko Haram extremist group. Tens of thousands of people have been killed in the insurgency, and hundreds of schoolgirls kidnapped, as the group gained notoriety and spread to neighboring countries, posing one of the most severe threats to West Africa's Sahel region in recent years. Although Nigeria has been a major partner in the U.S. fight against Islamist extremists in Africa, relations have faced challenges over the past year. In January, Nigeria joined a list of outraged African countries demanding an explanation from the U.S. ambassador after Trump's reported vulgar comments referring to African countries. Asked whether those comments came up during his private meeting with Trump, Buhari declined to comment. \\"I'm very careful with what the press says about other than myself.

Is there any relation between inflation and debt? Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","response":"No, these two questions are asking about different things, but they are related in terms of economics. Let me explain it to you in a simpler way. Imagine you have a candy shop. If you have lots of candies (lots of goods in the economy), but not a lot of people buying it (not enough demand), you might lower the price to sell more candies. This is like unemployment: if there are a lot of workers but not enough jobs, then there will be more people unemployed. On the other hand, inflation is like if you decided to print more candy money that kids use to buy candies. If now there's more candy money around but the same amount of candy, each candy's price will go up. This is like inflation: if there's more money in the economy but the same amount of goods, then prices in general will go up. As for the second question, debt is like if you borrow candy from someone promising to pay them back more later. If there's inflation (if candies' prices go up), then the extra candy you have to give back won't be as big a deal. But if there's deflation (candies' prices go down), that extra candy might be harder to get. So, although these two questions are asking about two different topics (inflation & unemployment, and inflation & debt), they are both related because they discuss how inflation impacts different aspects of our economy."},{"question":"Please add punctuation to this: Transfer from Eilat ETH airport to Taba","response":"Transfer from Eilat (ETH) Airport to Taba."},{"question":"To vyřídím.

Question: The king strolled through his back courtyard, where was near? Options: A. palace B. garden C. country estate D. large house E. suburbs Answer:","response":"B. garden Justification: The king is described to be strolling through 'his back courtyard.' Courtyards are often associated with palaces and houses formulating a part of the property. The term 'back' suggests a proximity to the king's residential place. Among the options, 'palace' would make the most sense as it is typically where a king resides. However, 'back courtyard' suggests an outdoor space which logically could include a garden, making 'garden' the more fitting answer. 'Country estate' could be a possibility, but it's much more ambiguous, since estates can be far-flung and not necessarily close to the king. 'Large house' might be a potential answer but would not be as typical a residence for a king as a palace. 'Suburbs' is quite unlikely as they denote a residential area, often some distance from the central part of the city, and it is unlikely that a king's palace is situated in such an area. Therefore, the option that aligns best with common sense would be B. garden."},{"question":"The hotter a main sequence star is, the brighter it is. Rachel was looking into the night sky.

Passage:The name \\"Lord Haw-Haw of Zeesen\\" was coined in 1939 by the pseudonymous Daily Express radio critic Jonah Barrington, but this referred initially to Wolf Mittler (or possibly Norman Baillie-Stewart). When Joyce became the best-known propaganda broadcaster, the nickname was transferred to him. Joyce's broadcasts initially came from studios in Berlin, later transferring (because of heavy Allied bombing) to Luxembourg and finally to Apen near Hamburg, and were relayed over a network of German-controlled radio stations that included Hamburg, Bremen, Luxembourg, Hilversum, Calais, Oslo, and Zeesen. Joyce also broadcast on and wrote scripts for the German Büro Concordia organisation, which ran several black propaganda stations, many of which pretended to broadcast illegally from within Britain. His role in writing the scripts increased over time, and the German radio capitalized on his public persona. Initially an anonymous broadcaster, Joyce eventually revealed his real name to his listeners; and he would occasionally be announced as \\"William Joyce, otherwise known as Lord Haw-Haw\\". Urban legends soon circulated about Lord Haw-Haw, alleging that the broadcaster was well-informed about political and military events to the point of near-omniscience. Links: a. Radio Luxembourg b.

A U.S. interagency group traveled to Saudi Arabia twice, in 1999 and 2000, to get information from the Saudis about their understanding of those finances. The group eventually concluded that the oft-repeated assertion that Bin Laden was funding al Qaeda from his personal fortune was in fact not true. The officials developed a new theory: al Qaeda was getting its money elsewhere, and the United States needed to focus on other sources of funding, such as charities, wealthy donors, and financial facilitators. Ultimately, although the intelligence community devoted more resources to the issue and produced somewhat more intelligence, it remained difficult to distinguish al Qaeda's financial transactions among the vast sums moving in the international financial system. The CIA was not able to find or disrupt al Qaeda's money flows. The NSC staff thought that one possible solution to these weaknesses in the intelligence community was to create an all-source terrorist-financing intelligence analysis center. Clarke pushed for the funding of such a center at Treasury, but neither Treasury nor the CIA was willing to commit the resources. Within the United States, various FBI field offices gathered intelligence on organizations suspected of raising funds for al Qaeda or other terrorist groups. By 9/11, FBI agents understood that there were extremist organizations operating within the United States supporting a global jihadist movement and with substantial connections to al Qaeda. The FBI operated a web of informants, conducted electronic surveillance, and had opened significant investigations in a number of field offices, including New York, Chicago, Detroit, San Diego, and Minneapolis. On a national level, however, the FBI never used the information to gain a systematic or strategic understanding of the nature and extent of al Qaeda fundraising. Treasury regulators, as well as U.S. financial institutions, were generally focused on finding and deterring or disrupting the vast flows of U.S. currency generated by drug trafficking and high-level international fraud. Large-scale scandals, such as the use of the Bank of New York by Russian money launderers to move millions of dollars out of Russia, captured the attention of the Department of the Treasury and of Congress. Before 9/11, Treasury did not consider terrorist financing important enough to mention in its national strategy for money laundering.

The clip ends with the final fade out and it is being shown in a small screening room somewhere in Hollywood. The elderly star of the film, Byron Orlock (Boris Karloff), tells the producer Marshall Smith (Monty Landis) that he has decided to retire from acting because he considers his performance no longer frightening in mainstream society. Marshall and the film's director Sammy Michaels (director Peter Bogdanovich) try to convince him to appear in their next film, but Orlok refuses and plans to return to his native England to live out the rest of his days, and refuses to even read the new script that Sammy gives to him. Orlok walks out with his young secretary Jenny (Nancy Hsueh), whom is Sammy's current girlfriend. Sammy follows him outside to persuade him to stay in Hollywood, but Orlok tells Sammy that he considers himself to be an anachronism because people are no longer frightened by horror pictures. \\"The world belongs to the young.

Article: Fish have ears. Really. They're quite small and have no opening to the outside world carrying sound through the body. For the past seven years, Simon Thorrold, a university professor, has been examining fish ears, small round ear bones called otoliths. As fish grow, so do their otoliths. Each day, their otoliths gain a ring of calcium carbonate . By looking through a microscope and counting these rings, Thorrold can determine the exact age of a young fish. As a fish gets older, its otoliths no longer get daily rings. Instead, they get yearly rings, which can also be counted, giving information about the fish's age, just like the growth rings of a tree. Ring counting is nothing new to fish scientists. But Thorrold has turned to a new direction. They're examining the chemical elements of each otolith ring. The daily ring gives us the time, but chemistry tells us about the environment in which the fish swam on any given day. These elements tell us about the chemistry of the water that the fish was in. It also says something about water temperature, which determines how much of these elements will gather within each otolith ring. Thorrold can tell, for example, if a fish spent time in the open ocean before entering the less salty water of coastal areas. He can basically tell where fish are spending their time at any given stage of history. In the case of the Atlantic croaker, a popular saltwater food fish, Thorrold and his assistant have successfully followed the travelling of young fish from mid-ocean to the coast, a journey of many hundreds of miles. This is important to managers in the fish industry, who know nearly nothing about the track of the young fish for most food fish in the ocean. Eager to learn about his technology, fish scientists are now lending Thorrold their ears. Question: Why does the writer compare the fish to trees? Options: A: Trees gain a growth ring each day. B: Trees also have otoliths. C: Their growth rings are very small. D: They both have growth rings.","response":"D: They both have growth rings."},{"question":"Answer the following question: My best story is about Santa Claus. A mall Santa had a heart attack at work and was rushed to the Emergency Room in full cardiac arrest. Let me explain that a person playing Santa is generally a certain age (white beard) and body type (round) that is predisposed to cardiac disease. We did everything we could but ultimately our efforts were futile. The mall Santa rode his sleigh into the great beyond. A mother, there to visit another patient, was insistent that her 7–8 year old son be allowed back to visit his grandmother. We had a strict 12 year old age limit visitation policy. I was called to speak with her. ”Why do you have such a stupid Draconian policy?” She insisted. “The Emergency Room is no place for a child ma’am. Besides, the germs and infections he may be exposed to, there are things he may see or hear that a child would have a hard time processing,” I explained. “Like what?” She argued. “Well, there are people in pain moaning,” I answered. “And drunks cursing at the staff. It’s a tough place.” “He’s fine,” she insisted. “I think I know how to parent. I don’t need you to worry about what my son is able to handle.” I caved in and allowed her back. As we passed the room with the dead Santa, a tech exited and opened the curtain. Her child looked in and saw Santa’s lifeless body, ET tube sticking out of his throat, boots still on but costume cut to shreds and strewn across the room. The child lost it! “Mom, Santa Claus is Dead!” He cried. “I’m not going to get anything for Christmas.” “Why would someone open the curtain?” The mother demanded. “I warned you,” I said. “That’s why we have a 12 years and above visitation policy.” She was not happy. Come to find out the child had his picture made with that very Santa a few days prior. Very ironic. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: The doctors probably spent how long trying to save Santa? Options: A. A couple of hours. B. not enough information C. All night. D. Several days. Answer:","response":"B. not enough information"},{"question":"Neighborhood Legal Services, which provides free legal services to the poor, has expanded into the San Gabriel and Pomona valleys, areas with large Asian populations, many of whom speak limited or no English. Language is their biggest obstacle, but the Asian communities' cultural isolation and service providers' lack of cultural expertise also play a part, said NLS executive director Neal Dubovitz. And with 13 percent to 15 percent of the Asian population in the U.S. living below the poverty line, NLS services are badly needed, Dubovitz said. \\"Although it is a significant part of the poverty population, Asians historically have not been able to participate in the services and programs available to the poor,\\" he said. From simple telephone advice to complete legal representation in court, the agency provides free consumer, health, family, immigration, housing, public benefits and labor legal services to people who earn under 1,380 per month. Legal service providers have long served large Latino populations, who have cultural diversity but share a common language. \\"I remember the days when there were only a handful of people in the legal offices who spoke Spanish,\\" Dudovitz said. \\"Now Spanish and English are interchangeable. Our goal is to have that for the major Asian languages as well.\\" Before the expansion, only a few NLS lawyers spoke Asian languages, said attorney Rebecca Yee, who was hired by NLS in April 2002 to design and head the project. \\"Now we have people speaking Cantonese, Mandarin, Thai, Khmer (from Cambodia), Korean, Vietnamese, Japanese and Tagalog,\\" Yee said. One of the 13 attorneys hired to work with the program is Irene Mak, a family law attorney who speaks Cantonese, Mandarin and Thai. Mak was a partner at a private law firm before she went to work for NLS two years ago, earning up to 20,000 less a year working on domestic violence cases. \\"The job is more satisfying than the money,\\" said Mak, who grew up in Hong Kong and Thailand before coming to the United States. \\"I could use my language skills and wanted to give back to the Asian community.\\" NLS expanded when Legal Services Corp., the federal agency that funds providers of free legal services nationwide, reduced the number of grantees in the Los Angeles area from five to three, Dudovitz said. NLS won the competitive grant over the Legal Services Program for Pasadena, San Gabriel-Pomona valleys. That boosted its client base from 16,000 to around 25,000, and NLS opened an office in El Monte.

Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy creates an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters or rarely as much as a few meters. Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur ( Figure below ).

The Chengdu Economic Daily reported that a cockroach crawled into the ear of a 60-year-old man in Chengdu on February 1. As a last resort, after trying by every means he could think of - including tooth picks and tweezers - to scoop the invader out after almost three days, the frustrated man sprayed pesticide into his ear canal, which killed the pest. However, the carcass of the cockroach remained stuck in the man's ear, which had turned swollen from the external irritation and chemicals in the pesticide. He went to a major hospital to remove the pest, which was found to be about 1cm long.

King Intharacha of Ayutthaya forced the former Kingdom of Sukhothai to recognize his authority in 1410. The king then invaded Lan Na in 1411, seizing Chiang Rai but failing to capture Chiang Mai and Phayao. In the latter battle the two sides may have used early cannons. In 1424 King Borommarachathirat II ascended the throne of Ayutthaya. After a seven-month siege, he captured Angkor by treachery in 1431. The Khmer retook the city in 1432 and subsequently transferred their capital to Phnom Penh. The sixth son of the Lan Na king Sam Fang Kaen, Thao Lok, ascended the throne in the aftermath of coup against his father in 1441. Thao Lok was crowned as king Tilokaraj of Lan na, later banishing his father Sam Fang Kaen to Muong Shan in the Shan States.

The film has a perfect opportunity for laughs, but surprisingly wanders aimlessly as we see a bizarre collection of characters such a woman who sold her soul to the devil and can shoot out flames of fire from her mouth, a man who appears to be a vampire, and a lunatic killer dressed as a woman and wears sacks over his head. You have the class president who believes he's the best thing since sliced bread(but as we see in the film, he's a coward and joke), a couple of pot smokers who don't even know they are at their own class reunion, and a man named Gary for whom know one even knew existed(and no one can seem to remember his name..this is the one running joke I enjoyed). There is a plump pervert who likes to grab women in inappropriate places, a deaf and blind woman who has a screeching holler when calling for her dog, and the cook(you know her from \\"goonies\\" and \\"Throw Mama From The Train\\")who loves to place food on people's plates with her hands! The film is essentially about a nutcase who is(or at least attempting to)taking revenge on his classmates for a gag they pulled on him(they arranged for him to sleep with his own twin sister!).

Trim an airplane. Trim the photograph.","response":"To determine if the word \\"trim\\" is used in the same way in these two sentences, we need to analyze the context and intended meaning of each sentence. 1. \\"Trim an airplane.\\" In this context, the word \\"trim\\" likely refers to adjusting an airplane to achieve a balanced state in flight, such as adjusting flaps, trim tabs, or the center of gravity. In aviation, the term \\"trim\\" is commonly used to describe the process of balancing an airplane to maintain a particular heading, pitch, or attitude while maintaining a constant speed. This allows the pilot to release pressure on the controls and maintain a stable flight. Step 1: Identify the context of the term \\"trim\\" in the sentence. Step 2: Relate the term to the specific domain (aviation). 2. \\"Trim the photograph.\\" In this context, the word \\"trim\\" means to cut away the edges of the photograph to improve its appearance or to fit it into a desired size. This involves removing parts of the photograph, most likely using a cutting tool such as scissors or a paper cutter. Step 1: Identify the context of the term \\"trim\\" in the sentence. Step 2: Understand the meaning related to the specific object (photograph). After carefully analyzing both sentences, we can conclude that the word \\"trim\\" is not used in the same way in these two sentences. In the first sentence, \\"trim\\" refers to adjusting an airplane for balanced flight, while in the second sentence, \\"trim\\" refers to cutting away the edges of a photograph for aesthetic or practical purposes."},{"question":"In these two sentences (1) Spin silk.

Step 2: Compare the meanings of the word \\"spin\\" in both sentences: - In sentence 1, \\"spin\\" refers to the physical action of twisting and creating a thread from fibers. - In sentence 2, \\"spin\\" refers to the way the creek flows and changes direction throughout the woods. Step 3: Determine whether the meanings are the same: - The meanings of \\"spin\\" in the two sentences are not the same. In the first sentence, it refers to a specific action related to fibers and thread, while in the second sentence, it is used metaphorically to describe the movement or path of the creek through the woods.

Walk slightly ahead of them, carrying menus and silverware to the table where you want them to sit. Ask if the table is okay before the customers sit down. Most customers expect to wait at least 10 minutes to be seated at a restaurant, especially if they didn’t have a reservation. If your guests have waited much longer than that, offer a sincere apology as you show them to their table. Ask management if it’s okay to comp them a free drink or appetizer (but don’t offer it to the guests until you get permission). If the restaurant is slow, try to seat guests at a table that’s not directly next to another full table. Of course, if the restaurant is very busy, guests will have to sit near other diners, but try to make sure all of your guests have enough space to be comfortable. By seating guests in rotating sections, you’ll help ensure that all of your servers are able to make money for the night. Rotating stations will also help keep servers from becoming overwhelmed by getting several tables at the same time. You never want to throw all of the menus down on a table, as this seems rude and dismissive. Instead, carefully lay a menu and silverware at each place setting, and make sure your guests are seated before you leave the table. Be prepared to get water or other small items for guests. If they request more than that, politely let them know that their server will be right with them. You’re the last person guests will have contact with, so offer a friendly farewell to guests as they walk out the door. This will help them leave feeling like they had a pleasant dining experience. What is a summary of what this article is about?","response":"The article provides a guide for restaurant staff on how to properly seat customers and ensure a pleasant dining experience. Key points include walking at a comfortable pace, carrying menus and silverware, confirming table preferences, managing wait times and potential compensations, seating arrangements, rotating server sections, properly placing menus and silverware, attending to minor guest needs, and offering a friendly farewell upon departure."},{"question":"1.

The baby liked playing with the rattle more than playing with the ball because the","response":"sound it produced was enchanting to his little ears. The bright colors of the rattle also seemed to interest him more than the plain blue ball that lay forgotten in the corner of the playpen. His eyes sparkled with joy as he shook the rattle, listening intently to the sound it produced, creating a symphony that only he could fully appreciate. One day, as the baby sat on the carpet, shaking his beloved rattle, a tiny beam of sunlight streamed in from a small crack in the curtains. The light reflected off the rattle, casting an array of colors across the room. The baby, completely captivated by the dazzling sight, stopped shaking the rattle for a moment. He then tilted it from side to side, watching as the colors danced along the walls and ceiling. His mother, Ella, stood in the doorway with a smile as she watched her little one play. Her heart swelled with love and pride as she saw him discovering the world around him. The simple joys of a child, Ella thought, had a certain magic to them that rejuvenated even the most tired and weary soul. As the baby continued to play with the rattle and the sunlight, he suddenly noticed something peculiar. The sound of the rattle seemed to change, to take on a different quality. It was as if each shake of the rattle was forming a pattern of sound, an intricate melody that he had never heard before. The baby was fascinated by this development and began to shake the rattle even more intently, experimenting with different speeds and movements to see what sounds he could create. As he continued, he noticed that every time he created a unique melody, the colorful patterns produced by the sunlight changed too, almost as if they were responding to the music. Intrigued and delighted, he continued to play, creating an ever-changing display of colors and sounds that filled the room with a sense of wonder. As Ella watched, she couldn't help but feel amazed at the incredible luck of having such a curious and imaginative child. She had always believed that the key to a fulfilling life was to never lose one's sense of wonder and curiosity, and seeing her baby explore new combinations of sounds and lights with his simple rattle filled her with an indescribable sense of happiness. The baby's father, Jack, joined Ella in the doorway and wrapped his arms around her. Together, they watched their little one play, completely absorbed in his world of color and sound. Jack whispered into Ella's ear, \\"We made that. We created that incredible little person.\\" Ella nodded, tears welling up in her eyes as she felt the enormity of the responsibility and the love they had for their child. They both knew that their lives had changed forever the moment their baby was born, and every day since had been a new adventure filled with joy, laughter, and learning. As the sunlight slowly began to fade, the vibrant colors on the walls receded, and the once enchanting melody returned to its original simple sound. The baby eventually grew tired and let the rattle fall onto the carpet with a gentle thud. His eyes fluttered shut, and he drifted off to sleep, his mind filled with beautiful dreams of the colorful symphony he had created. Ella and Jack carefully lifted their precious baby, placing him in his crib and pulling up the soft, warm blanket. As they tiptoed out of the room, the only sound remaining was the gentle rhythm of their baby's breath. And they knew that, no matter what challenges life may bring, they would be there to guide and nurture the limitless potential that lay within their child, cultivating his curiosity and love for the world around him. And who knows what other magical adventures the baby would create when playing with his rattle and the sunlight? Only time would tell, but one thing was certain: they would be there to watch and marvel at each of those wonderful moments."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: Given a sentence in English language, translate the sentence to Tagalog language keeping the meaning of the original sentence intact.

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","response":"No, the answer you found on Google is not the correct answer to your question about the classification of dogs. Dogs are not classified by their value as a food source, which is a cultural and ethical consideration rather than a biological one. Instead, dogs are classified biologically as part of the Animal Kingdom, having descended from common mammalian ancestors. A dog's full scientific classification is as follows: - Kingdom: Animalia - This is the highest level of classification, which encompasses all animals. - Phylum: Chordata - This includes animals that possess, at some point in their lifecycle, a notochord (a cartilaginous skeletal rod), a dorsal nerve cord, an endostyle, and a post-anal tail. - Class: Mammalia - This class includes animals that are warm-blooded, with hair or fur, and have the capability to breastfeed their young. This class also utilizes the neocortex region of the brain for higher functions. - Order: Carnivora - Dogs are part of this order, which consists of mammals that predominantly consume meat, although some are omnivores. - Family: Canidae - This family is also known as canines, which includes dogs, wolves, foxes, and other dog-like mammals. - Genus: Canis - This includes wolves, jackals, and dogs. Members of this genus are distinguished by their sharp teeth and claws, and a strong sense of smell. - Species: Canis lupus - Subspecies: Canis lupus familiaris - This is the classification of the domestic dog, descended from wolves. It's important to note each of these categories getting increasingly specific as you move down the list, culminating at the subspecies level, which specifies what we commonly understand as the domestic dog. So no, the fact that dogs are a food source in some cultures is not their classification, this statement is more related to cultural practices rather then biological taxonomy."},{"question":"foucault’s thoughts have managed become a sort of default in every branch of social science (except perhaps economics). at several western universities, he is today the most cited social science theorist.

Stream of consciousness reasoning: When thinking about the human body and its structure, we typically consider that it's comprised of bones, tissues, and organs. The skeletal system is fundamental to maintaining our body's form and allowing for our movement. It's interesting to note that while the adult human body contains 206 bones, the number of bones in newborn babies is different. Newborns have around 270 bones, many of which are cartilaginous and hadn't fused together yet. As a baby grows into an adult, several of these bones gradually fuse together, decreasing the total number of bones present. One example of this is the human skull, which forms from separate bones that later join together at the sutures. So, the number of bones for an adult is 206, while the number of bones in a baby is roughly 270. Finally, I would like to consider that our current discussion might be slightly off. In that case, one could consider a unique situation in which an adult has 205 bones due to a genetic variation, congenital condition, or surgical intervention."},{"question":"Generate a sentence that describes the following data: Adisham Hall, country, Sri Lanka; Sri Lanka, leader, Ranil Wickremesinghe; Sri Lanka, capital, Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte.

Answer:","response":"In the 2016 live-action adaptation of \\"The Jungle Book,\\" the song \\"I Wanna Be Like You\\" is performed by Christopher Walken, who voices the character King Louie. This iconic song was originally written by Robert B. Sherman and Richard M. Sherman for the 1967 animated film by Disney. The 2016 version of the song maintains the classic jazz elements and upbeat rhythm while adding a few modern twists. In this contemporary adaptation directed by Jon Favreau, King Louie is portrayed as a gigantic Gigantopithecus, an extinct species of great ape, instead of an orangutan as in the original animated film. The song \\"I Wanna Be Like You\\" is featured during the scene where King Louie tries to convince Mowgli, the human boy raised by wolves, to give him the secret of the 'red flower' (fire). King Louie believes that by obtaining the power of fire, he can become more human-like and establish his rule in the jungle. He sings this song to express his desire to be like Mowgli and harness the power that humans possess. Walken's performance adds an extra layer of depth to King Louie's character, showcasing both his ambition and charisma. The 2016 adaptation of \\"The Jungle Book\\" features a star-studded cast, including Neel Sethi as Mowgli, and voice talents such as Bill Murray as Baloo, Ben Kingsley as Bagheera, Idris Elba as Shere Khan, Lupita Nyong'o as Raksha, and Scarlett Johansson as Kaa. The movie seamlessly blends live-action with advanced CGI technology to create a visually stunning and immersive experience for its audience. Much like the 1967 animated film, the 2016 version also incorporates other cherished songs such as \\"The Bare Necessities\\" and \\"Trust in Me\\" into its soundtrack."},{"question":"Write a dialog with this premise \\"Samantha has just passed Audley End in the train.

Scoop its entire body up in your hand in a single movement. When you’re holding the dragon, make sure to support its full body, including legs and tail. If you pick a dragon up suddenly from the rear, it may mistake your hand for a predator and bite you. Never pick a dragon up by its tail. Unlike other lizards, their tails do not regenerate. You could cause serious harm to your lizard by grabbing it by its tail. If your dragon becomes aggressive and tries to bite you once you have picked it up, hold its body firmly with one hand (so its jaws can’t reach your fingers) and use your other hand to stroke its back. This will soothe the dragon and teach it that human contact is not a cause for fear. If the dragon continues to act aggressively—or becomes even more aggressive—set it back in its cage. Wait 5 minutes, and pick the dragon up again. Be careful, however, as this effectively \\"rewards\\" the dragon for acting aggressively. If possible, it's better to hold the dragon until it calms down and then replace it in the cage so that it learns that calm behavior will help it get what it wants. Aggressive dragons take longer to train, but don’t give up hope. Given enough time, they’ll get used to being touched and handled. Frequent human contact is the best way for a bearded dragon to learn that you are not a threat. Hold and handle your dragon daily, for about 10 minutes at a time, and it will become increasingly tame and comfortable with your presence. Dragons will become stressed if they’re handled for long periods of time. It’s better to have multiple, short handling sessions each day rather than a single, long session. Once your dragon has become accustomed to being touched and handled by you, you can train it to eat out of your hand. Simply hold a mealworm between two fingers and extend it near the dragon’s mouth. If your dragon is very comfortable with being handled out of its cage, you can hold a mealworm in your palm and let the dragon eat out of your hand. Prior to this point, you’ll need to feed your dragon in its cage using tweezers. Use the tweezers to drop mealworms down near your dragon. Summary:","response":"When picking up a bearded dragon, move your hand slowly and support its whole body. Don't grab its tail or scare it. If it tries to bite you, hold it firmly and gently stroke its back to calm it down. Practice holding the dragon for 10 minutes each day to help it get used to you. Once it's comfortable, you can teach it to eat from your hand.

To prevent breast cancer, or at least minimize the risk, follow these steps: 1. Maintain a healthy lifestyle: Adopting a healthy lifestyle can help lower the risk of developing breast cancer. This includes eating a well-balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Also, limit processed and red meat, and consume foods low in saturated fats and high in fiber. 2. Maintain a healthy body weight: Being overweight or obese increases the risk of breast cancer, especially after menopause. Regular exercise, combined with a balanced diet, can help maintain an ideal body weight. 3. Regular physical activity: Engaging in physical activity for at least 150 minutes per week can help reduce the risk of breast cancer. Exercise can also help maintain a healthy weight and boost the immune system. 4. Limit alcohol consumption: Consuming alcohol increases the risk of breast cancer. It is advisable to limit alcohol intake or abstain from it altogether. 5. Breastfeed your children if possible: Studies have shown that breastfeeding can help reduce the risk of breast cancer. Try to breastfeed for a minimum of six months or longer if possible. 6. Avoid exposure to radiation: Unnecessary exposure to radiation should be avoided, especially from medical imaging tests like CT scans, unless absolutely required for medical reasons. 7. Consider hormone therapy carefully: Long-term use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT), especially combined estrogen and progesterone therapy, can increase the risk of breast cancer. If you're considering HRT, discuss the benefits and risks with your healthcare provider. 8. Be aware of your family history: If you have a family history of breast cancer, especially in close family members like a mother or sister, inform your healthcare provider. They may recommend regular screenings or genetic testing to assess your risk. 9. Regular screenings and self-exams: Early detection is key in treating breast cancer effectively. Conduct monthly breast self-exams to look for changes, and follow the recommended screening guidelines for mammograms based on your age and risk factors. 10. Talk to your healthcare provider: Your healthcare provider can help assess your risk for breast cancer, provide personalized recommendations, and guide you on what lifestyle and screening measures are appropriate for you. Remember, these steps aim at reducing the risk of breast cancer but do not guarantee complete prevention. It is essential to stay vigilant and lead a healthy lifestyle to minimize the risk of developing the disease."},{"question":"Read the following paragraph and determine if the hypothesis is true: Here we go!

Chain of thought:","response":"Yes, looks are the easiest way to tell rosemary and lavender apart, although they do have some similarities in terms of their color and growth habit. Here's a detailed comparison of the two plants to help you distinguish between them: 1. Leaves: - Rosemary: The leaves are needle-like, dark green on the top, and slightly silvery underneath. They have a tough texture and are quite straight. - Lavender: The leaves are also needle-like, but they are softer, broader, and shorter when compared to rosemary. Lavender leaves tend to have a grayish-green color and are covered in fine hairs, which give them a silvery appearance. 2. Flowers: - Rosemary: The flowers are small and usually blue, white, or pink in color. They bloom in clusters along the stem, and the flowering season lasts from late winter to early summer. - Lavender: The flowers are small and typically purple, although they can also be blue, pink, or white in some varieties. Lavender flowers bloom in long, spike-like clusters over the summer months. 3. Aroma: - Rosemary: The leaves of this plant have a strong, resinous, and slightly minty scent. When crushed, the aroma releases oils that are commonly used in cooking and offer a refreshing quality. - Lavender: Lavender emits a sweet, floral, and slightly herbal fragrance. The aroma is soothing and calming, making it popular for use in perfumes, candles, and herbal remedies. 4. Growth habit: - Rosemary: This is an evergreen shrub that grows up to 6 feet tall in ideal conditions. Its overall shape is upright and bushy, with branches that tend to grow straight upward. - Lavender: Lavender is generally smaller, with a more rounded, mounding growth habit. Most lavender plants grow to be 1-3 feet tall and wide. 5. Cultural requirements: - Rosemary: This plant prefers full sun, well-draining soil, and a Mediterranean-type climate. It is fairly drought-tolerant when established and doesn't require much care once it's growing well. - Lavender: Lavender plants also enjoy full sun, well-draining soil, and a Mediterranean-type climate. They are drought-tolerant and require minimal care, but they might need more pruning to maintain their shape compared to rosemary. Using these distinct features of rosemary and lavender, you should be able to tell the two plants apart based on their appearance, scent, and growth habits."},{"question":"Seven Ways from Sundown is a 1960 American Eastmancolor Western film directed by Harry Keller and starring Audie Murphy and Barry Sullivan.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","response":"The perturbation hypothesis proposed suggests that owls would wait longer on a branch, and it seeks to understand whether this change would affect an owl's ability to see more prey. To address this hypothesis, let's first delve into the hunting process of owls and their unique abilities before discussing the potential effects of this change on their hunting success. Owls are predators that use a combination of highly sensitive hearing and keen night-vision to locate and catch their prey. Their hearing enables them to detect even the slightest sounds produced by their prey, such as rustling leaves or small movements, which is a crucial skill particularly when visibility is limited. Owls' exceptional vision allows them to detect prey in low-light environments by gathering more light with their large eyes and having a higher concentration of rod cells in their retinas. The hunting process of owls typically involves them sitting still on a perch like a stump or branch, remaining inconspicuous and waiting for potential prey to pass by. When they successfully locate prey, they fly silently, without flapping their wings, to avoid alerting their target of their approach. This stealthy flight is enabled by their specially adapted feathers that minimize turbulence and noise. Once they are close enough, the owl either silently glides or drops onto the prey, grabbing it with its sharp, powerful talons and beak. The prey is then either consumed or brought back to its perch. Now, let's consider the suggested perturbation hypothesis where owls wait longer on a branch. If owls were to wait longer on their perches, it might potentially increase the chances of spotting prey because they would be observing the surrounding area for an extended period. However, several factors could influence the outcome: 1. Prey abundance: One key factor is the abundance of prey in the hunting area. If an owl's hunting territory is rich in prey, waiting longer on a perch might not necessarily result in a significant increase in sightings, as the owl will already have an overall well-supplied area to hunt. 2. Prey activity level: The level of activity of prey animals in the hunting area also plays a role. If prey is less active during the time the owl is waiting on a perch, it might not result in an increased chance of sighting even if the owl waits longer. 3. Owl's energy conservation: Prolonged waiting periods on a perch mean that the owl will need to conserve more energy to continue its hunting activities. Owls might need to strike a balance between extended waiting times and energy conservation to ensure optimal hunting success. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis suggesting that owls wait longer on a branch might have an indirect effect on the hunting process. If an owl spends more time on its perch, it could potentially observe more prey in certain circumstances. However, various factors like prey abundance, prey activity level, and the owl's energy conservation need to be considered to determine whether this strategy would lead to higher hunting success."},{"question":"The journey begins from Mumbai to Kolhapur , Sindhudurg via Goa , Ajanta Ellora Caves , Nashik and back .

Answer: There are two indications, one from the initial pulse of the probe, and the second due to the back wall echo. Question: what is UT testing Answer:","response":"Ultrasonic Testing (UT) is a non-destructive testing (NDT) method that utilizes high-frequency ultrasonic waves to inspect and examine various materials and components for defects or discontinuities such as cracks, porosity, inclusions and other imperfections. UT testing is widely used across various industries, including aerospace, manufacturing, oil and gas, and power generation, for quality control and assurance, as well as predictive maintenance. In UT testing, ultrasonic waves are generated by a piezoelectric transducer, also known as a probe, which converts electrical energy into mechanical energy. The probe emits ultrasonic waves that travel through the material, and any imperfections or changes in the material will cause some of the ultrasonic waves to reflect back to the probe. The reflected waves are detected by the same transducer, which then transforms the mechanical energy back into electrical signals. These signals are processed, analyzed, and displayed on a screen, often as an A-scan, B-scan, or C-scan image. The duration of time taken by the ultrasonic waves to travel through the material and return to the probe is used to calculate the distance of the flaw from the surface and determines its size and orientation. Expert technicians and analysts can interpret these images to assess the defect's characteristics and determine whether it poses a concern to the structural integrity or functionality of the component. In regards to the answer provided, there are indeed two indications in a basic ultrasonic testing setup – one from the initial pulse of the probe and the second due to the back wall echo. The initial pulse is the point at which the transducer starts emitting the ultrasonic wave, while the back wall echo is the reflection of the ultrasonic waves from the back wall or the far boundary of the tested material. The time taken for the wave to travel from the initial pulse to the back wall echo reflects the thickness of the material. If a defect or discontinuity is present within the material, additional echoes will appear between the initial pulse and the back wall echo, thereby indicating the presence of a flaw. In conclusion, Ultrasonic Testing (UT) is a fast, reliable, and versatile non-destructive testing method that enables the detection and assessment of flaws and discontinuities in materials and components. The initial pulse and back wall echo are two fundamental indications in UT testing that help experts understand the material's geometry and identify defects. Thus, the answer \\"Yes\\" is accurate in this context."},{"question":"Translate the following sentence to Finnish: The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 noon.","response":"Äänestys tapahtuu huomenna kello 12.00 keskipäivällä."},{"question":"Translate to Romanian: Anyone with a chance of fleeing his dictatorship does so, and some are able to build a better life for themselves elsewhere.

Back in the mid 1990s when I worked in Southern California, I was returning from lunch one day with a coworker when we noticed two pickup trucks driving erratically. This was on Valley View Blvd in Cerritos which is a large roadway divided (by a large, planted median strip) with 3 lanes on either side. One truck seemed to be chasing the other when suddenly the lead truck made a quick U-turn and was followed by the second truck. But the second truck came to stop just after making the turn. This was when the driver of that truck got out, walked to the front of his vehicle, raised his arm holding a semi-automatic handgun, paused, and then fired a single shot. At this point, I was parallel with the shooter’s truck and only about 50–60 feet from where he was standing. I remember my coworker exclaiming, “Oh sh*t! Did he just shoot at the something?!” I floored my accelerator and sped off to my workplace which was about a 1/2 mile down Valley View Blvd. I parked and my coworker and I got into the building as quickly as we could. While he started telling our other coworkers about what we had just witnessed, I ran to my desk, called 911, and reported the shooting. The dispatcher kept me on the line after my initial report and then transferred me to a detective in order to take down my information. As it turns out, my information and the fact that I called 911 immediately resulted in the arrest of the shooter. I was later asked to testify in court which resulted in the shooters conviction. I lived in Southern California for 10 years and now I drive a commercial truck several days a week so I have PLENTY of other “road rage stories”, but this is still the craziest one.

Based on this information, we can conclude that the answer is \\"not enough information\\" as we don't have an exact speed or time given. However, if we assume that the driver was traveling at a reasonably fast speed after witnessing the shooting, it could have been a very short duration of time, maybe a few minutes or less."},{"question":"Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Baker was born into a staunch Methodist family, the youngest son of Birmingham Gas Department's chief accountant, Charles Frederick Baker and Millie Baker. His early schooling was at King Edwards Grammar School. His elder brothers, Leonard and Norman studied law, and he had a sister, Edna who was the oldest of them all. In his teens Baker began to question what religion meant to him and decided to become a Quaker, since it was closer to what he believed in. Throughout his practice, Baker became well known for designing and building low cost, high quality, beautiful homes, with a great portion of his work suited to or built for lower-middle to lower class clients. His buildings tend to emphasise prolific - at times virtuosic - masonry construction, instilling privacy and evoking history with brick jali walls, a perforated brick screen which invites a natural air flow to cool the buildings' interior, in addition to creating intricate patterns of light and shadow. Another significant Baker feature is irregular, pyramid-like structures on roofs, with one side left open and tilting into the wind. Baker's designs invariably have traditional Indian sloping roofs and terracotta Mangalore tile shingling with gables and vents allowing rising hot air to escape. Curved walls enter Baker's architectural vocabulary as a means to enclose more volume at lower material cost than straight walls, and for Laurie, \\"building [became] more fun with the circle.\\" A testament to his frugality, Baker was often seen rummaging through salvage heaps looking for suitable building materials, door and window frames, sometimes hitting a stroke of luck as evidenced by the intricately carved entry to the Chitralekha Film Studio (Aakulam, Trivandrum, 1974-76): a capricious architectural element found in a junk heap. Baker made many simple suggestions for cost reduction including the use of Rat trap bond for brick walls, having bends in walls that increased the strength and provided readymade shelves, thin concrete roofs and even simple precautions like shifting dug up soil into the built area rather that out of it. He advocated the use of low energy consuming mud walls, using holes in the wall to get light, using overlaid brick over doorways, incorporating places to sit into the structure, simpler windows and a variety of roof construction approaches. He liked bare brick surfaces and considered plastering and other embellishments as superfluous. Baker's architectural method is one of improvisation, in which initial drawings have only an idealistic link to the final construction, with most of the accommodations and design choices being made on-site by the architect himself. Compartments for milk bottles near the doorstep, windowsills that double as bench surfaces, and a heavy emphasis on taking cues from the natural condition of the site are just some examples. His Quaker-instilled respect for nature lead him to let the idiosyncrasies of a site inform his architectural improvisations, rarely is a topography line marred or a tree uprooted. This saves construction cost as well, since working around difficult site conditions is much more cost-effective than clear-cutting. (\\"I think it's a waste of money to level a well-moulded site\\") Resistant to \\"high-technology\\" that addresses building environment issues by ignoring natural environment, at the Centre for Development Studies (Trivandrum, 1971) Baker created a cooling system by placing a high, latticed, brick wall near a pond that uses air pressure differences to draw cool air through the building. Various features of his work such as using recycled material, natural environment control and frugality of design may be seen as sustainable architecture or green building with its emphasis on sustainability. His responsiveness to never-identical site conditions quite obviously allowed for the variegation that permeates his work. What did this do for him","response":"The detailed and diverse architectural approach of Laurie Baker, as described in the passage, had a significant impact on his career and reputation. By focusing on designing and building low-cost, high-quality, and beautiful homes catered primarily to the lower-middle and lower-class clients, Baker became an architect who was well-known and respected for his commitment to affordability and practicality. His unique design features, such as prolific masonry construction, brick jali walls, irregular pyramid-like structures on roofs, traditional Indian sloping roofs, terracotta Mangalore tile shingling, curved walls, and numerous innovative and sustainable construction techniques, allowed him to create distinctive and functional buildings that also emphasized natural environment control and frugality. Baker's architectural method of improvisation and his ability to adapt and respond to the specific conditions of each site showcased his creativity and deep respect for nature, resulting in cost-effective and environmentally friendly designs. His Quaker-instilled values manifested in the way he prioritized working around difficult site conditions and avoided clear-cutting or heavily modifying the site's natural state. By incorporating sustainable features like recycled materials and natural environment control systems in his designs, Baker's work can be seen as an early example of green building with a focus on sustainability.

Digestion is the process of breaking down food into nutrients. There are two types of digestion: mechanical digestion and chemical digestion. Mechanical digestion occurs when large chunks are turned into smaller chucks. Perhaps not surprisingly, this happens when you chew your food. Once you swallow the food, your stomach also does some of this work. Chemical digestion occurs when food is broken down into useful nutrients. This is a chemical process that begins as you start to chew your food. The saliva in your mouth starts this process. Once you swallow, the acid in your stomach further breaks down food. From the stomach, the foods moves into the small intestine. In the small intestines, another set of chemicals goes to work. Are you surprised? Your small intestine, and not your stomach, does most of the work! Do you have any questions?","response":"Digestion is an essential process in the body and involves the breakdown of food into smaller, absorbable nutrients. These nutrients are then used for various functions within the body, such as growth, repair, and energy production. As mentioned, there are two types of digestion: mechanical and chemical. Mechanical digestion involves physically breaking down food into smaller pieces. This process includes chewing in the mouth and the churning action of the stomach muscles. Chewing not only reduces food size but also increases the surface area of food particles, making it easier for enzymes to access and break down them chemically. The second type of digestion is chemical digestion, which involves enzymes and other chemicals that break down the food's macronutrients into their basic building blocks. Macronutrients include carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Different enzymes are responsible for digesting specific macronutrients. Chemical digestion begins in the mouth with the enzyme amylase, present in saliva, breaking down complex carbohydrates into simpler molecules. As food moves into the stomach, gastric acid (hydrochloric acid) and the enzyme pepsin break down proteins into smaller peptide chains. Gastric lipase, another enzyme, starts the digestion of fats in the stomach but only to a minor extent. As the partially digested food, now called chyme, moves from the stomach into the small intestine, enzymes from both the pancreas and the intestinal wall are released. Pancreatic enzymes like amylase, protease, and lipase break down carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, respectively. Additionally, enzymes known as brush border enzymes, located on the intestinal wall, continue breaking down these nutrients into their simplest forms—glucose for carbohydrates, amino acids for proteins, and fatty acids and glycerol for fats. Once nutrients are broken down to their simplest forms, they are absorbed through the walls of the small intestine into the bloodstream. From there, they are transported to the liver for further processing or distributed throughout the body to be utilized in various cellular processes. While the small intestine does most of the chemical digestion and absorption, the large intestine plays an essential role in water and electrolyte reabsorption, as well as housing a diverse population of gut bacteria. These bacteria break down indigestible fibers and produce several essential nutrients the body cannot produce on its own. In summary, digestion is a complex process involving both mechanical and chemical means that ultimately breaks down food into the necessary nutrients required for the body to function efficiently."},{"question":"What type of details about joão fonseca can be gathered from the following bio?

Question: suppose the virus isn't strong enough to spread to the body happens, how will it affect more food digested. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","response":"Given your question's description of a virus not being strong enough to spread throughout the body, I infer that its potential impact on the pancreas and digestion might be minimal or negligible. In this scenario, the virus would have limited to no effect on the processes you outlined. The pancreas would still detect chemical changes in the stomach, create and release digestive juices, and produce enzymes such as trypsin and chymotrypsin to digest proteins. Insulin production and glucose regulation would also remain unaffected, since the virus does not spread to the body effectively.

A new Gallup poll finds that support is down from 64% last year, and is at its lowest level since a brief moratorium on capital punishment began in 1972 with the Supreme Court ruling on Furman v. Georgia. The news comes on the heels of an exoneration last night, when DNA evidence freed a Texas man. The poll also found that 52% think the death penalty is applied fairly, down from last year’s 58%. One-quarter of those polled said the death penalty is imposed “too often,” while 27% believe it is used “about the right amount” and 40% said it should be imposed more often. That 40% also represents the lowest level since Gallup began asking the question in 2001. Men, Republicans, and right-leaning independents were all more likely to support the death penalty. Support for capital punishment hit an all-time high of 80% in 1994, Politico notes. In other death penalty news, find out which state wants to bring back firing squads.","response":"Title: Support for the Death Penalty in America: A 39-Year Low Introduction According to a recent Gallup poll, a full 61% of Americans back the death penalty, marking the lowest level of support in nearly four decades. The death penalty has been a contentious topic in the United States for years, with the last notable Supreme Court ruling in Furman v. Georgia halting capital punishment temporarily in 1972. This article will explore the current decline in support for the death penalty, the key findings from the Gallup poll, and the broader implications of these changing attitudes. Gallup Poll Findings: Americans' Support for the Death Penalty The Gallup poll finds that support for the death penalty has decreased from 64% last year to the current 61%, the lowest level since the brief moratorium in 1972. Americans' opinions on whether the death penalty is applied fairly have also changed slightly, with 52% considering it to be fair, compared to 58% in the previous year. The poll asked respondents to weigh in on the frequency of imposing the death penalty. One-quarter of those polled thought the death penalty is imposed \\"too often,\\" while 27% believe it is used \\"about the right amount.\\" On the other hand, 40% said it should be imposed more often. Notably, this 40% marks the lowest level since Gallup began asking this question in 2001. Demographic differences in attitudes towards the death penalty were observed, with men, Republicans, and right-leaning independents being more likely to support capital punishment. It is interesting to note that support for the death penalty reached an all-time high of 80% in 1994, according to Politico. A Recent Exoneration and its Impact on Public Opinion The Gallup poll results come at a time when the issue of wrongful convictions has been brought to the forefront due to recent events where DNA evidence led to the exoneration of a Texas man who was facing the death penalty. This particular case, among others, underscores the importance of considering the flaws in the justice system when debating the merits of capital punishment. Challenges to the Death Penalty Critics of the death penalty argue that it is inhumane, arbitrary, and irreversible, pointing to various studies showing racial bias, geographical disparities, and the high costs associated with capital punishment. On the other side, supporters argue that it serves as a deterrent, providing justice for the victims and their families, and retribution for heinous crimes. The Future of the Death Penalty The decline in support for capital punishment, along with factors such as wrongful convictions, exonerations and ongoing debates around effective and humane execution methods, has led some states to reconsider their stance on the death penalty. While some states have decided to abolish it altogether or instate moratoriums, other states are exploring alternative methods, such as the reintroduction of firing squads. Conclusion With support for the death penalty at its lowest level in 39 years, the United States may be at a turning point in its approach to addressing capital punishment. As public opinion shifts and awareness of the justice system's potential flaws grows, it is likely that the debates surrounding the appropriateness and effectiveness of the death penalty will continue to shape and challenge the future of capital punishment in America."},{"question":"blend the meat mass and cool.

Usage: Example: \\"They talked about the reason for the holiday.\\" In this sentence, the emotion expressed by the character (family) can be seen as happiness or interest in discussing the reason for the holiday. It meets the criteria as it focuses on the character's action and the emotion associated with it. Part #2: Use the context, if available, to provide more information about the sentence or the character. Usage: Example: Context: \\"A family invited some people over for Easter. They had a dinner together. They shared some good memories.\\" The context here provides additional information about the event and setting, which can help to determine the emotion.

Ensinnäkin olemme huolestuneita EU:n ulko- ja turvallisuuspolitiikan yhtenäisyyden ja tehokkuuden puutteesta. Kuten tiedämme, unionin jäsenvaltioiden väliset erimielisyydet ovat joskus haitanneet kykyämme toimia tehokkaasti ja yhtenäisenä kansainvälisellä näyttämöllä ja kehittää johdonmukaista ja vahvaa Euroopan unionia, joka pystyy puolustamaan etujaan ja perusarvojaan maailmassa. Toiseksi, vaikka me vihreät kannatamme voimakkaasti monenvälisyyttä ja rauhanomaisen konfliktinratkaisun periaatteita, emme voi olla näkemättä joitakin niistä haasteista ja uhkista, joihin Eurooppa kohtaa nykyisessä kansainvälisessä tilanteessa. Näitä ovat esimerkiksi terrorismin, joukkotuhoaseiden leviämisen, kyberhyökkäysten, hybridiuhkien ja laittoman siirtolaisuuden aiheuttamat turvallisuusriskit. Siksi kehotamme EU:ta ja jäsenvaltioita lisäämään yhteistyötään näiden haasteiden kohtaamiseksi tehokkaan yhteisen ulko- ja turvallisuuspolitiikan puitteissa. Kolmanneksi uskomme, että EU:n ulko- ja turvallisuuspolitiikassa tulisi olla vankempi ihmisoikeuksia ja demokratiaa edistävä ulottuvuus. Tämä tarkoittaa, että meidän tulisi tukea aktiivisesti kansalaisyhteiskuntaa, ihmisoikeuspuolustajia ja demokraattista oppositiota niissä maissa, joissa niiden tilaa ja toimintaa rajoitetaan ja jopa vainotaan. Neljänneksi, haluaisimme korostaa tarvetta uudistaa EU:n turvallisuus- ja puolustusarkkitehtuuria sekä tehostaa unionin yhteistyötä Naton ja muiden kumppaneiden kanssa. Tässä yhteydessä tuemme EU:n pyrkimyksiä kehittää yhteismarkkinoita ja -toimintaa puolustusalalla sekä parantaa sotilaallisia kyvykkyyksiä ja valmiuksia. Lopuksi meidän on mielestämme tarpeen päivittää EU:n globaali strategia ja tarkistaa unionin strategiset painopisteet ottaen huomioon muuttuvan maailmanjärjestyksen ja Venäjän palauttamisen kulmakivet, Kiinan nousu, Yhdysvaltain kääntyminen sisäänpäin sekä uudet teknologiset haasteet ja ympäristöön liittyvät kysymykset, kuten ilmastonmuutos ja biologinen monimuotoisuuden heikkeneminen.

He's not a secret agent, his job is to read, and he and his co-workers at the American Literary Historical Society read everything; books, comics, magazines, and they scan everything into a database to be cross-checked against real CIA operations. On a rainy December morning it's business as usual, so no one notices the non-descript man sitting in plain sedan across the street from Joe's building, checking off names of every employee as they enter.Inside, Joe looks for an answer to a letter he'd sent to the main CIA office at Langley. He has a theory about connections he's noticed between operations in Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, and other locations around the world, but so far there's no response. Noon approaches, and it's his turn to go out for lunch. Since it's still raining, he ducks out the basement door (which is against regulations) and cuts through several back alleys to the deli. Meanwhile, the sedan out front quietly pulls away after signaling to 3 men (one is a mailman) waiting in the street. They move in with quiet determination and knock on the front door. The mailman stands in view of the camera while the other two wait behind him.At the deli around the block, Joe picks up lunch for the others and then runs back. Since the rain has stopped, he goes to the front door, and buzzes the security intercom to be let in, but gets no answer. Pushing on the door, he finds it is unlocked, which it never is. Inside he finds a scene of carnage. Everyone has been murdered, shot to death in the few minutes he has been gone. Fighting down his shock and horror, he grabs a pistol from the receptionist's desk and flees.Suddenly, everyone on the street looks suspicious, and Joe realizes that whoever killed his coworkers is probably still looking for him.

Assess the relationship between Tracy and Remy: If Tracy and Remy share a strong, positive relationship and enjoy each other's company, it is more likely that Tracy would feel happy at the comparison. 2. Consider their individual personalities: If Tracy and Remy have distinct personalities that they value, then being compared to one another may not sit well with Tracy.

Rick Snyder, left, fills jugs with filtered Flint, Mich., tap water alongside Cheryl Hill at Hill's house where he drank his first glass of the local water Monday, April 18, 2016, on the... (Associated Press) LANSING, Mich. (AP) — Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder will drink Flint water at home and at work for at least a month to show to residents it is safe with the use of a faucet filter, he said Monday. The Republican governor, who has apologized for his administration's role in the city's lead-tainted water crisis, visited a house owned by Cheryl Hill and Todd Canty that was confirmed to have high levels of lead. Snyder, who left with five gallons of filtered water, said he understands people feel that if officials say the water is OK, then he should drink it, too. \\"What better way to help show support,\\" said Snyder, who will get refills from other homes as needed. Hill and Canty told The Flint Journal that they appreciate the governor's visit but still have a lead service line running to their home and don't know if and when it will be replaced. \\"I wouldn't want to be in his position right now,\\" Canty said. \\"I believe this is just one of those cases where personally he just has a lot of work to do.\\" For nearly 18 months, Flint residents drank and bathed with improperly treated water that had coursed through aging pipes and fixtures, scraping away lead. By the time Snyder announced in October that Flint would return to its earlier source of treated water, the Detroit municipal system, dangerously high levels of the toxic metal were detected in the blood of some residents, including children, for whom it can cause lower IQs and behavioral problems. On Monday, Snyder again urged residents to drink the water as long as a filter is in place. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, however, says bottled water is safest for children under age 6 and pregnant or breastfeeding women. Meanwhile, a state water-quality official who told the city of Flint that a chemical wasn't needed to prevent lead corrosion from pipes has taken a different job in the state Department of Environmental Quality. Mike Prysby, who was a district engineer with the Office of Drinking Water and Municipal Assistance and had been responsible for Genesee County, home to Flint, began working in the Water Resources Division's Transportation and Flood Hazard Unit on March 28. That was the day before a supervisor at Flint's water plant, Mike Glasgow, testified at a legislative hearing that Prysby told him before Flint switched to a local river for water in 2014 that phosphate wasn't required. DEQ spokeswoman Melanie Brown said Prysby took a position that opened up when someone was promoted, and his switch was not a forced transfer. \\"The department continues to cooperate with internal investigations regarding staff actions in Flint,\\" she told The Associated Press in an email. A message seeking comment was left Monday for Prysby, who has declined previous requests for an interview. Snyder has blamed \\"career bureaucrats\\" in state and federal governments. A task force appointed by Snyder has said the DEQ was the primary culprit because regulators misinterpreted a federal rule in telling Flint water officials not to treat the Flint River for corrosion until after two six-month monitoring periods. The DEQ's director and communications director resigned in December. Snyder fired the department's top drinking water official, and a district supervisor is on paid leave after being suspended five days without pay in January for actions related to the Flint crisis — the maximum allowed under civil service rules. ___ Follow David Eggert at http://twitter.com/DavidEggert00 .

The Lithuanian Army moved to secure territories abandoned by the retreating Polish forces. They took Turmantas on July 7, Tauragnai and Alanta on July 9, Širvintos and Musninkai on July 10, Kernavė, Molėtai, and Giedraičiai on July 11, Maišiagala and Pabradė on July 13. On July 13 the Polish command decided to transfer Vilnius to the Lithuanians in accordance with the resolution of the Spa Conference. Lithuanians moved in, but their trains were stopped by Polish soldiers near Kazimieriškės. This delay meant that the Bolsheviks were the first to enter Vilnius on July 14. By the time first Lithuanian troops entered the city on July 15, it was already secured by the Soviets. Poland sought to have Russians in the city as it would create much less complications when Polish Army counterattacked. Despite the Peace Treaty, the Soviets did not intend to transfer the city to the Lithuanians. Indeed, there were indications that the Soviets planned a coup against the Lithuanian government in hopes to re-establish the Lithuanian SSR. Despite the setback in Vilnius, the Lithuanians continued to secure territories in the Suwałki Region. They took Druskininkai on July 17, Vištytis, Punsk, Giby, and Sejny on July 19, Suwałki on July 29, Augustów on August 8.

The choice of words used to describe the movie evoke an unfavorable impression. The adjective \\"dreary\\" means dull, bleak, or lacking in excitement. Using this word to describe a movie suggests that the film was uninteresting, unappealing, or monotonous. It could imply a lack of engaging content, poor pacing, or unimpressive visual and audio components. The word \\"mess\\" in this context typically refers to a situation, event, or in this case, a movie that is disorderly, chaotic, and disorganized. This word further emphasizes that the film failed to present a cohesive and coherent narrative, potentially leaving the audience confused or frustrated. By describing the movie as a \\"mess,\\" the reviewer could be saying that its storyline, structure, character arcs, and production quality were subpar or haphazardly thrown together. Both of these words used together further reinforce the negative tone of the review, implying that the experience of watching the movie was not only dull and disheartening but also marred by disorder and lack of clarity. This tells the reader to expect an unsatisfactory and disappointing film experience if they were to watch it. Of course, it is important to keep in mind that individual opinions about movies can vary widely, and what one reviewer perceives as a \\"dreary mess\\" might be seen as an intentional artistic choice by another viewer.

By and by he finally regained the courage to live on. On a hot summer afternoon he was taking a walk with a stick near his house when a thunderstorm started suddenly. He stood under a large tree in order not to get himself wet. Unfortunately he was struck down to the ground by a lightning. The witnesses thought him dead but he woke up some 20 minutes later lying face down in muddy water below the tree. He felt that he was trembling badly, but when he opened his eyes ,he didn't dare to believe that he saw a plough( )lying near the wall. When Mrs Edwards came running up to him, she shouted their neighbours for help. And he saw her and heard her voice for the first time in nearly ten years.

Sentence A: \\"He put the pliers in the guacamole.\\" - Pliers: A tool used for gripping or bending objects, typically made of metal. - Guacamole: A dish made of mashed avocado, often mixed with tomatoes, onions, and seasonings, typically served as a dip. Sentence B: \\"He put the lime in the guacamole.\\" - Lime: A citrus fruit that is a common ingredient in various recipes, including guacamole. - Guacamole: Same as described in Sentence A. Step 1: Analyze the context. Guacamole is a food item, so any action that involves adding objects to it should be related to either food preparation or consumption. Step 2: Identify the objects involved. For Sentence A, the object involved is 'pliers'. For Sentence B, the object involved is 'lime'. Step 3: Evaluate the relevance of the objects in the context of the sentences. - Pliers are not typically used in food preparation or consumption, especially not in the context of guacamole. This creates a discrepancy in Sentence A. - Lime, on the other hand, is a common ingredient in guacamole and is relevant to the context of food preparation or consumption, making Sentence B sensible.

In monogamous species incubation duties are often shared, whereas in polygamous species one parent is wholly responsible for incubation. Warmth from parents passes to the eggs through brood patches, areas of bare skin on the abdomen or breast of the incubating birds. Incubation can be an energetically demanding process; adult albatrosses, for instance, lose as much as 83 grams (2.9 oz) of body weight per day of incubation. The warmth for the incubation of the eggs of megapodes comes from the sun, decaying vegetation or volcanic sources. Incubation periods range from 10 days (in woodpeckers, cuckoos and passerine birds) to over 80 days (in albatrosses and kiwis).\\". Can you tell me what it is?

Article: When Jane put out the idea of homeschooling to her parents, the first reaction they gave was, \\"You are cutting the child off the world.'' \\"Did the child really get cut off or did the child socialize better?\\" The moment we hear of homeschooling, we think the child will have no opportunities to interact with peers. However, in my friend's opinion, we forget that when attending a regular school, the child is not into socializing all the while. The child is restricted to so many other activities. Studies take a major role in a child's life. The child hardly has the time to interact at school. The child might be meeting and studying along with many peers; however, how many kids interact with all the kids in a class? But in homeschooling system, as my friend mentioned, the kid has all the time and can plan his day accordingly. During the day the child studies just like other school-going kids but with no burden of homework and project work, the child has so much free time in the evening as to effectively interact and play with peers. The quality time the child spends in education is really impressive. Homeschooled kids have the opportunity to socialize more often as they have a lot of time in their hands. They can also make socializing a regular habit. Just as my friend said, her child goes to a neighboring park almost every day and has a set of friends who go there daily. Other children get back home to finish off homework and project work whereas her child who is already through with studies gets the opportunity to spend time with family members. When I heard this, I really felt how lucky the child was. Definitely the child had a better opportunity to socialize when compared with my kid. However, I might not consider homeschooling for my kid, as I am so used to the conventional schooling system and feel regular schooling the safest bet. Question: What is the biggest advantage of homeschooled children? - They will become braver. - They can be more popular. - They can socialize better. - They will know how to arrange time. Answer:","response":"They can socialize better."},{"question":"Richard John Santorum (born May 10, 1958) is an American attorney, author, politician, and CNN Senior Political Commentator. A member of the Republican Party, he served as a United States Senator from Pennsylvania from 1995 to 2007 and was the Senate's third-ranking Republican from 2001 to 2007. He ran as a candidate for the 2012 Republican Party presidential nomination, finishing second to Mitt Romney. Santorum was elected as a United States Senator from Pennsylvania in 1994. Santorum served in the United States Senate representing Pennsylvania from 1995 to 2007. From 2001 until 2007, he was the Senate's third-ranking Republican. He was first elected to the Senate during the 1994 Republican takeover, narrowly defeating incumbent Democrat Harris Wofford, 49% to 47%. The theme of Santorum's 1994 campaign signs was \\"Join the Fight!\\" During the race, he was considered an underdog, as his opponent was 32 years his senior. He was reelected in 2000, defeating U.S. Congressman Ron Klink by a 52-46% margin. In his reelection bid of 2006, he lost to Democrat Bob Casey, Jr. by a 59-41% margin. After his election to the Senate in 1994, Santorum sought to \\"practice what [he] preached\\" and hired five people for his staff who were on welfare, food stamps, or other government aid. In 1996, Santorum served as Chairman of the Republican Party Task Force on Welfare Reform, and contributed to legislation that became the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act. Santorum was an author and the floor manager of the bill. In 1996, Santorum endorsed moderate Republican Arlen Specter in his short-lived campaign for president. Reporters have observed that though Santorum and Specter differed on social policy, Specter provided him with key political staff for his successful run in 1994. The National Taxpayers Union, a fiscal conservative organization, gave Santorum an \\"A-\\" score for his votes on fiscal issues, meaning that he was one of \\"the strongest supporters of responsible tax and spending policies\\" during his tenure, and ranked fifth in the group's rankings out of 50 senators who served at the same time. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: What about the next re-election?","response":"In Richard Santorum's next re-election bid in 2006, he lost to Democrat Bob Casey, Jr. by a 59-41% margin.

How to make chipotle rice Heat the oil in a large skillet. Add the oil to a room temperature skillet and place on the stove. Heat the oil over medium-high heat for a minute or two. Pick from: -- Stir the oil frequently until it begins to brown and become very moist. The oil should be steadily sizzling and bubbling. -- Let it remain near the heat until the oil is both heated and a translucent film forms. Alternatively, you can use non-stick skillet. -- This should keep the oil from burning throughout your rice. Using a large skillet can cause the oil to sizzle. -- The oil should be glossy and smooth, but it should not smoke at any point during the cooking process. If the oil begins to smoke, it means that the fat has begun to break down, which, in turn, means that the flavor will be thrown off.","response":"Next, proceed with the following steps to finish making chipotle rice: 1. Prepare your ingredients: Before you start, make sure you have all the necessary ingredients handy. You'll need the following: long-grain white rice, water, chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, garlic, onion, salt, and optional ingredients like cilantro, lime juice, and frozen vegetables. 2. Rinse and drain the rice: Place the rice in a fine-mesh strainer and rinse it under cold, running water until the water runs clear. This step helps remove excess starch, which can make the cooked rice sticky. Drain the rice well to prevent adding extra moisture to the skillet. 3. Sauté the onion and garlic: Once the oil is heated and glossy, add the diced onion to the skillet. Cook the onion until it starts to soften and become translucent, about 3-4 minutes. Then, add the minced garlic and cook for another 30 seconds, stirring continuously to prevent burning. 4. Add the rice and chipotle peppers: Add the rinsed and drained rice to the skillet, stirring it to coat the grains evenly with the oil, onion, and garlic mixture. Allow the rice to cook for a minute or two to toast, giving it an aromatic, nutty flavor. Then, add the chipotle peppers and adobo sauce, stirring to distribute them throughout the rice. 5. Add water and salt: Carefully pour in the measured water, ensuring that all the rice is submerged. Add salt to taste (about 1/2 to 1 teaspoon, or as desired) and stir gently. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover the skillet with a tight-fitting lid, and let the rice simmer gently. 6. Cook the rice: Allow the rice to cook undisturbed for about 15-20 minutes, or until the liquid is absorbed, and the rice is tender yet firm. Do not lift the lid or stir the rice during this time, as this can disrupt the steaming process and cause unevenly cooked rice. 7. Fluff the rice and add optional ingredients: Remove the skillet from the heat and let it stand for 5 minutes with the lid still on. Then, using a fork, fluff the rice gently to separate the grains. At this point, you can mix in optional ingredients like chopped cilantro, a squeeze of lime juice, or frozen vegetables that have been defrosted and reheated. 8. Serve the chipotle rice: Transfer the rice to a serving dish and enjoy it as a flavorful side or as part of a meal, such as a burrito bowl, alongside grilled meats, or with your favorite Mexican-themed dishes."},{"question":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

The Griff Rhys Jones TV project had stalled after a couple of meetings when everyone involved realised that the idea - to pipe broadband comedy programming into the nation's workplaces under the noses of bosses - was a bit of a non-starter. But I had become quite good friends with Rhys Jones's partner in the project, a comedy writer called Charlie Skelton, and he, Clare and I frequently met to brainstorm possible projects we might work on together. It was during one of these meetings that Clare proposed the idea of starting a comedy magazine - something like Private Eye, but for the Internet generation. My days as a school magazine publisher had taught me that printing magazines and distributing them was a royal pain in the arse and, anyway, if it was to be a magazine for the Internet generation then shouldn't it actually be on the Internet? The Zingin.com newsletter had attracted a ton of subscribers and had a distribution cost of basically nothing so why, I suggested, didn't we start a weekly comedy ezine, sent out by email? And, in a nod to Charlie's failed office comedy project, we could target it at bored office workers, sending the email to them on a Friday afternoon to cure the crushing boredom of those final few hours of the working week. And with that, The Friday Thing was born. To promote our fledgling publication we came up with a brilliant ruse: an online petition to have Friday afternoons declared a national holiday. British people worked harder than any other Europeans (we made up) and so it was only fair that our working week should end at noon on a Friday. We created an official website explaining our demands, registered a web address - letsgetitoff.com (snigger) - and sent a press release to the media.

Which farm contributes less to the carrying of chemicals to nearby rivers? Hint: Huge amounts of chemicals, such as fertilizers and pesticides, are applied to farm fields (see Figure below ). Some of the chemicals are picked up by rainwater. Runoff then carries the chemicals to nearby rivers or lakes. Dissolved fertilizer causes too much growth of water plants and algae. This can lead to dead zones where nothing can live in lakes and at the mouths of rivers. Some of the chemicals can infiltrate into groundwater. The contaminated water comes up in water wells. If people drink the polluted water, they may get sick. Answer:","response":"After considering the given information, we can determine which farm contributes less to the carrying of chemicals to nearby rivers. Step 1: Analyze the farming methods - Berry farm uses organic methods, with no fertilizers and pesticides. - Rose farm uses conventional agricultural methods, with fertilizers and pesticides. Step 2: Consider the impact of these methods on the environment - Berry farm's methods are less likely to introduce chemicals into nearby bodies of water, as there are no synthetic chemicals used. - Rose farm's methods introduce chemicals, such as fertilizers and pesticides, into the environment.

This would give the Allies control of the sea routes to Japan from southern Asia, cutting off substantial Japanese garrisons. MacArthur favored an invasion of the Philippines, which also lay across the supply lines to Japan. Roosevelt adjudicated in favor of the Philippines. Meanwhile, Japanese Combined Fleet Chief Toyoda Soemu prepared four plans to cover all Allied offensive scenarios. On 12 October Nimitz launched a carrier raid against Formosa to make sure that planes based there could not intervene in the landings on Leyte. Toyoda put Plan Sho-2 into effect, launching a series of air attacks against the U.S. carriers. However the Japanese lost 600 planes in three days, leaving them without air cover.

On September 19, having buried their non-essential possessions in a mound marked by a tent pole, they set out in search of settlements. Progress was hampered by the poor physical condition of the men, in particular Eriksen, who was badly affected by frostbite. On September 21 they halted at two empty huts, probably part of a hunting camp, where Alexey raised spirits by shooting a deer to replenish their dwindling food stocks. De Long allowed his exhausted party several days' rest before resuming the march.On September 28 the party found a large hut, with signs of recent occupation–edible food in the store, and moccasin tracks in the snow. When searches in the locality brought no sign of people, De Long decided to move on. By October 4, Eriksen could not continue; the party halted at another abandoned hut where, on October 6, Eriksen died. On October 9, with the condition of several men worsening, De Long decided to send two of the fittest in the group, Nindemann and Noros, to seek help. Ambler was offered the opportunity to go with them, but felt that his duty as a doctor required him to stay with the main body.For the next week De Long's party struggled on, sometimes making barely a mile a day. Although they jettisoned more of their possessions on the way, De Long insisted on carrying his maps and journals. His entry for October 10 recorded that there was \\"nothing for supper but a spoonful of glycerine\\". A few days later Alexey, the group's principal hunter, shot a ptarmigan which provided soup. But Alexey was weakening, and on October 17 he died.On October 20, trapped by the weather and without supplies, the party came to a final halt.

If one sees a fox and is standing in a coastal, gulf state, where is this person? Options: - alabama - louisiana - south carolina - arkansas - mountains","response":"To determine the location of the person who sees a fox in a coastal gulf state, we'll analyze each of the provided options: 1. Alabama: This state is located along the Gulf of Mexico. Foxes can be found in Alabama. 2. Louisiana: This state is also located along the Gulf of Mexico. Foxes can be found in Louisiana. 3. South Carolina: Although South Carolina is a coastal state, it borders the Atlantic Ocean, not the Gulf of Mexico. However, foxes can be found in South Carolina. 4. Arkansas: This state is not a coastal or a gulf state. Foxes can be found in Arkansas. 5. Mountains: This option is not a state but rather a geographical feature. As the question specifically asks for a coastal gulf state, we can eliminate South Carolina because it borders the Atlantic Ocean, Arkansas because it is not a coastal or a gulf state, and mountains as it isn't a state. This leaves us with two options: Alabama and Louisiana. Both of these states are coastal gulf states and have foxes.

Second question: How shoud I start my preparation for IAS? Are these two questions asking the same thing? Choices: - no - yes","response":"Yes, both questions are asking the same thing. They are both inquiring about the initial steps to take when starting to prepare for the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) examination. Here is a comprehensive step-by-step guide as an answer to your question: 1. **Understand the Exam Structure**: The very first thing you should do is understand the IAS exam structure and its requirements. The Civil Services Exam is conducted by the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) and it is divided into three stages: Preliminary, Mains, and Interview. You should familiarise yourself with the syllabus for each of these stages. 2. **Choose Your Optional Subject Wisely**: UPSC Mains exam has one optional subject that you can choose according to your interest and academic background. Choosing the right optional subject is crucial because it can make a significant difference in your final scores. 3. **Develop a Study Plan**: Once you are familiar with the exam pattern and syllabus, the next step is to create a study plan. Allocate specific hours in a day for each subject and ensure you also include time for revisions and mock tests. Stick to your plan religiously. 4. **Gather Study Materials**: You should gather all the necessary study materials before you begin your preparation. For general studies, start with NCERT textbooks to build a strong base. For current affairs, read newspapers daily and take notes. For the optional subject, refer to the suggested readings and if possible consult with seniors or mentors who have chosen the same optional subject. 5. **Take Mock Tests and Solve Previous Year Questions**: Mock tests are incredibly essential for effective preparation. They help you to assess your preparation level, improve your speed, and get familiar with the exam pattern. Also, solving previous year questions will give you a clear idea about what type of questions are asked in the exam. 6. **Enroll in a Good Coaching Institute (If Required)**: If you feel you need guidance and a structured approach to the study, you can consider joining a reputable coaching institute. They can provide customized study materials, regular classes, test series, and personalized guidance. 7. **Stay Physically and Mentally Fit**: Preparing for the IAS exam requires a lot of mental agility. Regular physical exercise, a balanced diet and sufficient rest will keep you healthy and ensure your brain functions optimally. Also, practicing some form of stress-reducing activities like meditation or yoga is beneficial. 8. **Stay Updated with Current Affairs**: Reading newspapers and following reliable news sources can help you stay updated on current affairs. This is crucial for both the Preliminary exams (which contain a ‘General Awareness’ section) and the Mains exams (which contain a ‘General Studies’ section that has substantial focus on current events and issues). Finally, remember that preparation for the IAS exam requires discipline, consistency, and patience. It may take months (or even a year or two) of diligent study before you are fully prepared."},{"question":"Two friends met after 20 years and had a beer together. Vlad was a geologist and studied earthquakes. Mort was a pedologist and studied soils. They had some interesting conversations that night. Which friend studied more about seismic waves? The answer to this question is:","response":"Vlad, the geologist, studied more about seismic waves. This is because geologists primarily focus on the study of earthquakes, including the analysis and interpretation of seismic waves, which are the energy waves produced during an earthquake. These waves help in understanding the Earth's interior structure and the processes associated with earthquake occurrences. On the other hand, Mort the pedologist, studied soils, which involves the examination of their formation, classification, and distribution.

Cary Grant (born Archibald Alec Leach; January 18, 1904 - November 29, 1986) was an English-American actor, known as one of classic Hollywood's definitive leading men. He began a career in Hollywood in the early 1930s, and became known for his transatlantic accent, debonair demeanor, and light-hearted approach to acting and sense of comic timing. He became an American citizen in 1942. Born in Horfield, Bristol, Grant became attracted to theatre at a young age, and began performing with a troupe known as \\"The Penders\\" from the age of six. Stirling refers to Grant as \\"one of the shrewdest businessmen ever to operate in Hollywood\\". His long-term friendship with Howard Hughes from the 1930s onward saw him invited into the most glamorous circles in Hollywood and their lavish parties. Biographers Morecambe and Stirling state that Hughes played a major role in the development of Grant's business interests, so that by 1939, he was \\"already an astute operator with various commercial interests\\". Scott also played a role, encouraging Grant to invest his money in shares, making him a wealthy man by the end of the 1930s. In the 1940s, Grant and Barbara Hutton invested heavily in real estate development in Acapulco at a time when it was little more than a fishing village, and teamed with Richard Widmark, Roy Rogers, and Red Skelton to buy a hotel there. Behind his business interests was a particularly intelligent mind, to the point that his friend David Niven once said: \\"Before computers went into general release, Cary had one in his brain\\". Film critic David Thomson believes that Grant's intelligence came across on screen, and stated that \\"no one else looked so good and so intelligent at the same time\\". After Grant retired from the screen, he became more active in business. He accepted a position on the board of directors at Faberge. This position was not honorary, as some had assumed; Grant regularly attended meetings and travelled internationally to support them. His pay was modest in comparison to the millions of his film career, a salary of a reported 15,000 a year. Such was Grant's influence on the company that George Barrie once claimed that Grant had played a role in the growth of the firm to annual revenues of about 50 million in 1968, a growth of nearly 80% since the inaugural year in 1964. The position also permitted use of a private plane, which Grant could use to fly to see his daughter wherever her mother, Dyan Cannon, was working. In 1975, Grant was an appointed director of MGM. In 1980, he sat on the board of MGM Films and MGM Grand Hotels following the division of the parent company. He played an active role in the promotion of MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas when opened in 1973, and he continued to promote the city throughout the 1970s.

Step by step answer:","response":"No, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. To determine this, let's analyze both the premise and the hypothesis step by step. Premise: 1. There is a yellow team soccer player. 2. The yellow team soccer player is jumping on two blue team players. 3. Other players are running alongside. Hypothesis: 1. A player from the yellow team jumps on two players from the blue team. 2. The reason for jumping is that they had just kicked him. Now, let's compare the statements in the premise and hypothesis: - The premise states that there is a yellow team soccer player jumping on two blue team players, while in the hypothesis, it also mentions the same action. - The premise does not include any information about why the yellow team player is jumping on the blue team players, while the hypothesis assumes a reason (that the yellow player was kicked).

Here is a hypothesis: Their high ratings are due to the economy and a bit of good sense. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","response":"Yes, it is possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is also true. Let's analyze the premise and hypothesis to provide a detailed explanation. Premise: All of them owe their sky-high poll ratings to the economy and a few ounces of good sense. In this premise, we are given the information that a group of people (or perhaps politicians) have very high poll ratings. It also claims that the reason for these high poll ratings is the strong economy and their good sense. Hypothesis: Their high ratings are due to the economy and a bit of good sense. The hypothesis shares a similar idea with the premise. It suggests that the high ratings are a result of the economy and the good sense demonstrated by the individuals. While the wording differs slightly (using \\"a bit\\" instead of \\"a few ounces\\"), the core idea remains the same. Now, in conclusion, considering that the premise and the hypothesis share the same core idea, it can be said that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is also true. They both establish a connection between the high poll ratings and two factors: the economy and the individuals' good sense. Therefore, if one were to accept the premise as true, it would logically lead to the acceptance of the hypothesis as well."},{"question":"Kendall did this magic trick around the world and nobody could figure out this trick.

Many people take supplements as a form of dietary insurance in case they are not meeting their nutrient needs from foods alone. Others take them as a form of health insurance – to protect against certain diseases. Some just take them out of habit. Supplements do have a role to play in some situations. People with a diagnosed deficiency, those with malabsorption conditions, women planning pregnancy, and people with very poor diets all can benefit from specific nutrient supplementation. But what about the benefit of supplements across the broad population? The mantra of most health professionals, which is even etched on the label of many supplements, is that supplements may only be of assistance if dietary sources are lacking. To see if this is supported by solid evidence, a systematic review of 63 clinical trials involving some form of supplementation in non-pregnant adults was carried out by a team of medical researchers. The clinical trials were broad in their nature with many nutrients studied including vitamins A, B6, B12, C, D and E; folic acid; calcium; selenium, omega-3 fatty acids; ginkgo biloba; glucosamine; saw palmetto; and milk thistle. All of the studies were randomised controlled trials and evaluated a range of health outcomes including risk of heart disease, cancer, diabetes, bone fractures, cognitive function and all-cause mortality. From the 63 studies, no benefit was seen in 45 studies with 10 of these showing a trend towards harm and just two showing a trend towards a benefit. Of the remaining studies, four showed harm with a greater risk of cancer with beta-carotene and a higher risk of fractures with a once-yearly dose of vitamin D. One study showed a lower risk of cancer with selenium supplementation, but this was not validated in much larger trials. Twelve studies showed a benefit and these mostly involved vitamin D... How long or often are supplements expected to be taken? - Monthly - not enough information - when diseased - Frequently A:","response":"The duration and frequency of supplement intake depend on various factors such as the individual's health, nutritional needs, and the specific supplement being taken. There is no one-size-fits-all answer, as each person's dietary requirements and health goals are unique. 1. Monthly: Some supplements may be taken monthly, such as certain forms of vitamin D supplementation prescribed for individuals with diagnosed deficiencies. However, this may not apply to all types of supplements or individuals. 2. Not enough information: It is difficult to provide specific recommendations for supplement intake without taking into account the individual's health, nutritional needs, and the specific supplement being taken. It is always better to consult with a healthcare professional to determine the appropriate duration and frequency of supplementation. 3. When diseased: In some cases, individuals may be advised to take supplements to address health issues or deficiency-related conditions. For example, people with anemia may be prescribed iron supplements to compensate for low iron levels. In such cases, supplements are typically taken until the deficiency or health issue is resolved, and the duration varies depending on the individual case. 4. Frequently: Some people may choose to take supplements, such as multivitamins, as a form of dietary insurance, ensuring they receive essential nutrients regularly. In these cases, supplements are often taken daily or as directed by a healthcare professional. The length of time one takes daily supplements is dependent on one's personal health goals and dietary needs. It is essential to note that the assumption of health benefits from supplementation across the broad population remains inconclusive, as mentioned in the study of 63 clinical trials. The suggested course of action is for individuals to try to meet their nutritional requirements through a balanced diet. However, if supplementation is deemed necessary, it should be done under the guidance of a healthcare professional, and the duration and frequency should be tailored to the individual's specific needs."},{"question":"What is the sentiment of the following movie review sentence? a crescendo that encompasses many more paths than we started with","response":"The sentiment of the movie review sentence is positive.

The drivers who have had the privilege of driving the prestigious number 1 car in NASCAR's history are numerous, and include plenty of talented individuals. It's important to keep in mind, however, that the drivers of the number 1 car can change frequently due to sponsorships, contractual obligations, team changes, or retirements. Let's look at a few of the notable drivers who've been behind the wheel of the number 1 car in chronological order: 1. **Bob Welborn**: Bob Welborn, mainly known for his success in convertibles, drove the number 1 car in the late 1950s. 2. **Billy Wade**: Another known driver of the car in the sixties was Billy Wade, who won 4 consecutive races. 3. **Donnie Allison**: Allison drove the number 1 car in the late sixties to early seventies. 4. **Martin Truex Jr.**: The early 2000s saw Martin Truex Jr. driving the number 1 car. He even won the NASCAR Xfinity Series Championship twice in 2004 and 2005. 5. **Jamie McMurray**: After Truex, Jamie McMurray took over the number 1 car and drove it for Chip Ganassi Racing from 2010 to 2018. 6. **Kurt Busch**: The number 1 car was driven by Kurt Busch from 2019 to 2020. He competes full-time in the NASCAR Cup Series for Chip Ganassi Racing. Kurt Busch even managed to bring victories for the team while driving the number 1 car. 7. **Ross Chastain**: Most recently, the number 1 car was taken over in 2021 by Ross Chastain, who previously raced in number 42. It's an intriguing piece of motorsports history to see how the number 1 car has passed through various teams and drivers throughout the years. Unfortunately, detailing the drivers of all the NASCAR cars is beyond the scope of this response, but I hope this gives some insight into some of the main drivers of the number 1 car in NASCAR. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, it's advisable to see the current team listings on the official NASCAR website. Please note that the information will change from season to season and sometimes even during a season, as drivers can change teams or be replaced due to injuries or other factors. NASCAR itself is a world full of ever-changing dynamics, and the legacy of the number 1 car is just one fascinating storyline among many in the sport."},{"question":"Q:Information: - Acanthostega (meaning \\"spiny roof\\") is an extinct genus of stem-tetrapod, among the first vertebrate animals to have recognizable limbs. It appeared in the late Devonian period (Famennian age) about 365 million years ago, and was anatomically intermediate between lobe-finned fishes and those that were fully capable of coming onto land. - The Carboniferous is a geologic period and system that spans 60 million years from the end of the Devonian Period million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Permian Period, Mya. The name \\"Carboniferous\\" means \\"coal-bearing\\" and derives from the Latin words \\"carb\\" (\\"coal\\") and \\"fer\\" (\\"I bear, I carry\\"), and was coined by geologists William Conybeare and William Phillips in 1822. Based on a study of the British rock succession, it was the first of the modern 'system' names to be employed, and reflects the fact that many coal beds were formed globally during that time. The Carboniferous is often treated in North America as two geological periods, the earlier Mississippian and the later Pennsylvanian. - Eogyrinus attheyi ( from Greek eos , meaning \`\` dawn '' , and gyrinos , meaning \`\` tadpole '' ) was one of the largest Carboniferous tetrapods , and perhaps one of the largest of its family , Eogyrinidae , at 4.6 metres ( 15 ft ) in length . Eogyrinus appears to have been a powerful swimmer that moved quickly through the water by swishing its long tail from side to side . It may have been a predator , lying in wait for prey in much the same way as a modern crocodile . It was a lightly built animal , weighing around 560 kilograms ( 1,230 lb ) . Although probably better at hunting in the water , Eogyrinus could probably have also made a grab for prey passing close by on land . Fossils of Eogyrinus are known from northern England . Recent studies by Jennifer A. Clack suggest that the amphibian Pholiderpeton described by Thomas Henry Huxley in 1869 is the same animal as Eogyrinus . If this is so , then Pholiderpeton 's name takes priority . - Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets. - The superclass Tetrapoda (Ancient Greek s tetrapods, \\"four-footed\\"), or the tetrapods , comprises the first four-limbed vertebrates and their descendants, including the living and extinct amphibians, birds, mammals, reptiles and some ancient, exclusively aquatic creatures such as the Acanthostega. Tetrapods evolved from the lobe-finned fishes around 390 million years ago in the middle Devonian Period, with modern tetrapod groups having appeared by the late Devonian, 367.5 million years ago. The specific aquatic ancestors of the tetrapods, and the process by which land colonization occurred, remain unclear, and are areas of active research and debate among palaeontologists at present. - Eogyrinidae is an extinct family of large, long-bodied tetrapods that lived in the rivers of the Late Carboniferous period.

He was 57 when she interviewed for the position of Assistant District Attorney. At the time, she thought he was 70. Two months ago, she had become the District Attorney. She loved seeing her name on the door. And she felt a rush of adrenaline every time a judge referred to her as 'The District Attorney' in open court.

The other options refer to places (Canterbury, Kent, Shepherdswell), companies (P&O Ferries), or things (Canterbury Crown Court, lesser charges) that would not make a call to an ambulance service.

Instead of lunches at Lut��ce, they caucus at the Palace Diner in Queens. Wooing clients means passing out fliers on street corners, not securing box seats at Madison Square Garden. To make ends meet, one partner stacks pipe and cleans the yard at a plumbing warehouse. Another handles urine samples in a hospital lab. A sign of failure, of a feeble economy, perhaps? Hardly. They are heeding the call of a growing pool of law schools, which are for the first time pointing graduates in a new direction and teaching them how to get there. Forget the lure of large firms, the security of a government post. Here is how to grapple \\"in the service of justice,\\" as many of the schools put it, instead. Convinced that corporate largess and government programs barely dent the nation's legal needs, the law schools are urging graduates to buck tradition, pass up big salaries and ignore mushrooming student debt to join tiny neighborhood practices or simply start their own, all with an eye toward charging no more than their clients can afford. This is not pro bono legal work; it is \\"low bono,\\" a term the schools coined to define the atypical kind of law career they are training students for. While its practitioners do charge for their services, they are also dead set on turning no one away - or at least as few as possible. \\"When you go into this kind of social justice law, it's really brutal and you're almost guaranteed to struggle for a couple of years before there's a light at the end of the tunnel,\\" said Fred Rooney, director of the Community Legal Resource Network at City University of New York School of Law, from which the lawyers of the newly formed Cates, Katalinic & Lund graduated last May. \\"But if our graduates don't do it, the millions of people who cannot access justice in this country will continue to soar.\\" The movement, primly called the consortium, started four years ago by CUNY, Northeastern University, the University of Maryland and St. Mary's Law School in Texas.

It is important to have a good grasp of the different theories, as applying them to your research and reflection will provide a more comprehensive understanding of Islam's role in international relations."},{"question":"(IT) Pane předsedající, dámy a pánové, Lisabonskou smlouvou končí dlouhá a velmi nebezpečná krize.

Could you please translate this to English?","response":"The term \\"Zvonil's?\\" appears to be a transliteration of the Russian word \\"Звонил?\\" (Zvonil), which, when translated to English, means \\"Did you call?\\" or \\"Have you called?\\" in the context of using a telephone or contacting someone. It is a single-word inquiry regarding whether or not a person has attempted to reach another individual by making a phone call or potentially via other communication methods. In the Russian language, words may be conjugated based on gender, number, and tense. The word \\"Звонил\\" (Zvonil) is the masculine form of the verb \\"звонить\\" (zvonit'), which means \\"to call\\" or \\"to ring.\\" The verb itself comes from the noun \\"звон\\" (zvon), meaning \\"ring\\" in the sense of a sound made by a bell or telephone."},{"question":"Bank on women in a crisis It is May 2003. I'm standing in the crowded, dusty, garishly carpeted Binion's Horseshoe casino in downtown Las Vegas. It is the 31st annual World Series of Poker. At this point in my poker career, I am only here to watch. The buy-in fee for the tournament is 10,000: this is a luxury for millionaires, a handful of \\"professional poker players\\" (if, in 2003, such a thing really exists) and those lucky enough to win their seats in competitions. There are a few more people than usual playing the 2003 tournament. This is because a new system has recently been launched whereby you can win seats on the internet. What an idea! Playing poker alone on a computer, using a credit card, against opponents whose faces you can't see? It'll never work… So there are more contestants, but of the usual type: middle-aged men in big hats and shiny belt buckles, eating and drinking and smoking while they play. I am surprised to see a beautiful young woman in the crowd, shouting, in a cut-glass English accent: \\"Go Daddy Wheeler! Go Daddy Wheeler!\\" Following her eyeline, the story becomes clear. The millionaire owner of spread-betting firm IG Index, Stuart Wheeler, has treated himself to a World Series ticket, had a good run and made his way into the prize money. His daughter is here to lend support. Mr Wheeler finishes 33rd for 35,000. According to official records, he has never cashed in a poker tournament before or since. Thus, I was not surprised to see, during last week's little press scandal, that he has rather lost touch with the game. Arguing against the idea that there should be more women on the boards of companies, Stuart Wheeler (now retired from IG Index and ensconced as treasurer of Ukip) said: \\"Business is very, very competitive and you should take the performance of women in another competitive area… Chess, bridge, poker – women come absolutely nowhere.\\" Others have kindly pointed out that Stuart Wheeler must have missed the disproportionate recent success of women in poker: 23 female poker millionaires in the official rankings list, topped by the phenomenal Vanessa Selbst who has won 7,398,454. (I'm tenth, with 1.7m.) But Mr Wheeler is missing something far more important than that. He may know that poker has undergone a revolution, thanks mainly to the fact that the ultimate winner of that 2003 World Series (the magically named Chris Moneymaker, a likable accountant from Tennessee) was an internet qualifier: he'd won his seat on PokerStars.com for 39 and spun it into 2.5m. Millions flooded after him, transforming poker from a shady endeavour for the adventurous few into a massive pastime for an entire generation. But it is no longer, as Stuart Wheeler clearly imagines, about big hats and ballsy bluffs. Try that on the modern poker scene and even his fortune could be obliterated in weeks. The millions of new young players, many with maths degrees, brought a revolution in technical strategy. Belligerent old Texans, still relying on primitive ideas of aggression and bluster, have been left in the dust. You do not succeed by being more \\"competitive\\" than your opponent, but by being cleverer. In other words, Mr Wheeler's poker point proves that he overestimates the value of muscle. We have all realised this in poker, but the business world is glacially slow to catch on. It is the masculine prejudices of the stock market, towards big-hat aggression and high-pressure manoeuvres, that led to the financial mess where we currently find ourselves. Macho competition on trading floors led to over-reaching, borrowed money, crashes – and subsequent demands for huge bonuses from the men who triggered them, on the grounds that this bull-headed approach is a rare and special skill. If Stuart Wheeler approached me for poker advice, I would tell him what I tell all aspiring players: the first rule is not to go skint. The second rule is to make a profit, however small. Those who are blinded by ego, interested only in vast wins and huge adrenaline rushes, end up trapped in the escalating debt scenario that currently threatens the entire western economy. Stuart Wheeler made a personal fortune with his business, but it was a betting company. It did not build or create anything. On such shifting sands sit the precarious national economies of today. In poker's official list of all-time money winners (all genders) I am 525th. That's actually pretty good, but my secret truth is the more important lesson for would-be gamblers. If you take account of poker losses (which the official records do not), I am in much better shape than many of the 524 who are officially above me. I play far more rarely and selectively than most pros, so my statistical win rate is higher; also, I take fewer risks so have kept more of my winnings. I have flaws as a player, of course, but over-reaching myself for reasons of ego isn't one of them. Is this because I'm female? I suspect that's hugely relevant. It is only my personal observation, but it seems that women gamble less (even while we are in the act of gambling) because we are slower to separate the betting chips from the reality of food and shoes. This operates as a check on recklessness. Opponents will say this is a weakness in my poker game. I will think (but do not say): I bet my bank account is healthier than yours. Therefore, if, like Stuart Wheeler, I were looking to poker for a comfortable, gender-based generalisation about world affairs, I would make precisely the opposite point. If our western economies were in female hands then perhaps we would not be staring at our empty fingers and wondering: where did all that money go? Write a one or two sentence summary.","response":"Stuart Wheeler's outdated views on the role of women in poker and business underestimate their success and the value of strategic thinking over aggressive competition. Embracing the qualities that women bring to the table can lead to a more stable and sustainable approach to both poker and business, contrary to Wheeler's perspective."},{"question":"What sentence would provide a factual answer to this question: \\"A magnifying glass makes objects\\"","response":"A magnifying glass makes objects look bigger or larger than they really are.

Here are the steps to create such a task: 1. Identify a suitable physical concept: Start by choosing a fundamental concept from physics such as gravity, friction, or fluid dynamics. For this example, let's choose the concept of \\"gravity.\\" 2. Define the experiment: Design a simple, clear, and easy-to-conduct experiment that can demonstrate the chosen concept. For gravity, we could use the classic \\"dropping two objects of different mass\\" experiment. 3. Set up the experiment and collect materials: Next, gather the necessary materials for the experiment. In this case, we would need two objects of different mass (e.g., a book and a tennis ball) and a space where you can safely drop them (e.g., a room with a high ceiling or an outdoor area). 4. Prepare the task with a question: Frame the task in the form of a question that requires physical reasoning to predict the outcome. Our question could be: \\"Which object - the book or the tennis ball - will hit the ground first when dropped simultaneously from the same height?, and why?\\" 5. Define measurable outcomes: Make sure the outcomes are clear and quantifiable. In this case, the outcomes are the time it takes for each object to hit the ground, and the explanation behind the result. The person performing the task must apply their understanding of physical reasoning to predict the outcome of the experiment (whether both objects hit the ground at the same time or one arrives first), as well as provide an explanation based on the principles of gravity. This task will assess their ability to apply physical concepts to real-world situations and effectively evaluate the outcomes."},{"question":"Check the spelling of this word. Check your luggage before boarding. Does the word \\"check\\" mean the same thing in the above two sentences?","response":"In the two sentences provided, the word \\"check\\" is used in different contexts, with slightly different meanings which are derived from the same core concept. While it's the same word, the way it is used in each sentence modifies its meaning subtly to fit the situation. 1. In the first sentence, \\"Check the spelling of this word,\\" the word \\"check\\" is used as a verb, meaning to examine, investigate or verify. In this context, the speaker asks that the listener ensures the spelling of the word is correct. In short, one must look at the word, confirm its spelling, and ensure it aligns with the appropriate and correct spelling. 2. In the second sentence, \\"Check your luggage before boarding,\\" the word \\"check\\" is again used as a verb but takes on a slightly different meaning. In this situation, the speaker is instructing another individual to place their luggage in a designated area or to hand it over to an authorized person, like a luggage handler, before boarding an aircraft or other means of transportation. In the context of traveling, \\"check\\" often refers to the action of entrusting one's baggage to the proper authorities to be stored, transported, and collected at the final destination. In conclusion, although the word \\"check\\" is used in both sentences, it carries slightly different meanings in each context. In the first instance, it refers to the act of confirming or validating, while in the second, it implies the process of submitting luggage to be stored and handled by transport staff. The core idea behind these meanings, however, revolves around the act of examination or evaluation, which is an integral part of both the processes described."},{"question":"Write a short summary for this text: the judge also told enron and its creditors to discuss the possibility of further payments to former employees .","response":"The important person called the judge asked Enron, a big company, and the people they owe money to, to talk about maybe giving more money to the people who used to work for Enron."},{"question":"Choose from options: Determine if the sentence is true based on the text below: Simon Corbell was terminated from his position as Deputy Chief Minister of the Australian Capital Territory.

Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia Regum Britanniae, completed c. 1138, contains the first narrative account of Arthur's life. This work is an imaginative and fanciful account of British kings from the legendary Trojan exile Brutus to the 7th-century Welsh king Cadwallader. Geoffrey places Arthur in the same post-Roman period as do Historia Brittonum and Annales Cambriae. He incorporates Arthur's father Uther Pendragon, his magician advisor Merlin, and the story of Arthur's conception, in which Uther, disguised as his enemy Gorlois by Merlin's magic, sleeps with Gorlois's wife Igerna (Igraine) at Tintagel, and she conceives Arthur. On Uther's death, the fifteen-year-old Arthur succeeds him as King of Britain and fights a series of battles, similar to those in the Historia Brittonum, culminating in the Battle of Bath. He then defeats the Picts and Scots before creating an Arthurian empire through his conquests of Ireland, Iceland and the Orkney Islands. After twelve years of peace, Arthur sets out to expand his empire once more, taking control of Norway, Denmark and Gaul. Gaul is still held by the Roman Empire when it is conquered, and Arthur's victory leads to a further confrontation with Rome. Arthur and his warriors, including Kaius (Kay), Beduerus (Bedivere) and Gualguanus (Gawain), defeat the Roman emperor Lucius Tiberius in Gaul but, as he prepares to march on Rome, Arthur hears that his nephew Modredus (Mordred)—whom he had left in charge of Britain—has married his wife Guenhuuara (Guinevere) and seized the throne. Arthur returns to Britain and defeats and kills Modredus on the river Camblam in Cornwall, but he is mortally wounded.

It was the organizing principle of rural economy that originated in the Roman villa system of the Late Roman Empire, and was widely practiced in medieval western and parts of central Europe. It was slowly replaced by the advent of a money-based market economy and new forms of agrarian contract. Manorialism was characterised by the vesting of legal and economic power in a Lord of the Manor, supported economically from his own direct landholding in a manor (sometimes called a fief), and from the obligatory contributions of a legally subject part of the peasant population under the jurisdiction of himself and his manorial court. Context: The word derives from traditional inherited divisions of the countryside, reassigned as local jurisdictions known as manors or seigneuries; each manor being subject to a lord (French seigneur), usually holding his position in return for undertakings offered to a higher lord (see Feudalism). The lord held a manorial court, governed by public law and local custom. Not all territorial seigneurs were secular; bishops and abbots also held lands that entailed similar obligations. By extension, the word manor is sometimes used in England to mean any home area or territory in which authority is held, often in a police or criminal context. In the generic plan of a medieval manor from Shepherd's Historical Atlas, the strips of individually worked land in the open field system are immediately apparent. In this plan, the manor house is set slightly apart from the village, but equally often the village grew up around the forecourt of the manor, formerly walled, while the manor lands stretched away outside, as still may be seen at Petworth House. As concerns for privacy increased in the 18th century, manor houses were often located a farther distance from the village. For example, when a grand new house was required by the new owner of Harlaxton Manor, Lincolnshire, in the 1830s, the site of the existing manor house at the edge of its village was abandoned for a new one, isolated in its park, with the village out of view. In an agrarian society, the conditions of land tenure underlie all social or economic factors. There were two legal systems of pre-manorial landholding. One, the most common, was the system of holding land \\"allodially\\" in full outright ownership. The other was a use of precaria or benefices, in which land was held conditionally (the root of the English word \\"precarious\\"). To these two systems, the Carolingian monarchs added a third, the aprisio, which linked manorialism with feudalism. The aprisio made its first appearance in Charlemagne's province of Septimania in the south of France, when Charlemagne had to settle the Visigothic refugees, who had fled with his retreating forces, after the failure of his Zaragoza expedition of 778. He solved this problem by allotting \\"desert\\" tracts of uncultivated land belonging to the royal fisc under direct control of the emperor. These holdings aprisio entailed specific conditions. The earliest specific aprisio grant that has been identified was at Fontjoncouse, near Narbonne (see Lewis, links). In former Roman settlements, a system of villas, dating from Late Antiquity, was inherited by the medieval world. Question: When was this word adopted? Answer:","response":"It is difficult to pinpoint an exact date for when the word \\"manorialism\\" was adopted. However, the origins of manorialism can be traced back to the Roman villa system of the Late Roman Empire, which evolved during the early medieval period (circa 5th-10th centuries) into the manorial system practiced in medieval western and parts of central Europe. The term \\"manorialism\\" itself likely emerged alongside this evolution, but a precise date is not readily available."},{"question":"Question: What were gold contacts attached to to increase signal output?

Michael Zennie. PUBLISHED:. 12:48 EST, 14 August 2013. |. UPDATED:. 16:10 EST, 14 August 2013. Ouch: Binge drinking costs more than just a hangover. The CDC says it costs more than 223.5billion a year. A shocking new government study claims that excessive drinking costs the nation more than 223.5billion a year in health care, lost productivity, crime and early death - and most of the burden is carried by taxpayers. The research, released Tuesday by the Centers for Disease Control, finds that binge drinking, alcoholism and alcohol abuse is dragging millions - and sometimes billions - of dollars from the economies of every state in the country. The health and productivity losses mean that for every cocktail, pint of beer or glass of wine consumed, American society must pay nearly 2 in additional costs. The nation's capital, which has one of the highest rates of alcohol consumption in the country according to CDC figures, pays the most. Washington DC residents consumed more than 680 drinks each in 2006 - the year that the study surveyed. Those drinks cost out more than 966billion in ancillary healthcare bills and productivity losses as a result - more than 1,660 per resident of the city. Utah, where strong influence from the Mormon church means alcohol is heavily regulated, has the lowest rates of alcohol consumption and - as a result - the lowest costs. Utah residents consumed fewer than 200 drinks each in 2006 and paid just 578 per capita. The shocking figure of 223.5billion is larger than the economies of Ireland and Pakistan. Researchers say it should serve as a wake-up call that the country needs to curb its drinking habit. 'Excessive alcohol use has devastating impacts on individuals, families, communities, and the economy,' CDC Director Dr Tom Frieden said in a statement. 'In addition to injury, illness, disease, and death, it costs our society billions of dollars through reduced work productivity, increased criminal justice expenses, and higher healthcare costs. 'Effective prevention programs can support people in making wise choices about drinking alcohol.' About 42 percent of the cost of heavy drinking was paid by state or federal funds - whether through Medicare and Medicaid or by other government services. That amounted to the largest share of the cost - and less than the cost paid by heavy drinkers and their families. Some 70percent of the costs of excessive alcohol use was incurred by binge drinkers - those who consume five or more drinks in a single sitting. Binge drinkers account for an estimated 70percent of the cost of alcohol abuse in America, the CDC study found. Authors of the study cautioned that the data doesn't include drinkers whose productivity at work is hampered by hangovers. A MailOnline analysis of CDC data shows that New Hampshire had the highest rates of alcohol consumption, with 736 drinks purchased per capita in 2006. Washington, DC, and Nevada were the next highest. However, the CDC points out that in New Hampshire many of the package liquor buyers come from other states and in Nevada - home to Sin City - much of the state's alcohol consumption can be attributed to tourists. The lowest per capita alcohol consumption was in Utah, Oklahoma and Arkansas. The study will be published in the October issue of the American Journal of Preventative Medicine. Highlights:","response":"1. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) states excessive drinking costs the US more than 223.5 billion annually in healthcare, lost productivity, crime, and early death. 2.

Washington DC, which has one of the highest rates of alcohol consumption in the US, pays the most. 5. Utah, where alcohol is heavily regulated due to the influence of the Mormon church, has the lowest alcohol consumption and associated costs. 6.

To find the time it takes for C to do the work alone, we divide the work by C's rate: Time_C = W / C_rate Time_C = W / (W/12) Time_C = 12 Thus, C will take 12 hours to complete the work alone. The answer is (A) 12 hours."},{"question":"Here are some concepts: boat, flight, lock What is a sentence about these concepts?","response":"The application of these three concepts: boat, flight, and lock, can be interwoven into a multitude of contexts. One such context could be the sphere of transportation and security. A boat is a type of watercraft designed for personal or commercial use. It’s a mode of transportation that can be utilized for various purposes such as fishing, shipping, sport, or recreation. These can range dramatically in size and design, encompassing a variety of classifications like sailboats, motorboats, rowboats, paddle boats, and more. They are designed to float on, and navigate through, waterways - this includes oceans, seas, rivers, and lakes. Flight, a concept most commonly associated with aviation, stems from the action or process of flying through the air. It is a phenomenon that has been intricately studied and harnessed by humans, resulting in the creation of aircraft ranging from hot air balloons and gliders to commercial and military jets. However, when broadly defined, flight is not just confined to humans and their inventions. It's also seen in the natural world among various species of birds, insects, and bats. A lock, on the other hand, is a mechanical or electronic fastening device that is released by a physical object (such as a key, keycard, fingerprint, RFID card, security token) or by a combination. The primary purpose of a lock is to provide security, whether it's as simple as a padlock on a gym locker or as complex as a biometric access control system in a top-secret facility. Now, crafting a sentence that encapsulates the relationship between these three disparate concepts could be: \\"The captain secured the lock on the boat's main hatch before the pre-dawn flight, ensuring the safety and security of the precious cargo on board.\\" This sentence illustrates how a boat (mode of transport on water) can be secured using a lock (security mechanism), before it embarks on a journey potentially involving flight (long-distance transport through air). Therefore, the sentence encapsulates all three concepts in a seamless blend of their functional attributes."},{"question":"Read the below conversation. M: Hello, I want a cab. W: Ok.

Did you fall prey to their claims? Rather that vouch for myself - my story is trite, and not particularly interesting - I'll relay the tale one of my nurses shared with me when I was laid up in the hospital for a few weeks. Call her R. R was from an Eastern European country. We chit-chatted a lot, while she was taking my blood pressure readings and stuff. Lots of fun stories! But she relayed to me one of her first U.S. memories: She wanted to lose weight. She was impressed by some things the U.S. had to offer - \\"you have actual nutritional information on everything!\\" - and thus figured everything she encountered was on the level. And she found a \\"miracle cure\\" company who was along those lines! \\"These are AWESOME miracle shoe inserts! Wear them, and the pounds will melt away!\\" She saved her pennies and dimes; she sprung for the inserts. She received them... and they were shoe inserts; that much was true. But then there was their documentation: \\"using these insoles, combined with a 1200 calorie-per-day diet....\\" Like a 1200-calorie diet won't likely involve weight-loss, no matter what else you did, shoe inserts aside. The inserts did nothing, obviously. It was a sham. At which point she knew she was snookered, but really had no recourse. She wasn't explicit about it, but I got the feeling that it was a leading factor towards her chosen profession. \\"I might not have been the most sage medical person ever, but I'm gonna rectify that, and if ever I hear someone falling for that sort of gambit again, I'll be there to nip those sentiments in the bud with my own anecdotes.\\" Which is awesome. I still feel for her. I wish I had contact information, so I could touch base, and express those thoughts personally. But that's the most personally resonant version of false advertising affecting someone that I've seen. What is probably true about R? Pick the correct answer from the following options: A.

Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal? Pick your answer from: (1). go upward from number 1.; (2). go downward from number 10.;...I think the answer is","response":"I think the answer is (1). go upward from number 1. Both methods can be used to count but option (1) is more reasonable for accomplishing the goal, and here is a detailed explanation of why: 1. Natural counting process: Starting to count from the number 1 aligns with the most basic and intuitive method of counting. It corresponds to the natural progression of numbers, and hence, it is easier for people to comprehend and perform. Going upward from number 1 mimics the way we have learned to count since childhood, and it is the most commonly used method across various tasks and situations. 2. Universality: Counting from 1 upwards adheres to the standard mathematical notation and conventions used in various cultures and languages around the world. This method is universally understood, which promotes better communication and minimizes confusion. 3. Limitless counting range: When counting upward from number 1, it is easy to keep track of the ongoing count, and there is no particular limit or upper boundary on the numbers. This enables you to count an indefinite amount of items or keep track of progress without any constraints. On the other hand, counting downward from a specific number (such as 10) is limited and requires constant adjustments if the counting range exceeds the starting point. 4. Less cognitive load: Starting to count at 1 and going upwards requires less cognitive effort as opposed to counting down from a higher number. For most people, counting upwards is an automated response, whereas counting down may warrant additional mental exertion due to the need for continuous arithmetic (i.e., subtraction) and the constant updating of the initial number. 5. Practical applications: In real-life situations, counting upwards from 1 is often more practical. For instance, when counting the number of people attending an event, it is logical to start at 1 and continue counting upward as more individuals arrive. Likewise, counting from 1 is useful when measuring things like time, distance, or the amount of a particular object (e.g., inventory, money, etc.). These applications often rely on a starting point of 0 or 1, hence making the upward counting method more suitable. In summary, counting upward from number 1 is the more reasonable method to accomplish the goal of counting because it aligns with the natural counting process, has universal applicability, provides a limitless counting range, requires less cognitive effort, and is more practical for various applications. While counting downward from number 10 can still be used to count, it brings certain limitations and challenges that make option (1) the better choice overall."},{"question":"Data: name = The Wrestlers, eatType = coffee shop, food = Fast food, priceRange = high, area = city centre, familyFriendly = no, near = Raja Indian Cuisine.

Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options: - floral arrangement - girl's hair - box - car - typewriter Answer:","response":"The most suitable option to answer the question \\"What do people usually tie a ribbon around as a present?\\" is a box. Ribbons are commonly used to add an elegant and decorative touch to gifts. Tying a ribbon around a box not only enhances its appearance, but also generates an element of excitement and anticipation for the recipient. Ribbons come in various colors, patterns, and materials, allowing the giver to personalize the presentation according to the occasion or the preferences of the recipient. While it is true that ribbons can be used in other contexts as well, such as in floral arrangements to create contrast or to complement the colors of the flowers, or in a girl's hair as a simple yet charming accessory, these uses are not as closely associated with gift-giving as tying a ribbon around a box. As for the other options, although ribbons can be used for decorating cars in specific situations such as weddings or other special events, this is not a common practice for everyday gift-giving. Similarly, tying a ribbon around a typewriter would be highly unusual, as typewriters are not commonly gifted items and wrapping them in a ribbon would be impractical. In summary, out of the given options, tying a ribbon around a box is the most suitable answer to the question, as it is the most common practice associated with gift-giving and is particularly effective in adding a personal and festive touch to presents."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer.

Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, commissioner of the Metropolitan police in London, told a conference of senior American police chiefs that authorities must take care “post-Snowden” to use the most intrusive surveillance tools available to them “only where necessary”, or “risk losing them altogether”. “We need to ensure that where law enforcement accesses private communications there is a process of authorisation, oversight and governance that gets the balance right between the individual’s right to privacy and their right to be protected from serious crime,” said Hogan-Howe, whose force that takes the lead on police counter-terrorism efforts in the UK. Speaking at an event in New York on Thursday, Hogan-Howe told fellow chiefs including Bill Bratton, the commissioner of the New York police department: “There is work to be done to restore the public’s trust that we are acting in their best interests.” The remarks appeared to contrast with more strident comments made by other senior British officials including David Cameron, the prime minister, who last year accused Snowden and newspapers such as the Guardian who published his disclosures of “helping our enemies”. However, Hogan-Howe also used his speech to rail against an increase in online security and encryption that has followed the revelations from Snowden, a contractor for the US National Security Agency (NSA) who leaked a cache of documents disclosing controversial electronic surveillance programs run there and at GCHQ, the NSA’s sister agency in the UK. Authorities have complained bitterly in particular about the latest update to the operating system for Apple’s iPhones, which upgraded the encryption on users’ data so as to prevent it from being accessible for handing over to law enforcement agencies. Hogan-Howe claimed that the internet was at risk of becoming a “dark and ungoverned space” because encryption and security measures on communications devices were now “beyond what any genuine domestic user could reasonably require”. Bratton told a press conference afterwards that the Islamic State (Isis) were using “increasingly sophisticated recruiting efforts” such as social media and well-produced websites “to actively recruit and successively recruit” jihadists. Hogan-Howe said that counter-terrorism officials in the UK were removing 1,000 pieces of “illegal content” from the web each week. “We cannot police the whole internet, but we will continue to do what we can.” Stressing that 500 Britons had travelled to join the conflict in Iraq and Syria, the Met police chief said that the threat of these people returning as militarised jihadists must be dealt with. However he also said that recent isolated attacks on police and military personnel in New York and Canada highlighted the need to be watchful of so-called “lone wolf” attackers. After telling the conference that “privacy is important”, Hogan-Howe was asked by the Guardian whether it was acceptable that British security were reported earlier on Thursday to be intercepting traditionally privileged communications between lawyers and their clients. Claiming not to have seen the specific reports, Hogan-Howe said he would be “amazed” if officials at MI5 and GCHQ were routinely eavesdropping on attorney-client conversations, adding: “That is very legally restricted unless the lawyer is involved with crime.” “It’s very clear what the law says, which is obviously that there is a legal privilege that exists between a lawyer and their client,” he said. And that is greatly respected.” The Met police chief said that despite the elevation in the government’s official threat level to “severe” in August this year, there was at present no direct intelligence indicating a planned attack in the near future. He declined to address when asked the likelihood of a terrorist plot being hatched using online communications to which law enforcement agencies no longer had access.

The second statement simply mentions that two men are waiting outside. Since street corners are typically located outside, it can be concluded that both statements align with each other regarding the fact that two men are waiting while it is raining.

The film follows the stories of four young women - Margaret (raped by her cousin), Bernadette (too beautiful and coquettish), Rose (an unmarried mother) and Crispina (an intellectually disabled unmarried mother) - who are all forced by their families or caretakers into the Magdalene Asylum. The film details the disastrous lives of the four girls whilst they are inmates of the laundries, portraying their harsh daily regimen, their squalid living conditions and the oppressive nature of the Catholic faith at the time. Each woman suffers unspeakable cruelty and violence from the Mother Superior, Sister Bridget, despite her gentle-faced appearance and outwardly soft-spoken demeanour. She is characterised as sadistic and almost inhuman at times, as conveyed through her merciless beating of Rose in full view of Bernadette, or when she mockingly laughs at Una as she hopelessly clutches at her fallen hair locks. The film also criticises the hypocrisy and corruption within the staff of the laundries. Sister Bridget relishes the money the business receives and it is suggested that little of it is distributed appropriately. Those who liken themselves to Mary Magdalene, who deprived herself of all pleasures of the flesh including food and drink, eat hearty breakfasts of buttered toast and bacon while the working women subsist on oatmeal. In one particularly humiliating scene, the women are forced to stand naked in a line after taking a communal shower. The nuns then hold a \\"contest\\" on who has the most pubic hair, biggest bottom, biggest breasts and smallest breasts. The corruption of the resident priest, Father Fitzroy, is made very clear through his sexual abuse of Crispina.

However, Aura is soon caught, but her return to the hospital coincides with the start of a string of murders of hospital staff members, past and present. The killer decapitates them using a home-made garrote device on rainy days. When her father is murdered along with her mother, Aura and David team up to find the killer. In the end, it is revealed that Aura's mother (who faked her death after murdering her husband) is the killer.

Currently intercity travel within the U.S. tends to favour air travel . 2. This is often due to the large distances between cities within the U.S. which mean that driving is not a viable strategy should there be time constraints on travel . 3. However , air travel has significant constraints as well such as long boarding times . 4. This causes problems for those people who frequently commute and high speed rail is set to solve these problems . 5. High speed rail provides a large number of significant benefits over air travel in this regard . 6. This is because high speed rail can travel to city centres . 7. Where airports , due to their size and the noise pollution they cause , are limited to the outskirts of a city , trains are not limited in the same way . 8. As such , people can arrive in a much more central area , cutting large amounts of time off their journey . 9. Secondly , high speed rail has no limits on wireless communication or internet in the same way that air travel does . 10. As such , high speed rail is significantly more useful for anyone who wishes to work on the journey .","response":"The argument implied by these sentences suggests that high-speed rail is a preferable alternative to air travel for intercity travel within the U.S., mainly due to the convenience and efficiency it offers. This argument unfolds by presenting the limitations of both driving and air travel as modes of intercity transport. The large distances between American cities make driving impractical in many cases, and air travel, while faster, has its downsides such as lengthy boarding times, which can be especially problematic for frequent commuters. High-speed rail, on the other hand, offers numerous advantages over air travel. Firstly, it can directly deliver passengers to city centers, unlike airports that are usually located on the outskirts of cities due to their size and noise pollution concerns. This factor alone can save considerable time for travelers, as they will not need to tackle additional transportation to reach their final destination. Secondly, high-speed rail does not impose restrictions on wireless communication and internet access, unlike air travel. This makes it more convenient for those who wish to remain connected or work during their journey. In summary, the argument suggests that high-speed rail is a more viable and beneficial mode of intercity transport in the U.S. compared to air travel, particularly for frequent commuters. The main advantages lie in its ability to directly access city centers and the unrestricted use of digital communication tools, both of which contribute to a more convenient and efficient travel experience."},{"question":"Write a short summary for this text: a meeting tuesday of six key powers in berlin on iran 's nuclear program will show tehran that it has not yet eliminated international concerns , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said .","response":"On Tuesday, six important countries will have a meeting in a place called Berlin to talk about Iran's special energy program, called nuclear program.

The starter turns well so it can't be the battery. It was filled up yesterday. What can the problem be? Second question: Should you leave the car engine in idle for a while before turning it off after a long drive? Are these two questions asking the same thing? Choose your answer from: + no; + yes;","response":"First question: Since you have ruled out the battery and you mentioned that you filled up recently, there are several potential reasons why your car's engine died while driving. Here is a detailed list of some possible causes: 1. Fuel pump or fuel filter failure: It's possible that the fuel pump or fuel filter has become clogged or failed. This would prevent fuel from reaching the engine, causing it to stall. 2. Ignition switch problems: Issues with the ignition switch can cause a loss of power to the engine and other electrical components, leading to the engine suddenly cutting out. 3. Engine timing issues: If there's a problem with the timing belt or chain, it may cause the engine to stop running. An out-of-sync timing belt could result in engine misfires or piston-valve contact, both of which can lead to engine stalling. 4. Ignition system problems: Problems with the ignition system components such as the ignition coil, spark plugs, or spark plug wires can cause the engine to die while driving. 5. Electronic Control Module (ECM) malfunction: The ECM manages various engine functions, and if it malfunctions or fails, it can cause the engine to stall. 6. Sensor failure: A throttle position sensor or a mass airflow sensor might be faulty, leading to incorrect signals being sent to the engine control system and causing the engine to stall. 7. Vacuum leak: A vacuum leak in the engine can cause running issues and stalling. 8. Overheating: If the engine was overheating, it may stall as a protective measure to prevent damage. It is worth noting that this list is not exhaustive, and a professional mechanic should be consulted to diagnose and address the issue with your car. Second question: It is generally a good practice to let your car engine idle for a short period (usually around 30 seconds to a minute) after a long drive before turning it off. This allows the engine to cool down gradually and can help prevent issues such as overheating or turbocharger damage (if your car is equipped with a turbo system). It is especially important for turbocharged engines, as the turbocharger uses engine oil for lubrication and cooling, and turning the engine off immediately after a long drive can cause the oil to remain stagnant in the hot turbocharger, potentially leading to premature failure. To answer the third point, these two questions are not asking the same thing. The first question is asking about potential causes for an engine dying while driving, while the second question is about whether it is necessary to let the car engine idle before turning it off after a long drive. Therefore, the answer is: + no;"},{"question":"Astăzi Moldova este un stat independent. Which language is this?","response":"This sentence is in Romanian.

However, these signs do not provide an accurate prediction of the specific timing of an eruption. While scientists can indicate that a volcano is becoming more active and that an eruption may be likely, pinpointing the exact day and time an eruption will occur remains impossible due to the complex and unpredictable nature of the Earth's geothermal systems. Volcanic activity is influenced by numerous factors, including internal magma dynamics, geological structures, and even external factors such as precipitation and tectonic activity, making it difficult to determine an exact time of eruption."},{"question":"Review: I had no idea what this movie was until I read about it in the L.A.

First, we'll simplify the equation a bit. 344636 - 109148 equals 235488. So now the equation looks like this: 0 = -4906*m + 235488. Now, we want to solve for m. Think of it like this. If you have a certain number of candies (which is 235488 in our case) and you were to slightly increase or decrease the number of candies you have by a certain amount (which is -4906*m here), if you want the result to be zero (which means no candies), how much should that changing amount be? To figure out, we will move -4906*m to one side of the equation, and 235488 to the other side by adding 4906*m to both sides and subtracting 235488 from both sides. The equation will now look like this: 4906*m = 235488. Now, to find out how much your 'm' (which is the same as your changing amount), we have to divide 235488 by 4906. If we do that, we get 'm' is approximately equal to 48. So, if -4906 is multiplied by 48 and added to 235488, we will have no candies left. Which means 0. In conclusion: m = 48 (approximately). I hope this helps. Just remember it's like figuring out how many candies you need to eat or add to make sure there are none left."},{"question":"- A type of coal must be chosen before the heating can start - The coal is broken down to a smaller material - The coal particles mix with hot air and move in to a boiler - Water in the boiler is pumped and produces steam with the coal - Steam powers turbine blades, which magnetically charge wire coals What might be the last step of the process?","response":"The last step of the process is that the magnetically charged wire coils within the turbines generate electricity, which is then transmitted through power lines to homes, businesses, and industries for consumption."},{"question":"Tom: Hi!

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose humans may pollute the earth happens, how will it affect the earth will not warm so rapidly. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","response":"The perturbation hypothesis in this case is concerned with the potential impact of human-induced pollution on Earth's atmosphere. Specifically, it queries whether the introduction of additional pollutants could influence the rate at which the Earth warms. To determine whether the supposed perturbation has a direct or indirect effect on the process, it is necessary to assess the role of human activities in contributing to the atmospheric composition and the subsequent impact on climate change. Human activities, particularly those associated with the burning of fossil fuels, agriculture, and deforestation, are known to result in the release of various pollutants, including greenhouse gases. Greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and water vapor (H2O), play a significant role in regulating the Earth's temperature. They absorb infrared radiation emitted by the Earth's surface, retaining heat that would otherwise escape into space. In turn, this trapped heat has a gradual warming effect on the planet's overall climate. When human activities contribute to the increased release of greenhouse gases, they become a direct factor in altering the balance of naturally occurring gases in the Earth's atmosphere. This increase in human-generated pollutants can lead to the intensification of the greenhouse effect, thus causing global warming to occur at a more rapid pace. Another important consideration in this context is the effect of aerosols, which are tiny particles that are suspended in the atmosphere. Human-induced pollutants, such as aerosols from industrial processes, have both warming and cooling effects on the climate. While some aerosols, such as black carbon, absorb sunlight and contribute to warming, others, like sulfates, can scatter incoming solar radiation, leading to a cooling effect. The net result of these competing influences is not fully understood, as aerosol-induced cooling can temporarily offset the warming caused by greenhouse gases. Nonetheless, it is evident that human activities have a notable impact on the Earth's atmosphere and temperature regulation. In summary, the perturbation hypothesis posits that human-induced pollution could influence the rate at which the Earth warms. Based on the strong evidence linking human activities to altered atmospheric composition and climate change, it is reasonable to conclude that the perturbation does have an effect, both direct and indirect, on the warming process. Direct effects manifest through the increased release of greenhouse gases due to factors like fossil fuel consumption, agriculture, and deforestation, resulting in enhanced warming. Indirect impacts may involve the modulation of warming through the presence of aerosols, which can have both warming and cooling effects, depending on their nature. Overall, human-induced pollution does indeed play a significant role in shaping the Earth's climate and the pace at which it warms."},{"question":"Available options: a). A teacher; b). A doctor; c).

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more crystals will be formed happens, how will it affect LESS minerals forming. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","response":"If more crystals are formed within the magma, it typically implies that there is a higher rate of cooling, which might influence the formation of minerals. Nonetheless, the relationship between crystal formation and mineral development is complex and can be affected by various factors, such as the magma's composition, temperature, and pressure, as well as the rate of cooling. In general, as the magma cools and particles move closer together, crystals start to form, and these crystals contain minerals. There are two possible scenarios in the context of the perturbation hypothesis: 1. If the increase in crystal formation occurs due to a rapid cooling rate, it can result in the formation of smaller crystals with a limited time for minerals to grow. Consequently, the outcome might be a lower concentration of larger, well-developed mineral crystals. 2. Conversely, if the increase in crystal formation is caused by having a magma composition that is richer in elements that can form minerals, more crystals might lead to the formation of a more diverse range of minerals in the rock. In this case, the number of available mineral-forming elements in the magma would impact the mineral's formation rather than the number of crystals. In summary, the perturbation of more crystals forming may have an effect, either direct or indirect, on the process of mineral formation based on the circumstances. If it causes minerals to form less efficiently due to rapid cooling and reduced opportunity for growth, the outcome may be a lower concentration of larger, well-developed mineral crystals. On the other hand, if it results from an increased number of mineral-forming elements available within the magma, it might lead to the formation of more diverse minerals within the rock."},{"question":"The Glory of Melaka: In the early days, if you were not a pirate or a mosquito, Melaka was not much of a place to live. The land was infertile, just a swampy plain, the river small and sluggish. But it had a sheltered harbor, protected from the monsoons by neighboring Sumatra. Later, the strategic location and deep-water channel close to the coast brought in the bigger vessels of the trade-wind traffic crossing the Indian Ocean. The first to realize the larger commercial potential, as so often throughout the country's subsequent history, were the Chinese. In 1409, under a new directive from Emperor Chu Ti to pursue trade in the South Seas and the Indian Ocean, a Chinese fleet of 50 ships headed by Admiral Cheng Ho called in at Melaka. They made Parameswara an offer he could not refuse: port facilities and an annual financial tribute in exchange for Chinese protection against the marauding Thais. In 1411, Parameswara took the money to Beijing himself, and the emperor gratefully made him a vassal king. Twenty years later, the Chinese withdrew again from the South Seas trade. The new ruler of Melaka, Sri Maharajah, switched his allegiance to the Muslim trading fraternity by marrying into the Muslim faith, wedding the daughter of a sultan in Sumatra. Islam won its place in Malaya not by conquest — as had been the case in North Africa and Europe — but by trade, dynastic alliances, and peaceful preaching. Bengali peddlers had already brought the faith to the east coast. In Melaka and throughout the peninsula, Islam thrived as a strong, male-dominated religion of individuality, offering dynamic leadership and preaching brotherhood and self-reliance — all qualities ideally suited to the coastal trade. At the same time, Sufi mystics synthesized Islamic teaching with local Malay traditions of animistic magic and charisma, though Islam did not become the state religion until Muzaffar Shah became sultan of Melaka (1446–1459). But the key figure in the sultanate was Tun Perak, bendahara (prime minister) and military commander. He expanded Melaka's power along the west coast and down to Singapore and the neighboring Bintan islands. He also had orang laut pirates patrolling the seas to extort tribute from passing ships. After Ailied district chiefs had repelled assaults from Thai-controlled armies from Pahang, Tun Perak personally led a famous victory over a Thai fleet off Batu Pahat in 1456.

'Let it be an arms race': Trump appears to double down on nuclear expansion Read more Paul began with an explanation of the event, which takes its name from a holiday celebrated as an alternative to Christmas by the character Frank Costanza. “The airing of grievances” is one of the traditions of Festivus. “On the media & #fakenews,” Paul wrote, “Festivus is real, media, so don’t try 2 fact check it.” In reference to a recently suspended and rehabilitated NBC News anchor, he added: “And @TheOnion is more accurate than a Brian Williams report.” “New administration is lookin [sic] good,” he continued. “Haven’t seen this many billionaires in 1 place since I staked out Bilderbergs w/ [conspiracy theorist and Trump supporter] Alex Jones. Good times.” Subsequent tweets were critical of the tech billionaire Peter Thiel, who shares some of Paul’s libertarian views but who has been supportive of Donald Trump, and potential Trump appointments. Of the George W Bush-era UN ambassador and noted foreign intervention hawk John Bolton, much to Paul’s dismay touted as a possible undersecretary of state, the senator wrote: “I know I’ve said a lot about @AmbJohnBolton so you’re probably expecting me 2 say something nice for the holidays. Nope. #AiringofGrievances.” Of Rick Perry, who famously failed to name the Department of Energy as one he would abolish but who has now been nominated to lead it, Paul wrote: “My favorite cabinet pick is what’s his name, umm it’s that guy who wanted to eliminate the Dept of @ENERGY. Hang on I’ll think of it...” Lest proceedings become too riotous, Paul proceeded to aim a barrage of tweets at what he alleged to be examples of federal government profligacy with taxpayers’ dollars. Such targets included a state department grant to develop a Pakistani superhero, a study of Ugandan gambling practices, and a National Parks Service study of “Knowledge, Experience and Beliefs of the Supernatural Environment”. The last tweet came complete with a cat gif. Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) The national Park Service announced a grant 2 study “Knowledge, Experience and Beliefs of the Supernatural Environment.” #AiringofGrievances pic.twitter.com/8XVRwhdKe3 With what may have been a nod to another Costanza family tradition, the trials of strength, Paul also promised tweets about “nonbinding resolutions against my Senate colleagues”. Rand Paul celebrates Festivus with 'airing of grievances' against 2016 rivals Read more Subsequent targets included Tea Party Republicans Mike Lee and Ted Cruz, the New Jersey Democrat Corey Booker, and the retiring Democratic minority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada. He also took a balanced shot at a favourite bugbear of Republicans and Trump himself, the supposed failure of liberal Americans to accord the proper respect to Christmas. “I’m gonna have to stop tweeting about Festivus soon, @FoxNews just asked me to come on & talk about my own personal #WaronChristmas. Rude. “For the folks at @MSNBC, that was a joke.” Lest anyone grow too excited, the senator also had a message for members of the press looking for something to write about on the last Friday afternoon before Christmas. “For those of you ‘media’ writing serious stories about my Festivus jokes,” he wrote, “I don’t even know what to say, just stop...” ||||| Tweet with a location You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

It merely describes a snapshot of a moment where two dogs are gazing out into the street. The fact that they are sitting next to a bicycle might as well be coincidental and unrelated to the perceived sense of security they may provide. Secondly, we are not given any information about the dogs' temperament, behavior, or training. They might simply be relaxing and enjoying the view rather than actively watching out for potential threats. Even if the dogs were intentionally keeping a lookout, we are not offered any evidence of their ability to protect or respond to danger effectively. Additionally, the statement doesn't clarify whether the dogs are keeping an eye on their surroundings to ensure safety or merely observing passing events out of curiosity or interest. Canine behavior can have various motivations, and without further information, it's impossible to determine the exact purpose behind their actions. Lastly, the notion of a \\"good job\\" in terms of safety is highly subjective. Safeguarding entails a variety of tasks such as deterring potential intruders, alerting others to possible threats, and responding effectively in case of an emergency. With the limited information given, we cannot ascertain whether these dogs possess the necessary skills to perform these tasks or whether they have a history of successfully ensuring safety.

The service was held in front of a vociferous crowd in the FNB stadium in Johannesburg. US President Barack Obama said Mr Mandela was a \\"giant of history\\", describing him as the last great liberator of the 20th Century. The former South African president died last Thursday, aged 95. The country is observing a series of commemorations leading up to the funeral on Sunday. At the scene \\"It took a man like Madiba to free not just the prisoner but the jailer,\\" US President Barack Obama said, to a standing ovation. He said Nelson Mandela embodied the spirit of \\"uBuntu\\", which means \\"I am because you are\\". Thousands braved the unseasonably cold weather and rain to pay their respects to the country's first black president at the FNB stadium in Soweto. This is where he addressed the nation on the day of his release in 1990. The crowds were in high spirits but were asked to \\"behave\\" after booing President Jacob Zuma a number of times. But despite a difficult start, President Zuma delivered his message, describing Madiba as \\"truly one of a kind\\". He said Mr Mandela was a kind man but had a sharp tongue, especially when it came to something he believed in. Mr Zuma will have been relieved to hear some cheering at the end of the speech. Mandela memorial binds South Africans 'A mighty life' The memorial service, which began at about 12:00 (10:00 GMT), lasted about four hours. It was one of the biggest gatherings of international dignitaries in recent years, with more than 100 current or former heads of state or government attending. There had been fears people would be turned away. But with heavy rain, security and transport issues, and the fact that Tuesday was not declared a national holiday, areas of the 95,000-capacity stadium remained empty. Introducing the proceedings, the master of ceremonies, Cyril Ramaphosa, said that Mr Mandela's \\"long walk is over... and he can finally rest\\". Current South African President Jacob Zuma made the keynote address but was booed in some parts of the ceremony. He said Mr Mandela was \\"one of a kind... a fearless freedom fighter who refused to allow the brutality of the apartheid state to stand in way of the struggle for the liberation of his people\\". Mr Zuma announced he was renaming the Union Buildings in Pretoria, where Mr Mandela will lie in state, as the Mandela Amphitheatre. Earlier Mr Obama delivered his address, carried on the White House web site, to huge cheers. He said: \\"It is hard to eulogise any man... how much harder to do so for a giant of history, who moved a nation towards justice.\\" He said Nelson Mandela had taught the world the power of action and the power of ideas, and that it had taken a man like Mr Mandela to free not only the prisoner but also the jailer.

While I will always fall short of Madiba (Mr Mandela's clan name), he makes me want to be a better man.\\" On his way to the podium, President Obama shook hands with Cuban President Raul Castro, an unprecedented gesture between the leaders of two nations that have been at loggerheads for more than half a century. A White House official later said the two had not planned to meet. \\"This wasn't a pre-planned encounter,\\" the official said, quoted by AFP news agency. \\"Above all else, today is about honouring Nelson Mandela, and that was the president's singular focus at the memorial service.

He was one of our greatest teachers. He taught by example. He sacrificed so much and was willing to give up all he had for freedom and democracy.\\" The first speaker, friend and fellow Robben Island inmate Andrew Mlangeni, said Mr Mandela had \\"created hope when there was none\\". Many people stood in the rain waiting for several hours to get into the stadium, the BBC's Pumza Fihlani reports from the scene. She says the crowds were in high spirits - singing and dancing, stomping their feet - and the stadium had the feel of a political rally. Rather than seeing the rain as a dampener, many in South Africa have welcomed it. Defence Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula said: \\"It's a blessing from the ancestors welcoming a son of the soil.\\" Analysis That Jacob Zuma was booed at the Nelson Mandela memorial is unfortunate. This was not an occasion to take pot shots. But it shows that South Africa is a robust democracy - such booing would not have been tolerated in many other countries. People would have been too afraid to voice their rage at the president. Nevertheless, Mr Zuma ought to be worried - will it be the death knell for his political career? He is due to lead the ANC into elections next year. A faction is bound to lobby for him to be ousted, in favour of Cyril Ramaphosa, his deputy in the party. Acting as master of ceremonies, Mr Ramaphosa received a far better reception from the crowd. He was next to Mr Mandela when he was released from prison in 1990, and was the chief architect of South Africa's democratic constitution. At the time, he was widely seen as Mr Mandela's heir but was outmanoeuvred in the political chess game within the ANC to choose the legend's successor. One of those attending, Shahida Rowe from Johannesburg, told the BBC: \\"The core of Mandela's life was humanity. That is why I am here today and the world is celebrating. \\"Thanks to him, I was recognised as a human being.\\" Mr Mandela's widow, Graca Machel, arrived at the stadium to huge cheers as she was shown on the big screen. There were cheers too of \\"Winnie! Winnie!\\" for ex-wife Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, who hugged and kissed Graca Machel. Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff, Chinese Vice-President Li Yuanchao, President Hifikepunye Pohamba of Namibia and Indian President Pranab Mukherjee also made speeches. The ceremony was closed by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who asked the crowd to rise to their feet for a final tribute. The BBC's Mike Wooldridge in Johannesburg says the line-up of world leaders is a sign of how South Africa has seen its partners and place in the world since Nelson Mandela became president. But, he adds, today is as personal as it is political - a recognition that there are lessons for the wider world in everything Nelson Mandela sought to achieve.

How much harder to do so for a giant of history, who moved a nation toward justice, and in the process moved billions around the world. Born during World War I, far from the corridors of power, a boy raised herding cattle and tutored by the elders of his Thembu tribe, Madiba would emerge as the last great liberator of the 20th century. Like Gandhi, he would lead a resistance movement -- a movement that at its start had little prospect for success. Like Dr. King, he would give potent voice to the claims of the oppressed and the moral necessity of racial justice. He would endure a brutal imprisonment that began in the time of Kennedy and Khrushchev, and reached the final days of the Cold War. Emerging from prison, without the force of arms, he would -- like Abraham Lincoln -- hold his country together when it threatened to break apart. And like America’s Founding Fathers, he would erect a constitutional order to preserve freedom for future generations -- a commitment to democracy and rule of law ratified not only by his election, but by his willingness to step down from power after only one term. Given the sweep of his life, the scope of his accomplishments, the adoration that he so rightly earned, it’s tempting I think to remember Nelson Mandela as an icon, smiling and serene, detached from the tawdry affairs of lesser men. But Madiba himself strongly resisted such a lifeless portrait. Instead, Madiba insisted on sharing with us his doubts and his fears; his miscalculations along with his victories. “I am not a saint,” he said, “unless you think of a saint as a sinner who keeps on trying.” It was precisely because he could admit to imperfection -- because he could be so full of good humor, even mischief, despite the heavy burdens he carried -- that we loved him so. He was not a bust made of marble; he was a man of flesh and blood -- a son and a husband, a father and a friend. And that’s why we learned so much from him, and that’s why we can learn from him still. For nothing he achieved was inevitable. In the arc of his life, we see a man who earned his place in history through struggle and shrewdness, and persistence and faith. He tells us what is possible not just in the pages of history books, but in our own lives as well. Mandela showed us the power of action; of taking risks on behalf of our ideals. Perhaps Madiba was right that he inherited, “a proud rebelliousness, a stubborn sense of fairness” from his father. And we know he shared with millions of black and colored South Africans the anger born of, “a thousand slights, a thousand indignities, a thousand unremembered moments…a desire to fight the system that imprisoned my people,” he said. But like other early giants of the ANC -- the Sisulus and Tambos -- Madiba disciplined his anger and channeled his desire to fight into organization, and platforms, and strategies for action, so men and women could stand up for their God-given dignity. Moreover, he accepted the consequences of his actions, knowing that standing up to powerful interests and injustice carries a price. “I have fought against white domination and I have fought against black domination. I’ve cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony and [with] equal opportunities. It is an ideal which I hope to live for and to achieve. But if needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die.” Mandela taught us the power of action, but he also taught us the power of ideas; the importance of reason and arguments; the need to study not only those who you agree with, but also those who you don’t agree with. He understood that ideas cannot be contained by prison walls, or extinguished by a sniper’s bullet. He turned his trial into an indictment of apartheid because of his eloquence and his passion, but also because of his training as an advocate. He used decades in prison to sharpen his arguments, but also to spread his thirst for knowledge to others in the movement. And he learned the language and the customs of his oppressor so that one day he might better convey to them how their own freedom depend upon his. Mandela demonstrated that action and ideas are not enough. No matter how right, they must be chiseled into law and institutions. He was practical, testing his beliefs against the hard surface of circumstance and history. On core principles he was unyielding, which is why he could rebuff offers of unconditional release, reminding the Apartheid regime that “prisoners cannot enter into contracts.” But as he showed in painstaking negotiations to transfer power and draft new laws, he was not afraid to compromise for the sake of a larger goal. And because he was not only a leader of a movement but a skillful politician, the Constitution that emerged was worthy of this multiracial democracy, true to his vision of laws that protect minority as well as majority rights, and the precious freedoms of every South African. And finally, Mandela understood the ties that bind the human spirit. There is a word in South Africa -- Ubuntu -- a word that captures Mandela’s greatest gift: his recognition that we are all bound together in ways that are invisible to the eye; that there is a oneness to humanity; that we achieve ourselves by sharing ourselves with others, and caring for those around us. We can never know how much of this sense was innate in him, or how much was shaped in a dark and solitary cell. But we remember the gestures, large and small -- introducing his jailers as honored guests at his inauguration; taking a pitch in a Springbok uniform; turning his family’s heartbreak into a call to confront HIV/AIDS -- that revealed the depth of his empathy and his understanding. He not only embodied Ubuntu, he taught millions to find that truth within themselves. It took a man like Madiba to free not just the prisoner, but the jailer as well to show that you must trust others so that they may trust you; to teach that reconciliation is not a matter of ignoring a cruel past, but a means of confronting it with inclusion and generosity and truth. He changed laws, but he also changed hearts. For the people of South Africa, for those he inspired around the globe, Madiba’s passing is rightly a time of mourning, and a time to celebrate a heroic life. But I believe it should also prompt in each of us a time for self-reflection. With honesty, regardless of our station or our circumstance, we must ask: How well have I applied his lessons in my own life? It’s a question I ask myself, as a man and as a President. We know that, like South Africa, the United States had to overcome centuries of racial subjugation. As was true here, it took sacrifice -- the sacrifice of countless people, known and unknown, to see the dawn of a new day. Michelle and I are beneficiaries of that struggle. But in America, and in South Africa, and in countries all around the globe, we cannot allow our progress to cloud the fact that our work is not yet done. The struggles that follow the victory of formal equality or universal franchise may not be as filled with drama and moral clarity as those that came before, but they are no less important. For around the world today, we still see children suffering from hunger and disease. We still see run-down schools. We still see young people without prospects for the future. Around the world today, men and women are still imprisoned for their political beliefs, and are still persecuted for what they look like, and how they worship, and who they love. That is happening today. And so we, too, must act on behalf of justice. We, too, must act on behalf of peace. There are too many people who happily embrace Madiba’s legacy of racial reconciliation, but passionately resist even modest reforms that would challenge chronic poverty and growing inequality. There are too many leaders who claim solidarity with Madiba’s struggle for freedom, but do not tolerate dissent from their own people. And there are too many of us on the sidelines, comfortable in complacency or cynicism when our voices must be heard. The questions we face today -- how to promote equality and justice; how to uphold freedom and human rights; how to end conflict and sectarian war -- these things do not have easy answers. But there were no easy answers in front of that child born in World War I. Nelson Mandela reminds us that it always seems impossible until it is done. South Africa shows that is true. South Africa shows we can change, that we can choose a world defined not by our differences, but by our common hopes. We can choose a world defined not by conflict, but by peace and justice and opportunity. We will never see the likes of Nelson Mandela again. But let me say to the young people of Africa and the young people around the world -- you, too, can make his life’s work your own. Over 30 years ago, while still a student, I learned of Nelson Mandela and the struggles taking place in this beautiful land, and it stirred something in me. It woke me up to my responsibilities to others and to myself, and it set me on an improbable journey that finds me here today. And while I will always fall short of Madiba’s example, he makes me want to be a better man. He speaks to what’s best inside us. After this great liberator is laid to rest, and when we have returned to our cities and villages and rejoined our daily routines, let us search for his strength. Let us search for his largeness of spirit somewhere inside of ourselves. And when the night grows dark, when injustice weighs heavy on our hearts, when our best-laid plans seem beyond our reach, let us think of Madiba and the words that brought him comfort within the four walls of his cell: “It matters not how strait the gate, how charged with punishments the scroll, I am the master of my fate: I am the captain of my soul.” What a magnificent soul it was. We will miss him deeply. May God bless the memory of Nelson Mandela. May God bless the people of South Africa. ||||| A summary of this is?","response":"The article is a detailed account of the memorial service held for former South African President Nelson Mandela, attended by tens of thousands of South Africans and numerous world leaders. The service took place in Johannesburg's FNB stadium. US President Barack Obama delivered a poignant tribute, calling Mandela the last liberator of the 20th Century and a \\"giant of history\\". There were a few instances of booing during South African President Jacob Zuma's speech. More than one hundred current or former heads of state attended the ceremony, despite potential issues of heavy rain and security. The event was seen as one of the largest gatherings of international dignitaries in recent years. Obama's speech highlighted Mandela's achievements, his enduring spirit of ubuntu (a Zulu term for 'humanity'), and the need to continue striving for social justice in the face of inequality and oppression. The memorial ended with a closing address by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Archbishop Desmond Tutu."},{"question":"Write a positive yelp review.","response":"Title: The Ultimate Dining Experience at The Gourmet Bistro!

Upon entering the restaurant, my partner and I were welcomed with an inviting atmosphere, featuring dimmed lights, soft background music, and elegantly arranged tables that created a warm, intimate setting. The distinct character and visual appeal of the interior decor made it the perfect spot for a romantic dinner or a gathering with friends and family. From the moment we stepped in, the attentive staff at The Gourmet Bistro welcomed us with open arms. Our waiter promptly greeted us with a genuine smile, a delightful menu presentation, and a detailed explanation of the best the restaurant had to offer. Throughout the night, he went above and beyond to anticipate our needs and ensure that our glasses were always full. His extensive knowledge of the menu and the overall professionalism of the entire team contributed significantly to our overall enjoyment of the evening. The range and quality of dishes available on the menu were truly astounding, with an impressive selection of appetizers, entrees, and desserts, which catered to various dietary requirements. The chef was even happy to accommodate customizations, making the experience entirely personalized. For the appetizer, we enjoyed the perfectly seared scallops accompanied by a heavenly cauliflower puree and crispy pancetta bits, which set the stage for our delicious culinary journey. The combination of textures and flavors was magical, leaving us craving more. As an entree, my partner opted for the succulent pan-roasted salmon, which featured a crispy skin and a sublime lemon-caper sauce that enhanced the full-bodied flavors of the beautifully cooked fish. I, on the other hand, indulged in the tender filet mignon, prepared to perfection with a delectable demi-glace sauce and paired with a hearty serving of garlic mashed potatoes and seasonal vegetables - hands down, one of the best steaks I've ever had the pleasure of tasting. No dining experience would be complete without a grand finale, and our desserts certainly did not disappoint. The Gourmet Bistro's signature crème brûlée proved to be a heavenly concoction of rich, creamy custard with a caramelized sugar crust that shattered with every bite, while the light and fluffy chocolate soufflé melted in our mouths, leaving us speechless. To complement our delicious meal, we also indulged in the fine array of wines carefully curated by the sommelier. His recommendations, tailored to our tastes and preferences, were spot-on and enhanced the flavors of each dish.

Question 2: What do you do after having a minimum viable product? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","response":"Hi there! I'll happily explain these two questions for you. Question 1: A Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is the simplest version of a new product that can be launched without taking too much time or effort but still works well enough for users to try it. Imagine when you create a new toy, you want to make sure it's fun to play with, even if it doesn't have all the cool features you're thinking of yet. Question 2: After having a Minimum Viable Product, the next step is to let people use it and see how they feel about it. You can think of it like sharing your new toy with friends and asking how they liked playing with it and what could be better. Based on their feedback, you can make improvements and add more features to make your toy even cooler. Even though these questions are related, they're not the same. The first question is about what makes a MVP, and the second question is about what to do after creating one. But both answers help us understand the process of making something new from start to finish."},{"question":"Teacher:This task is about translating a given English language sentence to Yoruba language.

Options: 1. Look for a zucchini that is light in color and slightly soft. 2. Look for a zucchini that is rich in color and fairly firm.","response":"2. Look for a zucchini that is rich in color and fairly firm. The correct way to accomplish the goal of picking a ripe zucchini at the grocery store is by following option 2. A ripe zucchini should have a rich green color and be fairly firm to the touch. It should not be too soft or squishy, which can signify that it is overripe or beginning to spoil. On the other hand, if the zucchini is too hard, it may be underripe. Option 1 is incorrect because a light-colored zucchini may be underripe, and if it is slightly soft, it could indicate that it is starting to spoil or has become too ripe. Always look for zucchini with even, deep green skin, free of blemishes, and firm to the touch for the best quality."},{"question":"Data: Arem-arem, country, Indonesia; Indonesia, language, Indonesian language Sentence about the following data:","response":"Arem-arem is a traditional Indonesian dish originating from the diverse and culturally rich country of Indonesia, where the official language spoken is Indonesian.

Question: When was Burke contacted for more writings? Context: In November 1790, François-Louis-Thibault de Menonville, a member of the National Assembly of France, wrote to Burke, praising Reflections and requesting more \\"very refreshing mental food\\" that he could publish. This Burke did in April 1791 when he published A Letter to a Member of the National Assembly. Burke called for external forces to reverse the revolution and included an attack on the late French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, as being the subject of a personality cult that had developed in revolutionary France. Although Burke conceded that Rousseau sometimes showed \\"a considerable insight into human nature\\" he mostly was critical. Although he did not meet Rousseau on his visit to Britain in 1766–7 Burke was a friend of David Hume, with whom Rousseau had stayed. Burke said Rousseau \\"entertained no principle either to influence of his heart, or to guide his understanding—but vanity\\"—which he \\"was possessed to a degree little short of madness\\". He also cited Rousseau's Confessions as evidence that Rousseau had a life of \\"obscure and vulgar vices\\" that was not \\"chequered, or spotted here and there, with virtues, or even distinguished by a single good action\\". Burke contrasted Rousseau's theory of universal benevolence and his having sent his children to a foundling hospital: \\"a lover of his kind, but a hater of his kindred\\".

Answer: Yes, Van Morrison has released more than two albums. In fact, he has released over 40 studio albums, along with several live recordings, compilations, and collaborative works. Some of his most notable albums include \\"Astral Weeks\\" (1968), \\"Moondance\\" (1970), and \\"Tupelo Honey\\" (1971)."},{"question":"A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the last name of the producer who provided the studio where the band that rehearsed in a deconsecrated church recorded their first single?, using the article: In January 1980, Michael Stipe met Peter Buck in Wuxtry Records, the Athens record store where Buck worked. The pair discovered that they shared similar tastes in music, particularly in punk rock and protopunk artists like Patti Smith, Television, and the Velvet Underground. Stipe said, \\"It turns out that I was buying all the records that [Buck] was saving for himself.\\" Through mutual friend Kathleen O'Brien, Stipe and Buck then met fellow University of Georgia students Mike Mills and Bill Berry, who had played music together since high school and lived together in Georgia. The quartet agreed to collaborate on several songs; Stipe later commented that \\"there was never any grand plan behind any of it\\". Their still-unnamed band spent a few months rehearsing in a deconsecrated Episcopal church in Athens, and played its first show on April 5, 1980, supporting The Side Effects at O'Brien's birthday party held in the same church, performing a mix of originals and 1960s and 1970s covers. After considering Twisted Kites, Cans of Piss, and Negro Eyes, the band settled on \\"R.E.M.\\" (which is an acronym for rapid eye movement, the dream stage of sleep), which Stipe selected at random from a dictionary.The band members eventually dropped out of school to focus on their developing group. They found a manager in Jefferson Holt, a record store clerk who was so impressed by an R.E.M. performance in his hometown of Chapel Hill, North Carolina, that he moved to Athens. R.E.M.'s success was almost immediate in Athens and surrounding areas; the band drew progressively larger crowds for shows, which caused some resentment in the Athens music scene. Over the next year and a half, R.E.M. toured throughout the Southern United States. Touring was arduous because a touring circuit for alternative rock bands did not then exist. The group toured in an old blue van driven by Holt, and lived on a food allowance of 2 each per day.During April 1981, R.E.M. recorded its first single, \\"Radio Free Europe\\", at producer Mitch Easter's Drive-In..., what would be the answer ?

Mr. Myrus was always perfectly dressed and spoke with the belief that talking to eight-year-olds didn't mean he had to sacrifice proper statements or grammars. And he was demanding but he wasn't unreasonable or cruel. He simply felt that no matter what your best was, you should achieve it.

Both expositions were held in Balboa Park, and many of the Spanish/Baroque-style buildings that were built for those expositions remain to this day as central features of the park. The buildings were intended to be temporary structures, but most remained in continuous use until they progressively fell into disrepair.

Nicholas Rodney Drake (19 June 1948 – 25 November 1974) was an English singer-songwriter and musician known for his acoustic guitar-based songs. He failed to find a wide audience during his lifetime, but his work has since achieved wider recognition.Drake signed to Island Records when he was 20, while a student at the University of Cambridge, and released his debut album, Five Leaves Left, in 1969. By 1972, he had recorded two more albums, Bryter Layter and Pink Moon. Neither sold more than 5,000 copies on initial release. His reluctance to perform live or give interviews contributed to his lack of commercial success. No footage of the adult Drake has been released, only still photographs.Drake is believed to have suffered from depression, reflected in his lyrics. After making Pink Moon, he withdrew from performance and recording, retreating to his parents' home in rural Warwickshire. At the age of 26, Drake died from an overdose of approximately 30 amitriptyline pills, a prescribed antidepressant. His cause of death was determined as suicide.The 1979 release of the retrospective album Fruit Tree triggered a reassessment of Drake's music. By the mid-1980s, he was credited as an influence by such artists as Robert Smith, David Sylvian, and Peter Buck. In 1985, the Dream Academy reached the UK and US charts with \\"Life in a Northern Town\\", a song written for and dedicated to Drake. By the early 1990s, he had come to represent a \\"doomed romantic\\" musician in the UK music press. The first Drake biography was published in 1997, followed in 1998 by the documentary film A Stranger Among Us. In 1999, his song \\"Pink Moon\\" was used in a Volkswagen commercial, resulting in an increase in his U.S. album sales. By 2014, more than 2.4 million Nick Drake albums had been sold in the UK and the US.

But if you had been there around 15,000 years ago, during the last ice age, would it have been the same? For more than 30 years, scientists have been arguing about how rainforests might have reacted to the cold, dry climate of the ice ages, but till now, no one has reached a satisfying answer. Rainforests like the Amazon are important for mopping up CO2 from the atmosphere and helping to solve global warming. Currently the trees in the Amazon take in around 500 million tons of CO2 each year: equal to the total amount of CO2 given off in the UK each year. But how will the Amazon react to the future climate change? If it gets drier, will it survive and continue to draw down CO2? Scientists hope that they will be able to learn in advance how the rainforest will manage in the future by understanding how rainforests reacted to climate change in the past. Unfortunately, collecting information is incredibly difficult. To study the past climate, scientists need to look at fossilized pollen kept in lake mud, Going back to the last ice age means drilling down into lake sediments , which requires specialized equipment and heavy machinery. There are very few roads and paths, or places to land helicopters and aeroplanes. Rivers tend to be the easiest way to enter the forest, but this still leaves vast areas between the rivers completely unsampled . So far, only a handful of cores have been drilled that go back to the last ice age and none of them provide enough information to prove how the Amazon forest reacts to climate change. The best title for the text may be _ . A) Secrets of the Rainforest B) Climates of the Amazon C) The History of the Rainforest D) Changes of the Rainforest Answer:","response":"B) Climates of the Amazon The Amazon rainforest, a vital ecosystem that plays a crucial role in mitigating global warming, has long been a subject of scientific study. The rainforest's ability to absorb significant amounts of CO2 is essential to maintaining the balance of our atmosphere. However, understanding how the Amazon has reacted to climate change in the past, such as during the ice ages, can help inform predictions on how it may cope with future changes. Around 15,000 years ago, during the last ice age, the Amazon rainforest may have experienced significantly different environmental conditions than it does today. The question of how it reacted to the cold, dry climate remains a contentious subject among scientists, in part due to the difficulty of collecting data from that time. One method of studying past climates involves analyzing fossilized pollen preserved in lake mud. To access this evidence, researchers must drill down into lake sediments, which requires specialized equipment and presents logistical challenges due to the lack of infrastructure in the rainforest, including roads and air transport facilities. Rivers remain the most accessible means of entry, but large areas remain unexplored and unsampled. To date, only a handful of core samples from the last ice age have been drilled, and none provide conclusive insight into the Amazon's response to past climate change. The process of gathering information from these cores will continue, however, in hopes of illuminating the ancient rainforest's resilience and adaptability. Understanding how the Amazon has reacted to changing climates throughout history is essential as we look toward the future. As our planet experiences increasing shifts in temperature, rainfall, and CO2 levels, we seek to predict how essential ecosystems such as the Amazon rainforest will react and survive. By uncovering the secrets of the rainforest's past adaptations to climate fluctuations, we can better prepare for and address potential changes in the future.

This trapped heat energy warms up the Earth's atmosphere and surface, causing the global temperature to increase. This is known as the \\"greenhouse effect.\\" 7. As the temperature continues to rise over time, global warming gets accelerated, which leads to melting of polar ice caps. 8. As more ice melts, it releases water into the oceans, causing sea levels to rise. Additionally, the reduced ice cover reduces the Earth's albedo (its ability to reflect sunlight), leading to even more solar radiation being absorbed and further increase in global temperatures. 9. The temperature rises even faster, exacerbating the effects of global warming, which may lead to more extreme weather events, loss of biodiversity, and other negative consequences for our planet's ecosystems and human societies."},{"question":"Summarize this article: If you assemble the pieces at random, the puzzle will usually be unsolvable. Reassemble it in a solved position instead, starting with four edge pieces of the same color. This first part is the most difficult: Slide each edge piece into position around the matching central place. Hold them in place so they don't fall. If a piece won't go in, slide it on in a \\"wrong\\" position and twist it into place. Once the cross is made, carefully put the cube down, with the cross on the table surface. The four corner pieces on the bottom should snap on easily. They will help hold the other pieces in place, so it will be easier from here on out. Make sure all pieces are in the correct position. Push them firmly into place. You should now have one gap in the middle layer. Begin with a corner, which should attach easily, then build from it until you have two rows done. The edge pieces are easier to attach if you rotate the top layer so you can slot the edge piece in directly over the gap you left in the middle layer. Finish up with the final four pieces: Attach the last piece in the middle layer. Attach the two remaining corner pieces in the top layer. Rotate the top layer at a 45º angle to the others. Attach the final piece. The cube can feel stiff at first after adding lubricant, but after a few minutes of working it in, you should notice faster, smoother turns. If you adjusted the screws, it can take a couple hours of use to break in the cube and check whether the tension is where you want it. If lubricating made your cube stiffer and the problem doesn't go away within a couple days, you probably used too much lubricant. Disassemble the cube and wipe off the excess.","response":"This article talks about putting together a puzzle cube.

Which parcel of land had soil with faster rates of decomposition? Answer:","response":"To determine which parcel of land had soil with faster rates of decomposition, we should consider the factors affecting decomposition rates. These factors include moisture, temperature, the availability of oxygen, and the type of organic matter present. Step 1: Compare the moisture levels Forests, like Tom's land, typically have higher moisture levels than grasslands, like Bill's land. Higher moisture levels usually lead to faster decomposition rates, as microorganisms responsible for breaking down organic matter thrive in moist environments. Step 2: Compare the temperature Decomposition rates tend to increase with warmer temperatures. In general, though, forests and grasslands may have similar temperatures, depending on their geographic location. So, this factor may not help us give a definite answer. Step 3: Compare the availability of oxygen Oxygen accessibility is important for aerobic decomposition. Forests, like Tom's land, usually have more porous and well-aerated soils, as tree roots create spaces for air and water. On the other hand, grasslands, like Bill's land, may have more compact soils, leading to less oxygen availability, and thus slower decomposition. Step 4: Compare the type of organic matter Tom's forested land contains more lignin-rich organic matter (leaves, branches, and trunks from trees), which takes longer to decompose than grasses. In contrast, Bill's grassland contains more cellulose and simple sugars, which decompose more quickly than lignin. Conclusion: Considering the factors mentioned above, moisture and soil aeration favor faster decomposition rates in Tom's forested land. However, the presence of lignin-rich organic material in the forest may slow down decomposition compared to the grassland. Balancing these factors, it is likely that Bill's grassland has soil with faster rates of decomposition due to the more easily decomposable plant material present in grasslands."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: In this task you will be given a list of integers.

The use of these three supplements - fish oil, Q10, and Acetyl L-carnitine - has been suggested for preventing or delaying the onset of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Age-related macular degeneration is a common eye condition that typically affects individuals over the age of 50. It is characterized by a gradual decline in visual acuity, ultimately leading to severe vision loss if left untreated. Fish oil contains omega-3 fatty acids, specifically docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). These essential fatty acids have been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects, which can help protect the cells of the retina from damage caused by oxidative stress. Additionally, omega-3s may help to improve blood flow to the retina, further promoting overall eye health. Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), also known as ubiquinone, is a powerful antioxidant that neutralizes free radicals, which can cause damage to cell membranes and other structures within the eye. CoQ10 has been shown to support mitochondrial function, which may help to maintain the energy production necessary for the cells of the retina to function properly. This can be particularly important for older individuals, as the body's natural production of CoQ10 declines with age. Acetyl L-carnitine is an amino acid that plays a vital role in the production of energy within cells, especially in the mitochondria. It aids in the transport of fatty acids into the mitochondria, where they can be converted into energy needed for optimal cellular function. Additionally, Acetyl L-carnitine has been shown to have antioxidant properties, which can help to protect the delicate cells of the retina from the damaging effects of oxidative stress. When used in combination, these three supplements may provide a synergistic effect, with each component playing a specific role in protecting the retina from age-related damage, as well as providing the necessary nutrients for maintaining optimal cellular function. However, it is important to note that research on the efficacy of this combination in preventing or delaying AMD is still limited and further studies are needed to substantiate these findings. Before beginning any supplement regimen, it is crucial to consult with a healthcare professional to ensure that the chosen supplements are appropriate for the individual's specific needs and do not interact with any current medications or health conditions. Moreover, it is essential to maintain other healthy lifestyle habits, such as a balanced diet, regular exercise, and routine eye exams, to best support overall eye health and reduce the risk of developing age-related macular degeneration."},{"question":"Facts: - ru clubcaps: 39 - birth name: joshua adrian kronfeld - birth date: 20 june 1971 - weight: 96 kg stlb on - ru provincecaps: 69 - supercaps: 42 - allblackno: 943 - ru ntupdate: 12 december 2007 - ru nationalpoints: -lrb- 70 -rrb- - height: 1.85 m ftin on - superupdate: 12 december 2007 - ru clubyears: 2001-2003 - allblackid: 476 - ru nationalcaps: 54 - university: university of otago - superyears: 1996-2000 - name: josh kronfeld - school: hastings boys high - birth place: hastings , new zealand - ru position: flanker - ru nationalteam: new zealand new zealand - other: yes - ru clubupdate: 12 december 2007 - ru provincepoints: -lrb- - -rrb- - ru nationalyears: 1995-2000 - ru clubpoints: -lrb- 35 -rrb- - ru proclubs: england leicester - superpoints: -lrb- - -rrb- - super: new zealand highlanders - ru province: new zealand otago - ru provinceyears: 1993-2000 Based on these bullet points, write a short biography describing the life of josh kronfeld .","response":"Joshua Adrian Kronfeld, commonly known as Josh Kronfeld, was born on June 20, 1971, in Hastings, New Zealand.

A:","response":"The diplomatic corps had trouble with handling the complexity of specific aspects of international relations, which had become so complex as it was beyond the scope and abilities of a diplomatic corps in the former sense. Due to this complexity, various specialized agencies were formed to manage specific aspects of international relations, and the living Near East became primarily defined by what these agencies described it as.

A step-by-step solution is:","response":"Step 1: Identify the key elements in the premise The key elements in the premise are: - A woman - Talking on her cellphone - Carrying a dummy Step 2: Identify the key elements in the hypothesis The key element in the hypothesis is: - The woman is moving her mouth Step 3: Analyze the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis In order to determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, we should understand the relationship between \\"talking on her cellphone\\" and \\"moving her mouth.\\" Step 4: Understand common human behavior when talking on the cellphone It is generally understood that when a person is talking on the cellphone, they are engaged in a verbal conversation. Verbal communication, in most cases, involves speaking, which requires the person to move their mouth. Step 5: Determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise Based on Step 4, we understand that talking on the cellphone typically requires people to move their mouth. Since the premise states that the woman is talking on her cellphone, it is reasonable to conclude that the woman is moving her mouth.

Emily enjoyed playing with cats and combing their fur much more than Megan did, since Pick from: [A]. Emily had twelve pet cats.; [B]. Megan had twelve pet cats.;","response":"Emily enjoyed playing with cats and combing their fur much more than Megan did, since Emily had twelve pet cats. This meant that Emily was quite accustomed to their distinct personalities, their individual preferences, and their unique quirks. These adorable creatures had become an integral part of Emily's life, bringing her endless joy and companionship. Emily, over the years, had learned how to expertly care for their needs, ensuring they remained healthy, happy, and well-groomed. Megan, on the other hand, didn't share the same level of enthusiasm or experience with cats as Emily did. Having twelve cats of her own might have allowed her to familiarize herself with their world better, but that wasn't the case. Megan's interests and hobbies differed from Emily's, and the cat-combing activity was enjoyable for her but not as deeply fulfilling as it was for Emily. Additionally, caring for twelve pet cats entailed a significant level of responsibility and commitment, which Emily happily embraced. She always made sure that her feline companions received the best possible care - from nutritious meals to regular vet checkups, from playtime to cozy napping spots. Each of her cats had a special bond with her, and it was evident to anyone who witnessed their interactions. As Emily combed the fur of her beloved cats, she could identify them by their markings, size, and the feel of their fur. There was Fluffy, the giant Maine Coon with majestic fur, Ginger, the feisty and playful orange tabby, and Luna, the elegant silver-furred beauty who adored cuddling with Emily during quiet evenings. Megan, while appreciating the serene presence of these lovable creatures, didn't quite grasp the level of joy that Emily drew from these moments. Nevertheless, she still respected and admired Emily's dedication to her feline companions and participated in the cat-combing sessions, even if it meant playing a supporting role. Emily knew that Megan didn't share her passion for cats, but it never caused a rift between them. Instead, Emily felt grateful for having a friend who accepted her love for cats and joined her in taking care of them, even if sometimes it was just to keep Emily company. They had their shared interests, of course - movie nights, shopping trips, and lazy Sunday brunches - but in the end, the friendship flourished despite the differing levels of affinity towards their plushy little furballs."},{"question":"Information: - Max Beckmann (February 12, 1884 December 27, 1950) was a German painter, draftsman, printmaker, sculptor, and writer.

The statement implies that the name in question was unusual, peculiar, or outside the norm- it was thus able to catch the person's attention, but it does not necessarily mean that the person had never encountered the name prior to this. For instance, a person might come across an uncommon name for the second, third, or even tenth time, and still be captivated every time due to its unusualness. This means while there's a possibility that the person hasn't seen the name before (which could be one reason that it's particularly striking), there's also a decent chance that they have seen it, but are still drawn to it because of its weirdness. Also, without more information or context, we can't assess whether the name was unusual to this person due to their specific circumstances or cultural background, or because it’s universally bizarre. What is considered outlandish could differ from person to person based on their experiences or cultural contexts. A name that seems unusual in one cultural or linguistic context might be relatively normal in another. So, while it isn't a definitive 'no' to the hypothesis \\"I've never seen that name before.\\", because given the context that could certainly be a possibility, we absolutely cannot assert the hypothesis as true solely based on the given premise.

Dragons' Den star Peter Jones has relaunched camera chain Jessops - two months after it was forced from the High Street. Two Jessops stores will open today in London's Oxford Street and Birmingham, with four others opening over the Easter weekend in Manchester, Aberdeen, High Wycombe and St Albans. Up to 30 more Jessops stores are due to re-open in April, as part of a £5 million investment. Scroll down for video. Investment: Dragons' Den star Peter Jones was today opening two Jessops stores in London and Birmingham as part of a £5m relaunch. Open: Peter Jones stands outside the Jessops store in Oxford Street, central London. Relaunch: Staff pose for pictures inside the newly opened Jessops store in Birmingham. Jessops called in administrators PwC in January, leading to the closure of all 187 Jessops stores and the loss of almost 1,500 jobs. Later that month Mr Jones and other investors bought the brand and certain assets. The entrepreneur is the sole owner of the relaunched camera store chain. The company has pledged to create 500 jobs with its relaunch - with the majority going to former Jessops staff who lost their jobs when the chain collapsed. Mr Jones, who appears as an investor on the BBC reality TV series about entrepreneurs, will take the role of chief executive and chairman. He said: 'I believe Jessops is an iconic British brand which can lead the retail resurgence on Britain's high streets, powered by new innovations and world-leading, expert staff. 'Image is everything, and even in the mobile and tablet era, there's no substitute for a quality camera when it comes to taking the perfect picture.'

Investment: Dragons' Den star Peter Jones was today opening two Jessops stores in London and Birmingham as part of a £5m relaunch. Closure: Jessops called in administrators PwC in January, leading to the closure of all 187 Jessops stores and the loss of almost 1,500 jobs. Mr Jones opened the Oxford Street store today with TV comic James Corden. The. relaunched company is forecasting sales of at least £80 million in its. first year, which it said will give it 15 per cent of the DSLR camera. market in the UK. Jessops also promised greater integration with its. online presence, including an option to collect internet orders at. store. The camera giant was. the first high-profile retail casualty of 2013, after suffering from. online competition and a boom in camera phones in recent years, which. hit demand for digital cameras. Hands-on: The relaunched company is forecasting sales of at least £80 million in its first year. At its appointment, PwC said the company's core market had seen a 'significant decline' in 2012, while forecast profits over Christmas did not materialise, squeezing its funding. Jessops had struggled since 2007, when it underwent a major overhaul with a swathe of store closures. The firm began life in 1935 when Frank Jessop opened his first shop in Leicester. Writing in The Sun today, Mr Jones said while 'so-called experts' say the High Street no future, he believes 'the facts say otherwise'. 'Devastating effect': Staff from the Warrington branch of Jessops plastered their photos in the window of the store in the hope of finding new employment after its closure was announced. Mr Jones said shopper numbers on the High Street were up by 2.7 per cent last month compared to the previous year, according to the British Retail Consortium. He said while the business could have been relaunched online, he knew there was a desire for a 'proper shopping experience'. He said: 'I also think it's time we snapped out of our negativity about the economy, and got behind the great British brands and institutions that can lead the recovery. 'That's why I've declared myself \\"in\\" to what I think will be the first step in the revival of our high streets.' He added things were looking up for British shoppers, with Blockbuster also set to re-open in the near future. The High Street has seen some turbulent times in recent years, but the latest development could be a sign of changing fortunes. December 2008: MFI, the furniture retailer, was one of the first major firms to go out of business at the start of the downturn, as retail sales began to fall following a sharp rise in unemploymentWoolworths. January 2009: Woolworths shuttered its 800 stores, bringing home to many the scale of the UK's economic collapse as the country entered recession for the first time. February 2009: Zavvi stopped trading around Christmas - and refused to honour its gift cards, leading to widespread customer anger. In trouble: Electrical giant Comet closed its doors for the last time shortly before Christmas while music chain HMV called in administrators in January. December 2009: Borders was another entertainment behemoth to go under as sale of CDs and DVDs were squeezed by digital downloads and online retailers. October 2012: JJB Sports closed all but 20 of its stores, which were taken over and re-branded by Sports Direct - leading to the death of the JJB brand and 550 employees losing their jobs. December 2012: Comet shut down just before Christmas, leaving nearly 7,000 staff out of work and forcing the taxpayer to pick up a £50million tab related to its bankruptcy, which was blamed on soaring energy prices and a reduction in the number of home buyers. January 2013: Jessops was closed by administrator PwC earlier this month after years of struggling with online competition as customers turned away from traditional photography. January 2013: HMV, which has 239 shops and 4,500 staff, announced that it was calling in administrators.

You turned around and, sure enough, someone was looking right at you! Parapsychologists say that humans have a natural ability to sense when someone is looking at them. To research whether such a \\"sixth sense\\" really exists, Robert Baker, a psychologist at the University of Kentucky, performed two experiments. In the first one, Baker sat behind unknowing people in public places and stared at the backs of their heads for 5 to 15 minutes. The subjects were eating, drinking, reading, studying, watching TV, or working at a computer. Baker made sure that the people could not tell that he was sitting behind them during those periods. Later, when he questioned the subjects, almost all of them said they had no sense that someone was staring at them. For the second experiment, Baker told the subjects that they would be stared at from time to time from behind a two way mirror in a laboratory setting. The people had to write down when they felt they were being stared at and when they weren't. Baker found that the subjects were no better at telling when they were stared at and when they weren't. and they were no better at telling when they were stared at than if they had just guessed. Baker concludes that people do not have the ability to sense when they're being stared at. If people doubt the outcome of his two experiments, said baker, \\"I suggest they repeat the experiments and see for themselves.\\" The purpose of the two experiments is to _ .

Recent research from Germany and Italy shows that heart attacks are more common on Monday mornings and doctors blame the stress of returning to work after the weekend break. The risk of having a heart attack on any given day should be one in seven, but a six-year study helped by researchers at the Free University of Berlin of more than 2, 600 Germans showed that the average person had a 20 percent higher chance of having a heart attack on a Monday than on any other day. Working Germans are particularly not protected against attack, with a 33 percent higher risk at the beginning of the working week. Non-workers, by comparison, appear to be no more at risk on a Monday than any other day. A study of 11, 000 Italians proved 8 a. m. on a Monday morning as the most stressful time for the heart, and both studies showed that Sunday is the least stressful day, with fewest heart attacks in both countries. The finding could lead to a better understanding of what is the immediate cause of heart attacks, according to Dr Stefan Willich of the Free University. \\"We know a lot about long-term risk factors such as smoking and cholesterol but we don't know what actually causes heart attacks, so we can't give clear advice on how to prevent them, \\"he said. Monday mornings have a double helping of stress for the working body as it makes a rapid change from sleep to activity, and from the relaxing weekend to the pressures of work. \\"When people get up, their blood pressure and heart rate go up and there are hormonal changes in their bodies, \\"Willich explained. \\"All these things can have an unfavorable effect in the blood system and increase the risk of a clot which will cause a heart attack.\\" \\"When people return to work after a weekend off, the pace of their life changes. They have a higher workload, more stress, more anger and more physical activities,\\"said Willich.

Question: In 1947, what kind of a season did the Chicago team have? Context: The Cubs enjoyed one more pennant at the close of World War II, finishing 98–56. Due to the wartime travel restrictions, the first three games of the 1945 World Series were played in Detroit, where the Cubs won two games, including a one-hitter by Claude Passeau, and the final four were played at Wrigley. In Game 4 of the Series, the Curse of the Billy Goat was allegedly laid upon the Cubs when P.K. Wrigley ejected Billy Sianis, who had come to Game 4 with two box seat tickets, one for him and one for his goat. They paraded around for a few innings, but Wrigley demanded the goat leave the park due to its unpleasant odor. Upon his ejection, Mr. Sianis uttered, \\"The Cubs, they ain't gonna win no more.\\" The Cubs lost Game 4, lost the Series, and have not been back since. It has also been said by many that Sianis put a \\"curse\\" on the Cubs, apparently preventing the team from playing in the World Series. After losing the 1945 World Series to the Detroit Tigers, the Cubs finished with winning seasons the next two years, but those teams did not enter post-season play.

Potential energy: This is more about the energy that an object has due to its position or form. In the context of a machine's wheels and gears, greasing won't change its potential energy. So this answer would not be considered. 2. Efficiency: The efficiency of a machine refers to how much of the input energy is converted to output energy. Greasing would actually increase efficiency by reducing wasted energy (due to heat from friction). So, this option is incorrect. 3. Output: This refers to the net work or energy produced by the machine. Greasing might increase output indirectly by improving efficiency but it primarily does not directly affect the output. Therefore, this option is not directly correct. 4. Friction: This is the resistance to motion of one object moving relative to another. It's known that machines are greased to reduce friction so that the parts can move more smoothly. This helps in increasing the lifespan of these parts and also improves the machine's efficiency as there's less energy wasted as heat due to friction. Therefore, with each option considered carefully, it's concluded that the wheels and gears of a machine are greased in order to decrease 'friction'."},{"question":"Question 1: How do I build/compile a flash (as2) flashlite 3.1 file to be a stagecraft file for a settop box? Question 2: How can I convert SWF files to PDF? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","response":"Answer for Question 1: To build or compile a Flash AS2 (ActionScript 2) Flash Lite 3.1 file for a set-top box, follow these steps: 1. Set up the development environment: a. Install Adobe Flash Professional (CS3 to CS6 have support for ActionScript 2). b. Download and install the appropriate Flash Lite 3.1 extension for Adobe Flash Professional, available on the Adobe website or by using the following link: http://download.macromedia.com/pub/flash/m/dc/flashlite31_ext_fl.zip c. In Adobe Flash Professional, go to 'Help > Manage Extensions' to install the downloaded Flash Lite extension. 2. Create a new Flash Document targeting ActionScript 2 by going to 'File > New', then selecting 'Flash Document' and ensuring the 'ActionScript 2' option is selected under Settings. 3.

Create your graphical assets, animations, and interactions for your content using the Flash drawing tools and Timeline panel. c. Write your AS2 code on separate layers or in external AS files, then import and link them to your project. d. Run a test of your content using 'Control > Test Movie', which will simulate how it will run on the set-top box. 4. Exporting the content for the set-top box: a. Go to 'File > Publish Settings', and under the Flash tab, ensure 'ActionScript 2' is selected as the script version and 'Flash Lite 3.1' as the target player. b. Under the 'Formats' tab, make sure the 'Flash (.swf)' and 'FlashLite Projector (.exe)' options are selected. c. Make sure you include any necessary font outlines if your content uses custom fonts. d. Press 'Publish' to export the content in the desired formats. 5. Convert the .swf file to a format suitable for your set-top box. Each set-top box may have different format requirements. Therefore, you should refer to the documentation provided by the set-top box manufacturer for detailed instructions on converting and deploying the content on the device. Answer for Question 2: Converting SWF files to PDF files can be done using a specialized SWF-to-PDF converter software or an online conversion service. Below is a method to convert SWF files to PDF using a versatile converter software, XabeSwfToImage: 1. Download and install XabeSwfToImage available at https://github.com/tomaszzmuda/Xabe.FFmpeg 2. Set up the command-line option by opening the Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac). 3. Use XabeSwfToImage to convert your SWF file to an image format (e.g., PNG) using the command: \`\`\` XabeSwfToImage -i input.swf -o output.png \`\`\` Replace 'input.swf' with the path to your SWF file and 'output.png' with the desired output file path. 4. Use a PDF conversion tool (e.g., ImageMagick) to convert the output image to a PDF file with the command: \`\`\` convert output.png output.pdf \`\`\` Replace 'output.png' with the path to the output image file and 'output.pdf' with the desired PDF output file path. Now, you will have a PDF file generated from your initial SWF file. No, the answers to these two questions are not the same. While both involve conversions, the first question focuses on converting a Flash AS2 Flash Lite file for compatibility with a set-top box, while the second question pertains to converting SWF files into a PDF format.

Question: John was watching the ocean from the beach and after a long period of observation, he concluded that the less wind there is, that the waves will become Bigger or Smaller? Paragraph : The size of an ocean wave depends on how fast, over how great a distance, and how long the wind blows. The greater each of these factors is, the bigger a wave will be. The answer is:","response":"Smaller. According to the provided paragraph, the size of an ocean wave is influenced by three factors: the speed of the wind, the distance over which it blows, and the duration of its action. It states that when these factors are greater, the waves will also become larger. Consequently, when John observed the ocean from the beach, he concluded that with less wind, the waves would likely be smaller in size. This conclusion can be deduced from the information in the paragraph, which emphasizes that greater wind speed, distance, and duration contribute to bigger waves. As such, the opposite – less wind speed and potentially shorter distance or duration – would lead to smaller waves."},{"question":"Bailey got into a disagreement with their mother and they knew they were right but decided to leave it alone.

Premise: \\"For how many calls\\" This statement is a question by itself, without sufficient context. It doesn't provide any information about the number of calls made. It can be understood as a query asking for the number of calls made.

No These options are possible answers to the hypothesis (the question about making a lot of calls). Now, to answer the main question, \\"Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?\\" In this particular scenario, the premise is just a question asking for the number of calls made and doesn't provide any information or evidence to support the hypothesis.

Article: Children who see their parents drunk are twice likely to get drunk themselves, a survey of young teenagers has suggested. Poor parental supervision also raises the chances of teenage drinking, said the Joesph Rowntree Foundation. If parents don't know where their children are on a Saturday night, or let them watch films of violence, they are more likely to have had an alcoholic drink. The survey also found the behavior of friends is also a powerful factor in drinking habits. The more time teenagers spend with friends, the more likely they are to drink alcohol. In this survey of 5,700 children aged 13 to 16, carried out by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, researchers found that one in five wanted to have a drink by the time they were 14. By the age of 16, half of those questioned said they had been drunk. Pamela Bremner, scientist of the survey, said, \\"For the first time in the UK, this study shows what most influences young people's drinking behavior.\\" \\"It found that the behavior of friends and family is the most common influential factor in determining how likely and how often a young person will drink alcohol.\\" Don Shenker, Chief Executive of Alcohol Concern, said, \\"Government ministers must also look at some of the causes of why it is so easy for children to get alcohol, usually from the home.\\" \\"Governments should look to see if they've done everything they can to help the large supermarkets from continuing to sell cheap alcohol which encourages more alcohol sales and therefore results in more alcohol being stored in the home.\\" The Royal College of Physicians also said it was not surprising that being able to get alcohol easily was an important factor on current drinking problems and drunkenness of teenagers. A statement said, \\"This shows that the government needs to focus more attention on increasing the price of alcohol, and increasing education and national campaigns for both young people and their families on the dangers of alcohol.\\" Question: How many teenagers admitted that they had been drunk in the survey carried out by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation? Answer: Possible answers: [1]. About 5700.; [2]. About 1200.; [3]. About 2800.; [4]. About 4200.; The answer is:","response":"[3]. About 2800. This is calculated based on the information from the article that said, \\"By the age of 16, half of those questioned said they had been drunk.\\" The survey was conducted on 5,700 children, so if we say that half of them admitted to having been drunk, that would be approximately 2,850 teenagers. The closest option to this calculated value in the given choices is \\"[3]. About 2800.\\". So this is the most valid answer according to the context of the text.

Keep in mind that talents extend beyond just playing the guitar or dancing like a pro. Talents come in all shapes and sizes and extend into many areas of life. For example, being able to read emotions very accurately is a very useful talent. As you reflect on yourself in search of your talents, start by looking at your past. Look at the things that you've done. Look at the things you've enjoyed. Look at the times when you really excelled. Ask yourself questions like \\"What am I most proud of that I've done?\\" or \\"When was I so proud that I didn't care what anyone thought?\\" One good thing to think about was what your childhood was like. What did you do a lot as a kid? What did you enjoy? What were you known for? Sometimes this can reveal some of your deepest talents and certainly will reveal interests that can be probed further. Think about your hobbies as your personality is made by them they are the things you do regularly and your hidden talent is that which you can do better than everyone so focus on your hobbies and how you do them every single step. Another thing you can think about are the times in your life that you've been challenged. Think about the tough situations that you've had to deal with. Times of trial can often reveal your hidden skills. For example, when your dad had a heart attack, maybe you kept your head and called 911. Staying alert and calm in an emergency is a really useful talent. The things that make you happy can also reveal your talents. Think about the things that you love to do. Do people ever give you compliments on it? Do they ever ask for your help with it? You might not think of it as a talent but it probably is. Do you ever completely lose track of time? You start doing something and you just don't even notice time passing? This might hint at your talent. For example, maybe you get lost when you're modding your favorite video game. This might be one of your talents. Listen to how you talk. Do you ever find yourself rambling to your family or your best friend about this subject that means so much to you? This might be another hint at a talent you have. Write down everything that you enjoy. This will help you to see what things you truly enjoy doing and give you an opportunity to think about why you enjoy these things. For example, you might enjoy playing fantasy football or walking in nature. Doing these things may allow you to use the special knowledge that you have about these subjects. Now, there's a big difference between what you enjoy and what you're good at. You might think of your talents only being things that you love doing, but it's important to remember that your talents are often things you don't enjoy or things you don't even think about. This is why it's important to take a long hard look at what you're actually good at. Think about things that come naturally to you. Things you don't struggle with. Do you ever find yourself telling someone, \\"Nevermind, it's easier if I do it\\" or \\"Here, let me help you with that\\"? Do you find yourself correcting people? These behaviors usually indicate something that you're good at and know a lot about. Look back on your life and think about times where you really succeeded, times where you felt about to burst with the pride of your success. This can indicate a talent you possess. For example, maybe you helped your boss rearrange and reorganize his office and helped things at your work run so much more smoothly. Organization is a very useful talent. This exercise can help you reveal not only the talents that you have but also talents that you should consider developing. Write about what you were like as a kid, what you liked to do before and after school, what your favorite subjects were. Write about growing up. Write about where you're at in your life now. Now, write about your future. Write about where you want to go. Write about what you want people to say at your funeral. You may also want to write about what you would like to do with your time if money was not an issue. What activities would you most like to do if you did not have to worry about money? Considering this can help you to identify your interests and talents. This exercise reveals your priorities and what you really think is important about yourself. It can also reveal what you want for your life, helping you focus on talents you should cultivate if you want to achieve your dreams. Having an outside perspective, other people may find it easier to see what you're good at. Ask around and people will usually be happy to tell you what they see as your strengths. Be sure to talk to people that know you well but also people that barely know you. Both will see you in different ways and the differences that they see can tell you even more about yourself. What is a summary?","response":"The article emphasizes the importance of realizing and acknowledging one's hidden talents. It suggests starting the self-evaluation process by exploring past experiences, hobbies, and challenges faced. Childhood activities and habits can also reveal submerged abilities. Occasions when one loses track of time due to deep involvements or handles emergency situations commendably are strong indicators of latent talents. While compliments and corrections given to others highlight known expertise, innate talents might lie in actions performed effortlessly or even disliked activities. Reflective writing on personal history, current status, and future aspirations can further assist in talent discovery while considering what one would do if money was not a limiting factor can be illuminating. Finally, seeking other people's perspectives is recommended, as they can provide varied viewpoints about one's strengths."},{"question":"Given a factoid/trivia type question, generate the topic of the question.

Hypothesis: Zale Dalen is a Canadian film director. He is proud of his film the hounds of Notre Dame","response":"Based on the paragraph provided, the hypothesis can be divided into two parts: 1. Zale Dalen is a Canadian film director. 2. He is proud of his film, \\"The Hounds of Notre Dame.\\" For the first part, the paragraph clearly states that Zale Dalen is a Canadian film and television director. Thus, this part of the hypothesis is true. For the second part of the hypothesis, although it is established that Zale Dalen directed \\"The Hounds of Notre Dame\\" and received a Genie Award nomination for Best Director for the film at the 2nd Genie Awards in 1981, there is no direct information provided on whether he is proud of the film or not. It could be inferred that the nomination might have brought some level of pride or satisfaction for the director, as it typically reflects appreciation and recognition of his work in the film industry. However, since there is no explicit mention of his feelings towards the film in the paragraph, confirming his pride in the film would involve making an assumption based on limited information. In conclusion, the first part of the hypothesis is true, as Zale Dalen is indeed a Canadian film director. However, the second part of the hypothesis cannot be definitively confirmed as true or false based on the provided information. It would be more accurate to state that it is likely, or we can assume, that Zale Dalen is proud of his film \\"The Hounds of Notre Dame\\" due to the Genie Award nomination for Best Director he received."},{"question":"Two arrested after policemen killed in US Police are searching for Curtis Banks and Marvin Banks in relation to the murder of two Mississippi officers. (AAP) Two brothers have been arrested over the killing of two police officers in Mississippi. Police officers Benjamin Deen, 34, and Liquori Tate, 25, were shot on Saturday and taken to hospital where they were confirmed dead, The Clarion-Ledger newspaper reported, citing Forrest County Coroner Butch Benedict. Officials did not give details on the motive of the attack but said the suspects, Curtis Banks, 26, and Marvin Banks, 29, were arrested early on Sunday, ending an hours-long manhunt, according to the newspaper. Both men were reported to have criminal records, which include drugs and weapons-related charges and felony convictions. A third woman who was allegedly in the car at the time of the shooting in Hattiesburg city was also taken into police custody. The killings come in the wake of another police shooting in New York, where plainclothes officer Brian Moore, 25, was shot in the head and died last Monday. A total of five police officers have been killed in the past five months in the United States, including two other New York policemen who were shot in December. Hattiesburg Mayor Johnny DuPree decried the latest killings. \\"The men and women who go out every day to protect us, the men and women who go out every day to make sure that we're safe, they were turned on tonight,\\" DuPree said, according to The Clarion-Ledger. The newspaper said one of the officers pulled a car over Saturday night, approached the vehicle, and was joined by a second officer before shots were fired. One of the suspects allegedly fled in a police vehicle, which was later found abandoned. A neighbouring police force in Oxford, Mississippi mourned the slain officers. \\"Both Hattiesburg Police Officers have died. Terrible. Prayers to the entire community and families,\\" the Oxford force said on Twitter. The Clarion-Ledger said it was the first police killing in Hattiesburg in 30 years.

Earlier on in the game, your main source of food will be from rabbits caught in traps, berries picked from berry bushes, and carrots lying around, all of which you can cook over a campfire and eat to restore your Hunger. However, for food that restores sanity, you'll need more thorough methods. Carrots can be found poking out of the ground and Berry bushes are scattered around the world. You can pick them up by left-clicking or pressing X. To catch rabbits, make a trap with 6 Cut Grass and 2 Twigs. You can craft it in the Survival tab, represented by a looped rope icon. Once created, place it near or on top of a rabbit hole, which is a small hole in the ground found in grasslands and savannahs, then wait until a rabbit is caught. Once caught, the trap will rattle and jump around. If you pick it up, you’ll get both the trap and the rabbit. You can then re-use the trap for 7 more times before it disappears. You’ll need to “murder” the rabbit before you can make use of the meat, though. Right-clicking (PC) it or pressing the right direction button (PS4) when a rabbit is selected will do the trick. With a Science Machine, you can also craft a Bird Trap for 3 Twigs and 4 Silk through the Survival tab. This functions similarly to a trap, but only catches birds. To make a farm plot, you need at least a Science Machine. You can make it through the Food tab, represented by a buried carrot icon, for 8 Grass, 4 Manure, and 4 Logs. You can get Manure from Beefalo, which excrete them regularly at random intervals and are found in savannahs. You can also get Manure by feeding a pig, found individually in random spots in the map or collectively in huge villages normally found at the end of roads, with some non-meat food (berries, carrots, produce from farm plots, cave bananas, etc.). Once you’ve placed the farm plot, you can put a seed on it by selecting the seed and interacting with the farm. You can either wait for it to grow slowly throughout the day or pile manure on it until it grows. Once grown, simply interact with the crop to gather it, and congratulations! You now have some food! Jerky and Small Jerky are long-lasting food items that restore quite a bit of all three gauges. To make Jerky, you'll need to make a Drying Rack first, which is made with a Science Machine and requires 3 Rope, 3 Twigs, and 2 Charcoal. Charcoal can be obtained by burning down Trees. You can do this by making a Torch, equipping it, then right-clicking on the Trees. Each burned Tree can be chopped down with an Axe to get 1 Charcoal. Upon creating a Drying Rack, you can then place a piece of Meat of any kind, including Frog Legs, Batilisk Wings, and Monster Meat, by approaching the rack and using the left mouse button or X to place the meat. After a few days you'll have your Jerky ready for consumption! The Crock Pot is another way of cooking your food, and you can make one with a Science Machine and costs 6 Charcoal, 6 Twigs and 3 Cut Stone. The Crock Pot's cooking mechanic requires you to put in 4 items of food in the four slots to cook and takes about a minute for the dish to cook. Most meals can restore a great amount of sanity, as long as you figure out the recipe. You can use Twigs as fillers for recipe, which would usually save you from using up more important “edible” ingredients. Be careful when adding Monster Meats and Durians, though. Use too much without a twig, and you’ll end up with a Monster Lasagna, an incredibly damaging food that gives a hefty penalty to Health and Sanity.","response":"This article is about finding, cooking, and eating different types of food in a game to help your character regain hunger, health, and sanity."},{"question":"Answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.

It was established in 1998 as the Mitteilungen aus dem Museum für Naturkunde in Berlin, Geowissenschaftliche Reihe and originally published on behalf of the Museum für Naturkunde by Wiley-VCH; since 2014 it has been published by Copernicus Publications. The editors-in-chief are Martin Aberhan, Dieter Korn, and Florian Witzmann (Museum für Naturkunde). - Eurasia is the combined continental landmass of Europe and Asia. The term is a portmanteau of its constituent continents. Located primarily in the Northern and Eastern Hemispheres, it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Pacific Ocean to the east, the Arctic Ocean to the north, and by Africa, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Indian Ocean to the south. The division between Europe and Asia as two different continents is a historical and cultural construct, with no clear physical separation between them; thus, in some parts of the world, Eurasia is recognized as the largest of five or six continents. In geology, Eurasia is often considered as a single rigid megablock. However, the rigidity of Eurasia is debated based on the paleomagnet data. - Naval warfare is combat in and on the sea, the ocean, or any other major body of water such as a large lake or wide river. - The United States Navy (USN) is the naval warfare service branch of the United States Armed Forces and one of the seven uniformed services of the United States. The U.S. Navy is the largest, most capable navy in the world, with the highest combined battle fleet tonnage. The U.S. Navy has the world's largest aircraft carrier fleet, with ten in service, two in the reserve fleet, and three new carriers under construction. The service has 323,792 personnel on active duty and 108,515 in the Navy Reserve. It has 274 deployable combat vessels and more than 3,700 aircraft in active service . - The Triassic is a geologic period and system which spans 50.9 million years from the end of the Permian Period million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Jurassic Period Mya. The Triassic is the first period of the Mesozoic Era. Both the start and end of the period are marked by major extinction events. The Triassic was named in 1834 by Friedrich von Alberti, after the three distinct rock layers (\\"tri\\" meaning \\"three\\") that are found throughout Germany and northwestern Europered beds, capped by marine limestone, followed by a series of terrestrial mud- and sandstonescalled the \\"Trias\\". - The United States Armed Forces are the federal armed forces of the United States. They consist of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard. The President of the United States is the military's overall head, and helps form military policy with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), a federal executive department, acting as the principal organ by which military policy is carried out. From the time of its inception, the military played a decisive role in the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even so, the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played an important role in the American Civil War, where leading generals on both sides were picked from members of the United States military. Not until the outbreak of World War II did a large standing army become officially established. The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War II and during the Cold War's onset, created the modern U.S. military framework; the Act merged previously Cabinet-level Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the Department of the Air Force and National Security Council. - A reserve fleet is a collection of naval vessels of all types that are fully equipped for service but are not currently needed, and thus partially or fully decommissioned. A reserve fleet is informally said to be \\"in mothballs\\" or \\"mothballed\\"; an equivalent expression in unofficial modern U.S. naval usage is \\"ghost fleet\\". In earlier times, and especially in British usage, these ships were said to be \\"laid up in ordinary\\". - An aircraft carrier is a warship that serves as a seagoing airbase, equipped with a full-length flight deck and facilities for carrying, arming, deploying, and recovering aircraft. Typically, it is the capital ship of a fleet, as it allows a naval force to project air power worldwide without depending on local bases for staging aircraft operations. Aircraft carriers are expensive to build and are critical assets. Carriers have evolved since their inception in the early twentieth century from wooden vessels used to deploy balloons to nuclear-powered warships that carry numerous fighter planes, strike aircraft, helicopters, and other types of aircraft. - Sturgeon is the common name for the 27 species of fish belonging to the family Acipenseridae. Their evolution dates back to the Triassic some 245 to 208 million years ago. The family is grouped into four genera: \\"Acipenser\\", \\"Huso\\", \\"Scaphirhynchus\\" and \\"Pseudoscaphirhynchus\\". Four species may now be extinct. Two closely related species, \\"Polyodon spathula\\" (paddlefish) and \\"Psephurus gladius\\" (Chinese paddlefish, possibly extinct) are of the same order, Acipenseriformes, but are in the family Polyodontidae and are not considered to be \\"true\\" sturgeons. Both sturgeons and paddlefish have been referred to as \\"primitive fishes\\" because their morphological characteristics have remained relatively unchanged since the earliest fossil record. Sturgeons are native to subtropical, temperate and sub-Arctic rivers, lakes and coastlines of Eurasia and North America. Sturgeons are long-lived, late-maturing fishes with distinctive characteristics, such as a heterocercal caudal fin similar to that of sharks, and an elongated spindle-like body that is smooth-skinned, scaleless and armored with 5 lateral rows of bony plates called scutes. Several species can grow quite large, typically ranging 712 feet (2-3 m) in length. The largest sturgeon on record was a Beluga female captured in the Volga estuary in 1827, weighing and long. Most sturgeons are anadromous bottom-feeders which migrate upstream to spawn but spend most of their lives feeding in river deltas and estuaries. Some species inhabit freshwater environments exclusively while others primarily inhabit marine environments near coastal areas, and are known to venture into open ocean. - Scaphirhynchus is a genus of sturgeons native to the United States of America. All species in this genus are considered to be threatened. The pallid sturgeon is Endangered and the Alabama sturgeon is Critically Endangered. - Acipenseriformes is an order of basal ray-finned fishes that includes the sturgeons and paddlefishes, as well as some extinct families. - An aircraft is a machine that is able to fly by gaining support from the air. It counters the force of gravity by using either static lift or by using the dynamic lift of an airfoil, or in a few cases the downward thrust from jet engines. - The lead ship, name ship, or class leader is the first of a series or class of ships all constructed according to the same general design. The term is applicable to military ships and larger civilian craft. - In biology, a common name of a taxon or organism (also known as a vernacular name, English name, colloquial name, trivial name, trivial epithet, country name, popular name, or farmer's name) is a name that is based on the normal language of everyday life; this kind of name is often contrasted with the scientific name for the same organism, which is Latinized. A common name is sometimes frequently used, but that is by no means always the case. - Pseudoscaphirhynchus is a genus of fishes in the Acipenseridae family. The three species, all of which are threatened, are restricted to Central Asia. - FOSSIL is a standard protocol for allowing serial communication for telecommunications programs under the DOS operating system. FOSSIL is an acronym for \\"Fido Opus SEAdog Standard Interface Layer\\". \\"Fido\\" refers to FidoBBS, \\"Opus\\" refers to Opus-CBCS BBS, and \\"SEAdog\\" refers to a Fidonet compatible mailer. The standards document that defines the FOSSIL protocol is maintained by the Fidonet Technical Standards Committee. - USS Sturgeon ( SSN - 637 ) , the lead ship of her class of nuclear - powered attack submarines , was the third ship of the United States Navy to be named for the sturgeon . - The United States of America has seven federal uniformed services that commission officers as defined by Title 10, and subsequently structured and organized by Title 10, Title 14, Title 32 and Title 42 of the United States Code. - A ship is a large buoyant watercraft. Ships are generally distinguished from boats based on size, shape and cargo or passenger capacity. Ships are used on lakes, seas, rivers, and oceans for a variety of activities, such as the transport of people or goods, fishing, entertainment, public safety, and warfare. Historically, a \\"ship\\" was a sailing vessel with at least three square-rigged masts and a full bowsprit. - North America is a continent entirely within the Northern Hemisphere and almost all within the Western Hemisphere. It can also be considered a northern subcontinent of the Americas. It is bordered to the north by the Arctic Ocean, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, to the west and south by the Pacific Ocean, and to the southeast by South America and the Caribbean Sea.

Passage:He was both a Catholic and a royalist, and enjoyed the confidence of Queen Henrietta Maria, who recommended him to Charles I as \\"a man deserving of every encouragement.\\" In 1645 he tried to get the Confederation of Kilkenny to support King Charles I in the English Civil War on the grounds that their demands for full civic rights to be restored to Roman Catholics would be met. He fought with the Confederates against the Parliamentarians in 1645–6, and led a successful assault on Roscommon Castle in 1646. In 1649 he was imprisoned in London but soon released. After some time in France he was allowed to return to England through the pleas of his brother-in-law John Holles, 2nd Earl of Clare. He is said to have been one of the few Irishmen whom Oliver Cromwell admired, and was also on good terms with Oliver's son Henry Cromwell, although Henry refused his request to be allowed to recover possession of his principal residence, Merrion Castle. During the Commonwealth he seems to have played a careful double game- his second marriage into the Holles family put him in the Parliamentarian camp, but he was also suspected of working for the Restoration of Charles II.
