JPMorgan Chase — the nation’s largest bank — sent an e-mail to customers Sunday night, informing them that all overdraft fees and late fees on credit cards and business and consumer loans would be waived through Wednesday, Oct. 31. Customers have until the end of business Thursday to make sure their accounts and balances are up-to-date to avoid a fee. (MORE: 11 Weirdest Election-Themed Products) Similarly, Citibank announced that fees would be waived for New York City residents who use another bank’s ATM, according to the Wall Street Journal. Bank of America has also announced that customers who have incurred fees due to Sandy can contact BofA to have those fees waived. “We will even refund fees for customers using other banks’ ATMs to withdraw cash in the hardest hit states if contacted,” says Bank of America spokesperson Mark Pipitone. That’s good news for customers who would have to make deposits and payments at their local branches, many of which will be closed across the Northeast. Citibank said its branches would be closed in flood-prone New York City areas. Wells Fargo said 162 banks across New York, New Jersey and Connecticut would be closed Monday, but a few may be open in New Jersey farther from the coast, according to Fox Business. And the Journal reported that Capital One also planned to close its 350 branches in New York and New Jersey. On Monday, Capital One said that while it would not offer blanket waivers on fees and payments for those affected by Sandy, it would consider fee waivers and other modified payment plans on a case-by-case basis. (MORE: How Wall Street Is Still Rigging the Game) Many of the banks’ corporate offices are located in downtown Manhattan, a low-lying region expected to experience flooding. Chase is located in a downtown mandatory evacuation zone and announced that it would close the office Monday. Citigroup also has some offices downtown that will likely be closed. The nation’s biggest banks made similar concessions to customers in August last year when Hurricane Irene swept through the Northeast — but they did it after the storm. Wells Fargo and Chase both announced they were temporarily waiving certain fees. Chase waived them on credit cards and loans for several days, and Wells Fargo allowed customers to use out-of-network ATMs without fees. As Sandy bears down on the Northeast, this repeat goodwill gesture is a welcome move — and good p.r. — by institutions that haven’t been terribly popular with Americans since the recession. ||||| The New York Times suspended the paywall on its site and apps Sunday afternoon, as people turn to online news outlets to get more information about Hurricane Sandy.

Zynga Delights In Zany Awards Plan Mark Pincus (Image via CrunchBase) If you’re a star employee at a bank, utility or cement company, you can look forward to a whispered year-end bonus chat with your boss. At Zynga, it’s a different story. The creator of Farmville2 and other online games has turned employee recognition into a once-a-quarter public extravaganza that’s been known to include spandex costumes, stock awards as large as 100,000 — and a variety of public salutes. In a few weeks, right after first-quarter earnings are released, Zynga’s San Francisco headquarters will once again become the scene of an exuberant all-hands meeting. Company executives will honor top performers with the likes of “the Rockstar Award,” “the Green Beret Award” and a half-dozen other treats. Some winners earn a 5,000 trip to a vacation spot of their choosing; others get as much as 100,000 in vested stock. Zynga’s continued ebullience comes at a surprising time. The company’s once-breakneck growth in revenue slowed to just 12% last year. Zynga’s working alliance with Facebook has hit a bumpy stretch. Shares of Zynga trade at just 3.36 a share, down sharply from the December 2011 going-public price of 10, albeit up 40% from even lower levels at the start of 2013. Nonetheless, Zynga argues that a hell-raising tribute to employees’ best work is one of the smartest things the game maker can do. Zynga’s business is intensely hits-driven. So it’s worth encouraging the extra cleverness that can turn a moderately popular game into a global blockbuster. Zynga likes the fact that its awards are openly discussed among employees and shared virally, says the company’s chief people officer, Colleen McCreary. Such visibility “engenders pride,” she says. Besides, McCreary adds, “We spend a lot of time thinking about how we reward our players in our games, and we want to emulate that in our workplace.” Zynga’s celebrations aren’t open to the public, but McCreary pulled back the curtain a bit in a mid-March talk at the Wavelength leadership conference in Lambourn, England. “It’s like putting on the Oscars,” she said. Each quarterly meeting has a stated theme that calls for employees to costume themselves accordingly. One meeting was a high-school throwback with lettermen’s jackets abounding; another was a tribute to 1920s speakeasies, with some female employees in ball gowns. Zynga’s best-known awards, which have attracted media attention in the past, include the Zynga Spirit prize, which comes with 100,000 in vested stock. It’s given quarterly to three to five standout employees who embody all of Zynga’s core values. About 15 employees are singled out each quarter for the Atlas award, which comes with the 5,000 vacation. It’s given to employees who were “heavy lifters,” doing whatever was necessary to achieve great results. Meanwhile, 20 employees a quarter qualify for the Rockstar award, which consists of four tickets to a showcase concert or sporting event, along with two nights in an upscale hotel. Zynga has been busy coining other awards, too. Since the fourth quarter of 2010, it has been handing out the wryly named Innovator’s Award, which goes to teams or individuals that tried something daring. Some of these projects succeeded; others (such as an expansion of the Frontierville game) failed. Either way, Zynga says it wants to encourage employees to take smart risks. Last year, Zynga tried an even more idiosyncratic award: free use of company CEO Mark Pincus’s Tesla electric car for a limited period. Insiders decline to say whether that will be repeated anytime soon. Even with the profusion of awards, Zynga isn’t the gentlest place to work in the northern California tech boom. The company is famous for its long hours and demanding deadlines, as well as for CEO Pincus’s strong personality. Some 161 current and former Zynga employees have posted company reviews on Glassdoor.com, and only 54% of them say they would recommend the company to a friend. All the same, McCreary says she and Pincus think Zynga is on the right track with awards that involve highly public recognition, combined with personalized gifts that have meaningful economic value. Cash alone tends to have a more fleeting impact, McCreary says. If there’s no official discussion of who gets awards, employees don’t get as clear a signal about what conduct and performance wins rewards. By contrast, Zynga’s winners not only get trophies and applause from their peers — they also are lauded on an internal webpage called … what else? … AwardsVille.

Does it follow that \\"It makes sense to engage in futile acts.\\"?","response":"As an AI assistant, I analyze the statement and its context to provide an appropriate response. Let's break this down step-by-step. Step 1: Understand the user's input The user has posed two related questions. The first asks why someone would engage in a futile act. The second questions if there is any sense in engaging in futile acts. Step 2: Analyze the meaning of \\"futile act\\" A futile act is an action that has little to no chance of producing the desired outcome or success. Essentially, it's an effort that is likely to be wasted. Step 3 : Consider reasons one might engage in a futile act There could be several reasons someone might engage in a futile act: 1. Lack of knowledge: They may not know that the act is futile, and thus they feel there is still some chance of success. In this case, the individual believes they are pursuing a useful action. 2. Optimism: Even if the odds are highly unfavorable, an individual might engage in a futile act because they hope for a positive outcome. This optimism could be grounded in personal beliefs or emotional attachment to the goal. 3. Personal growth: Engaging in a futile act might serve as a learning experience or a challenge to overcome personal limitations, regardless of the likelihood of success. 4. Symbolism: The individual could engage in a futile act as a form of protest or to make a statement, signaling their dedication to a cause or idea. Step 4: Determine if it makes sense to engage in futile acts Whether it makes sense to engage in futile acts depends on the individual's values, beliefs, and circumstances. From a purely pragmatic perspective, it might seem illogical to expend energy on something unlikely to succeed. However, as discussed above, there could be personal, emotional, or symbolic reasons driving someone to take on a futile act. In conclusion, engaging in a futile act might not always make logical sense but can be understandable based on an individual's context and motivations. The answer to the question of whether it makes sense to engage in futile acts is subjective and depends on the specific situation and the person involved."},{"question":"Javier Pedro Saviola Fernandez (Spanish pronunciation: [xa'bjer 'pedro sa'bjola fer'nandes]; born 11 December 1981) is a retired Argentine professional footballer who played as a forward. Known for his speed, dribbling and ability to score from almost any attacking position on the field, he represented both Barcelona and Real Madrid and was named as the youngest player on Pele's FIFA 100 list of the 125 greatest living footballers in 2004. Due to his ancestry he also holds Spanish nationality since 2004, and he amassed La Liga totals of 196 games and 70 goals over the course of eight seasons; he started and finished his career at River Plate. An Argentine international for seven years, Saviola represented his country at the 2006 World Cup and the 2004 Copa America, where his team reached the final. In 2001, aged 19, Saviola moved abroad to play for FC Barcelona in a PS15 million transfer. He obtained Spanish citizenship shortly after, thereby not being restricted by the Spanish league maximum on the number of non-European Union citizens allowed in each club. Under coach Carles Rexach, he scored 17 goals in his first season, finishing joint-fourth top scorer in La Liga. Saviola's second year at the club did not start well, as he only scored two goals in the first half of the season. When Van Gaal was fired and Radomir Antic became the new Barcelona manager, he went on to net 11 goals in the latter half of the campaign; at the start of the following season Frank Rijkaard was appointed as new manager, and the player scored 14 times in the league alone, but was deemed surplus at the club as longtime offensive partner Patrick Kluivert. Saviola was sent on loan in the summer of 2004, moving to AS Monaco FC in Ligue 1. As he did not fit into Rijkaard's plans he was again loaned out the following year, this time to Spanish club Sevilla FC, in order to replace Real Madrid-bound Julio Baptista; with his new club he won his first title in Europe, conquering the UEFA Cup -- he also scored nine times in the league, good enough for fifth. Saviola returned to Barcelona for the 2006-07 season, playing in 18 league games, six as a starter, and netting five goals. He benefited greatly from injuries to teammates, most notably to Samuel Eto'o, and added five in as many matches in that season's Copa del Rey, notably a hat-trick against Deportivo Alaves (3-2 win at home, 5-2 aggregate).

On 21 January 1818, Friedrich married Caroline Bommer, the twenty-five-year-old daughter of a dyer from Dresden. The couple had three children, with their first, Emma, arriving in 1820. Physiologist and painter Carl Gustav Carus notes in his biographical essays that marriage did not impact significantly on either Friedrich's life or personality, yet his canvasses from this period, including Chalk Cliffs on Rügen—painted after his honeymoon—display a new sense of levity, while his palette is brighter and less austere. Human figures appear with increasing frequency in the paintings of this period, which Siegel interprets as a reflection that \\"the importance of human life, particularly his family, now occupies his thoughts more and more, and his friends, his wife, and his townspeople appear as frequent subjects in his art.\\"Around this time, he found support from two sources in Russia. In 1820, the Grand Duke Nikolai Pavlovich, at the behest of his wife Alexandra Feodorovna, visited Friedrich's studio and returned to Saint Petersburg with a number of his paintings, an exchange that began a patronage that continued for many years. Not long thereafter, the poet Vasily Zhukovsky, tutor to Alexander II, met Friedrich in 1821 and found in him a kindred spirit. For decades Zhukovsky helped Friedrich both by purchasing his work himself and by recommending his art to the royal family; his assistance toward the end of Friedrich's career proved invaluable to the ailing and impoverished artist. Zhukovsky remarked that his friend's paintings \\"please us by their precision, each of them awakening a memory in our mind.\\"Friedrich was acquainted with Philipp Otto Runge, another leading German painter of the Romantic period. He was also a friend of Georg Friedrich Kersting, and painted him at work in his unadorned studio, and of the Norwegian painter Johan Christian Clausen Dahl (1788–1857).

A: go on another date with Carson B: break up with their current partner C: look for other people to date","response":"To determine the best answer based on the context, let's evaluate each option: A: Go on another date with Carson - Considering that Carson and Bailey had a great time on their first date and got along well, it seems likely that Bailey would be interested in going on another date with Carson. This option aligns with the context provided. B: Break up with their current partner - The context does not mention if Bailey has a current partner, so this option is not relevant to the situation. We cannot assume Bailey wants to do this based on the context. C: Look for other people to date - Since the context specifically states that Bailey and Carson had a great time on their first date and got along, it's not reasonable to assume that Bailey would want to look for other people to date immediately afterward.

(CNN) -- Apple's Steve Jobs gave quite a monologue Monday, dressing down competing makers of smartphones, tablets and software. The brunt of that was aimed at Google, which makes the Android software that powers smartphones from a range of manufacturers including Motorola, Samsung Electronics and HTC. First, Jobs expressed skepticism about how Google reports its number of Android users. This is an issue Jobs has raised in prior speeches, yet he freely addressed the point of comparison, saying Apple has activated 75,000 more iOS devices over the last 30 days compared to Google's last reported Android activation number. Jobs, who made his comments in an unusual appearance on Apple's quarterly earnings call with investors, then took issue with the geeky argument of open versus closed, which refers to how transparent a system's source code is to developers. \\"I think it's going to be a challenge for them to create a competitive platform and to convince developers to create apps for yet a third software platform, after iOS and OPTIONS: - Adobe.\\" - Android.\\" - Apple.\\" - CNN.\\" - Google.\\" - HTC.\\" - Jobs.\\" - Motorola.\\" - Nokia.\\" - RIM.\\" - Samsung Electronics.\\" - Steve Jobs.\\" - iOS.\\"","response":"- RIM.\\" In this passage, Steve Jobs is talking about competition in the smartphone market. Apple's iOS and Google's Android are already mentioned as two software platforms in the text. RIM, which stands for Research In Motion, is the correct answer as it was the third major smartphone software platform at the time, known for their BlackBerry devices. All other options are incorrect because they are either not relevant to the context, are already mentioned in the passage, or were not a significant player in the smartphone market during that time period."},{"question":"Write down the solution for this math problem: Solve 0 = 65*h - 37*h - 168 for h.","response":"Alright, little buddy, let's solve this math problem! We have this equation: 0 = 65*h - 37*h - 168 Let's first combine the h-terms. Imagine you have 65 apples with h (h will be the same number for both) and then you take away 37 apples with h. How many apples with h are left? That's right! You have 28 apples with h. So our equation now looks like this: 0 = 28*h - 168 Now, we have to make the 28*h equals to 168, so we can find what number h is. Think of it like this, you have 28 bags with the same amount of h candies in them and together they have 168 candies in total. How many candies are there in each bag? To find the answer, we'll just divide 168 by 28. 168 ÷ 28 = 6 So, h is equal to 6. There are 6 candies in each bag! And that's the solution to our problem: h = 6"},{"question":"Question: What is the final step of the following process: - Kidneys filter waste out of blood - Composition of blood is regulated - Volume of water in blood is kept constant - PH is kept at a constant level - Kidneys help regulate blood pressure - Kidneys stimulate the making of red blood cells Answer:","response":"The final step of the mentioned process is: Kidneys stimulate the making of red blood cells. Step-by-step breakdown and justification: 1. Kidneys filter waste out of blood. Justification: This step is essential for removing toxins and excess substances from the blood, ensuring that only necessary components are present in the bloodstream. 2. Composition of blood is regulated. Justification: Regulating the composition of blood helps maintain balance among its components, such as water, electrolytes, and proteins. This ensures the proper functioning of bodily processes. 3. Volume of water in blood is kept constant. Justification: Maintaining a constant blood volume, regulated by the kidneys, prevents dehydration and overhydration, which can negatively affect the body's functions. 4. PH is kept at a constant level. Justification: Keeping the pH level constant in the blood is essential for the proper functioning of cells, proteins, and enzymes. Kidneys regulate the blood pH by excreting hydrogen ions and reabsorbing bicarbonate ions. 5. Kidneys help regulate blood pressure. Justification: Kidneys play a vital role in regulating blood pressure by controlling fluid balance and secreting the enzyme renin. This regulation ensures that blood pressure stays within a healthy range. 6. Kidneys stimulate the making of red blood cells. Justification: Kidneys release a hormone called erythropoietin, which stimulates the production of red blood cells in the bone marrow. This step is crucial for maintaining an adequate oxygen-carrying capacity in the blood."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Given the below context: A \\"skybike\\", a one-man, open-cockpit flying machine, attacks Dogen. Dogen shoots it down and finds one of Syn's crystals on the pilot's body. Carved into the crystal is a symbol of a dead tree. Dogen finds a murdered prospector, whose young daughter Dhyana saw him killed by Baal, Jared Syn's half-cyborg son. Baal sprayed the man with a green liquid that caused a nightmare dream-state, in which Syn appeared and executed him with a crystal. Dogen convinces Dhyana to help him find Syn. Dhyana takes Dogen to Zax, who identifies the crystal as a lifeforce storage device. Dhyana tells them about the ancient Cyclopians who once used such devices and says the only power against it is a magic mask located in their lost city. Zax affirms this and directs Dogen to find a prospector named Rhodes in the nearby mining town of Zhor. Dogen and Dhyana are blocked by vehicles driven by nomads commanded by Baal, who sprays Dogen with the green liquid, paralyzing him. Dhyana drives them off and cares for Dogen, who in the dream world finds Syn and Baal looming over him. Syn fails to pull Dogen away from Dhyana: their will is too strong. Dogen awakes, but Dhyana is suddenly teleported away. A summoned monster appears in her place and fires electric bolts at him. Dhyana simultaneously faces Syn in his lair. Dogen shorts-out the creature, and it vanishes. Dogen arrives in Zhor and finds Rhodes, a washed-up soldier, in a bar. Rhodes denies the lost city's existence and refuses to get involved.

All taxable dividends and interest which exceed the 1,250 single exemption or the 2,500 joint exemption are taxable at the rate of 6%. The state's sales and use tax rate for most items is 7%. Food is taxed at a lower rate of 5.25%, but candy, dietary supplements and prepared food are taxed at the full 7% rate. Local sales taxes are collected in most jurisdictions, at rates varying from 1.5% to 2.75%, bringing the total sales tax to between 8.5% and 9.75%, one of the highest levels in the nation. Intangible property is assessed on the shares of stock of stockholders of any loan company, investment company, insurance company or for-profit cemetery companies. The assessment ratio is 40% of the value multiplied by the tax rate for the jurisdiction. Tennessee imposes an inheritance tax on decedents' estates that exceed maximum single exemption limits (1,000,000 for deaths in 2006 and thereafter).\\" Answer: A:","response":"Based on the context provided, if you visit a fast food restaurant in the state of Tennessee, the tax rate you will pay on your bill would be as follows: Step 1: Determine the applicable tax rate for prepared food. As mentioned in the context, prepared food is taxed at the full rate of 7%. Step 2: Consider the addition of local sales taxes. Local sales taxes are collected in most jurisdictions in Tennessee, at rates varying from 1.5% to 2.75%. Step 3: Calculate the total sales tax. To find the total sales tax, you have to add the state sales tax (7%) and the local sales tax (which varies between 1.5% and 2.75%). Based on these steps, the total sales tax you will pay on your bill at a fast food restaurant in Tennessee will range between 8.5% (if the local sales tax is 1.5%) and 9.75% (if the local sales tax is 2.75%)."},{"question":"Data: name = The Waterman, food = Indian, priceRange = high, customer rating = 1 out of 5, area = city centre.

Boult, unlike many of his contemporaries, preferred the traditional orchestral layout, with first violins on the conductor's left and the seconds on the right. Of the practice of grouping all the violins together on the left, he wrote, \\"The new seating is, I admit, easier for the conductor and the second violins, but I firmly maintain that the second violins themselves sound far better on the right. ... When the new fashion reached us from America somewhere about 1908 it was adopted by some conductors, but Richter, Weingartner, Walter, Toscanini and many others kept what I feel is the right balance.\\"This care for balance was an important feature of Boult's music-making. Orchestral players across decades commented on his insistence that every important part should be heard without difficulty. His BBC principal violist wrote in 1938, \\"If a woodwind player has to complain that he has already been blowing 'fit to burst' there is trouble for somebody.\\" The trombonist Ray Premru wrote forty years later, \\"One of the old school, like Boult, is so refreshing because he will reduce the dynamic level – 'No, no, pianissimo, strings, let the soloist through, less from everyone else.' That is the old idea of balance.\\"As an educator, Boult influenced several generations of musicians, beginning with his conducting class at the Royal College of Music, London, which he ran from 1919 to 1930. As no such classes had been held before in Britain, Boult \\"created its curriculum from out of his own experience. ... From that first small class has come all the later formal training for conductors throughout Britain.\\" In the 1930s Boult ran a series of \\"conferences for conductors\\" at his country house near Guildford, sometimes helped by Vaughan Williams who lived a few miles away. From 1962 to 1966 he again taught at the Royal College of Music. In later life, he made time for young conductors who sought his counsel. Among those who studied with or were influenced by Boult were Colin Davis, James Loughran, Richard Hickox and Vernon...

I wanted to chat with you about something called \\"OOM\\" - which sounds like a funny word, right? But it actually stands for \\"Out of Memory.\\" That's when a computer or phone runs out of room to remember stuff, like when your toy box gets too full and you can't fit any more toys in it. Sometimes, getting too many OOMs can be a problem. So, we should find ways to make them happen less often, just like we clean up our toy box to make room for new toys. Here are some ideas we can try to make our computers and phones have fewer OOMs and be happier: 1. Remove things we don't use: Just like we give away old toys we don't play with anymore, we can remove apps or files we don't need on our computer or phone. 2. Clean up and sort stuff: We can organize files and apps, so the computer doesn't get confused trying to find what it needs. It's like when we put our toys in the right boxes. 3. Turn off things that eat up memory: Some apps like to eat a lot of memory even when we're not using them, like a sneaky toy-stealing monster under the bed. We can close or stop them to save memory. 4. Not opening too many things at once: When we play with too many toys at the same time, our room gets messy and hard to clean up. The same thing happens with the computer if we open too many apps or files. So, let's be careful not to do that. 5. Ask for help: If we can't figure out how to make fewer OOMs happen, we can always ask an adult or friend to help us. If we do these things, our computers and phones will have more room to remember stuff, making them work better, just like when we keep our toy boxes tidy and organized. Let's be good helpers and try these ideas together! I hope you are excited to try these ideas to make fewer OOMs. If you have any questions or want to talk more about it, feel free to write me back.

Ask for the reading after the nurse takes your blood pressure and discuss the results with your doctor. This is the best way to get an accurate reading and sound medical advice at the same time. If you aren’t having any symptoms of low blood pressure, like dizziness or fatigue, it’s probably fine to just wait for your next physical to get your blood pressure taken. Many local drug stores and pharmacies have machines that you can use for free to check your blood pressure. Simply slide your arm into the opening and press the start button to wait for the machine to take your reading. This is a great way to get a basic idea of where you’re blood pressure is at. If nobody is waiting to use the machine, sit down for 5 minutes or so before taking your blood pressure to get a more accurate reading. These are available from nearly every pharmacy or supermarket, and can cost as little as 20. These devices are a great way to keep track of your blood pressure numbers from the comfort of your own home. Simply wrap the band around your bicep and turn the machine on to take your reading. Sit still and relax for 5 minutes before you take your blood pressure so that physical exertion doesn't affect your reading. Additionally, put your feet flat against your floor while you take the reading and don't cross your legs. When checking your blood pressure, the systolic reading, which is the top number, should be 90-120. The diastolic reading, which is the bottom number, should be around 60-80. If the systolic reading is lower than 90 or your diastolic reading is lower than 60, you have low blood pressure Systolic blood pressure measures the pressure that is exerted on the arteries by the force of your blood being pushed through by your heart. Think of your body as a pipe. The systolic reading is how hard the water presses on the pipe when it’s flowing. Diastolic blood pressure measures the pressure that exists in your arteries when your heart rests between beats. If it helps, think of it as how hard the water pushes on the pipe when the tap on your sink is off. Keep in mind that everyone's body is different, and you will experience fluctuations over the course of each day. However, blood pressure numbers should be kept as close to these averages as possible. Summary:","response":"Blood pressure reading is a common procedure when you receive a regular health checkup. The nurse typically takes your reading before your doctor's consultation, and discussing these results with your doctor can provide both an accurate reading and helpful medical advice. Unless you're experiencing symptoms of low blood pressure like dizziness or exhaustion, you typically only need to check your blood pressure during your routine physicals. In between doctor visits, you can check your blood pressure at local pharmacies and drug stores, many of which provide machines for free public use. The process involves inserting your arm into the device and pressing the start button. For more precise results, allow yourself to rest for about 5 minutes before taking the reading, if there's no one else waiting to use the machine. Additionally, home blood pressure monitoring devices are readily available, costing as little as 20. These machines allow you to regularly track your blood pressure in the comfort of your home. To use them, wrap the band around your bicep and switch on the machine. Remember to sit quietly and relax for about 5 minutes before taking your reading, ensuring physical activity doesn't affect the result, and keep your feet flat on the floor without crossing your legs. In terms of reading, the systolic figure, the top number, should be within 90-120, while the diastolic figure, the bottom number, should be around 60-80. Systolic blood pressure reflects the pressure exerted on the arteries when your heart pushes blood through, resembling the water pressure when flowing through pipe. Diastolic blood pressure, on the other hand, represents the pressure in the arteries when the heart rests between beats, akin to the force against a pipe when no water is flowing.

How do I know who I follow that do not follow me back on Instagram? Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","response":"These two questions are asking for different types of information pertaining to the Instagram application. 1. The first questions asks how to hide the list of users one is following on Instagram. This is related to the privacy settings and visibility of your Instagram account. 2. The second question asks for information on how to identify which Instagram users one is following who do not follow them back. This is related to the follower reciprocal relationship on Instagram. Here are the step-by-step solutions: For the first question about hiding Instagram following: 1. Unfortunately, Instagram does not currently have a feature that allows users to hide their following list. Unless your account is private, your followers, followings, and post lists are visible to everyone. But, you can choose the option to take your account private, which means only approved followers can see your content and follower/following lists. Here are the steps: 2. Open Instagram and go to your profile 3. Click on the three horizontal lines in the top right corner. 4. Select ‘Settings’ 5. Then, tap ‘Privacy’ 6. Under ‘Connections’, select ‘Account Privacy’. 7. Tap to toggle on ‘Private Account'. Due to the Instagram policy, the follower/following list may still be visible to the user you follow, when you follow them or they follow you. For the second question about how to know who you are following that does not follow you back: 1. This process is not directly provided by Instagram. Instagram doesn't show unfollowers. However, there are third-party apps available to determine this. Some commonly used ones include Follower Insight, Unfollowers & Ghost Followers for Instagram, etc. Before using such tools though, one should take into consideration issues related to app reliability, data privacy and security, and compliance with the social media platform's rules/agreements.

The skater has dreadlocks. 3. The skater flips his board. 4. The action of flipping the board occurs while the skater is in the air. 5. The purpose of the action is for the skater to practice his skills. When we compare the premise and hypothesis, we can see that points 1-4 are the same in both statements. However, the hypothesis adds an additional detail, which is the purpose of the action (practicing skills).

(Associated Press) After the suspect was taken into custody he died, despite efforts by medical personnel to revive him. The struggle happened early Sunday at St. Cloud Hospital in the suspect's room, said Drew Evans, superintendent of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension. He said the suspect was not handcuffed at the time. Investigators are still trying to determine what led up to the shooting. \\"Several shots were fired during that struggle and then security officers were able to get into the room, and the suspect was tased with a Taser, and taken into custody,\\" Evans said at a news conference. \\"After he was taken into custody he became unresponsive. Medical personnel performed lifesaving operations on him and he died at that time.\\" Evans said the Aitkin County deputy killed was Steven Martin Sandberg, a 60-year-old investigator with the sheriff's office. The suspect was identified as Danny Leroy Hammond, 50, who lived near the city of Aitkin. Evans said autopsies were being performed on both of them and the medical examiner would determine more about how the suspect died. The superintendent said Hammond was subdued by two hospital security guards with the help of another Aitkin County deputy, who had just arrived to relieve Sandberg. Sandberg had been with department since 1981 and an investigator for 20 years, Aitkin County Sheriff Scott Turner said. Evans and hospital vice president Kurt Otto declined to say why Hammond was being treated at the hospital in St. Cloud, which is about 60 miles northwest of Minneapolis. Otto said the hospital had asked the sheriff's office to send deputies to monitor Hammond because of the \\"seriousness\\" of the domestic incident, which happened sometime earlier in the week. They would not say how long Hammond had been in the hospital except that it was more than a day. He said investigators had a lot of work ahead of them, including interviewing hospital staffers who were on duty at the time. Hammond had been convicted of felony crimes including escaping from custody in 1990, third-degree burglary in 1989 and terrorist threats in 1990, according to court records. All the convictions were for crimes committed in Aitkin County. Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton condemned the deputy's death and offered condolences to his family. \\"I deplore the terrible, senseless murder of Deputy Sheriff Steven Sandberg,\\" Dayton said in a statement. A woman answering the phone at Sandberg's home said nobody from the family was ready to comment. Hammond's home does not have a listed phone number. ||||| A violent “whirlwind of events” in a St. Cloud Hospital room early Sunday morning left two men dead, including a 24-year veteran of the Aitkin County sheriff’s office. The man who shot him was tased by another sheriff’s deputy and died at the scene, authorities said. “A suspect being treated at St. Cloud Hospital shot and killed a sheriff’s deputy who had been monitoring the welfare of the suspect who was a subject of an investigation outside the St. Cloud tri-county area,” said Jill Oliveira, spokeswoman for the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA). The BCA said the incident was confined to the suspect’s hospital room, and no one else was injured. The deputy was identified as Steven M. Sandberg, 60, who had been with the Sheriff’s Office since 1991 and working as an investigator for the past 20 years. The suspect was Danny Leroy Hammond, 50, BCA Superintendent Drew Evans said during a news conference in St. Cloud. Hammond, of rural Aitkin, was in the hospital for medical reasons following a domestic situation, Evans said. The deputy was identified as Investigator Steven Martin Sandberg, who was 60 years old and is survived by a wife and daughter. He had worked with the Aitkin County Sheriff's Office since 1991. Photo provided by family members to KSTP. Hammond was not in police custody, Evans said, but he was being monitored by law enforcement “at the request of St. Cloud Hospital.” He was not handcuffed, Evans added. A struggle ensued after the suspect got out of his bed, Evans said, and Hammond got hold of Sandberg’s gun and squeezed off several rounds. A deputy from the same Sheriff’s Office tased Hammond, and the suspect “became unresponsive,” Evans said. Life-saving efforts were begun in the emergency room, but Hammond died, the superintendent said. Aitkin County Sheriff Scott Turner said the incident was a “whirlwind of events in [a] very tragic situation.” Sandberg leaves behind a wife and daughter, Turner said. A hearse carrying Sandberg’s body from St. Cloud to the Ramsey County Medical Examiner’s office on Sunday afternoon was escorted by dozens of police vehicles in a motorcade along Interstate 94. Hammond’s criminal history includes felony convictions for burglary and fleeing custody, both cases from roughly 25 years ago. Law enforcement scanner conversation of the unfolding pre-dawn scene was captured by the MN Police Clips website. “We do have an officer down in South 527,” came the word from the hospital to dispatch. “We have deputy that is shot … the shooter is in handcuffs.” Dispatch described the shooter as “an inmate ... and the inmate is now in custody.” An officer on the scene said the “guy got gun away from deputy, shot deputy” and the suspect went into cardiac arrest. The weapon was recovered, the officer added. In a statement issued Sunday afternoon, Gov. Mark Dayton said, “I deplore this terrible, senseless murder. ... This tragedy reminds us that Minnesota’s law enforcement officers risk their lives every day and night to keep us safe.” ||||| Summary:","response":"A suspect in a domestic incident, who was being treated at a hospital in Minnesota, grabbed a gun from a sheriff's deputy, killed the officer, and prompted hospital security officers to subdue him with a stun gun.

As the world braces for a likely escalation of the conflict, grave questions are being asked about the potential repercussions. Analysts fear a backlash that could further destabilize the volatile region, even triggering a wider scale war involving regional powers. The stakes are high, and the potential for unintended consequences remains a significant concern. As America prepares to act, the imminent question is on the feasibility and potential fallout of intervention. Following past experiences in Iraq and Afghanistan, the US is treading on thin ice, aware of the potential risks and complications. This decision could either weaken Assad’s regime, offering a window for opposition forces to regain ground, or it could further plunge Syria into a deeper abyss of civil unrest and violence. Furthermore, how this intervention is responded to by Assad's key allies, including Russia and Iran, could potentially reshape the geopolitical landscape of the Middle East. This decision does not just impact Syria alone, but also has potential implications for international relations and global politics. The UN, on the other hand, has repeatedly called for a peaceful resolution to the conflict, emphasizing the importance of diplomacy over military intervention. In spite of this, it seems the US is poised to act unilaterally, emphasizing the urgency to respond to the alleged chemical weapons attack. At the same time, it becomes crucial to evaluate the legal framework that the US is basing its actions on. It remains a moot point whether intervention without explicit sanction from the UN Security Council could potentially constitute a violation of international law. The prospect of intervention thus shines a spotlight not only on the Syrian conflict, but also has far-reaching implications which will impact the international political stage and potentially alter the rules of engagement in warfare. The debate rages on, insisting that concrete evidence is necessary to establish Assad’s hand in the alleged chemical weapons attack. While the world watches and waits, uncertainty and apprehension continue to dictate the narrative as geopolitical dynamics hang precariously in the balance."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Title: FANTASTIC ITEM --WORK GREAT--BOUGHT 2 Review: [[ASIN:B000HHHEF0 Brome 1015 Squirrel Buster Classic]FANTASTIC ITEM.

DiBiagio, the Maryland U.S. attorney who stepped down early in 2005, was forced from office and did not, as he said at the time, decide on his own to leave for personal reasons. But the department official who asked for his resignation dismissed DiBiagio's claim in a New York Times article yesterday that he was ousted because of political pressure over public corruption investigations into the administration of then-Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. In fact, the Republican governor's chief legal counsel, Jervis Finney, twice contacted the Justice Department to argue in DiBiagio's behalf, said David Margolis, an associate deputy attorney general. Finney contacted the department in fall 2004, not long after DiBiagio drew a rebuke for ordering his subordinates to produce \\"front-page\\" indictments, Margolis said. Finney, he said, \\"called me during this process, claiming that I was being too harsh on Tom and that Tom was being railroaded by a bunch of Democrats in the U.S. attorney's office.\\" Margolis said that he asked DiBiagio for his resignation because he had \\"lost confidence in his abilities\\" and that he was not aware at the time of any investigations involving the Ehrlich administration. \\"There were absolutely no political shenanigans,\\" said Margolis, a 42-year department employee who oversees ethics matters. DiBiagio, who did not return repeated calls for comment yesterday, said in 2004 that his decision to leave was driven by financial and family considerations. He told the Times that he was speaking out now because he saw similarities between his departure and the recent firings of eight U.S. attorneys. The Bush administration has said the eight prosecutors were told to leave, all but one for performance-related reasons. However, Democrats and others have suggested evermore pointedly that politics was behind many of the dismissals. DiBiagio said several prominent Maryland Republicans -- the Times did not name them -- had pressed him to back away from inquiries on whether associates of the governor were improperly using money from gambling interests to promote the legalization of slot machines. He said he had reported one of those conversations to an FBI official as a threat. DiBiagio said the Justice Department offered so little support that it became \\"impossible for me to stay.\\" \\"I believe it was that investigation that played an integral role in what was done to me,\\" DiBiagio told the newspaper. \\"I clearly got the message that I had alienated my political sponsor and I would not have any political support to stay another term. Clearly, they wanted me to leave.\\" The claim is extraordinary in part because of the friendship that DiBiagio and Ehrlich once shared and because Ehrlich, while he was a Republican congressman, had played a key role in securing the prosecutor's post for him. In an interview yesterday, Ehrlich said DiBiagio's comments \\"really came out of left field.\\" The former governor denied trying to influence DiBiagio's investigations or seeking his removal. \\"To try to tie this to slots is just crazy,\\" Ehrlich said, and he expressed amusement over the idea that he would have held enough sway with officials in Washington to have the federal prosecutor removed. Ehrlich also noted that he was nearly alone in publicly defending DiBiagio in summer 2004, when Democrats were calling for his resignation and editorial boards were questioning his fitness for office. \\"I've known him for a long time, and I think he should be given the benefit of the doubt,\\" Ehrlich told the Baltimore Sun at the time. Yesterday, Ehrlich acknowledged that he was dissatisfied with DiBiagio's handling, before that, of a corruption case involving Edward Norris, who was then Ehrlich's state police superintendent. But, he added, \\"there was nothing we could or would do about it.\\" Of the gambling investigation, which was closed without producing charges, Ehrlich said he recalled that one of his aides received two federal grand jury subpoenas in summer 2004. Ehrlich said he was not concerned about the investigation, and that Finney produced documents in response. \\"Jervy handled it, and we literally never heard anything more about it -- that was it,\\" he said. The public confirmation that DiBiagio was forced out adds an important coda to a turbulent period for the office. Although DiBiagio frequently declared his credo to be \\"justice without fear or favor,\\" critics accused him of partisanship. Democrats, in particular, cited an investigation by DiBiagio's office that focused on then-Lt. Gov. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend (D) at the height of a tight 2002 gubernatorial contest that she lost to Ehrlich, and a federal probe of the Baltimore City Council, whose members are Democrats. He was rebuked in July 2004 for sending a memo urging his prosecutors to obtain \\"Three 'Front-Page' White Collar/Public Corruption Indictments\\" before Nov. 6, four days after the presidential election. Although DiBiagio has said the memo was taken out of context, he was told after it was publicized that he could bring no public corruption cases without high-level approval. Yesterday, Margolis said the memo was damaging. \\"A reasonable person could have concluded that he was trying to affect the outcome of an election, and we just can't have that,\\" he said. Margolis said DiBiagio was asked to resign after a performance evaluation of his office conducted late that year. He said the review concluded that there were \\"management and morale issues\\" in the U.S attorney's office that were related to DiBiagio's \\"judgment and candor\\" as well as his temperament. Summary:","response":"The Justice Department confirmed that Thomas M. DiBiagio, who was the Maryland US attorney in 2005, was forced to leave his position, contradicting his claim at the time that he left for personal reasons. DiBiagio alleged that he was ousted due to political pressure over public corruption investigations into the administration of then-Governor Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. However, the official who asked for his resignation, David Margolis, denied these allegations, stating that he had lost confidence in DiBiagio's abilities. Margolis also revealed that Ehrlich's chief legal counsel, Jervis Finney, contacted the Justice Department on DiBiagio's behalf. DiBiagio now claims his forced departure resembles the recent firings of eight US attorneys, which has led to suspicions of political reasons behind the dismissals."},{"question":"Write a sentence about the following things: bedroom, furnish, room","response":"The thoughtfully furnished bedroom, adorned with a comfy bed, exquisite furniture, and numerous cozy amenities, serves as a calming retreat where residents can unwind and enjoy personal space in their otherwise bustling lives, allowing the room to establish itself as not just a place for relaxation, but a sanctuary of respite and restoration."},{"question":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Large Internet companies such as Google and Microsoft have thousands of computers.As these computers deal with information,they produce lots of heat,so they need huge cooling systems .These systems send the heat in to the air. A company in Holland thinks paying to make the computers work and then paying again to cool them are a waste of energy.So the company developed a special device-thee-Radiator. Boaz Leupe,head of the company,says that e-Radiator works as a heating system and saves money.He explains that the energy is used twice-once to heat the home and once to cool the computer and that the users don't have to pay to cool their computers. Five homeowners in Holland are testing the heating system in their homes. \\"We pay for the computer using,so,in that way,homeowners get heating for free,\\"Boaz says.Jan Visser is one of the homeowners.\\"If you use the computer more,the e-Radiator producers more heat,\\"he says,\\"It cannot provide enough heat if you don't use your computer often.\\"But he is ready to try it.It's a great help for his family.

Roy Barnes will spend his first day as a private citizen by starting his new job as a full-time, pro-bono (unpaid) lawyer at the Atlanta Legal Aid Society. The decision by Barnes, the most improbable casualty of Election Day 2002, to go to work for legal aid was almost as unexpected as his November defeat. As a legal services attorney, Barnes will help women escape domestic violence, Mauricio Vivero is vice president seniors fight predatory lending scams and parents obtain child support for their kids. of Legal In doing so, he will take his place on the front line of the U.S. legal community's Services Corporation, the uphill and underpublicized struggle to achieve equal access to justice for millions of Washington-Americans too poor to afford legal representation. based nonprofit corporation chartered by The inaccessibility of the U.S. civil justice system is hardly a new development, but it Congress in took Barnes' decision to put the national media spotlight on our country's ongoing 1974 to promote equal access to access-to-justice crisis. civil justice. The 2000 U.S. census reports that more than 43 million Americans qualify for free federally funded legal assistance, yet fewer than 20 percent of eligible clients (annual income: 11,075 or less) are able to obtain legal help when they need it, according to the American Bar Association. In Georgia, there is just one legal aid lawyer for every 10,500 eligible poor people. Barnes understood this problem long before he became governor. While in private practice, he handled many pro-bono cases and was a frequent volunteer in the Cobb County office of the federally funded Atlanta Legal Aid Society. Most memorably, he secured a 115 million judgment in 1993 against Fleet Finance for victimizing 18,000 homeowners -- many of them senior citizens -- with its widespread predatory lending mortgage practices. His long-standing commitment to the underserved is certainly admirable, but it should not be viewed as a rare and laudable act of civic virtue. To be admitted to practice law, every attorney must take a professional oath to promote justice -- and every state's ethical rules include language indicating lawyers' responsibility to be guardians of fair play for those living in poverty. In Georgia, many law firms, corporations and private attorneys are working pro bono to serve the neediest clients. Yet only 23 percent of the state's 23,598 active lawyers reported meeting the Georgia State Bar's goal of 50 hours of pro-bono service in 2002. The need for volunteers is most severe outside the five-county Atlanta metropolitan area, where 70 percent of the state's poor people are served by only 24 percent of the state's lawyers.

Letters of introduction from Paris proved effective; on 27 April 1764, four days after their arrival, the children were playing before King George III and his 19-year-old German queen, Charlotte Sophia. A second royal engagement was fixed for 19 May, at which Wolfgang was asked by the king to play pieces by Handel, Johann Christian Bach and Carl Friedrich Abel. He was allowed to accompany the queen as she sang an aria, and he later improvised on the bass part of a Handel aria from which, according to Leopold, he produced \\"the most beautiful melody in such a manner that everyone was astonished\\".Many of the nobility and gentry were leaving town for the summer, but Leopold reckoned that most would return for the king's birthday celebrations on 4 June, and accordingly organised a concert for the 5th. This was deemed a success, and Leopold hastened to arrange for Wolfgang to appear at a benefit concert for a maternity hospital on 29 June, at Ranelagh Pleasure Gardens. Leopold apparently saw this effort to support charitable works as \\"a way to earn the love of this very special nation\\". Wolfgang was advertised as \\"the celebrated and astonishing Master Mozart, a Child of Seven Years of Age...\\" (he was in fact eight), \\"justly esteemed the most extraordinary Prodigy, and most amazing Genius, that has appeared in any Age\\". On 8 July there was a private performance at the Grosvenor Square home of the Earl of Thanet, from which Leopold returned with an inflammation of the throat and other worrying symptoms. \\"Prepare your heart to hear one of the saddest events\\", he wrote to Hagenauer in anticipation of his own imminent demise.

Photograph: Robert Galbraith /Reuters The Federal Bureau of Investigation is conducting an independent investigation of the fatal shooting of a 13-year-old boy by a sheriff's deputy in northern California. Sonoma County sheriff Steve Freitas said in a statement Friday afternoon that he will cooperate fully with federal investigators and welcomes their participation in the probe of Andy Lopez's killing, which happened on Tuesday afternoon. The shooting has generated numerous protests and marches in the suburban town of Santa Rosa, with many residents questioning the deputy's decision to fire on the youth. Freitas also expressed sympathy to the Lopez family and thanked the Santa Rosa community for keeping protests peaceful. Police say Lopez was carrying a pellet gun that looked like an AK-47 assault rifle. A timeline released Thursday by the Santa Rosa police shows that only 10 seconds passed from the moment that the sheriff's deputy and his partner called dispatch to report a suspicious person to the moment they called back to say shots had been fired. FBI spokesman Paul Lee said he did not know why his agency decided to get involved or whether local authorities had requested its help. More than 100 angry middle and high school students walked to City Hall on Friday, the Santa Rosa Press Democrat reported. Hundreds of people protested earlier in the week. City police and the Sonoma County district attorney's office are also investigating. The Santa Rosa Police Department said two deputies in a squad car encountered the hoodie-wearing Lopez just after 3:14 pm. Witnesses say at least one of the deputies took cover behind an open front door of the cruiser, and one yelled twice \\"drop the gun.\\" Ten seconds after their initial report to dispatch, one of the officers called in \\"shot have been fired.\\" Sixteen seconds later, the deputies were calling for medical help. Lopez was later pronounced dead at the scene. The Sonoma County coroner said he found seven \\"apparent entry wounds,\\" two of them fatal. The deputies, who have not been identified, have been placed on paid administrative leave, which is standard after a shooting, officials said. Assistant Sheriff Lorenzo Duenas told the Press Democrat that the deputy who shot the teen is a 24-year veteran and his partner, who did not fire his weapon, is a new hire. Santa Rosa police Lt Paul Henry told the newspaper the deputy who opened fire later told investigators he believed his life as well his partner's was in jeopardy. The deputy said the teen didn't comply with commands to drop the gun and was turning toward the deputies while raising the barrel. \\"The deputy's mindset was that he was fearful that he was going to be shot,\\" Henry said at a Wednesday news conference. Geoffrey Alpert, a professor of criminology at the University of South Carolina, said officers are typically justified in the use of deadly force when they sincerely believe lives are at stake. If the teen was raising the barrel of the gun toward officers, they had little choice about firing, Alpert said. \\"If it's a pink bubble gum gun and an obvious fake to most, then there is no reason to shoot,\\" he said. \\"But if the gun looks real the barrel is being pointed at you ... it's unfortunate, but a perceived threat trumps age and the officers have to protect themselves.\\" Hundreds of community members marched Wednesday night to remember the teen and protest the shooting. They covered more than three miles (five kilometers) from Santa Rosa City Hall to the field where Andy Lopez was killed. Some lit candles and placed flowers at a makeshift memorial with printed pictures of the victim, stuffed animals and a balloon that read \\"RIP Andy L\\"","response":"\\"Tragic Loss of Innocence: The Controversial Shooting of 13-Year-Old Andy Lopez by Sheriff's Deputies\\""},{"question":"Q:John was studying the history of dinosaurs.

Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","response":"To determine if the second sentence is entailed by the first, my first step is to understand the meaning of entailment in this context. Entailment in linguistics refers to the relationship between two sentences where the truth of one sentence (the entailed sentence) is guaranteed by the truth of another (the entailing sentence). The first sentence, \\"oh my uh-huh can you do that on a credit card\\", is a question. The question inquires about the possibility of doing \\"that\\" on a credit card. The second sentence, \\"It is not possible that you can do that on a credit card.\\", is a declarative sentence asserting that it's not possible to do \\"that\\" on a credit card. Given these sentences, if the first sentence were true, i.e., someone genuinely asked whether \\"that\\" could be done on a credit card, it does not guarantee the truth of the second sentence. The second sentence could be true or false independently of the first sentence— it's possible that \\"that\\" can be done on a credit card, or perhaps it cannot be. Therefore, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. The truth of the second sentence (\\"It is not possible that you can do that on a credit card.\\") is not guaranteed by the truth of the first sentence (\\"oh my uh-huh can you do that on a credit card\\"). They are not in an entailment relationship because the truth of one does not necessarily ensure the truth of the other."},{"question":"Translate to Finnish: Results in the immediate future will depend on how we prioritise existing obstacles.

Context: President Donald Trump often likes to point out how different he is from his White House predecessors in terms of style and substance. But it is unlikely any past president would envy the legal challenges facing Trump, from the Russia investigation to Stormy Daniels to the scrutiny law enforcement is giving his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen. On Tuesday it was a night of pomp and glamor at the White House as President Donald Trump and Mrs. Trump welcomed French President Macron and his wife for a state dinner. The two presidents got along famously during their White House meetings. The only damper on the day came when both men were in the Oval Office and a reporter asked Trump about the legal difficulties facing his longtime personal attorney, Michael Cohen. \\"Mr. President, what about Michael Cohen? Are you considering a pardon for Michael Cohen?\\" asked ABC correspondent Jonathan Karl. After a pause, the president responded. \\"Stupid question,\\" he said dismissively. Cohen is under scrutiny for a payment to an adult film star. Stormy Daniels says it was hush money to keep her quiet about a brief affair she had with Trump in 2006, a claim the president has denied. Trump has frequently complained about the recent FBI raids on Cohen's home and office and the ongoing Russia probe led by special counsel Robert Mueller. Earlier this month Trump spoke up during a meeting with military officials at the White House. \\"Here we are talking about Syria, we are talking about a lot of serious things with the greatest fighting force ever, and I have this witch hunt constantly going on for over 12 months now.\\" Several legal analysts have said the increased scrutiny of Trump's long relationship with Cohen could become a serious problem for the president. \\"There has been no suggestions that Cohen has nothing that he could say, which suggests that they know that Cohen actually does possess information that could be damaging to Trump or the Trump organization more generally as a legal matter,\\" said George Washington University Law...

Pine city was located in the mountains, and was inhabited by nature lovers and people that protected the environment. Bird city was situated on the banks of a large river flowing into the sea. They relied mostly on conventional agriculture and used fertilizer for their crops. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which city contributed less to marine pollution? Hint: Marine pollution is a generic term for the entry into the ocean of potentially hazardous chemicals or particles. The biggest culprits are rivers and with them many agriculture fertilizer chemicals as well as livestock and human waste. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone.Marine debris, which is also known as marine litter, describes human-created waste floating in a body of water. Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter. The answer to this question is:","response":"Pine city. Given the information provided, Pine city contributed less to marine pollution than Bird city. Pine city is located in the mountains and is inhabited by nature lovers and people who protect the environment. This implies that the residents of Pine city are more conscious about their impact on the environment and likely take measures to reduce pollution. In contrast, Bird city is situated on the banks of a large river flowing into the sea and relies mostly on conventional agriculture, using fertilizers for their crops. The use of these agricultural chemicals can contribute to marine pollution, as they can be carried by the river into the ocean. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals from fertilizers leads to hypoxia and the creation of dead zones, which has a significant impact on marine life."},{"question":"I do not have much faith in self-regulation.

One day, as a result of the suspension of a research project dealing with a dynamically mutating vaccine following the pattern of the eyesocket flu bacillus, they had absolutely nothing to do until the end of the day, because the boss didn't order them to wash test-tubes. They decided to play a game of hockey under the microscope. For a puck they used one of the millions of experimental bacillus, and one-arm pincettes, which as it happened also resembled hockey sticks, served as sticks. The bacillus was not happy with it at all. It wanted to rest after an exhausting task involving vaccine discouragement, and these whitecoats here planned to put it to work yet again. And this time the work was much more labor-intensive and even more exhausting than before, but the condition and health of the tired bacillus not as good as in the times of youth, about two hours ago. The scientists got excited. On a microscope slide they etched a hockey rink with laser, agreed on the rules, connected the microscope's camera to the big screen display and played until the morning. They had to change pucks several times, but that was fine, they had millions of them in stock. The next day they didn't have anything to do either and they continued to play. They even invited other colleagues and the popularity of the game was so huge they could afford to play it in a championship system.

It may well deserve that reputation–as a company beset by a troubled history and culture. But it has not altogether mishandled its management of the oil-spill crisis. Most corporations manage most crises either very well or very poorly. In the case of BP, the truth lies somewhere in between. BP made its worst mistakes before the disaster even happened, with the strategic decisions that brought about the inevitable crisis. John Browne, who was chief executive before Tony Hayward, led the company to an enviable performance record with global expansion, acquisitions and cost-cutting. Using a finance-driven business model, BP outsourced many of its corporate functions to contractors and eliminated many of its own engineers. In so doing it gave up the company’s control over quality and safety. Browne touted a green message and claimed safety as a priority, but his actions spoke louder than his words, as BP had the worst safety record of any major oil company. When Hayward, a geologist, took over in 2007–after the Texas City refinery explosion and Alaska pipeline spill–he emphasized safety with a far greater sense of urgency. But his attempt to shift the corporate culture didn’t succeed. OSHA found 700 safety violations at the Texas refinery in 2009, more than twice the 300 found in 2005, and more than tripled the fine it imposed. Then came the Gulf oil disaster. Having a culture that accepted higher risk for higher rewards, the company ignored some of the early signals of the dangers of deepwater drilling. In 2005 BP’s Thunder Horse production platform in the Gulf experienced equipment problems that required high repair costs and set back production for three years. Subsequently the company rushed the Deepwater Horizon well into production, ignoring danger signals especially related to the blowout preventer, which Tony Hayward now acknowledges must be totally redesigned. At the same time the Minerals Management Service of the Interior Department failed to inspect equipment, withhold approvals or implement its own recommendations of 2001 and 2003–which might turn out to be a saving grace for BP when it confronts legal liabilities in the future. Looking at crucial steps BP has taken in crisis management since the oil rig explosion and fire, you see a more mixed story. Most notable cases of crisis management are either totally mishandled ( Occidental Petroleum and Love Canal, AH Robbins and the intrauterine device, Firestone and tires) or handled extremely well ( Johnson & Johnson and Tylenol, Abbott Labs and infant formula). The BP case is unusual because it’s not as clear-cut: Investigating the Facts Although BP ignored crucial facts and warnings from workers in the pre-crisis stage, it has since then been conscientious in ascertaining the causes of the disaster. The complete story is not yet in, and public authorities are conducting their own studies. As the company’s new CEO, Robert Dudley, admits, “It’s complicated.” Portraying the Problem BP initially underestimated the scope and severity of the spill by stating a low amount of leaking oil and by comparing the relative size of the leak with the vast expanse of the ocean. Yet Hayward has been partially vindicated by the evaporation or absorption of much of the oil. The perception created by the media can often be more powerful than reality. BP should have avoided citing a specific number and simply admitted that the disaster was very big. Accepting Responsibility BP has apologized many times over and taken responsibility. However, given the number of partners and contractors involved, it has not assumed legal culpability and liability, and it cannot. It has taken the lion’s share of responsibility for the cleanup of the Gulf, which may help restore some of its credibility. Responding to the Government and to its Critics Whatever irritation they may have felt, BP officials have not lashed out publicly at either officials or investigations. They have not been confrontational with their critics. Both Hayward and Dudley have reportedly cooperated fully with state and federal government officials, especially on cleanup efforts, though Hayward obviously didn’t fare well in Congressional hearings. Some environmental groups have launched tepid and likely ineffective boycotts against BP, and the company has neither condemned nor spent much effort cooperating with the activities of non-governmental organizations. BP has opposed the drilling moratorium, but it has been joined by every other oil company on that issue. All in all BP has a mixed to positive record with this dimension of crisis management. Adopting New Policies For the third time since 2005 BP has again announced safety as its top priority and pledged a shift in its culture to ensure that that promise will be implemented. The public awaits results. A coalition of four other major oil companies has just announced another positive industry response, an initiative on safe drilling. BP has adjusted its strategy, but with no dramatic departures, selling assets in other geographic areas while maintaining its presence in the Gulf and its commitment to deep-water drilling. Instituting New Procedures As a byproduct of the BP crisis, ExxonMobil’s improved safety record since the Valdez oil spill is winning belated praise. BP needs to replicate that experience, through both organizational and technological improvements, if it is to gain respect and credibility. That performance will be the ultimate test of BP’s crisis response. Political Tactics BP recruited the Brunswick Group as its chief consultant in handling crisis management. It also retained several lobbying firms with connections to both sides of the political aisle in Washington and has stayed active in funding political candidates. Those are all conventional tactics. It must avoid being defensive or reactive, too. It must mend fences within its own industry and build a broad-based coalition with stakeholders, including selected non-governmental organizations and shareholder activists. Its leadership and advertising of the Gulf cleanup effort may help it build bridges with stakeholders, even as some politicians complain about its public-relations efforts and expenses. Litigation No matter how BP fares with all the dimensions of crisis management mentioned above, litigation may be the most critical. It will determine the price BP pays for its pre-crisis failures. The company has set aside more than 32 billion to cover penalties and litigation, including the 20 billion escrow fund administered by Kenneth Feinberg. Some experts project up to 100 billion in legal judgments ultimately. Given that the company has 260 billion in assets, the prevailing opinion is that it may survive without going into bankruptcy. But if it is found liable based on gross negligence, then the lid comes off and no projections can be made; there could potentially be huge punitive damages. BP denies that it has been negligent, but even Anadarko, its partner in the Deepwater Horizon, has accused it of gross negligence, wanting to minimize its own potential liability. What may ultimately most help BP as a defense in its several lawsuits is the negligence of the key regulator, the Minerals Management Service. That scandal-ridden agency, rife with conflicts of interest, was notably lax in its performance. BP can maintain that it did exactly what the agency ordered or allowed it to do. Critics who see BP as forever stained by the Gulf oil disaster might note the improved safety record of Exxon Mobil. A corporate reputation may take a long time to rebuild, but it can be done. And while the public perception of BP’s crisis management may be negative, the reality of what the company has done is much different. John M. Holcomb is a professor of business ethics and legal studies at the Daniels College of Business of the University of Denver. Comments are turned off for this post.

This July, they'll find out how he dies. \\"Life With Archie\\" #36 hits stores on July 16, and CNN can reveal exclusively that it tells the story of how Archie sacrifices himself to save a friend. Few details are known, but it seems fitting that Archie would go out a hero. The 37th issue one week later will end the series. The \\"Life With Archie\\" series has been telling the stories of possible future Archie scenarios for the past few years, and so Archie will continue to be alive in the comics set in the present day. JUST WATCHED 'Archie' slated for a violent death Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH 'Archie' slated for a violent death 00:10 CNN spoke with Archie Comics CEO Jon Goldwater (son of Archie creator John Goldwater) about the upcoming issues. CNN: Can you explain the \\"Life With Archie\\" series for the uninitiated? Goldwater: \\"Life With Archie\\" is Archie's future -- it gives readers a look into what his life would be like after high school and college, which has never really been explored. Most fans are familiar with Archie as a high schooler, hanging out at Pop's Chocklit Shop with his friends. \\"Life With Archie\\" shows what happens when Archie becomes an adult and starts dealing with grownup issues. Each issue is normally split into two storylines -- one telling a tale of Archie married to Veronica another with him ending up with Betty. The final issue, however, will show readers Archie's final fate in both timelines -- and they're the same. CNN: Why kill Archie? Goldwater: I think it's the natural conclusion to the \\"Life With Archie\\" series. Archie dies as he lived -- heroically. He dies saving the life of a friend, and does it in his usual selfless way. Archie has always been a representation of us -- the best of us. Our strengths and our faults. Writer Paul Kupperberg, with input from myself, has crafted an emotional, impactful and classic story that I know will survive the test of time. This isn't a random one-off or \\"what-if\\" story that we're doing as a gag. This is the story that we mapped out carefully and with much thought. This is the death of Archie as we see it, and we're treating it with that same level of gravitas and import. It's a once-in-a-lifetime event, and we are being very considerate about it. CNN: What are you hoping to accomplish with this storyline? Goldwater: First and foremost, like with anything we do at Archie, we want to tell a great, memorable story. That being said, this story in particular is of the utmost importance to us as a company and as a keeper of the Archie brand. We want to not only show how Archie's life ends, but also what he means to the world around him. We want to celebrate his life. After the events of \\"Life With Archie\\" #36, fans will leap forward a year to see the aftermath, and how his friends have moved on since his surprising death. What's Jughead doing? How are Betty and Veronica dealing with the loss? It's not about the attention-grab of the death but about telling a great, evocative story that reminds people why this character is important to the fabric of pop culture -- and showing how heroic a normal guy like Archie can be, and how important it is to realize that. This isn't a story we're going to retcon a few weeks from now. This happened. This is the conclusion to the \\"Life With Archie\\" story and timeline, and it will allow us as a company and the world to take a moment to look at Archie's life as a whole and recognize him as one of the most important characters -- not in just comics -- but in popular culture. We want people to feel the same emotional roller coaster we felt putting this story together -- to feel the range of emotions, from happiness, sadness, anger, joy and pride. We want people to react to this in a strong way because Archie is so important to them. CNN: How do you hope fans will react ultimately? Goldwater: We expect some level of shock, outrage and surprise -- followed by understanding. As a company, we are not afraid to take risks. We're not scared to shake things up to draw attention to the great stories we're building here at Archie. I hope fans will be intrigued by this news, pick up the issues in July and realize they've been given one of the best comics on the stands. They'll be handed a piece of comic book history, featuring some of the most well-known characters in the world saying goodbye to an icon. We want fans to talk about this for years to come. We think this story is bigger than anything we've ever done -- it's bold, dramatic and best of all, a fitting end to the life of Archie. CNN: What do you think Archie Comics has been doing by shaking things up over the recent years? Archie: We're a sleeping giant. Years ago, before I stepped in as CEO, Archie was seen as a dormant, nostalgia brand stuck in amber. We were in suspended animation. People thought the stories were still set in the '50s! Now, while the characters -- like Betty, Archie, Veronica, Jughead and Reggie -- are at their core the same, Riverdale has changed. It's caught up with the times. The town of Riverdale you read about now is like any other in America. It's diverse, it's not problem-free, and it represents America in an honest way. Archie is about being welcoming, diverse and entertaining. We've managed to strike that balance in our storytelling for the last five years and managed to not only get attention, but keep people entertained. From the introduction of Kevin Keller, the first regular gay character in comics to now, the death of Archie, we've not been afraid to take risks. The big thing is, though, our risks pay off because the stories, art and execution are spot-on. We back up what we say. CNN: What will be the long-term impact of this story? Goldwater: Well, this is the end. This is how Archie dies in the pages of \\"Life With Archie.\\" We will not be retconning, reversing or backtracking on this story in terms of \\"Life With Archie.\\" The main Archie line, however, telling stories of Archie in high school, will continue. \\"Afterlife With Archie\\" [the \\"Archie\\" zombie series] will continue, and we will keep on taking risks with different and new interpretations of our characters. But as far as we see it, this is how Archie dies. That's how we approached this story and how we're treating it. ||||| It breaks my heart a little to learn that Archie Andrews, the freckle-faced teenager who has graced comic books since 1941, is going to die. At least temporarily. In an event comic book that seems inspired by his constantly resurrecting superhero peers, Archie Comics will kill off its hero to end the “Life With Archie” series, which flash-forwarded into different versions of Archie’s future as an adult. (Credit: Courtesy of Archie Comics) “Archie dies as he lived — heroically,” Archie Comics CEO Jon Goldwater told the New York Post. “He dies saving the life of a friend and does it in his usual selfless way. Archie has always been a representation of us — the best of us. Our strengths and our faults.” But part of what has been best about Archie Comics is the way it has tended to avoid the sorts of escalating stakes that characterize superhero comics (even when the Punisher showed up in Riverdale, no one got whacked). As Archie Comics let its titular redhead grow up enough to explore what his life might be like had he married Betty Cooper or Veronica Lodge, Archie Andrews remained a kind of forerunner to “How I Met Your Mother” main character Ted Mosby (Josh Radnor). Precisely because the stakes in Archie’s life were so low, the comics could focus on his quest for true love without making the question of which girl Archie might pick seem silly. The choice between what Michael Chabon described in “The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay” as “the two big-toothed, wasp-waisted goddess-girls, light and dark, entangled forever in the enmity of their friendship” is easy to caricature as average and rich, nice and mean, tomboyish and feminine. But Betty and Veronica represent two competing visions of the American dream that Archie must choose between. Is he aiming for middle-class security with Betty, and a lifestyle they can support on relatively modest careers? Or does Archie truly want to leap classes and try to fit with Veronica and the Lodge family, who are convinced that their wealth is their due? Archie Comics complicated this choice over time, introducing Cheryl Blossom, who was even richer than Veronica, as a potential love interest for Archie and breaking with its past discomfort about interracial dating and telling a story in which Archie marries fellow musician Valerie Brown and has a daughter with her. But whomever Archie paired up with and how we got there, the Archie comics have always been a story that treated decisions about courtship and dating as if they were serious and consequential. Their counterparts in the world of superhero comics may have garnered critical respect and political attention on the big screen by tackling issues like use of drones and the privatization of military equipment. But as Matt Zoller Seitz pointed out in his review of “Man of Steel” last year, “virtually alone among big-name superheroes, [Superman is] a romantically and sexually mature man who seems to like and be comfortable around women.” We all know that Archie Andrews’s preternaturally extended teenage years are a fantasy. But making the comics, however temporarily, about death rather than life, turns away from the franchise’s core purpose. Superhero and crime comics teach us about all the ways we can die. Archie Andrews, in all his bumbling, indecisive, lovelorn foolishness, has always been a character who taught us how we want to live. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","response":"In the upcoming issue of \\"Life With Archie,\\" the comic book character Archie Andrews will die as a hero, sacrificing himself to save a friend.

With their departure, the Texian army controlled the Gulf Coast, forcing Mexican commanders to send all communication with the Mexican interior overland. The slower land journey left Cos unable to quickly request or receive reinforcements or supplies.On their return to Goliad, Westover's group encountered Governor Viesca. After being freed by sympathetic soldiers, Viesca had immediately traveled to Texas to recreate the state government. Dimmitt welcomed Viesca but refused to recognize his authority as governor. This caused an uproar in the garrison, as many supported the governor. Dimmitt declared martial law and soon alienated most of the local residents.

More generally, however, in (modern) physics, matter is not a fundamental concept because a universal definition of it is elusive: elementary constituents of atoms may not take up space individually, and massless particles may be composed to form objects that have mass (even when at rest). - The Hale Telescope is a , 3.3 reflecting telescope at the Palomar Observatory in California, US, named after astronomer George Ellery Hale. With funding from the Rockefeller Foundation, he orchestrated the planning, design, and construction of the observatory, but did not live to see its commissioning. The \\"Hale\\" was groundbreaking for its time, with double the diameter of the next largest telescope and pioneering the use of many technologies such as vapor deposited aluminum and low thermal expansion glass. It is still in active use. - Frequency is the number of occurrences of a repeating event per unit time. It is also referred to as temporal frequency, which emphasizes the contrast to spatial frequency and angular frequency. The period is the duration of time of one cycle in a repeating event, so the period is the reciprocal of the frequency. For example, if a newborn baby's heart beats at a frequency of 120 times a minute, its periodthe time interval between beatsis half a second (that is, 60 seconds divided by 120 beats). Frequency is an important parameter used in science and engineering to specify the rate of oscillatory and vibratory phenomena, such as mechanical vibrations, audio (sound) signals, radio waves, and light. - Arizona (O'odham: \\"Al onak\\" [ai onak]) is a state in the southwestern region of the United States.

The state also has the nation's most populous county, Los Angeles County, and its largest county by area, San Bernardino County. - A reflecting telescope (also called a reflector) is an optical telescope which uses a single or combination of curved mirrors that reflect light and form an image. The reflecting telescope was invented in the 17th century as an alternative to the refracting telescope which, at that time, was a design that suffered from severe chromatic aberration. Although reflecting telescopes produce other types of optical aberrations, it is a design that allows for very large diameter objectives. Almost all of the major telescopes used in astronomy research are reflectors. Reflecting telescopes come in many design variations and may employ extra optical elements to improve image quality or place the image in a mechanically advantageous position. Since reflecting telescopes use mirrors, the design is sometimes referred to as a \\"catoptric\\" telescope. - The Ivy League is a collegiate athletic conference comprising sports teams from eight private institutions of higher education in the Northeastern United States.

Artist C. C. Beck and writer Bill Parker created the character in 1939. Captain Marvel first appeared in Whiz Comics #2 (cover-dated Feb. 1940), published by Fawcett Comics. The first post-Crisis appearance of Captain Marvel was in the 1986 Legends miniseries. In 1987, Captain Marvel appeared as a member of the Justice League in Keith Giffen's and J. M. DeMatteis' relaunch of that title. That same year (spinning off from Legends), he was given his own miniseries titled Shazam!: The New Beginning. With this four-issue miniseries, writers Roy and Dann Thomas and artist Tom Mandrake attempted to re-launch the Captain Marvel mythos and bring the wizard Shazam, Dr. Sivana, Uncle Dudley, and Black Adam into the modern DC Universe with an altered origin story. Roy Thomas, a veteran comic book writer and editor, had been lured from Marvel Comics to DC in 1981 with the specific contractual obligation that he would become the main writer of Shazam! and the Justice Society of America characters. Before the Crisis, Thomas wrote several of the DC Comics Presents stories featuring the Marvel Family. The most notable change that the Thomases, Giffen, and DeMatteis introduced into the Captain Marvel mythos was that the personality of young Billy Batson is retained when he transforms into the Captain. This change would remain for most future uses of the character as justification for his sunny, Golden-Age personality in the darker modern-day comic book world, instead of the traditional depiction used prior to 1986, which tended to treat Captain Marvel and Billy as two separate personalities. This revised version of Captain Marvel also appeared in one story-arc featured in the short-lived anthology Action Comics Weekly #623-626 (October 25, 1988 - November 15, 1988), in which a Neo-Nazi version of Captain Mazi was introduced. At the end of the arc, it was announced that this would lead to a new Shazam! ongoing series. Though New Beginning had sold well and multiple artists were assigned to and worked on the book, it never saw publication due to editorial disputes between DC Comics and Roy Thomas. As a result, Thomas' intended revival of the Marvel Family with a new punk-styled Mary Bromfield/Mary Marvel (aka \\"Spike\\") who was not Billy's sister, and an African-American take on Freddy Freeman/Captain Marvel Jr., did not see print. Thomas departed DC in 1989, not long after his removal from the Shazam! project. Other attempts at reviving Shazam! were initiated over the next three years, including a reboot project by John Byrne, illustrator of Legends and writer/artist on the Superman reboot miniseries The Man of Steel (1986). None of these versions saw print, though Captain Marvel, the Wizard Shazam, and Black Adam did appear in DC's War of the Gods miniseries in 1991. By this time, DC had finally ceased the fee-per-use licensing agreement with Fawcett Publications and purchased the full rights to Captain Marvel and the other Fawcett Comics characters.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What else happen in the 1980s","response":"The article does not provide any other specific information about what happened in the 1980s related to Captain Marvel/Shazam or any other events.

The military says at least 12 people were on board the C-130 Hercules, which crashed just minutes after taking off from an air force base outside Medan, where the pilot told the control tower he was suffering engine trouble, reports the AP. The news agency notes that 143 people died in the city a decade ago when a Mandala Airlines Boeing 737 crashed into a residential neighborhood.","response":"Title: Indonesian Military Transport Plane Crashes into Neighborhood, Kills At Least 30 Introduction At least 30 people were killed when an Indonesian military transport plane crashed into a residential neighborhood in one of the country's biggest cities, Medan. The C-130 Hercules, carrying at least 12 people on board, crashed just minutes after taking off from an air force base outside of Medan. Officials say the death toll could potentially rise as the investigation continues. The Crash The crash occurred when the pilot of the C-130 Hercules reported engine trouble to the control tower just minutes after taking off from an air force base near Medan. According to the Associated Press, witnesses described the plane as \\"wobbling\\" and \\"swaying\\" before it came down in a crowded residential neighborhood. Rescue and recovery efforts have been ongoing, with first responders working to search for survivors in the wreckage. The majority of those killed in the crash were reportedly civilians who were on the ground in the densely populated residential area. This is not the first time a tragic plane crash has occurred in Medan. In 2005, a Mandala Airlines Boeing 737 crashed into a residential neighborhood in the city, killing 143 people. Response to the Crash Immediately following the crash, emergency responders rushed to the scene to assist in rescue efforts and evacuate those affected by the disaster. The Indonesian military has been cooperating with local officials and aiding in the rescue, recovery, and investigation process. Indonesian President Joko Widodo has expressed condolences for those killed in the crash and has called for a thorough investigation into the cause of the accident. The president has also urged officials to ensure that every effort is made to prevent similar crashes in the future. Investigation The cause of the crash is still unknown, and officials are working to determine what led the military transport plane to go down. A full investigation, including a review of the plane's maintenance records and an examination of the wreckage, is underway. While the results of the investigation are yet to be released, experts have already started speculating about the potential causes of the crash. Some believe that the age and condition of the military transport plane could have been factors in the accident. Conclusion The tragic crash of the C-130 Hercules in Medan has highlighted concerns regarding the safety of Indonesia's air travel. As the death toll continues to rise, and the investigation into the cause of the accident progresses, the Indonesian government is under growing pressure to address possible safety issues in its military and civilian aviation sectors. The loss of lives in this latest incident serves as a stark reminder of the consequences of inadequate safety measures in aviation. As the investigation continues, the Indonesian government must take every step possible to ensure that similar tragedies are prevented in the future."},{"question":"Data: Alimentum eatType restaurant; Alimentum food Japanese; Alimentum priceRange moderate; Alimentum customer rating average; Alimentum area riverside; Alimentum near Yippee Noodle Bar What would a sentence about this data be like?","response":"Alimentum is a restaurant that serves yummy Japanese food at a not too expensive price, has an okay rating from people who eat there, is located by a pretty river, and is close to another place called Yippee Noodle Bar."},{"question":"Write some highlights for the following article: Lewis Hamilton is adamant his situation and mindset have not changed now he is again leading the Formula One World Championship. So long the hunter over the course of the current campaign, Hamilton is back in front for only the second time this season in the wake of the events in Sunday's Singapore Grand Prix. After bitter rival and Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg retired after 14 laps following a wiring loom failure in the steering column of his car, Hamilton went on to take the chequered flag. Lewis Hamilton dominated in Singapore to take a lead in the championship over teammate Nico Rosberg. The 29-year-old now has a three-point lead going into the final five races of the season, starting with next weekend's race in Japan, and followed swiftly a week later by the inaugural Russian Grand Prix. But despite the man now being hunted, Hamilton said: 'Nothing changes. 'I have believed, since the time I started training for this season, that I can win the world championship this year. 'And with a great car like this, even with some of the difficulties I've had, you know you are still within shooting range. 'You have to keep that positivity, belief and hope - hope is one of the most powerful things in the world - and I carry that with me each weekend. The Brit says he was always positive and won't change his mindset now he leads the way. 'I haven't lost that vision or that dream, that's still there, and I didn't leave Singapore thinking the title is more of a possibility.

Hannah comes home from work to find her older son taped her younger son to a chair with 22 strands of duct tape. If Hannah can cut 8 strands per minute and her son can cut 3 strands per minute, how long will it take them to free her younger son? What is the step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the answer: 2?","response":"Step 1: Identify the given information: - Hannah can cut 8 strands of duct tape per minute. - Her son can cut 3 strands of duct tape per minute. - There are 22 strands of duct tape in total. Step 2: Determine the combined rate at which Hannah and her son can cut the strands. - Add the number of strands Hannah can cut per minute to the number of strands her son can cut per minute. - 8 strands (Hannah) + 3 strands (son) = 11 strands per minute. Step 3: Calculate the time it will take for both of them to cut the 22 strands. - To do this, we will divide the total number of strands by their combined rate. - 22 strands ÷ 11 strands per minute = 2 minutes.

Four overlapping ecological regions have been identified on the Table Rocks, with considerable differences in the variety of wildlife found in each. From the outermost base of the rocks, three regions consisting of oak savanna, chaparral, and mixed woodland surround the relatively flat tops. The andesite cap is covered by the fourth region, mounded prairie. This region formed when the caps were slowly eroded by the freezing and thawing of water that seeped into the ground (ice erosion), which created layers of mounded soil. Vernal pools fill in from October to June in the mounded prairie area due to the andesite's impermeability. The pools support species of plants and animals. Over 340 species of plants grow on the rocks, including approximately 200 species of wildflowers. Some of the most common wildflowers are western buttercups, desert parsley, bicolor lupine, and California goldfields. Camas and death camas also grow on the rocks. Camas produces an edible bulb, while death camas is poisonous and was used by the Takelma as an anesthetic.More than 70 species of animals are known to live on the Table Rocks. Lizards such as the western fence lizard, southern alligator lizard, and western skink have been seen in all four regions of the Table Rocks. Western rattlesnakes and two species of garter snakes also live in all regions. Black-tailed deer, coyotes, and bobcats are some of the mammals that live on the Table Rocks. The rocks are also home to western black-legged ticks, although they are mainly found in the chaparral region. Many species of birds live on the rocks.The Table Rocks experience a Mediterranean climate. The average wind speed in the area is less than 6 miles per hour (10 km/h), and the annual precipitation is approximately 18 inches (460 mm) due to the rain shadow created by the Klamath Mountains. It rarely snows in the winter.

They do this by looking at something called \\"communications data.\\" This is the information about who someone is talking to, like a friend or a family member, on the phone or computer. A group called Big Brother Watch - they watch what's happening and tell us if we need to know about it - has shared some exciting news. Over three years, the police in Britain, which is a country far away from here, asked to look at communications data 733,237 times! That's a big number, like the number of jellybeans in a huge jar. Why do you think they wanted to look at all that data? It's because they were trying to catch bad guys and protect people, like you and me.

Size 14 envelopes measure 5\\" x 11.5\\" and are considered the standard size. They will be rectangular in shape and will often be sold in packages at your local post office. You can also mail a letter in an envelope that is smaller than a size 14, such as a size 10 envelope (4.125\\" x 9.5\\"), with a regular stamp. If possible, fold your letter so it fits in a standard rectangular envelope, as this may cut down on the price of postage. Envelopes larger than size 14 are considered large envelopes, or flats, and will be more expensive to mail. Card sized envelopes, made for small greeting cards or wedding invitations, will also likely have additional postage fees. This is because pieces of mail that have an odd shape or are square shaped and made of rigid card can jam mail processing machines and need to be processed separately. You can do this at the post office or on a small office scale. The weight and size of your letter (plus the envelope) will affect the price of postage, or how much you will pay for a stamp. Often, the heavier the letter is, the higher the price of postage will be. Letters in a standard envelope that weigh less than 13 ounces can be sent via First Class Mail at one flat rate. Letters in a standard envelope that weigh more than 13 ounces will be upgraded to Priority Class Mail, and the price for postage will be more than the flat rate. There are three basic levels of mail, according to the US Post Office. First Class Mail is often what is used to send letter-size pieces that are rigid and square. To send a letter First-Class, it must weigh no more than 13 ounces. The price for sending First Class Mail is the same, regardless of the distance the letter is traveling. The arrival time for First Class Mail is two to three days for destinations within the U.S. Sending mail First Class is ideal for a single letter as all you need is a standard stamp and access to a post box. Priority Mail is ideal if you want your letter to get to the addressee by the following business day. To send a letter by Priority Mail, it must weigh no more than 70 pounds. At the post office, you can add on extra services to your Priority Mail item, such as USPS Tracking and Registered Mail, especially if your letter contains legal or sensitive information that must reach its destination. The price of Priority Mail postage is based on the distance the mail must travel; the further the distance, the more you will pay for postage. This is broken down by nine “zones”. For example, “Zone 1” is local, or the area close to you, and “Zone 9” is the furthest distance away from your location. Standard Mail is used for larger quantities of mail, at least 200 pieces or 50 pounds of mail at one time. Envelopes must weight less than 16 ounces. Large envelopes, also called flats, cost more than letters. People use Standard Mail to send flyers, advertising documents, newsletters, catalogs, and bulletins. You can only send domestic mail by Standard Mail and you cannot send one single envelope through Standard Mail. What is a summary of what this article is about?","response":"The article discusses different types of envelopes, their sizes, and the corresponding postage fees based on various factors such as weight, shape, and destination. It highlights the three basic levels of mail according to the US Post Office: First Class Mail, Priority Mail, and Standard Mail, describing their weight limitations, pricing, and use cases. The article also emphasizes that odd-shaped or larger envelopes may incur additional postage fees due to their potential to jam mail processing machines.

Assuming that: In erosion, a slower moving stream will only carry smaller particles. A:","response":"To answer the question, we need to analyze the relationship between the speed of a stream and the size of particles it can carry. Step 1: Understanding the concepts of erosion and sediment transport Erosion is the process by which soil, rock, or other materials are removed from a location due to forces like water, wind, and ice. In the case of a stream, the water's flow can erode materials from the surrounding environment and carry them downstream. Step 2: Evaluating the effect of stream speed on particle size A fast-moving stream is more capable of carrying larger particles. This is because the increased energy and momentum allow it to move more massive objects along its course. As the stream slows down, its carrying capacity for larger particles decreases, and it becomes more difficult for it to transport these materials downstream. As a result, slower-moving streams are more likely to carry smaller particles, while faster-moving streams are more capable of carrying both larger and smaller particles. So, based on our analysis: A slow-moving stream is capable of carrying smaller particles than a fast-moving stream, as the carrying capacity for larger particles decreases with a decrease in stream speed."},{"question":"If In recent years, many of those hotels have been urgently updating their design and services, as even more hotels are being built in the zona turista., can we conclude that \\"Many of the hotels have been updating their design and services to include spas.\\"?

Retail, transport and educational infrastructure are centred on Wrexham, Rhyl, Colwyn Bay, Llandudno and Bangor. It is bordered to the south by the counties of Ceredigion and Powys in Mid Wales, and to the east by the counties of Shropshire in the West Midlands and Cheshire in North West England. - Gwynedd is an area in north-west Wales, named after the old Kingdom of Gwynedd. As a local government area, it is the second biggest in Wales in terms of geographical area and also one of the most sparsely populated. A majority of the population are Welsh-speaking. The name Gwynedd is also used for a preserved county, covering the two local government areas of Gwynedd and the Isle of Anglesey. Culturally and historically, the name can also be used for most of North Wales (for instance, the area covered by the Gwynedd Constabulary), roughly corresponding to the territory of the Kingdom of Gwynedd at its greatest extent. The current area is 2,548 square km (983.78 sq miles, slightly smaller than Luxembourg) with a population as measured in the 2011 Census of 121,874. - Publius (or Gaius) Cornelius Tacitus (c. AD 56 c. AD 120) was a senator and an historian of the Roman Empire. The surviving portions of his two major worksthe \\"Annals\\" and the \\"Histories\\"examine the reigns of the Roman emperors Tiberius, Claudius, Nero, and those who reigned in the Year of the Four Emperors (AD 69). These two works span the history of the Roman Empire from the death of Augustus, in AD 14, to the years of the First JewishRoman War, in AD 70. There are substantial lacunae in the surviving texts, including a gap in the \\"Annals\\" that is four books long. - In the United Kingdom, a scheduled monument is a 'nationally important' archaeological site or historic building, given protection against unauthorised change. - Tomen y Mur is a Roman fort complex in Gwynedd , Wales . The fort was constructed under governor Gnaeus Julius Agricola in AD 78 , and was abandoned around AD 140 . A millennium later , in the Norman period , the site was reoccupied and refortified with a motte within the old walls . It is a scheduled monument in the care of Snowdonia National Park Authority . - The Principality or Kingdom of Gwynedd (Medieval Latin: \\"Venedotia\\" or \\"Norwallia\\"; Middle Welsh: \\"Guynet\\",) was one of several successor states to the Roman Empire that emerged in sub-Roman Britain in the 5th century during the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain. - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - Wales is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and the island of Great Britain. It is bordered by England to the east, the Irish Sea to the north and west, and the Bristol Channel to the south. It had a population in 2011 of 3,063,456 and has a total area of . Wales has over of coastline and is largely mountainous, with its higher peaks in the north and central areas, including Snowdon, its highest summit. The country lies within the north temperate zone and has a changeable, maritime climate. - An archaeological site is a place (or group of physical sites) in which evidence of past activity is preserved (either prehistoric or historic or contemporary), and which has been, or may be, investigated using the discipline of archaeology and represents a part of the archaeological record. Sites may range from those with few or no remains visible above ground, to buildings and other structures still in use. - Gwynedd Constabulary was the Home Office police force for the counties of Caernarfonshire, Anglesey and Merionethshire, Wales. - Gnaeus Julius Agricola (13 June 40 23 August 93) was a Gallo-Roman general responsible for much of the Roman conquest of Britain. Written by his son-in-law Tacitus, the \\"De vita et moribus Iulii Agricolae\\" is the primary source for most of what is known about him, along with detailed archaeological evidence from northern Britain. - The Roman conquest of Britain was a gradual process, beginning effectively in AD 43 under Emperor Claudius, whose general Aulus Plautius served as first governor of Roman Britain. Great Britain had already frequently been the target of invasions, planned and actual, by forces of the Roman Republic and Roman Empire. In common with other regions on the edge of the empire, Britain had enjoyed diplomatic and trading links with the Romans in the century since Julius Caesar's expeditions in 55 and 54 BC, and Roman economic and cultural influence was a significant part of the British late pre-Roman Iron Age, especially in the south. - Luxembourg, officially the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, is a landlocked country in western Europe. It is bordered by Belgium to the west and north, Germany to the east, and France to the south. Its capital, Luxembourg City, is, together with Brussels and Strasbourg, one of the three official capitals of the European Union and the seat of the European Court of Justice, the highest juridical authority in the EU. Its culture, people and languages are highly intertwined with its neighbors, making it essentially a mixture of French and Germanic cultures. The repeated invasions by its neighbor countries, especially in World War II, resulted in the country's strong will for mediation between France and Germany and led to the foundation of the European Union. What is the relationship between 'tomen y mur' and 'archaeological site'? Answer:","response":"Tomen y Mur and archaeological site share a relationship in that Tomen y Mur is an archaeological site itself. By definition, an archaeological site is a location where evidence of past human activity is preserved and investigated using the discipline of archaeology. In this case, Tomen y Mur is a Roman fort complex located in Gwynedd, North Wales, and showcases preserved remnants of historical significance from different periods in history. Constructed under the Roman governor Gnaeus Julius Agricola in AD 78, Tomen y Mur was abandoned around AD 140 but later reoccupied during the Norman period and refortified with a motte within the old Roman walls. As a scheduled monument under the care of Snowdonia National Park Authority, Tomen y Mur serves as an important archaeological site providing insight into the Roman and Norman occupations in the region. Archaeological sites such as Tomen y Mur contribute to our understanding of past societies, their cultures, and historical events. By studying the physical remains at these sites, archaeologists are able to piece together information about the people who lived there, their beliefs, social structures, and interactions with neighboring communities. In summary, the relationship between Tomen y Mur and archaeological site is characterized by Tomen y Mur being a prime example of such a site, where its historical remains serve as a testament to the Roman and Norman influence in North Wales and offer valuable insights into their respective societies and the transformation of the landscape over time."},{"question":"Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: In 1991, while riding his bike through the woods, a young boy spots a woman darting between the trees.

But a rigorous new experiment in Oregon has raised questions about that assumption, finding that newly insured people actually went to the emergency room a good deal more often. The study, published in the journal Science, compared thousands of low-income people in the Portland area who were randomly selected in a 2008 lottery to get Medicaid coverage with people who entered the lottery but remained uninsured. Those who gained coverage made 40 percent more visits to the emergency room than their uninsured counterparts during their first 18 months with insurance. The pattern was so strong that it held true across most demographic groups, times of day and types of visits, including those for conditions that were treatable in primary care settings. The findings cast doubt on the hope that expanded insurance coverage will help rein in emergency room costs just as more than two million people are gaining coverage under the Affordable Care Act. And they go against one of the central arguments of the law’s supporters, that extending insurance to large numbers of Americans would reduce emergency room use, and eventually save money. In remarks in New Mexico in 2009, Mr. Obama said: “I think that it’s very important that we provide coverage for all people because if everybody’s got coverage, then they’re not going to the emergency room for treatment.” The study suggests that the surge in the numbers of insured people may put even greater pressure on emergency rooms, at least in the short term. Nearly 25 million uninsured Americans could gain coverage under the law, about half of them through Medicaid. The first policies took effect on Wednesday. “I suspect that the finding will be surprising to many in the policy debate,” said Katherine Baicker, an economist at Harvard University’s School of Public Health and one of the authors of the study. Advertisement Continue reading the main story An administration spokeswoman, Tara McGuinness, said that the time frame was too short to expect much of a change, and that over the longer term, use would most likely decline. She pointed to a longer-term study in Massachusetts, which expanded coverage for its residents in 2006, that found an 8 percent decline in emergency department use over a period of several years. “Medicaid saves lives and improves health outcomes,” Ms. McGuinness said. “Plenty of studies show that.” But many economists say that the emphasis on emergency room use, both in policy and in political speeches, is misplaced, as it makes up only a small part of health care costs in the United States. A federal government health survey found that emergency departments accounted for about 4 percent of total health spending in 2010, far less than inpatient hospital visits, which accounted for about 31 percent. Certain populations, however, like low-income people with chronic illnesses, have much higher rates of use. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Advertisement Continue reading the main story Dr. Baicker and Amy Finkelstein, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, another author, said the increased use of emergency rooms is driven by a basic economic principle: When services get less expensive, people use them more. Previous studies have found that uninsured people face substantial out-of-pocket costs that can put them in debt when they go to the emergency room. Medicaid reduces those costs. Medicaid coverage also reduces the costs of going to a primary care doctor, and a previous analysis of data from the Oregon experiment found that such visits also increased substantially. “This is just one piece of an increase we found across every type of care,” said Bill J. Wright, an author of the new study who is the associate director of the Center for Outcomes Research and Education in Portland, a part of Providence Health and Services, a large health care provider. The study’s authors emphasized that Medicaid had many benefits. Previous analyses from the experiment found that gaining coverage reduced the incidence of depression and increased feelings of financial stability. The study drew on data from the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment that included about 90,000 low-income Oregonians and randomly assigned about 30,000 of them access to Medicaid. Health experts say the experiment’s design — random assignment of coverage through a lottery — allowed them to isolate and evaluate the effects of the program. Such designs are the gold standard in medical research, but are rarely used for domestic health care policy. Some experts noted that the study measured only the first 18 months after people gained coverage, and that old habits of relying on the emergency room are often hard to shake. It also takes time to find a primary care doctor and make an appointment. “How to use a plan and when to seek emergency department care involves a learning curve that doesn’t happen overnight,” said Sara Rosenbaum, a health researcher at George Washington University who was not involved in the study. Amitabh Chandra, a professor and director of health policy research at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, said people may often use the emergency room because they need its services. Medicine has become increasingly complex, with teams of specialists using highly sophisticated equipment for treatments that often go beyond the capabilities of the family doctor. “We often say, ‘If this person had just received preventative care at a doctor’s office, we would not have seen emergency room use,' ” said Dr. Chandra, who was not involved in the study. “But there is only so much that prevention can do.” Professor Rosenbaum pointed out that a lot of the recent growth in emergency department use has been among the privately insured people, not the uninsured. She said insurers often recommend going to the emergency room for quick specialty care, like for stomach pain. Dr. Wright said that many participants in Oregon were already connected to a primary care doctor, and that it was unlikely that the rise in use had much to do with a lack of access to a physician. The study’s lesson, he said, was that new coverage needed to be accompanied by broader changes to the way care was delivered, like those in Oregon and under Mr. Obama’s new law. Heidi Allen, an assistant professor at Columbia University and an author of the study, said much of the non-urgent emergency department use among patients she interviewed happened because those patients could not get same-day appointments with their primary care doctors. Dr. Chandra, who helped conduct another analysis of emergency department use in Massachusetts after the overhaul, called the Oregon study, with its strong design and clear result, “breathtaking.” In contrast, studies from Massachusetts have come up with conflicting findings. His study, for example, found that emergency room use did not change. “You would conclude what you wanted to conclude depending on which side of political aisle you were on,” he said, adding, “Now we have an answer.” ||||| As the health-care law expands Medicaid to cover millions more Americans, a new Harvard University study finds that enrollment in public program significantly increases enrollees' use of emergency departments. The research, published Thursday in the journal Science, showed a 40 percent increase in emergency department visits among those low-income adults in Oregon who gained Medicaid coverage in 2008 through a state lottery. This runs counter to some health-care law supporters' hope that Medicaid coverage would decrease this type of costly medical care, by making it easier for low income adults to see primary care providers. \\"I would view it as part of a broader set of evidence that covering people with health insurance doesn't save money,\\" says Jonathan Gruber, a health economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who has also studied Oregon's Medicaid expansion but is not affiliated with this study. \\"That was sometimes a misleading motivator for the Affordable Care Act. The law isn't designed to save money. It's designed to improve health, and that's going to cost money.\\" The Science study is part of a much larger research project that looks at Oregon's 2008 Medicaid expansion, where the state had limited funding to expand the public program to a set number of low-income residents. Oregon used a lottery to determine who would gain access to coverage, and that created a unique opportunity for researchers: The chance to study what happens when some people are randomly assigned to receive health insurance, and others are not. Previous research on the Oregon Medicaid expansion has found that enrolling in the public program increased hospital visits, primary care trips and prescription drug use. That left an unanswered question: Were new Medicaid enrollees going their primary care doctor instead of the emergency department, or, were they using more of all types of health-care services? This study suggests the latter answer: With financial barriers removed, Medicaid patients see their primary care doctor more -- and also go to the emergency department at an increased frequency. Medicaid enrollees made, on average, 1.43 trips to the emergency department during the 18-month study period, compared to an average of 1.02 visits among those who entered the Medicaid lottery but did not gain coverage. Medicaid coverage also increased the probability of having any visit to the emergency department by 7 percent. The researchers also looked at the types of visits and found no decline in use of the emergency department for primary care treatable conditions among those who had enrolled in Medicaid coverage. \\"Part of what makes emergency department use interesting is there are different theories about what to expect,\\" lead study author Sarah Taubman, also at the Harvard School of Public Health. \\"There's one theory that it increases, because insurance pays for emergency room care that would lead people to use more than if they faced the full cost. The other theory is that, by paying for primary care visits, insurance may lead to a decrease in emergency department use. We looked at this and, taken altogether, we see a net increase. Twenty-five states and the District of Columbia expanded their Medicaid programs under the Affordable Care Act, extending coverage to all adults who earn less than 133 percent of the federal poverty line, about 15,000 for an individual and 31,400 for a family of four. Two more states, Indiana and Pennsylvania, are seeking to move forward with the health-care law program at a later date. Although the Affordable Care Act initially mandated that all states expand their Medicaid programs, the Supreme Court ruling in June 2012 found that provision to be too restrictive, allowing each state to decide whether to participate. Some governors have cited a reduction in emergency department visits as a reason to expand the public program. \\"Today, uninsured citizens often turn to emergency rooms for non-urgent care because they don't have access to primary care doctors -- leading to crowded emergency rooms, longer wait times and higher costs,\\" one fact sheet from Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder (R) states. \\"By expanding Medicaid, those without insurance will have access to primary care, lowering costs and improving overall health.\\" And, when Congress was debating the Affordable Care Act in 2009, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius cited the high number of uninsured Americans being seen at the emergency department as a reason to pass the law “Our health care system has forced too many uninsured Americans to depend on the emergency room for the care they need,” she said in a July 2009 statement. “We cannot wait for reform that gives all Americans the high-quality, affordable care they need and helps prevent illnesses from turning into emergencies.” Gruber, the MIT economist, doesn't see the Harvard study as a compelling case against expanding Medicaid. There are still other benefits to insurance coverage, he says, that aren't about saving public funding. Separate research on the Oregon expansion, published last spring in the New England Journal of Medicine, found Medicaid enrollees to have significantly lower rates of depression and were more able to pay their medical bills. \\"The overall notion is we're getting people more health care,\\" Gruber says. \\"There are huge improvements in mental health. For those who want to argue that expanding Medicaid is a free lunch, this is bad. But that was never the right argument.\\" ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","response":"A new study in the journal Science has found that expanding insurance coverage through Medicaid led to an increase in emergency room visits, contrary to the predictions of supporters of the Affordable Care Act, who expected that greater coverage would lead to a reduction in costly emergency room visits.

Context: KnowledgeWare was a software company headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia co-founded by James Martin and run by Fran Tarkenton. It produced a Computer Aided Software Engineering (CASE) tool called IEW (Information Engineering Workbench). KnowledgeWare was sold to Sterling Software in 1994, which was in its turn acquired by Computer Associates. Hypothesis: IEW was a name created by Fran Tarkenton.","response":"Based on the provided context, it is not accurate to directly infer that the hypothesis \\"IEW was a name created by Fran Tarkenton\\" is true. There is not enough evidence from the context to substantiate this claim. The passage does mention that KnowledgeWare produced a CASE tool called IEW, co-founded by James Martin and run by Fran Tarkenton, but it does not specifically attribute the naming of IEW to Fran Tarkenton. To elaborate on the context provided, KnowledgeWare was a software company with its headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia. The company was co-founded by James Martin, a well-known British software consultant and author, and Fran Tarkenton, a former American football player turned entrepreneur. KnowledgeWare developed and produced a CASE tool called IEW, which stands for Information Engineering Workbench, a tool designed to aid in computer-aided software engineering. In 1994, KnowledgeWare was sold to Sterling Software, another software company that specialized in software and services for application development, operations management, and systems software. Subsequently, Sterling Software was acquired by Computer Associates, now called Broadcom Inc., a global software and technology corporation with expertise in various segments, such as development tools, semiconductors, and networking. While the context provides valuable information about the companies, their products, and notable individuals involved, it doesn't specifically mention who created the name IEW. Providing an answer to the hypothesis would require further information or evidence that attributes the naming of IEW to Fran Tarkenton, as it might have been named by any of the company's stakeholders or employees, or even the co-founder, James Martin."},{"question":"Please add spaces between words: Mosthouseplantswillalsothriveinaneast-facingwindow,wheretheygetdirectsunlightinlimitedquantities.","response":"Most house plants will also thrive in an east-facing window, where they get direct sunlight in limited quantities. East-facing windows are particularly beneficial for a variety of house plants, as they provide an ideal balance of sunlight and shade. In this location, plants are able to receive direct sun exposure in the morning, followed by more indirect light as the day progresses. Direct sunlight is essential for the proper growth and development of many house plants. It aids in photosynthesis, the process by which plants convert sunlight into energy, and helps to maintain their overall health and vitality. In limited quantities, direct sunlight can contribute to the vibrant, lush appearance that many house plant enthusiasts desire. However, too much direct sunlight can also be harmful to some plants, as it can lead to issues such as scorched leaves, wilting, and even stunted growth. East-facing windows provide a balance of direct sunlight and indirect light that allows most house plants to flourish without causing sun damage. The morning sunlight that east-facing windows offer is also generally gentler and less intense than the harsh, direct sunlight that plants may receive in south- or west-facing windows. This makes east-facing windows a suitable location even for more delicate or shade-loving plant varieties. Some of the house plants that will thrive in an east-facing window include: 1. Spider plants (Chlorophytum comosum) 2. Pothos (Epipremnum aureum) 3. Calathea varieties 4. Peace lilies (Spathiphyllum) 5. Boston ferns (Nephrolepis exaltata) 6. African violets (Saintpaulia) 7. Prayer plants (Maranta leuconeura) 8. Snake plants (Sansevieria) To further ensure the success of house plants in an east-facing window, it's essential to maintain proper care by monitoring the temperature, humidity, and watering schedule. With the right balance of light and care, most house plants will thrive by growing healthily and displaying vibrant colors in an east-facing window."},{"question":"Sentence from a movie review: nothing good can happen Select your answer: was the movie seen positively or negatively based on the preceding review? OPT: A). negative; B). positive;","response":"Based on the given sentence \\"nothing good can happen\\" from a movie review, it can be inferred that the movie was seen negatively. Therefore, the correct answer is: A). negative. This statement implies that the reviewer believes the movie lacks any positive qualities or redeeming features. It seems that they were disappointed with the film's content, execution, or overall experience. The phrase \\"nothing good can happen\\" conveys a sense of dissatisfaction, as if the reviewer was not entertained, engaged, or moved by the events or characters within the movie. When evaluating a movie, critics and viewers may consider a variety of aspects. These include the film's plot, character development, acting, visual effects, music, pacing, and themes. If a reviewer states that nothing good can happen in a movie, they might be implying that one or more of these elements failed to meet their expectations or standards. This could lead to a negative review and potentially deter other potential viewers from watching the film. It is essential to note that individual opinions and perceptions about a movie can vary greatly. A statement from a single movie review might not entirely capture the film's overall quality or other viewers' experiences. Reading various reviews and considering a range of perspectives could provide a more comprehensive understanding of a movie's strengths and weaknesses and help potential viewers make informed decisions about whether to watch the film. In summary, the given sentence from a movie review suggests a negative perception of the movie by the reviewer. They apparently found little or no redeeming qualities in the film, leading to the conclusion that the movie was seen negatively. Nonetheless, it is crucial to consider multiple reviews and opinions to form a comprehensive understanding of a film's value and determine if it aligns with one's tastes or preferences."},{"question":"Generate a context and a hypothesis.","response":"Context: In recent years, there has been a noticeable increase in the use of social media platforms by people of all ages across the globe. With the widespread accessibility of the internet and the rapid advancements in technology, individuals can now effortlessly stay connected with one another, express their thoughts and opinions, and share various forms of multimedia content. While social media undeniably offers numerous benefits, it has raised concerns in terms of mental health and well-being, particularly among the younger generation. It has been observed that a significant proportion of teenagers spend excessive amounts of time on social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and Twitter. This heightened immersion has led to concerns that social media could potentially have negative effects on individuals' mental health, especially regarding self-esteem, body image, and feelings of loneliness. Research on the topic has offered mixed results, as some studies suggest a correlation between social media usage and worsened mental health, whereas other research implies that there is no concrete evidence to support this connection. Hypothesis: The hypothesis in this context is that excessive usage of social media has a detrimental effect on the mental health of teenagers, contributing to a decline in self-esteem, an increase in negative body image perceptions, and heightened feelings of loneliness. To investigate this hypothesis, several research methodologies can be employed, such as: 1. Conducting a literature review: Examining previous research studies published on the topic will help in understanding the current knowledge and findings in the field. By carefully analyzing these studies, patterns and connections between social media usage and mental health outcomes can be identified, which can lay the groundwork for further research. 2. Surveys and questionnaires: Distributing surveys and questionnaires targeting teenagers in different environments (e.g., schools, community centers) will help gather valuable insights into their social media habits, mental health status, and overall well-being. This information can be analyzed to determine if there is a correlation between excessive social media usage and the identified mental health concerns. 3. Longitudinal studies: Following a group of teenagers over an extended period and periodically assessing their social media usage and mental health can provide a clearer picture of how these factors are interconnected. By observing how these variables change over time, researchers can establish causality and draw stronger conclusions. 4. Experimental designs: Researchers can design experiments that manipulate social media exposure and assess its impact on the mental health of the participants. For example, a study could involve observing the mental health outcomes of two groups of teenagers, where one group is instructed to limit their social media usage, while the other continues using it as they usually would. Comparing the results would shed light on the potential causal relationship between excessive social media use and mental health concerns. If the hypothesis is supported by a majority of the research, it would be essential to devise strategies, interventions, and educational campaigns to raise awareness about the potential risks of excessive social media use. Moreover, the development of support systems to aid teenagers in maintaining a balanced approach to their online activities will be crucial in preventing mental health issues associated with extensive exposure to social media platforms."},{"question":"Write an article based on this summary: – Those poor, misjudged rats? According to infectious disease experts in Norway and Italy, rats aren't to blame for the spread of the Black Death, which has previously been referred to as the species' most infamous crime. In fact, humans might've been directly involved, reports the CBC. While studying nine European plague outbreaks that killed 125,000 people between 1348 and 1813—considered the second pandemic of the bubonic plague, following the first in the sixth century—researchers at the University of Oslo and University of Ferrara used mathematical models to compare scenarios of transmission by humans, by fleas carried by rats, and by parasites carried by humans, reports CNN. In seven of nine European cities, the latter scenario best matched evidence in mortality records. The theory is that fleas and lice carried by humans would bite an infected person, then jump to another victim and bite again, quickly spreading the disease, per the Independent. Researchers believe this is what led to the deaths of 10,000 people in Florence in 1400, 17,000 people in London in 1563-64, and more than 53,000 people in Moscow in 1771, according to the study published Monday in PNAS. Experts believe this may also explain more recent plague outbreaks in Africa. But perhaps you shouldn't feel so bad for those misjudged rats after all. The study notes the flea-carrying rodents did help spread the plague in the third pandemic, starting in 1855. There are also researchers who continue to believe rats were involved in the Black Death, reports National Geographic, suggesting this \\"provocative\\" study won't be the final word. (The Black Death had an upside.)","response":"Title: Rethinking Rats’ Role: Were Humans the Real Culprits of the Black Death? Introduction: The Black Death, one of history's most devastating pandemics, has long been blamed upon rats and their fleas. However, a new study conducted by infectious disease experts in Norway and Italy suggests that humans might have played a more direct role in the spread of the bubonic plague. This research has cast doubt on the widely accepted theory and opened the doors for further exploration into the spread of pandemics and the implications for modern public health. Rats in the Dock: The Black Death has for centuries been associated with rats, as they were thought to carry the fleas responsible for transmitting the deadly bacteria Yersinia pestis. An estimated 75 to 200 million lives were lost across Europe, Asia, and Africa during the plague’s peak between 1347 and 1351. The rat-based theory has long been the prevailing explanation for this disaster. A Provocative New Study: In a new study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), researchers from the University of Oslo and the University of Ferrara analyzed nine European plague outbreaks that occurred between 1348 and 1813. These outbreaks were part of the second pandemic of the bubonic plague, following the first in the sixth century. After examining the mortality records and using mathematical models to compare transmission scenarios—namely, humans, fleas carried by rats, and parasites carried by humans—researchers found that in seven out of nine cities, transmission through human parasites best matched the available evidence. The Human Factor: According to the study, the rapid spread of the plague is more likely to have been caused by fleas and lice carried by humans. The theory suggests that these parasites would bite an infected person, then jump to another victim, quickly spreading the disease. This mode of transmission may have led to significant outbreaks resulting in thousands of deaths in cities like Florence, London, and Moscow, and recent outbreaks in Africa. Not Exonerating Rats Entirely: While the study sheds new light on humans' possible role in the spread of the bubonic plague, it does not entirely exonerate rats. The flea-carrying rodents indeed played a part in spreading the disease during the third pandemic, which began in 1855. Additionally, some researchers maintain that rats were involved in the Black Death and that this new study is \\"provocative\\" but not the final word. Implications and Conclusion: The new findings present a striking shift in the understanding of plague transmission, with human parasites playing a crucial role in spreading the disease. This information can help inform modern public health efforts, particularly in countries where lice and flea infestations remain a significant health issue. While the debate surrounding rats' involvement in the Black Death is far from settled, the study serves as a reminder that humans must always be vigilant in understanding and addressing the potential risk factors associated with infectious diseases."},{"question":"Question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: How would you like to teach yourself, rather than have teachers? According to the UK's Department of Education and Skills, students will teach themselves in the schools of the future. This means that there will be no more problems such as finding enough teachers. Estelle Morris, the UK Education Secretary, opened the 2002 Education Technology Conference in London recently. To start the conference, she presented a video showing a computer--generated model of the school of tomorrow. Greater use of computer technology and classroom assistants will help students develop their own way of learning, Morris said. She added that this is a more exciting as well as a more interesting way of learning. At the same time, teachers will be \\"freed from their traditional role as the source of all knowledge\\". Children of all abilities will \\"form the curriculum around their individual needs.\\" They will \\"learn in their own time, at their own speed and in their own environment\\". At home or at school, they will follow their learning programmes by looking at online libraries and watching lessons by world-class teachers and subject experts. Instead of going on field trips, students will use virtual reality. If they don't understand something, they can ask other students--\\"take part in virtual communities with learners with similar needs\\"--or e-mail their teachers. They will hand in their work electronically to be \\"auto-marked\\". The classroom of the future is fast becoming a reality. And the Department of Education will soon produce a guide to help schools adapt buildings for new technology, Morris said. These ideas are based on the UK government's plan to create an education system that provides students with a strong grounding of knowledge and skills at primary school level. And provides the chance for students to develop their individual skills at secondary school level.

Researchers found that the risk of stillbirth for those sleeping on the left side was 1.96 per 1,000 births, and 3.93 per 1,000 births for any other position. Tomasina Stacey, a midwifery lecturer at University of Auckland, who led the study, cautioned pregnant women not to be over-concerned by the finding. \\"It was an observational study, not one that can show cause and effect – all it does is show an association. It would be premature to jump up and down and say that everyone has got to sleep on their left. It's a starting point for future research.\\" In the UK, there were more than 4,000 stillbirths in 2009; almost a third of these occurred late in the pregnancy term, after 37 weeks. \\"Stillbirth is a much bigger problem than most people realise, and many are unexplained,\\" said Stacey. \\"In the UK and New Zealand, there has been very little change in the rate in the last 15 years.\\" For the study, published in the British Medical Journal, she and her colleagues spoke to 155 women who had stillborn babies in Auckland between 2006 and 2009. They were asked about, among other things, their positions on going to sleep and waking up in the final weeks and month before the death of their baby. For the control group, the researchers randomly selected two women who were at the same number of weeks in their pregnancy and questioned them about their sleep in the days and month before the interview. The researchers wanted to examine the effects of sleep disorders in pregnant women, such as sleep apnea or snoring, which could be a factor in stillbirths, because these conditions can reduce the amount of oxygen getting to the baby. Instead, the study showed that sleep position on the night before birth was the decisive factor. Stacey said a possible explanation could be that when a woman does not sleep on her left side, the foetus could compress her inferior vena cava taking blood back to the heart, and a reduced flow means less oxygen gets to the mother's – and in turn the baby's – other organs. \\"If you've got a strong healthy baby, then the slightly reduced blood flow is fine; but if you've got a baby that is compromised in some other way, then maybe that reduction in blood flow can be the tipping point,\\" said Stacey. The left lateral position is known in clinical settings to be the optimal position for looking after a woman in labour and is associated with foetal wellbeing in labour, she added. An accompanying editorial in the journal by Lucy Chappell of King's College London says \\"any simple intervention that reduces the risk of stillbirth would be extremely welcome\\", but argues that the finding should be treated with caution. \\"A forceful campaign urging pregnant women to sleep on their left side is not yet warranted,\\" she said, adding that the study needed to be replicated to be conclusive. Alexander Heazell, of the University of Manchester School of Medicine, also pointed to a weakness – the fact that mothers were asked to recall their sleep position 25 days after a stillbirth. Stacey said her advice to those women who found it uncomfortable to sleep on their left was \\"not to worry about it too much\\". But, she added, at a population level, the associations between position and stillbirth might be important. \\"We could make a difference to the stillbirth rate by encouraging people to sleep on their left.\\" ||||| By Steven Reinberg HealthDay Reporter TUESDAY, June 14 (HealthDay News) -- For pregnant women, reducing the risk for stillbirth may be as simple as sleeping on their left side, New Zealand researchers suggest. In fact, women in the study who didn't sleep on their left side had twice the risk of having a stillborn infant, the researchers noted. Overall, \\"the increase in risk [from right-sided sleeping] is small for the individual,\\" stressed lead author Tomasina Stacey, a graduate student in the department of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Auckland. However, \\"as many women do not sleep on their left side in late pregnancy, it may have an important impact on a population level,\\" she reasoned. \\"This is a new and potentially exciting hypothesis, but further research is required before all women are advised to sleep on their left side in late pregnancy,\\" Stacey concluded. Experts say improved blood flow to the fetus might play a role in any benefit of left-sided sleep, although that remains a theory. The report is published in the June 14 online edition of the BMJ. For the study, the researchers interviewed 155 women who delivered a stillborn baby at at least 28 weeks' gestation. They compared these women with 310 pregnant women with typical ongoing pregnancies. The women were asked about their sleep position during the last month of their pregnancy, the last week of their pregnancy, and on the night they believed the stillbirth occurred. In addition, the women were asked about snoring, daytime sleepiness, if they regularly slept during the day during the last month of pregnancy, how much sleep they got at night and how many times they got up to use the toilet at night. The researchers found no connection between snoring or daytime sleepiness and risk of late stillbirth. However, women who slept on their back or on their right side on the night before a stillbirth were twice as likely to have a late stillbirth, compared with women who slept on their left side. The absolute increase in risk of stillbirth to any one woman remained small, however: Stillbirths occurred in 1.96 per 1,000 cases among women who slept on their left side, versus 3.93 per 1,000 cases for those who slept in the other positions, the investigators found. Women who got up to use the toilet once or less on the last night of their pregnancy were also more likely to have a late stillbirth, compared with women who got up more frequently, the researchers added. And there was a significant link between sleeping regularly during the day and late stillbirth risk, and also longer-than-average sleep at night, the authors said. Still, Stacey was quick to point out that \\"an observational study such as this cannot determine cause-and-effect but it has identified an area that urgently requires further exploration.\\" Lucy Chappell, a clinical senior lecturer in Maternal and Fetal Medicine in the division of women's health at King's College London and author of an accompanying journal editorial, said that \\"this is an interesting finding, but we should be cautious about making a large jump to saying that this is the cause of stillbirth. And we should not rush out to run a large campaign to say pregnant women should sleep on their left side.\\" Chappell noted, however, that there are biological reasons that could support the finding. \\"We have long believed that blood flow to the baby, womb and placenta may be better when pregnant women are on their left,\\" she said. Study coauthor Ed Mitchell, professor of child health in the department of pediatrics at the University of Auckland, believes the finding might help cut the number of stillbirths. \\"If this finding is real and there is a causal relationship between maternal sleep and stillbirths, then the rate of stillbirths might be reduced by a third, which is tremendous given that the rate of stillbirth has hardly changed over the last 20 years,\\" he said.

Character: Children","response":"This task asks you to determine the emotion of a character, based on the provided context, sentence, and character name. The task additionally warns that in some instances, no emotion may be given, and in such scenarios, you should return 'None'. Step-by-step explanation to find an answer: 1. Read the provided context carefully: For example, in the provided information, the context talks about Molly, who has a daycare with eight small children. We learn that she feeds them three times a day and often ends up with a mess on her chairs. 2. Identify the Character: In the provided sentence, the character specified is 'Children'. 3. Read and analyze the sentence: Here, the sentence states that Molly bought a plastic kid's picnic table that seats eight. 4. Now, using the given context and the sentence, your task is to determine the emotion of the specified character. In this instance, the character is the 'Children', and you will have to speculate how they might feel about Molly buying a new table that all of them can sit at. 5. If the context or sentence doesn't show any emotion for the character, return 'None' 6. Lastly, remember that you are expected to pick just one emotion. So, when you speculate what might the children feel, only go for the most plausible emotion given the context and sentence. Always remember that the goal here is to draw out plausible emotion from the character not to write a story out of it."},{"question":"Write a title for this article: “At present there is no cure for Parkinson’s Disease,” says the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. A French nun named Sister Marie Simon-Pierre knows what it’s like to read those words, as she was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease when she was just 40. It was 2001, and Pope John Paul II was already visibly shaking from the disease, so Sister Marie knew where she was headed, and it wasn’t pretty. John Paul died in April of 2005, and Sister Marie began praying that he intercede for her. So did other nuns in her congregation, the Petites Soeurs des Maternites Catholiques. Then, she says, she woke up on June 3 cured, healed from one day to the next. The Vatican had its medical specialists look into the nun’s condition and determined that it was in fact a miracle. While there have been other miracles reportedly worked through the intercession of the late pope, this is the “official” one that allows Pope Benedict to beatify John Paul, or declare him blessed, on May 1. With another miracle, John Paul can be canonized, or made a saint. The miracles are frequently medical cures, inexplicable scientifically. They have to be sudden, complete, and lasting. While John may have done a great deed for Sister Marie – a miracle, really – she’s repaying the favor by coming forward and letting everyone know what happened. She doesn’t look someone who likes the limelight, and you probably won’t be seeing her on the late-night talk shows. But Sister Marie seems to be ready to go through what she has to in order say thanks to her miracle worker. John Paul needed a miracle to get through this point of his sainthood process; in a certain sense, she provided it.

Before the start of the Second World War, and the establishment of war-based industries, Jarvis's initiatives brought modest relief to Jarrow. By 1939, about 100 men were employed in a small furniture factory and up to a further 500 in various metal-based industries set up on the Palmer's site. Jarvis had acquired the obsolete liners Olympic and Berengaria, to be broken up at the yard. However, after their triumphant homecoming many of the marchers felt that their endeavour had failed. Con Whalen, who at his death in 2003 was the last survivor of those who marched the full distance, said that the march was \\"a waste of time\\", but added that he had enjoyed every step. His fellow marcher Guy Waller, on the 40th anniversary of the march in 1976, said that \\"[t]he march produced no immediate startling upsurge in employment in the town. It took the war to do that\\". These views are shared by most commentators and historians. The Daily Mirror columnist Kevin Maguire calls the march \\"a heroic failure\\", while Matt Dobson, in The Socialist, writes that \\"out of all the hunger marches its aims were the most diluted and it made the most modest gains\\". The historians Malcolm Pearce and Geoffrey Stewart provide a positive perspective, arguing that the Jarrow March \\"helped to shape [post-Second World War] perceptions of the 1930s\\", and thus paved the way to social reform.Perry observes that \\"the passage of time has transformed the Jarrow Crusade ... into a potent talisman with which many apparently seek association\\". Thus the Labour Party, which in 1936 shunned the march, later adopted it as \\"a badge of credibility\\". In 1950 the party featured the Jarrow banners on its election posters; the march then disappeared from view in an era of high employment, only to be invoked again when unemployment again became a political issue in the 1980s. In the late 20th century and beyond, Labour leaders—Michael Foot, Neil Kinnock, Tony Blair—have all associated themselves with the march.

The group are regarded as 'founding fathers of Celtic rock' for their fusion of traditional Irish music with rock music and went on to inspire many local and international acts. They formed in 1970 and 'retired' in 1980 for an extended period. The name originated from a spoonerism on The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse which became \\"The Four Poxmen of The Horslypse\\". In March 2004, three Horslips enthusiasts, Jim Nelis, Stephen Ferris and Paul Callaghan, put on an exhibition of Horslips memorabilia in The Orchard Gallery in Derry. It was opened by the band, who played five songs acoustically. Buoyed by this first public appearance in 24 years, Horslips returned to the studio in Westmeath to produce a studio album, Roll Back, in the summer of 2004. Described as \\"Horslips Unplugged\\", the album contained acoustic reworkings of many of their best-known songs. The same exhibition moved to Drogheda in October 2005, courtesy of longtime fan Paddy Goodwin, and was formally opened on 6 October by a tribute band, Horslypse, composed of nine teenage musicians. Horslips did a version of \\"Furniture\\". The exhibition moved to Belfast in February and March 2006 and there were plans for a New York showing in 2007. In February 2008, the exhibition opened in Ballinamore in County Leitrim, and in July it opened in Ballybofey in Donegal. A double DVD entitled Return of the Dancehall Sweethearts came out in November 2005. Disc one is a documentary and disc two was live footage of the band from the 1970s, including promo videos and slots on The Old Grey Whistle Test. In December 2005, the band played in front of an invited audience for the recording of the RTE television program Other Voices in Dingle in County Kerry. Part of the set included three songs done \\"full-on\\" - the first time the band had played live and electric since October 1980.

Set up: This plot revolves around Rose, a bright, cheerful, and vivacious woman, who had so much to offer to the world. She was an eminent artist residing in New York, captivating people with her enchanting performances and also a beloved figure in her neighborhood, always ready to lend her help to anyone in need. Her sudden mysterious disappearance and assumed death leave the city shocked. Initial investigations indicate suicide, which seems highly unlikely. With no body found and no note, it all feels too suspicious. Step 2: Introduction of the protagonist and rise of the conflict Plot Development: Jacob, a seasoned investigative journalist who has been following Rose's career as an artist for an extended period, finds the conclusions of the police investigations difficult to swallow. Known for his ability to reveal the truth, he decides to dive deeper into Rose's life and her supposed suicide. The \\"conflict\\" here is to uncover the dubious circumstances around Rose's disappearance, setting the stage for the unfolding mystery and investigation. Step 3: Progression of the plot and introduction of key elements Plot Progression: Jacob, through his investigation, uncovers many secrets. He begins to find out that Rose had many anonymous threats and creepy fan encounters. Jacob suspects that there's foul play involved and believes that Rose might have been targeted and possibly kidnapped. The plot thickens further as Jacob receives a mysterious note hinting towards a large-scale art theft racket which Rose might have accidentally unearthed. Step 4: The climax of the plot Climax: Jacob manages to track down the art theft racket, and in a powerful climax, he rescues Rose, who had been held captive by the art racketeers. The racket feared their cover being blown due to Rose's in-depth research for her new play on historical art pieces, leading to a series of events construed as Rose's suicide. Step 5: The resolution or denouement Resolution: The culprits are caught and their crimes exposed, providing justice to all the people duped by them. Rose, scarred but resilient, gradually returns to her life, vowing to use her art to raise awareness about such criminal activities. Jacob and Rose form a bond through the ordeal, promising to face any future adversity together. This plot carefully navigates the intrigue around the question, 'Did Rose commit suicide?' It creates a mystery thriller which intriguingly answers this query with a resounding 'No'. Through this story, we keep the audience on their toes, engaging them in an enthralling tale of art, mystery, and resilience."},{"question":"Question: Information: - Syed Sajjad Ali Shah ( Urdu : ) was the Chief Justice of Pakistan from 4 June 1994 to 2 December 1997 . - The Supreme Court of Pakistan (SC) (\\"Adlat-e-Uzma Pkistn\\") is the apex court in the of Pakistan, the final arbiter of legal and constitutional disputes.

The binoculars are the “world’s first digital binoculars with HD video recording, zoom, autofocus and SteadyShot image stabilization,” according to the company’s announcement. SteadyShot image stabilization is the the optical stabilization system that’s found in Sony Handycam camcorders and Cyber-shot cameras — it helps keep images clear and stable, even when viewing at high magnifications. The binoculars come with a rechargeable battery pack that allows up to approximately three hours of 2D recording on a single charge. Also included with both models is a battery charger/adaptor, A/V connecting cable and USB cable for PC connection. There are only slight differences between the two binocular models. While both the DEV-3 and DEV-5 feature 10x optical zooms, the DEV-5 can digitally zoom up to 20x. The biggest difference is the DEV-5′s built-in GPS receiver, which enables it to automatically geo-tag videos and photos. Lastly, the DEV-5 comes with a number of fancy accessories not included with the DEV-3, including a carrying case, neck strap, finder cap, a lens cover and large eye cups. You really have to be an enthusiastic birdwatcher or sports fanatic to shell out for these puppies, though. The DEV-3 comes in at 1,400, and the DEV-5 will be priced at a whopping 2,000. We’re not convinced that a 600 price jump is justified for the addition of DEV-5′s GPS feature, advanced zooming and a few accessories.

Options: - crowding - retrospection - amazement - being bored - excited The answer is \\"amazement\\" because Answer:","response":"The answer is \\"amazement\\" because when kids visit museums that showcase old dinosaur bones, they often experience a feeling of wonder, fascination, and awe. This state of amazement occurs for several reasons. Firstly, seeing old dinosaur bones allows children to further explore their innate curiosity about the world around them. For many kids, visiting a museum is their first opportunity to see, firsthand, the remnants of creatures that roamed the Earth millions of years ago. These prehistoric relics pique the interest of children as they consider the immense age and history behind these ancient fossils. Next, the sheer size and scale of many dinosaur fossils can often be both intimidating and awe-inspiring. Children are amazed by the vast stature of the dinosaurs on display – especially when comparing them to their own sizes or to the animals they see in their everyday lives. This comparison elicits a sense of amazement as children ponder how such colossal creatures could have once existed. In addition to the size of the fossils, the overall presentation and design of dinosaur museums contribute to a sense of amazement. Many museums recreate lifelike environments, including detailed dioramas or full-scale models, to provide a better understanding of the dinosaurs within their respective habitats. This immersive experience helps children feel as though they have stepped back in time, further fueling their amazement. The opportunity to learn about the scientific and historical context within which these dinosaurs lived also play a significant role in fostering a sense of amazement. Through multimedia exhibits, interactive displays, and educational programs, museums help children develop a deeper appreciation for the fascinating world of paleontology and the incredible efforts behind the excavation and preservation of dinosaur fossils. Moreover, visiting museums with old dinosaur bones often serve as a memorable, shared experience for children and their families or friends. This shared sense of amazement and wonder can help strengthen bonds and create lasting memories that children will cherish for years to come. In conclusion, amazement is the best answer to describe what happens to kids when visiting museums displaying old dinosaur bones. These visits present an opportunity for children to explore their innate curiosity, appreciate the scale and size of these extinct creatures, learn about the scientific and historical context, and create lasting memories with their loved ones. While some children may also experience crowding, retrospection, or even boredom during these visits, the predominant emotion – and what makes these museum visits an enriching and awe-inspiring experience – is the sense of amazement that comes from being in the presence of these ancient giants."},{"question":"Question: Information: - Johann Kuhnau (6 April 16605 June 1722) was a German polymath: known primarily as composer today, he was also active as novelist, translator, lawyer, and music theorist, being able late in life to combine these activities with the duties of his official post of \\"Thomaskantor\\" in Leipzig, which he occupied for 21 years. Much of his music, including operas, masses, and other large-scale vocal works, is lost. His reputation today rests on a set of programmatic keyboard sonatas published in 1700, in which each sonata depicted in detail a particular story from the Bible. After his death, Kuhnau was succeeded as \\"Thomaskantor\\" by Johann Sebastian Bach. - Der beglückte Florindo ( HWV 3 ) is an opera composed by Handel at the request of Reinhard Keiser , the manager of the Hamburg Opera . It was first performed ( after Handel had left for Italy ) at the Theater am Gänsemarkt in January 1708 . It was probably directed from the harpsichord by Christoph Graupner . The opera was the first part of a double opera , with the second part , Die verwandelte Daphne , intended to be performed on the following evening . Keiser inserted a play in low German , called die lustige Hochzeit , into the opera , afraid that the audience would get tired otherwise . Handel was not pleased , according to Romain Rolland . Only fragments of the score survive , but a copy of the libretto exists in the Library of Congress . The libretto was by Hinrich Hinsch , a lawyer , who also wrote the text for Keiser 's first opera in Hamburg : Mahumet II ( 1696 ) , based on the life of Mehmet II. Hinsch had been writing librettos since 1681 . He died in 1712 . - Georg Philipp Telemann ( 25 June 1767) was a German Baroque composer and multi-instrumentalist. Almost completely self-taught in music, he became a composer against his family's wishes. After studying in Magdeburg, Zellerfeld, and Hildesheim, Telemann entered the University of Leipzig to study law, but eventually settled on a career in music. He held important positions in Leipzig, Sorau, Eisenach, and Frankfurt before settling in Hamburg in 1721, where he became musical director of the city's five main churches. While Telemann's career prospered, his personal life was always troubled: his first wife died only a few months after their marriage, and his second wife had extramarital affairs and accumulated a large gambling debt before leaving Telemann. - Reinhard Keiser (9 January 167412 September 1739) was a popular German opera composer based in Hamburg. He wrote over a hundred operas. Johann Adolf Scheibe (writing in 1745) considered him an equal to Johann Kuhnau, George Frideric Handel and Georg Philipp Telemann (also associated with the Oper am Gänsemarkt), but his work was largely forgotten for many decades. - Christoph Graupner (13 January 1683 in Kirchberg 10 May 1760 in Darmstadt) was a German harpsichordist and composer of high Baroque music who was a contemporary of Johann Sebastian Bach, Georg Philipp Telemann and George Frideric Handel. - Johann Sebastian Bach (28 July 1750) was a German composer and musician of the Baroque period. He enriched established German styles through his skill in counterpoint, harmonic and motivic organisation, and the adaptation of rhythms, forms, and textures from abroad, particularly from Italy and France. Bach's compositions include the \\"Brandenburg Concertos\\", the \\"Goldberg Variations\\", the Mass in B minor, two Passions, and over three hundred cantatas of which around two hundred survive.

Three years later, the Holy Roman Empire found itself on the brink of war when Wolfgang Wilhelm claimed that the normative year imposed by the treaty took precedence over the Treaty of Xanten in regard to church properties. Since more parishes were in Catholic hands in 1624 than a decade before, Wolfgang Wilhelm hoped to stabilize his control over Jülich and Berg. The Aulic Council was still reviewing the evidence when Frederick William declared himself a protector of the Protestant population living in the two duchies. In June 1651, 3,800 Brandenburg troops invaded Berg, killing two civilians, bombarding Wolfgang Wilhelm's palace and seizing a herd of cows belonging to his wife. After rallying at Kaßlerfeld, the Brandenburgers created an encampment at Angermund and unsuccessfully beleaguered Düsseldorf. The Neuburg envoy in Vienna described the incident as a \\"Cow War\\", comparing Brandenburg's ruler to a cattle rustler. By July, Brandenburg had reinforced its expedition by 2,700 troops, mobilizing 16,000 more across its various territories. Wolfgang Wilhelm employed the help of Charles IV, Duke of Lorraine, who launched a counter invasion of Mark with the intention of obtaining provisions for his army. The estates of all five duchies refused to provide money to either side, while Duisburg's city council requested Dutch protection. The Dutch condemned the actions of their former ally, while Sweden persuaded both sides to disengage through their envoy Melchior von Hatzfeldt. By the end of the year, Neuburg and Brandenburg had disbanded their troops. The Aulic Council distributed the church property on the basis of the current year, ending the conflict. Further negotiations in 1666 and 1672 confirmed the 1651 arrangements, putting an end to the dispute.

Context: SEOUL — The head of the United Nations World Food Program (WFP) on Tuesday said the North Korean leadership is hopeful that following a possible denuclearization deal, the international community will increase humanitarian aid for millions of people in the country who are living in poverty and suffering from malnutrition. “There is a tremendous sense of optimism by the leadership, by the people I met with, in the hopes that they will be turning a new chapter in their history, a new page,” said David Beasley, the Executive Director of the WFP during a briefing in Seoul. The WFP director visited North Korea for four days last week, spending two days in Pyongyang and two visiting rural areas outside the capital. Beasley said he was given “remarkable” access during his visit to the restrictive state where contact with foreigners is tightly controlled. Government minders also accompanied him during his visit. Beasley, a former governor of the U.S. state of South Carolina, was nominated to head the WFP last year by U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley, who is also a former South Carolina governor. With the upcoming summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un now scheduled to be held in Singapore on June 12, there are increased expectations that an agreement will be reached to dismantle the North’s nuclear, missile and chemical weapons programs that threaten the U.S. and its allies. Details over the scope and timing of the denuclearization process must still be worked out, but the North Korean leader has indicated he wants to resolve the dispute to focus on improving the economic conditions of the country. Ending the severe U.S. led sanctions banning 90% of North Korean trade that were imposed for the North’s repeated nuclear and missile tests, would open the door to increased economic investment and cooperation. Humanitarian assistance has been exempted from the economic sanctions, but Beasely said import restrictions has made it more complicated to bring in aid, and made...

CTV News and TSN have learned that Henderson filed his lawsuit against Wideman on Apr. 18 in a Calgary court. Henderson seeks general damages of 200,000, special damages to pay for housekeeping, yard work and hospital expenses of 50,000, and damages for loss of income and future loss of income of 10 million. The Flames are also listed as a defendant. According to his lawsuit, Henderson suffered injuries to his head, neck back, shoulder, and right knee. He also allegedly suffered a concussion, pain, numbness and tingling in his right arm and hand, shock anxiety and depression, headaches and permanent and partial disability. None of the allegations have been proven in court. No statements of defence have been filed. A Flames spokesperson did not immediately reply to an email seeking comment. Wideman hit Henderson during a Jan. 27, 2016, game in Calgary. Wideman was suspended by the league for 20 games as a result of the incident, the second-longest suspension in league history for abusing an official. The NHL said in a video explaining the discipline that Wideman was diagnosed with a concussion after that game, but that his being disoriented was no excuse for “the nature and severity of the offence he committed on the ice.” After an independent arbitrator reduced Wideman’s suspension to 10 games, the NHL went to court in New York in an attempt to vacate the arbitrator’s decision. The league lost that court battle on March 15. In his lawsuit, Henderson’s lawyer wrote that he “has suffered a limitation of activities and loss of enjoyment of life, and will continue to suffer a limitation of activities and enjoyment of life.” Henderson has incurred expenses related to medical care and treatment, prescription medication and other medical supplies, hospital expenses, and other damages, his lawyers claim. “The Plaintiff has been and continues to be unable and restricted in the ability to work as he has yet to get cleared to officiate National Hockey League games, thereby resulting in a loss of income in an amount to be determined at the trial of this action,” the filing says. According to his lawsuit, Henderson suffered injuries to his head, neck back, shoulder, and right knee. He also allegedly suffered a concussion, pain, numbness and tingling in his right arm and hand, shock anxiety and depression, headaches and permanent and partial disability. The government of Alberta is also listed as a plaintiff in the case. “The Plaintiff, the Queen, claims for the cost of health services provided to the Plaintiff, or which will likely be provided to the Plaintiff in the future for the injuries suffered as a result of the wrongful acts or omission of the Defendants as alleged…” According to the statement of claim, the government has asked the court to order Wideman and the Flames to cover the cost of in-patient and out-patient services provided in a hospital, dental surgery services, optometric services, chiropractic services, services provided by a podiatrist, mental health services, drug services, or any goods or services provided by a health service. ||||| Don Henderson, the NHL linesman who was knocked to the ice by Calgary Flames’ defenceman Dennis Wideman during a game against Nashville last year, has filed a 10 million lawsuit against the player and the team. Wideman cross-checked Henderson while returning to the bench after he was hit by the Predators’ Mikka Salomaki during a game on January 27, 2016. The entire incident was caught on camera and about a week later Wideman appologized. \\"First thing I want to apologize to Donnie Henderson. I know I feel awful about what happened and hopefully he's recovering and he's gonna be back on the ice soon but I feel really bad about the whole situation. The last seven days have been tough,\\" he said. Wideman was suspended from play by the league for 20 games even though he claimed that he was disoriented from the hit and that the contact with Henderson was unintentional. The NHLPA appealed the decision on Wideman’s behalf and an independent arbitrator ruled to reduce the suspension down to 10 games. Wideman had already missed 19 games while waiting for a decision on the appeal and returned to the ice before the end of the 2016 season. This week, Henderson filed a 10.25 million statement of claim against Calgary Sports & Entertainment Corp, the Calgary Flames and Wideman. In the claim, Henderson alleges Wideman 'violently' struck him from behind without warning, pushing him to the ice and referred to the hit as an 'attack.' He claims he suffered injuries to his head, neck, shoulder, back, arm, hand and right knee and that he has required psychological counselling in addition to medical treatment. Henderson says he has been unable to work since the incident and has not received clearance from the league to return to the ice. According to the claim, the veteran linesman says he will continue to need 'costly therapy and rehabilitation' and that the incident has cost him millions in lost wages and future earning capacity. None of the allegations have been proven in court and no statements of defence have been filed. The Calgary Flames declined to comment on the lawsuit, as did Henderson’s lawyer. CTV has reached out to Wideman, but has not heard back. |||||Summary:","response":"NHL linesman Don Henderson has filed a 10.25 million lawsuit against Calgary Flames defenceman Dennis Wideman and the team over an incident that occurred in 2016.

I found the following answer on Google: The academic discipline of second-language acquisition is a subdiscipline of applied linguistics . Is that a correct answer? Yes or no.","response":"No, the answer you found on Google is not related to the third theory of language acquisition. The third theory you might be looking for could be the \\"Interactionist Theory\\" of language acquisition. There are several prominent theories of language acquisition, and here's a summary of the three major ones: 1. Behaviorist Theory: Proposed by B.F. Skinner, this theory posits that language acquisition is a result of imitation, reinforcement, and conditioning. According to this theory, children learn language as they are exposed to it, and they imitate the behaviors and expressions of others, reinforced by the responses they receive from their environment. 2. Nativist Theory: Put forward by Noam Chomsky, this theory argues that children are born with an innate capacity for language, called the Language Acquisition Device (LAD). This theory asserts that there is a universal grammar that all human languages share and that children have the innate ability to acquire language based on this universal grammar. 3. Interactionist Theory: This approach, commonly associated with Lev Vygotsky, suggests that language acquisition is a combination of both nature (innate abilities) and nurture (environmental influences). According to this theory, social interactions with adults and peers play a crucial role in language development. Children learn language through communication and by actively participating in interactions with their environment. These theories provide different perspectives on language acquisition, and no single theory can fully explain the complex process through which humans acquire language. Recent research in linguistics, psychology, and neuroscience indicates that a combination of genetic, developmental, social, and cognitive factors influence language learning."},{"question":"Concepts: cathedral, locate, structure Write a sentence that includes all these words.","response":"Step 1: Identify the main subject - In this case, the main subject is 'cathedral.'

Iraq produces its electricity by burning fossil fuels, while Iran uses nuclear fission as its energy source. Which country causes more environmental problems? Hint: In the U.S., the majority of electricity is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels. This causes air pollution, acid rain, and global warming. Fossil fuels are also limited and may eventually run out. Like fossil fuels, radioactive elements are limited. In fact, they are relatively rare, so they could run out sooner rather than later. On the other hand, nuclear fission does not release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with burning fossil fuels. This is the major advantage of using nuclear fission as a source of energy.

Glucose reacts with oxygen to give off carbon dioxide and water. What mass of oxygen is required for a complete reaction of 25 g of glucose? Do those questions have the same meaning? Choices: (A). no; (B). yes;","response":"Imagine you are blowing bubbles into a glass of water. When you blow air, you are releasing carbon dioxide (CO2) into the water. Once the CO2 mixes with the water (H2O), they create a new substance called carbonic acid (H2CO3). It's like mixing two different colors of playdough to make a new color! Now, let's talk about glucose. Glucose is a type of sugar that our body uses for energy. When you eat something sweet, your body breaks down the glucose by mixing it with something called oxygen (O2). When this happens, two new things are made - carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O), just like the bubbles you were blowing earlier. As for the mass of oxygen needed, it's difficult to explain without using some math that might be too hard to understand right now. The first question is about how carbonic acid is made when carbon dioxide and water mix together. The second question is about how much oxygen is needed to turn glucose (sugar) into carbon dioxide and water. So the answer is: (A). No, the questions do not have the same meaning. They are talking about different things, even though they both involve carbon dioxide and water."},{"question":"Teacher:In this task, you're given a review from Amazon and category of the product based on the review given by the user and your task is classify whether the given category match the review.

The Spanish and the Portuguese revolted with British support. The Peninsular War lasted six years, noted for its brutal guerrilla warfare, and culminated in an Allied victory. Fighting also erupted in Central Europe, as the Austrians launched another attack against the French in 1809. Napoleon defeated them at the Battle of Wagram, dissolving the Fifth Coalition formed against France. By 1811, Napoleon ruled over 70 million people across an empire that had domination in Europe, which had not witnessed this level of political consolidation since the days of the Roman Empire.

Rationale: Elephants are animals and some are considered endangered. The question and answer:","response":"Question: What are the primary reasons for the endangerment of elephants and what actions can be taken to protect them? Answer: The primary reasons for the endangerment of elephants include habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict. Habitat loss occurs when human activities such as deforestation, agriculture, and urbanization encroach upon elephant habitats, leading to fragmentation and scarcity of resources. Poaching, especially for ivory, is another major threat to elephants, as it drastically reduces their population and disrupts their social structure. Human-elephant conflict arises when the shrinking habitats force elephants into frequent contact with humans, leading to property damage and, in some cases, injury or death to both humans and elephants. To protect elephants, several action points can be implemented. The most crucial include: 1. Conservation and restoration of elephant habitats: Governments, NGOs, and local communities can collaborate to set aside protected areas where human activities are restricted or carefully managed to ensure the preservation of natural habitats for elephants. 2. Strengthening anti-poaching measures: Investing in resources such as law enforcement, wildlife rangers, and technologies like drones or surveillance cameras can help detect and prevent poaching activities. In addition, implementing strict legal penalties for those caught poaching can serve as a deterrent. 3. Raising awareness about the ivory trade: Public awareness campaigns can educate people about the negative impact of the ivory trade on elephants and encourage consumers to refuse buying ivory products. 4. Reduce human-wildlife conflict: Building fences, trenches, or other barriers can help protect farmlands and communities from invading elephants. Additionally, promoting land-use planning that accommodates elephants' migratory patterns can reduce conflicts between humans and elephants. 5. Support research and monitoring: Understanding elephant population dynamics, behavior, and habitat requirements can inform better protection plans. Consequently, supporting ongoing research and monitoring of endangered elephant populations is vital for their preservation. By addressing these factors, we can contribute to the protection and conservation of elephant populations, ensuring their survival for future generations."},{"question":"In the cosmic scheme of things, this was relatively minor. But very annoying. I had met a woman. Actually, at 19, she was still a girl. I lived in Pittsburgh. She lived in London, Ontario. She was, to put it bluntly, hotter than hell. On top of that, she’s one of the sweetest, nicest people you were ever going to meet. Needless to say, I was quite smitten, and quickly arranged to spend a week in London with her. When I showed up, she was wearing very interesting pajamas. At least for a few minutes. Unfortunately, my two cats, who had never spent a night in my home without me being there, were, less than impressed when I didn’t show up by 5 PM the day I left, despite having arranged for one of my parents to come over each day to feed them and make sure they had water, etc. Playing with them was optional, but neither would show themselves during that week. Nothing looked amiss on the first floor to Mom or Dad. The food was eaten, the water, apparently drunk, etc. When I got home and went upstairs I found something quite different. There was a trail of toilette paper strewn all over the hallway. My pillow was in the bedroom door and shredded. My alarm clock was on the floor. The power cord had been pulled from the wall and chewed through. There were several…uhmmm… “presents” in the middle of the bed, where they had pulled the sheets back. Some of them were still wet. I figure that trip cost me somewhere in the neighborhood of 1k to repair the damage. So I did what any 24 year old would do when faced with that situation.

The victims included 1.5 million children and represented about two-thirds of the nine million Jews who had resided in Europe. Some definitions of the Holocaust include the additional five million non-Jewish victims of Nazi mass murders, bringing the total to about 11 million. Killings took place throughout Nazi Germany, German-occupied territories, and territories held by allies of Nazi Germany. - Vice Admiral Emory Scott Land (January 8, 1879 November 27, 1971) was an officer in the United States Navy, noted for his contributions to naval architecture, particularly in submarine design.

In this analysis, various factors and evidences were considered: 1. Freedom of Expression and Information: The first criteria for making conclusions was the impact of the internet on freedom of expression and information. The analysis pointed out that the digital revolution, which features the rapid growth of the internet, has been beneficial for freedom of expression and information. This indicates that internet growth has made it easier for people to express their opinions publicly and access information more readily. This could be due to the democratizing nature of the internet which allows users from all walks of life to freely express their opinions. 2. Impact on Traditional Media: The analysis also looked at the effects of internet growth on traditional forms of media like prints, radio and television. This underlined that traditional sources of funding have been disrupted by the internet. As the internet continues to grow and provide alternative means of content distribution, traditional media outlets, which relied heavily on advertising revenue, have been massively affected. This is because advertisers now have more platforms to choose from and online platforms typically offer more cost-effective and targeted advertising opportunities. 3. Emergence of Internet Journalism: The growth of the internet has given rise to new media outlets – indeed, internet journalism has replaced a fraction of what's been lost from traditional media. The comparison of the new and old medium was a significant factor while making conclusions. Despite the proliferation of internet journalism, according to the text, it has been able to replace only a tiny fraction of what's been lost due to the decline in traditional media. This implies that while internet growth has led to more sources of news, these new sources have not been able to fully fill the gap left by declining traditional media. In conclusion, the analysis derived conclusions about internet growth by extensively examining its effects on freedom of expression and information, its impact on traditional media, and the emergence and effectiveness of the new internet journalism. Each of these factors offered insights into how the growth of the internet has transformed mass communication. Furthermore, it emphasized the mixed results of this growth, portraying both the beneficial and detrimental outcomes, making a complex and multi-faceted conclusion on Internet growth."},{"question":"Give the step-by-step reasoning process and then the final answer.

What force causes the block to slow down? Pick the answer from these options","response":"Although you haven't provided options to choose from, I will explain the situation and provide the correct answer. In the given scenario, when a block slides down a wooden ramp and gradually slows down until it comes to a stop, the force responsible for this deceleration is friction. Friction is a force that acts between two surfaces that are in contact with each other, and it opposes the relative motion between those surfaces. In this case, the surfaces in contact are the block and the wooden ramp. As the block slides down the ramp, the force of friction resists the motion of the block and dissipates its kinetic energy, which is the energy of the block due to the motion, into heat or sound energy. Several factors affect the magnitude of friction present in a system, including: 1. The nature of the materials: Different materials have different properties that contribute to the friction between them. More friction occurs between rough or sticky surfaces compared to smoother ones. In this case, the properties of the block material and the wooden ramp will determine the amount of friction present. 2. The normal force: The normal force is the force acting perpendicularly between the two surfaces in contact, which, in this case, is the force between the block and the ramp. The magnitude of the frictional force is proportional to the magnitude of the normal force. In situations where an object is sliding down an inclined plane, like the wooden ramp, the normal force will be less than the object's weight because some of the object's weight is supported by the ramp. 3. The coefficient of friction: This is a dimensionless number that depends on the materials in contact. It represents the ratio of the frictional force to the normal force. There are two types of coefficients of friction: the static coefficient of friction, which concerns the force required to start the motion, and the kinetic coefficient of friction, which concerns the force required to maintain the motion. As the block slides down the ramp, friction will continue to oppose its motion until the block's kinetic energy is fully dissipated, causing the block to come to a complete stop."},{"question":"If \\"A man with a white shirt and red tie is talking to another man in a kitchen.\\", can we conclude \\"A man with a red shirt and black tie eating in a kitchen with another guy.\\"?","response":"To determine if we can conclude that \\"A man with a red shirt and black tie eating in a kitchen with another guy.\\" based on the statement \\"A man with a white shirt and red tie is talking to another man in a kitchen.\\", let's analyze the information step-by-step: Step 1: Compare the details about the man's clothing - In the first statement, the man is described as having a white shirt and red tie. - In the second statement, the man is described as having a red shirt and black tie.

The measurement of ejection fraction can be done through several methods, some of which include: 1. Echocardiography: This is the most common and non-invasive method for measuring ejection fraction. A device called a transducer sends sound waves into the chest, which bounce off the heart and return to the transducer, generating images of the heart's chambers and valves. These images are used to calculate the volume of blood in the left ventricle and the amount pumped out with each beat, resulting in the ejection fraction percentage. 2. Radionuclide ventriculography or Multiple-Gated Acquisition (MUGA) scan: This involves the injection of a radioactive tracer into the bloodstream. As the tracer circulates, it highlights the heart's chambers and valves, allowing a gamma camera to capture images during various stages of the cardiac cycle. Healthcare providers then use those images to determine ejection fraction. 3. Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI): This method uses electromagnetic waves to create detailed images of the heart. The test provides precise volumetric measurements of the left ventricle, which can be used to calculate the ejection fraction. 4. Cardiac catheterization: A less common invasive procedure, cardiac catheterization involves the insertion of a thin tube (catheter) into the blood vessels leading to the heart. Healthcare providers then inject a dye into the bloodstream, allowing x-ray imaging to visualize the heart's structures. The images obtained can be used to measure ejection fraction. In summary, the proposed suggestion does not accurately address how ejection fraction is measured. The correct answer should include specific methods and procedures for calculating ejection fraction, such as echocardiography, radionuclide ventriculography, cardiac MRI, or cardiac catheterization."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Paul Reynolds crisscrossed his sketchbook with furious strokes, filling the pages with images of the vengeance he would take on his former coworkers at Fear and Loading Games. He'd founded the company three years back and, just a few hours ago, his partners and erstwhile friends had fired him without cause or warning. He concentrated hard as his pen brought to life demonic figures from one of the best-selling comics he'd created, scythe wielding cyber-men called Myrmidons who tore into surprised computer programmers with fangs and claws. Elsewhere on the page, computers assembled themselves into 21st century Golems, rising up against traitorous CEO's and producers to crush them to bloody pulp as they cowered beneath their desks. Sitting at the bar in Señor Goldstein's Mexican Restaurant in San Jose, California, Paul's own artwork engaged him for the first time in months, maybe years. Under other circumstances, that would have made him happy. But today's circumstances allowed only two emotions: despair and a burning desire for revenge. Not wanting to succumb to the former, and not quite wanting to find a gun and go back to the office, he instead drew. He had turned to a fresh page and begun to sketch his most elaborate revenge-scheme yet when a woman walked into his line of vision. There were four or five other women in the restaurant already (most of them employees), but this one stood out. This one would've stood out anywhere. Her hair, cut short and spiky, was dyed a magenta so bright it nearly glowed. She wore a tight black t-shirt, baggy olive drab shorts that hung on shapely hips, and heavy black boots with two inch thick soles. She had a faded black messenger bag slung across her chest, the strap pressing between her breasts. If Paul had to guess, she wasn't wearing a bra. She definitely wasn't your average Silicon Valley techie on an early lunch break, and certainly not a restaurant employee.

Dubbed B31, the iceberg \\"is now well out of Pine Island Bay and will soon join the more general flow in the Southern Ocean,\\" says an expert in a NASA report. It could pose problems for shipping routes, CNN reports, particularly as Antarctic winter darkness makes it harder for researchers to keep tabs on it. NASA has been tracking the iceberg for five months, io9 reports. \\"It has been surprising how there have been periods of almost no motion, interspersed with rapid flow,\\" the researcher says.

This giant iceberg is now floating away from the Pine Island Bay and will soon move with the flow of the Southern Ocean. Scientists at NASA, who keep a close eye on Earth happenings, have been watching this iceberg for five months. Sometimes it doesn't move much, but other times it moves really fast. The iceberg is about 20 miles long, 12 miles wide, and maybe a third of a mile thick. That's a really big piece of ice! Since it's so big, the B31 iceberg could cause some trouble for the ships that travel in the ocean. It might be harder for the scientists to see and track it when it gets dark during the Antarctic winter. Even though the iceberg is causing some challenges, it will probably be around for a while. An expert thinks it might take at least a year for the B31 iceberg to melt or break into smaller pieces."},{"question":"Background: Sir Richard Starkey (born 7 July 1940), known professionally as Ringo Starr, is an English musician, songwriter, singer, and actor who gained worldwide fame as the drummer for the Beatles.

Let me explain each one for you. 1 - Slowing down with clutch and brakes in a manual car: In a manual car, when you want to slow down, you press the brake pedal with your foot. If you also press the clutch pedal at the same time, it's okay, but it's not always necessary. Only press the clutch when you need to change gears or stop the car completely. Pressing the clutch and brake together won't hurt your car, but it's better to use them the right way so your car will be happy! 2 - Clutch gets hard to press and gears don't engage: When you drive your car for a while and the clutch gets hard to press, it might be because your car is a bit tired or there's a problem. The gears not engaging means they don't want to play with each other properly. It could be because something inside your car needs to be checked or fixed.

It compiles eleven tracks recorded by Davis's nonet for the label over the course of three sessions during 1949 and 1950. Featuring unusual instrumentation and several notable musicians, the music consisted of innovative arrangements influenced by classical music techniques such as polyphony, and marked a major development in post-bebop jazz. As the title suggests, these recordings are considered seminal in the history of cool jazz. The nonet recorded twelve tracks for Capitol during three sessions over the course of nearly a year and a half. Davis, Konitz, Mulligan and Barber were the only musicians who played on all three sessions, though the instrumental lineup was constant (excepting the omission of piano on a few songs and the addition of Hagood on \\"Darn That Dream\\"). The first session occurred on January 21, 1949, recording four tracks: Mulligan's \\"Jeru\\" and \\"Godchild\\" as well as Lewis's \\"Move\\" and \\"Budo\\". Jazz critic Richard Cook hypothesizes that Capitol, wanting to get a good start, recorded these numbers first because they were the most catchy tunes in the nonet's small repertoire. That date Kai Winding replaced Zwerin on trombone, Al Haig replaced Lewis on piano, and Joe Shulman replaced McKibbon on bass. The second recording date came three months later on April 22, 1949 with Davis filling in for Fats Navarro in Tadd Dameron's band with Charlie Parker during the interim. The band returned to the studio with five substitutions in personnel: J. J.

But there are ways to save some money on your currency conversion. Three years ago, the Canadian and U.S. dollar were equal in value. The loonie has since fallen by nearly one-third. Options abound and it would be nice if there was a comparison-shopping website for currencies, but we didn't find one to recommend. Nilan Peiris, of TransferWise, a London-based online money-transfer company, says it's not easy for customers to find the best deal when it comes to money transfers. \\"It's almost impossible to figure out, as a consumer, if you're getting a good deal,\\" he says. Experts tell us, as a general rule, you will get the worst rates at currency booths in airports and train stations. It should cost less exchanging your Canadian dollars at your neighbourhood bank before leaving on your trip. But both the University of Toronto's Ambarish Chandra and Friedberg Mercantile Group's Michael Hart tell CBC News better rates exist elsewhere. \\"Banks do work to ensure that the rates they offer are competitive, and they can be better than other foreign exchange providers,\\" according to the Canadian Bankers Association. As a general rule, experts say you will get the worst rates at currency booths in airports and train stations. (Ryan Remiorz/Canadian Press) Bank rates can be better, but they can also be worse. As with many purchases, it's \\"buyer beware.\\" Currency exchanges post rates for buying or selling a currency. Consumers want to exchange at a rate that's close to the midpoint of those buy-and-sell rates. Peiris refers to that mid-market rate as the only \\"real exchange rate.\\" So what's a consumer to do? Let's say your next-door neighbour has a relative who's just arrived from Europe and wants to convert Euros to Canadian dollars. Your neighbour, knowing you plan to soon leave for Europe, puts you in touch with her relative. If the two of you agree to make the exchange at the mid-market rate for the Euro and the dollar, you will both do better than you could at a bank or currency exchange. According to the Bank of Canada's rough estimate, the fee banks and other financial institutions charge consumers \\"is typically around four per cent of the amount being converted.\\" In the scenario above, both you and the neighbour's relative save that four per cent. Nilan Peiris is the vice-president of growth for TransferWise, a U.K.-based peer-to-peer online money transfer service. (TransferWise) That was the idea behind TransferWise. The company is currently improving their setup for transferring Canadian dollars, and by the end of March, Peiris says it will be cheap, easy and fast to transfer loonies into other major currencies using their website. TransferWise was started in 2011 by two friends who frequently travelled between the U.K. and Estonia: Kristo Kaarmann, a former management consultant, and Taavet Hinrikus, Skype's first employee. TransferWise does peer-to-peer money transfer, using the midpoint rate for the two currencies and charging a fee of about one per cent on transfers between 500 and 1,000 US, with the rate dropping slightly for larger amounts. The fee on a 50,000 transfer would be about 0.72 per cent. Peiris, the company's vice-president of growth, says TransferWire strives to be transparent with consumers. He views the rest of the industry as almost in collaboration \\"to obfuscate pricing and make it much more difficult for consumers to shop around.\\" If exchanging amounts over 5,000, U of T's Chandra recommends online currency exchanges. Chandra teaches business economics, with his current research focusing on travel and trade across the Canada-U.S. border. That includes websites like TransferWise, CanadianForex, XE Trade, NorthStar and Payline by International Currency Exchange. Ambarish Chandra, a business professor at the University of Toronto, says using your credit card for purchases in the U.S. will get you a slightly better rate than getting U.S. dollars at a bank. (Ken Jones/University of Toronto) In general, using these services requires some advance planning — the first time you use it, you will need to set up an account — and have bank accounts in both currencies. The exchange can take up to six business days but usually takes about three. You can pay off a foreign currency credit card this way, or use it to get cash, but that will require a visit to the bank. To get around not having the right foreign currency bank account, people sometimes have the money transferred to the account of a friend or relative where they will be travelling. In the trade, this is known as \\"using a friend as an ATM.\\" For most Canadian tourists going on short trips, most of the time Chandra advises using your credit card to make purchases in the U.S. and many other countries. Their exchange rate should be slightly better than the banks, he says. Expect to lose about 3.5 per cent using your credit card in the U.S., and more than four per cent in other countries. Frequent travellers can do even better using a U.S. dollar credit card, Chandra says. You may be able to get a card through a U.S. bank and some Canadian banks also offer U.S. credit cards, as well as U.S. dollar accounts. The key to saving is in how you pay that monthly credit card bill (and don't forget to check credit card fees). There are also credit cards available that don't charge foreign exchange transaction fees. Rogers Bank, from the telecom Rogers, offers one through MasterCard. Rogers says they don't add a 2.5-per-cent charge, the way the big banks do on their credit cards, and the exchange rate they use, for U.S. dollars at least, is the Bank of Canada's mid-market rate. The big bank credit cards use the MasterCard or Visa exchange rate, which costs the consumer another one per cent or so. Other credit cards that say they don't charge a foreign exchange fee include the Marriott Visa and Amazon Visa from Chase Canada. If you are travelling to a place where you have a friend or relative, you could do your currency exchange online and have the money sent to their bank account. You'll get a better rate and once you're there, they can easily withdraw the money. (Emrah Gurel/Associated Press) Chandra has another recommendation for a way to avoid foreign exchange fees. This method requires buying shares in an interlisted company on a Canadian stock exchange and then selling those shares on, say, a U.S. stock exchange. This method should get you U.S. dollars at the true mid-market rate, he says. He recommends this method for exchanging large sums and doing it through an online broker to keep the trade fees low. And of course, the stock price could go up or down in between your two trades. If you are trading large amounts, you can also negotiate a better rate than what the bank or exchange company posts, especially if you can prove other places are offering a better deal. While the loonie may be way down right now, Chandra advises against gaming the markets in hopes of getting a better rate. \\"It's not worth the trouble and the psychic costs of trying to look at the markets every day,\\" he says, adding that \\"you're very rarely going to win by a whole lot.\\" One of the best ways to save money on currency exchange is to pay with Canadian cash in the U.S. Despite the plunging loonie, some U.S. businesses still accept Canadian currency at par, although the number is dwindling. Write a one or two sentence summary.","response":"When traveling to another country, exchanging currency can be confusing and sometimes expensive. To get the best deal, try to exchange money at banks or online currency exchanges rather than at airports or train stations, and use credit cards when possible for slightly better rates."},{"question":"Multi-choice problem: Choose from the options at the end, and answer how do you do this: Remove hair from hair brush. Available options: [a]. Pull out hair with toothbrush.; [b]. Pull out hair with paint brush.;","response":"I would choose option [a]. Pull out hair with toothbrush. Step-by-step process and justification: 1. Examine the hairbrush: Look at the hair tangled in the bristles to get an idea of how much hair needs to be removed and how it's distributed in the brush. 2. Choose a toothbrush: A toothbrush has stiffer, closer, and stronger bristles compared to a paintbrush. This makes it more effective in detaching tangled hair without bending or spreading the bristles. 3. Loosen hair with toothbrush: Starting from one end of the hairbrush, insert the toothbrush bristles between the hairbrush bristles where the hair is tangled. Gently wiggle the toothbrush back and forth to loosen the hair. 4. Pull out hair with toothbrush: Once the hair is loosened, use the toothbrush bristles to grip and pull out the hair. Repeat this step in small sections across the hairbrush. 5. Dispose of the hair: After removing a section of hair, safely dispose of it in a bin to keep your workspace clean. 6. Repeat until clean: Continue steps 3 to 5 until all the hair is removed from the hairbrush. If needed, you may want to use your fingers to remove any remaining stubborn hair. 7. Final examination: Once you have cleaned the hairbrush, thoroughly inspect it to ensure no hair remains. In conclusion, option [a] is the most effective choice as a toothbrush provides the necessary stiffness and force to effectively remove hair from a hairbrush."},{"question":"Given the question: The 2013 Oakland Raiders began their season with a quarterback who now plays as wide receiver for what team?

Please consider the following points while generating an output. 1) The claim will always have supporting proof in the paragraph, and the paragraph will have a clear point of view supporting the claim. 2) There can be instances where direct correlation to the claim is not available. Make use of the sentences in the paragraph to provide a corresponding output supporting the claim. 3) The explanation should be at least one and at most twelve sentences long. Q: Paragraph: Good job on this. The story stated: However, it could have also included at least a line about the costs of following testing and possible treatment of false positives. Excellent. The story put the important number needed to screen in the third sentence of the story: “A major government study found the screening scans saved the life of one person for every 300 current or former smokers who were scanned.” It went on to explain “The study was stopped when it was found that the scanning group had a 20 percent lower risk of dying from lung cancer than those being screened with X-rays.” It could have done so in absolute terms, not relative risk reduction, but overall it warrants a satisfactory score. The story was clear on this: In a rarity for such a story, “downsides” was even in the headline. The third paragraph read: “But now cancer and screening experts are worried that the limited findings will be used by private screening centers to promote the test to a broader group than was studied. That, in turn, could lead to thousands of unnecessary lung scans, causing excess radiation exposure and unnecessary biopsies and surgery.” In clear language, the article explained key points about the study, including its limitations: While the study found a benefit to scanning a specific group of high-risk smokers, that doesn’t mean other groups will get the same benefit. Good job here as well. The quote from Dr. Otis Brawley of the American Cancer Society was key: “To take a trial that involves people at high risk for lung cancer and to extrapolate it and say it’s good for people with intermediate or low risk is not appropriate.” Good sourcing – including quotes from one who promotes the scans and the study findings and from two who have concerns and are skeptical or worried about the impact. The one comparison was the synopsis of the key study finding: “The smokers and former smokers were given either annual CT lung scans or chest X-rays. Compared with conventional X-rays, the CT, or computed tomography, scans create a detailed three-dimensional image of the lungs. The study was stopped when it was found that the scanning group had a 20 percent lower risk of dying from lung cancer than those being screened with X-rays.” The availability of CT scanners to do lung cancer screening was clear from the story. More importantly, though, was the question of interpreting those scans – with questions raised in this excerpt about the problems even experienced radiologists at major cancer centers had: The story explained that some were already promoting the study’s findings in news releases saying that the study “should once and for all settle the controversy” about whether CT lung scans save lives. But it quickly countered that claim with observations from Dr. Otis Brawley of the American Cancer Society who said that he was worried that the few early press releases and radio advertisements are just the beginning of widespread promotion of screening lung scans. “It was sort of ominous to be working Sunday evening in my home office and this thing comes on the radio,” he said. “A lot of people run out when there is a new announcement and get the new test. We’re very frightened some people are going to be harmed because of this.” This column did not rely on a news release. Claim: The Downside of a Cancer Study Extolling CT Scans A:","response":"The paragraph supports the claim that there are downsides to the cancer study extolling CT scans. It highlights concerns that private screening centers might promote the test to a broader group than studied, potentially leading to unnecessary lung scans, excess radiation exposure, and unnecessary biopsies and surgeries. The article explains that while the study found benefits for a specific group of high-risk smokers, it is not appropriate to extrapolate these results to those with intermediate or low risk. The paragraph also notes that the interpretation of CT scans can be problematic, with even experienced radiologists struggling at times. Additionally, Dr. Otis Brawley of the American Cancer Society expresses concern about the potential for widespread promotion of screening lung scans and the harm it could cause. Overall, the paragraph provides evidence that there are potential downsides and limitations to the cancer study promoting CT scans."},{"question":"How is \\"In the report that is the case, but this work should be continued very intensively.\\" said in Romanian?","response":"În raport, acesta este cazul, dar această muncă trebuie să continue foarte intens.

This is called the adolescent growth spurt. In boys, it is controlled by testosterone. The rate of growth usually starts to increase relatively early in puberty. At its peak rate, growth in height is about 10 centimeters (almost 4 inches) per year in the average male. Growth generally remains rapid for several years. Growth and development of muscles occur toward the end of the growth spurt in height. Muscles may continue to develop and gain strength after growth in height is finished. and the situation: Jeff and Jeremy were neighbors and best friends since kindergarten. They always enjoyed the same hobbies and did everything together. When puberty hit, Jeff was growing much taller than Jeremy. Jeremy's parents were worried about him because he was not growing and was the shortest boy in their class so they took him to the doctor to have his hormones tested. The boys wanted to play a team sport together and had to choose between basketball and soccer. Answer the following question: Which sport would Jeff play better do to his size, basketball or soccer? Answer:","response":"Given Jeff's taller stature due to his growth spurt during puberty, he would likely have an advantage in playing basketball compared to soccer. Height can be beneficial in basketball for various aspects such as rebounding, blocking shots, and having a higher release point on jump shots. However, it's essential to note that being taller doesn't guarantee success in basketball, as skills, coordination, and athleticism are also critical factors. Soccer, on the other hand, relies more on agility, speed, and ball-handling skills, rather than height. Therefore, Jeff's size would likely be more advantageous in playing basketball."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Generate a 5-star review (1 being lowest and 5 being highest) about an app with package com.google.android.gms.

We managed to miss the exit off the I-17 to go to one of the bbq joints up in Anthem, and when we tried to go to another nearby bbq place (Pork on a Fork) they were closed. Finally, we found one more option that wasn't too out of the way, Campfire Bistro! It's close to the Ice Den where I spent many a Friday night in middle school, so it brought back fond memories of singing to Smash Mouth and Backstreet Boys while ice skating with friends. When I realized this place was in a gas station, I was skeptical but hopeful. When I walked in I was surprised to see what basically looks and feels like La Grande Orange-it's in a market with upscale cool things to buy like wines, cheeses, meats, and fun tchatchkies to look at and play with. There's a register counter near the front when you walk in, and Campfire is on the righthand side of the shop further down from the entrance. It's easy to find once you're in. They have a seating area near the soda fountains (COKE PRODUCTS, SCORE! they even have cherry coke from the fountain!), and there is a wonderful display of BBQ sauces with pretty dead-on descriptions of the flavor profiles of each. There's to-go ramekins for you to squeeze the bbq sauces into, and of course bf and I took at LEAST one of each. They let us borrow a sharpie to label the sauces so we would remember which was which, that was way helpful! I was immediately attracted to the BBQ tacos-they came with a choice of pulled chicken, pulled pork, and brisket, and they come in an order of 3 and are served on flour tortillas (YES!). When I saw that there were 3 meat options and you get 3 tacos in the order, of course I asked if I could get one of each taco, which the cashier happily obliged. Bf ordered the same thing, plus a pulled chicken sandwich to have for later which came with chips. Tacos didn't come with a drink or chips, but they were under 10 for three of them, and they were all very tasty! Tender, juicy meat on a soft, fresh tortilla with salsa and some other goodies sprinkled on top. Bf agreed that all of them were delicious, and I think we both decided the chicken is the winner here. All of the bbq sauces were good, though the spicy ones were VERY spicy! Cheap, delicious, creative...I will be back! P.S.

Portuguese explorers then embarked upon Macau (now Macao), the Congo, and various other parts of Africa, including the Sudan. The Portuguese policy was to avoid armed strife and to develop a trade empire, rather than to conquer nations. To this end it succeeded with relatively few blood-soaked episodes in its colonial history. Adventures abroad, however, proved disastrous during the second half of the 16th century. In 1557 the 14-year-old boy-king Sebastião ascended the throne, the beginning of a calamitous reign that was to end at the battle of Alcacer-Quiber (Morocco) in pursuit of a vain crusade. Sebastião's untimely demise, alongside some 18,000 ill-prepared, badly led followers, set the stage for a crisis of succession. For many years afterwards, legends and rumors bizarrely insisted that the king was still alive, and imposters turned up from time to time claiming the throne; those who were plausible enough to be deemed a threat were summarily executed. In fact, the only rightful claimant to the crown was the elderly Prince Henry. But after two years of alternating between the throne and his sickbed, he died, heirless. Surveying the situation and smelling an opportunity, Spain occupied the power vacuum, and Portugal's neighbor and long-time antagonist became its master. Spanish rule dictated Portugal's inadvertent involvement in Spain's ongoing wars. In 1587 a squadron of British ships commanded by Francis Drake attacked the Algarve (now a \\"legitimate target\\" as Spanish territory) and sacked Sagres, thus depriving the world of the relics of Henry the Navigator. Nine years later Faro was torched. The 1386 Treaty of Windsor, by which Britain and Portugal had pledged eternal friendship, seemed a distant memory. Portugal's empire was gradually eroded, and many of its trading posts (with the notable exception of Brazil) were picked off by the British and Dutch. Finally, after 60 years of Spanish rule, Portuguese noblemen (aided by the French, then at war with Spain) organized a palace coup and restored independence. The Great Disaster Portugal's greatest misfortune struck on All Saint's Day, 1 November 1755. Question: \\"What created a crisis of succession following this era of increased trade?\\" Answer: \\"SebastiÃ£oâs demise\\" Is this answer correct?","response":"Yes, the answer is correct. The crisis of succession in Portugal was created after the tragic demise of King Sebastião during the battle of Alcacer-Quiber in Morocco. His sudden death, along with the lack of a direct heir to the throne, left a power vacuum in the country and opened up opportunities for other contenders, eventually leading to Spanish occupation and control over Portugal."},{"question":"Han dynasty: Ban Chao (d.

Incubation can be an energetically demanding process; adult albatrosses, for instance, lose as much as 83 grams (2.9 oz) of body weight per day of incubation. The warmth for the incubation of the eggs of megapodes comes from the sun, decaying vegetation or volcanic sources. Incubation periods range from 10 days (in woodpeckers, cuckoos and passerine birds) to over 80 days (in albatrosses and kiwis).\\"? The answer to this question is:","response":"Question: What are the different methods through which birds provide warmth for incubation, and how do incubation periods vary among bird species? Answer: Birds provide warmth for incubation through brood patches, which are areas of bare skin on the abdomen or breast of the incubating birds. In some cases, such as with megapodes, the warmth comes from external sources like the sun, decaying vegetation, or volcanic sources. Incubation periods can vary widely among bird species, ranging from 10 days in woodpeckers, cuckoos and passerine birds, to over 80 days in albatrosses and kiwis."},{"question":"Information: - Punk rock (or simply \\"punk\\") is a rock music genre that developed in the early to mid 1970s in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. Rooted in 1960s garage rock and other forms of what is now known as \\"proto-punk\\" music, punk rock bands rejected perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. Punk bands typically use short or fast-paced songs, with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY ethic; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through informal channels. - Dean \\"Deano\\" Butterworth is a British-American drummer who is noted for working with English singer Morrissey, and in 2005 became the drummer for American band Good Charlotte after they parted with their previous drummer, Chris Wilson. - Eric Dodd, known professionally as Eric Valentine, is an American record producer, who began his career as drummer and producer in the heavy metal band T-Ride. - Maryland is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, bordering Virginia, West Virginia, and Washington, D.C. to its south and west; Pennsylvania to its north; and Delaware to its east.

Options: - people dying - heartache - killing people - evil - suffering Let's give stream of consciousness first:","response":"The end result of waging war can vary depending on the context and the goals of the individuals or countries involved. However, based on the options provided, the potential end results can be: 1. People dying: This is a common result of war, as conflicts often lead to casualties on both sides, including both soldiers and civilians. 2. Heartache: War can cause immense emotional pain and heartache for those who lose loved ones, homes, and possessions, or are otherwise affected by the conflict. 3. Killing people: This is another aspect of war that often leads to death and destruction, and it can be seen as both a cause and an effect of the violence that takes place during a conflict. 4. Evil: War can sometimes be viewed as evil, particularly when it is waged for unjust reasons or when the harm it causes outweighs any potential benefits. 5. Suffering: Whether through physical injury, emotional distress, or displacement, suffering is an inevitable consequence of war for many people, both directly and indirectly involved. In summary, the end result of waging war can be a combination of people dying, heartache, killing people, evil, and suffering. The specific outcome will depend on the details of the conflict and the actions of those involved, but these elements are often present and interconnected in most war situations."},{"question":"Teacher:In this task, you are given an abstract of article.

Solve this instance: BACKGROUND Androgens play a critical role in the growth of both androgen dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Only a few micro-RNAs (miRNAs) have been suggested to be androgen regulated. We aim to identify androgen regulated miRNAs. METHODS We utilized LNCaP derived model, we have established, and which overexpresses the androgen receptor (AR), the VCaP cell line, and 13 intact-castrated prostate cancer (PC) xenograft pairs, as well as clinical specimens of untreated (PC) and CRPC. The expression of miRNAs was analyzed by microarrays and quantitative RT-PCR (Q-RT-PCR). Transfection of pre-miR-141 and anti-miR-141 was also used. RESULTS Seventeen miRNAs were > 1.5-fold up- or downregulated upon dihydrotestosterone (DHT) treatment in the cell lines, and 42 after castration in the AR-positive xenografts. Only four miRNAs (miR-10a, miR-141, miR-150*, and miR-1225-5p) showed similar androgen regulation in both cell lines and xenografts. Of those, miR-141 was found to be expressed more in PC and CRPC compared to benign prostate hyperplasia. Additionally, the overexpression of miR-141 enhanced growth of parental LNCaP cells while inhibition of miR-141 by anti-miR-141 suppressed the growth of the LNCaP subline overexpressing AR. CONCLUSIONS Only a few miRNAs were found to be androgen-regulated in both cell lines and xenografts models. Of those, the expression of miR-141 was upregulated in cancer. The ectopic overexpression of miR-141 increased growth of LNCaP cell suggesting it may contribute to the progression of PC.

How much weight would you lose in a week by eating 600 calories per day? Choose your answer. Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? OPT: A. no. B. yes.","response":"A. No. These two questions are not paraphrases of each other since they address different scenarios with differing criteria. First Scenario: The question poses a situation where the individual is running 10 miles a day and consuming 1000 calories. To determine weight loss in this scenario, we must consider the number of calories burned during the daily run and the individual's resting metabolic rate. An average person burns approximately 100 calories per mile of running, so running 10 miles daily would lead to 1000 calories burned. The individual's total caloric expenditure for the day would be 1000 calories from running plus their resting metabolic rate, which depends on factors like age, sex, weight, and height. A commonly used formula to estimate resting metabolic rate is the Mifflin-St Jeor equation. Assuming an average value for resting metabolic rate at 1800 calories per day, the total daily caloric expenditure would be 2800 calories. The difference between the caloric intake (1000 calories) and the total caloric expenditure (2800 calories) per day would be 1800 calories. To lose one pound of body weight, it's essential to create a caloric deficit of around 3500 calories. This means that under this scenario, an individual would lose approximately 3,600 calories in a week and would be burning around 12,600 calories (1800 × 7). Consequently, the individual might lose (12,600 calorie deficit ÷ 3500 calories per pound) around 3.6 pounds per week if their physical exertion and caloric intake remains consistent. Second Scenario: The question asks how much weight an individual would lose if they consume only 600 calories per day. In this case, we're supposed to determine the weight loss without factoring in any exercise regime. Using the previously mentioned average resting metabolic rate of 1800 calories per day, consuming 600 calories per day would create a daily caloric deficit of 1200 calories (1800 - 600). Over a week, this deficit accumulates to 8400 calories (1200 × 7). Therefore, the individual might lose approximately (8400 calorie deficit ÷ 3500 calories per pound) around 2.4 pounds per week if their caloric intake remains consistent. To conclude, these questions are not paraphrases of each other, as they examine separate scenarios with different exercise and caloric intake specifications."},{"question":"Data: name = Cotto, priceRange = less than £20, area = riverside, near = All Bar One.

If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\". Although research has been inconclusive, some findings have indicated that electronic communication negatively affects adolescents' social development, replaces face-to-face communication, impairs their social skills, and can sometimes lead to unsafe interaction with strangers. A 2015 review reported that “adolescents lack awareness of strategies to cope with cyberbullying, which has been consistently associated with an increased likelihood of depression.” Studies have shown differences in the ways the internet negatively impacts the adolescents' social functioning. Online socializing tends to make girls particularly vulnerable, while socializing in Internet cafés seems only to affect boys academic achievement. However, other research suggests that Internet communication brings friends closer and is beneficial for socially anxious teens, who find it easier to interact socially online. The more conclusive finding has been that Internet use has a negative effect on the physical health of adolescents, as time spent using the Internet replaces time doing physical activities. However, the Internet can be significantly useful in educating teens because of the access they have to information on many various topics. How can the Internet be beneficial for socially anxious teens?","response":"The Internet can be beneficial for socially anxious teens in several ways: 1. Anonymity and reduced fear of judgment: The anonymity provided by the Internet can make it easier for socially anxious teens to communicate and express their thoughts and feelings without the fear of direct judgment. This allows them to build their confidence in social interactions gradually. 2. Opportunities for social practice: Online platforms give socially anxious teens a chance to practice and develop their social skills in a less intimidating environment. They can work on their conversation skills, learn social cues and norms, and practice conflict resolution without the immediate pressures and anxieties of in-person interactions. 3. Finding like-minded individuals: The Internet offers a plethora of opportunities to join support groups, forums, and online communities where teens can find others with similar interests or who share the same experiences. This helps in providing a sense of belonging and forming meaningful connections with others who can understand and empathize with their social anxiety. 4. Access to resources for coping strategies: The Internet contains various resources, such as articles, videos, and self-help guides, that can help socially anxious teens develop coping strategies and techniques to manage their anxiety in different social situations. These resources can also provide valuable information on therapeutic approaches and treatments for social anxiety disorders. 5. Easier communication options: Communication tools like instant messaging, emailing, or texting can provide a more comfortable means of communication for socially anxious teens. These methods allow them to have more control over the timing and content of their interactions, thus reducing some of the anxiety associated with face-to-face communication. 6. Opportunities for self-expression and creativity: The Internet offers various opportunities and platforms for self-expression, such as blogs, social media profiles, and video-sharing websites. This allows socially anxious teens to express themselves creatively, which can help them develop a sense of identity and build self-confidence. 7. Enhanced academic and learning experiences: For teens with social anxiety who might find regular classroom settings challenging, the Internet can provide access to e-learning platforms and online tutoring services, which enable them to continue their education in a more controlled and less stressful environment. In summary, the Internet can serve as a helpful tool for socially anxious teens by providing them with opportunities to practice and develop social skills, find support from like-minded individuals, access helpful resources, and engage in alternative modes of communication. However, it is essential to balance online interactions with face-to-face socialization when appropriate to ensure well-rounded social development."},{"question":"Ratners Group PLC, a fast-growing, acquisition-minded London-based jeweler, raised its price for Seattle-based specialty jeweler Weisfield's Inc. to 57.50 a share, or 62.1 million, from 50 a share, or 55 million, after another concern said it would be prepared to outbid Ratners's initial offer.

It appears the sentence was already written with correct capitalization, assuming the context is an informal message or conversation. In that case, no modifications were needed, and the sentence has been successfully repeated with appropriate capitalization: \\"Do send original messages to other users.\\" Moreover, it is important to consider the context and the intent behind the message when capitalizing words in a sentence. Capitalization generally follows standard rules and serves several purposes in written communication, such as: 1. Indicating the start of a new sentence: This helps readers identify the beginning of a new thought or statement. 2. Signifying proper nouns: Proper nouns are the specific names given to people (e.g., John Smith), places (e.g., London), or organizations/famous landmarks (e.g., United Nations, Eiffel Tower). These words require capitalization to distinguish them from common nouns. 3. Acronyms and abbreviations: Acronyms and certain abbreviations (e.g., UN for United Nations) are capitalized to make them more noticeable and easily recognizable. 4. Titles: Titles (e.g., Mr., Mrs., Dr.) are capitalized to indicate respect or formality. 5. Capitalizing pronoun 'I': The pronoun 'I' is always capitalized in English when referring to oneself as the speaker or writer. In this case, the sentence \\"Do send original messages to other users\\" adheres to the standard capitalization rules and is properly formatted for an informal context.

To arrive in time to open his tiny store at 8:30, he needed to leave our apartment at 6:30. After all, he had to take a bus and then the subway. The last journey was a long walk through a neighborhood much of which was full of the smell of rubbish. I learned: it is very important to work. No excuse. When I was 12, I would, on some Saturdays, go to my father's store to help out. After helping set up the outside clothing display, for the rest of the day, I'd watch to make sure no one stole anything. When I noticed someone looking unusual or strange, I would look the person in the eye, smile and say, \\"May I help you?\\" Usually that worked, but sometimes, someone would run off with something. The first time, I ran after the thief but my father shouted, \\"Martin, stop! There is no need to do that.\\" It's true that safety is more important than money.

Yes or no? Answer: The Union marshaled the resources and manpower to attack the Confederacy from all directions, and could afford to fight battles of attrition through the Overland Campaign towards Richmond, the Confederate capital. Question: what date did the american civil war start A:","response":"The simple answer to the question \\"What date did the American Civil War start?\\" is April 12, 1861. However, I would like to provide a detailed explanation to offer a better understanding of the events leading up to the Civil War and how it unfolded. The American Civil War began on April 12, 1861, when Confederate forces under General P.G.T. Beauregard opened fire on Fort Sumter, a Union stronghold located in Charleston Harbor, South Carolina. This attack marked the beginning of a long and bloody conflict that would rage on for four years, resulting in the deaths of approximately 620,000 soldiers and an untold number of civilians. The conflict stemmed from a deep-seated disagreement between the Northern and Southern states over issues such as state sovereignty, economic policies, and, most importantly, the institution of slavery. While the Northern states sought to abolish slavery and promote a stronger federal government, the Southern states clung to the practice, fearing the potential economic and social consequences of emancipation. Over time, these differences fueled a bitter sectional rivalry, ultimately leading to the secession of 11 Southern states and the formation of the Confederate States of America in February 1861. The Union, comprised of the remaining states loyal to the United States, was thrust into a war to preserve the nation and ultimately bring an end to slavery. President Abraham Lincoln and his administration faced numerous challenges, including mustering a large army, developing a clear strategy, and navigating the treacherous political landscape of the time. As mentioned in the previous answer, the Union's strategy during the Civil War involved marshaling its superior resources and manpower to wage a war of attrition. The Overland Campaign, led by Union General Ulysses S. Grant, aimed to wear down Confederate forces and capture their capital, Richmond, Virginia. The planning and execution of this campaign, which took place in 1864, involved a series of bloody and hard-fought battles, including the Battle of the Wilderness, Spotsylvania Court House, Cold Harbor, and the Siege of Petersburg. In addition to the Overland Campaign, the Union also sought to establish naval blockades to restrict trade and supplies to the Confederacy. The objective of the Anaconda Plan, as it was known, was to slowly strangle the Southern economy and reinforce the Union's strategic advantages. Over the course of four years, the Union's military advantage, combined with the superior industrial and economic resources of the Northern states, proved decisive in achieving victory. The Confederate army, under constant pressure and undersupplied, began to falter. On April 9, 1865, Confederate General Robert E. Lee formally surrendered to General Ulysses S. Grant at Appomattox Court House in Virginia, effectively ending the Civil War. In conclusion, the American Civil War began on April 12, 1861, with the attack on Fort Sumter in South Carolina. As a consequence of the deep-rooted differences between the Northern and Southern states, and the commitment of the Union to bring an end to slavery, this devastating conflict would last for four years and leave an indelible mark on the nation's history."},{"question":"„for us quality is an optical and tactile experience“ Repeat this setence, but with the correct capitalization.","response":"\\"For us, quality is an optical and tactile experience.\\""},{"question":"Can we conclude from \\"A woman with facial piercings and red-hair.\\" that \\"A woman in a band.\\"?

Lawsuit: Minneapolis priest Michael Keating, pictured, is being sued for allegedly sexually abusing a girl for three years a decade and a half ago. A Minneapolis priest sent at least 19 'seductive' emails confessing his love to a teenage girl who he was allegedly sexually abusing for a period of three years a decade-and-a-half ago. The victim, who was 13 when the alleged abuse started and is in her late 20s now, filed a lawsuit against Reverend Michael Jerome Keating Monday claiming 'dealing with what he did to me is an hourly battle.' She alleges he fondled her breasts, made her lie on top of him while he was aroused, woke her in the middle of the night to ask for a back rub and french kissed her. In the deeply personal emails, made. public today by the girl's lawyer, Keating expressed love and affection for. the girl, regularly signing off 'love you lots and lots' and warning her. that she will be popular with the boys because she was 'pretty and. charming.' Keating, then-44 and 30 years the girl's senior, was attending St Paul Seminary at the time, studying to be a priest. He is now an associate professor in Catholic studies at the University of St. Thomas. According to her suit, Keating 'engaged in multiple instances of unpermitted, harmful and offensive sexual contact with the girl from 1997 to 2000. She said Keating repeatedly told her he loved her and she believed she loved him. In 2004 she said confronted him about the alleged abuse. 'He twisted things so much that by the end, I was apologizing to him,' she told the TwinCities.com. '(He said) \\"you're just an angry girl, and everything I've ever done has been out of love,\\"' she said. She said the abuse drove her to attempt suicide twice. 'The pain of the abuse didn't stop,' she said. 'What he did to me was so internally damaging that I forgot who I was.' Keating was ordained in 2002 and served as a priest at St. John the Baptist church in New Brighton from 2003 to 2005, the lawsuit states. In 2006, the woman, then 21, detailed the alleged abuse, and showed the personal emails, to archdiocese officials but the church found there was insufficient evidence to support a finding of sexual abuse of a minor. The board 'does not believe that the priest's faculties should be suspended, given his effectiveness in many areas of his work,' a summary provided to the family in 2007 stated. A concurrent police investigation was also abandoned. She described the decision as devastating. Thrown out: In 2006, the woman, then 21, detailed the alleged abuse, and showed the personal emails, to archdiocese officials but the church found there was insufficient evidence to support a finding of sexual abuse of a minor. The woman said she decided to file her suit against Keating this week after allegations involving another priest at the Twin Cities archdiocese and claims that the church had failed to report sexual misconduct. She said she felt a tremendous relief since opening up about the abuse. She said: 'I feel free. I'm not scared. I feel proud of myself. I feel excited for what it means not just for me but for other kids.' On the weekend, Keating announced that he was taking a leave from the archdiocese. He is however, still scheduled for classes at St Thomas, according tot he University's website. Neither commented on the case to TwinCities.com and Keating did not return a call made to his home on Monday. In a statement to the Star Tribune, Keating's attorney Fred Bruno on Thursday said the woman's claims 'were thoroughly discredited over six years ago.' He said at the time Father Keating passed a polygraph administered by Minnesota's 'most experienced and highly regarded law enforcement polygrapher.' 'The unfortunate grandstanding and publicity generated by the recent announcement of this lawsuit add nothing to the credibility of the claims,' he said. 'Such self-serving tactics do not promote genuine justice, and are needlessly hurtful to an esteemed member of the Catholic community and to the Church as a whole.' In a statement from the girl on Thursday, she said she had given her attorney Jeff Anderson permission to release a video testimony recorded when she came forward about the abuse in 2006. She said in the statement: 'I want the truth to be known. I want it to be understood that when the abuse started I was barely 13. I want people to know that I came to the Archdiocese with everything I had, with my whole and honest story and I feel like I begged them to hear me.

Only one came back to me consistently with problems. From Minnesota to Melbourne, three testers wrote to me that their very first attempt at making Tuscan gnudi (ricotta and spinach balls that, rather than be encased in pasta like for ravioli, are simply dusted in flour) resulted in a pot of simmering water with “dissolved” gnudi. It reminded me of Pellegrino Artusi’s potato gnocchi recipe in his famous cookbook from 1891, where he interrupts the recipe instructions to mention a signora who, upon attempting to stir the gnocchi cooking in the pot, finds they have disappeared – O dove’erano andati? “Where did they go?” In the case of the gnocchi, there was too little flour used, according to Artusi. But in the case of the gnudi, I already had a hunch. I grilled all three testers on a number of various factors — was the water just simmering, not on a rolling boil (which can destroy delicate gnudi), did they drain the spinach very well, and equally the ricotta (one said she even drained it overnight)? Did they use “proper” ricotta? Aha. “Proper” ricotta. The kind that was only made a day or so earlier, the leftovers of the cheese-making process, the real deal. The kind that you can see in a deli counter, standing on its own, that gets cut into a big wedge and weighed when you order it. Not the kind you buy at the supermarket, in a tub, that so often is grainy, more like the consistency of yogurt, has no structure, and is full of unnecessary gums or additives. All my recipe testers had used the second kind — to be fair, some were new to the idea of buying ricotta and in their neighbourhood only had access to this. In that case, it would have probably been better to make your own, or choose another recipe. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

Question: suppose \\"the environment doesnt allow the bird to build nest\\" happens, how will it affect MORE/LARGER nests. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","response":"If the environment does not allow a bird to build a nest, it would significantly affect the construction of more and larger nests. The availability of materials, appropriate nesting locations, and surrounding factors play a crucial role in nest-building, and the absence or scarcity of these components would limit the bird's ability to create more nests or larger variants. The perturbation can result in various consequences for different aspects of nest-building. Firstly, it may lead to fewer nests being built overall due to the unavailability of suitable nesting sites or construction materials. For birds that are already highly selective in their nesting locations, they may be unable to find a place that meets their requirements or find enough suitable materials for their nests, leading to a substantial decline in nest-building activities. Secondly, the inability to create nests may also impact the size of these nests, with birds having to construct smaller nests in compensation. Since larger nests typically require more materials and can offer greater protection and warmth for the offsprings, the birds may be forced to adjust and use fewer materials to make smaller nests. This could affect the birds' reproductive success, as smaller nests might not provide the same level of shelter and comfort to the birds and their hatchlings, potentially leading to decreased offspring survival rates. Moreover, the perturbation can directly influence the second effect mentioned - the construction of sides with twigs and other things. With limited resources and nesting sites, birds may be unable to gather enough twigs and refuse to create sturdy, well-constructed sides for their nests. Alternatively, they may need to rely on a combination of less suitable materials, which could result in nests with weaker, less stable sides. These weakened structures could leave the birds and their offspring more exposed to predators, harsh weather conditions, and other external threats, thereby affecting the overall nesting success. In conclusion, the environmental challenges that prevent birds from building nests will likely lead to fewer and smaller nests being constructed, as well as nests with less stable sides. The perturbation will have a significant negative impact on both the quantity and quality of the nests, potentially affecting the reproductive success and survival rates of the bird species involved."},{"question":"Information: - Barbara Kingsolver (born April 8, 1955) is an American novelist, essayist and poet. She was raised in rural Kentucky and lived briefly in the Congo in her early childhood. Kingsolver earned degrees in biology at DePauw University and the University of Arizona and worked as a freelance writer before she began writing novels. Her widely known works include \\"The Poisonwood Bible\\", the tale of a missionary family in the Congo, and \\"Animal, Vegetable, Miracle\\", a non-fiction account of her family's attempts to eat locally. - Imagination, also called the faculty of imagining, is the creative ability to form images, ideas, and sensations in the mind without direct input from the senses, such as seeing or hearing. Imagination helps make knowledge applicable in solving problems and is fundamental to integrating experience and the learning process. A basic training for imagination is listening to storytelling (narrative), in which the exactness of the chosen words is the fundamental factor to \\"evoke worlds\\". - A fair (archaic: faire or fayre) is a gathering of people for a variety of entertainment or commercial activities. It is normally of the essence of a fair that it is temporary with scheduled times lasting from an afternoon to several weeks. - A television program is a segment of content intended for broadcast on over-the-air, cable television, or Internet television, other than a commercial, trailer, or any other segment of content not serving as attraction for viewership. It may be a single production, or more commonly, a series of related productions (also called a television series or a television show). - Social justice is the fair and just relation between the individual and society. This is measured by the explicit and tacit terms for the distribution of wealth, opportunities for personal activity and social privileges. In Western as well as in older Asian cultures, the concept of social justice has often referred to the process of ensuring that individuals fulfill their societal roles and receive what was their due from society. In the current global grassroots movements for social justice, the emphasis has been on the breaking of barriers for social mobility, the creation of safety nets and economic justice. - In linguistics, sound symbolism, phonesthesia or phonosemantics is the idea that vocal sounds or phonemes carry meaning in and of themselves. - A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects. - Non-fiction or nonfiction is content (sometimes, in the form of a story) whose creator, in good faith, assumes responsibility for the truth or accuracy of the events, people, and/or information presented. In contrast, a story whose creator explicitly leaves open if and how the work refers to reality is usually classified as fiction. Nonfiction, which may be presented either objectively or subjectively, is traditionally one of the two main divisions of narratives (and, specifically, prose writing), the other traditional division being fiction, which contrasts with nonfiction by dealing in information, events, and characters expected to be partly or largely imaginary. - Animation is the process of making the illusion of motion and the illusion of change by means of the rapid display of a sequence of images that minimally differ from each other. The illusionas in motion pictures in generalis thought to rely on the phi phenomenon. Animators are artists who specialize in the creation of animation. Animation can be recorded with either analogue media, a flip book, motion picture film, video tape, digital media, including formats with animated GIF, Flash animation, and digital video. To display animation, a digital camera, computer, or projector are used along with new technologies that are produced. - Phonaesthetics (from the \\"phn\\", \\"voice-sound\\"; and \\"aisthtik\\", \\"aesthetics\\") is the study of the inherent pleasantness (euphony) or unpleasantness (cacophony) of the sound of certain words, phrases, and sentences. - The PEN/Bellwether Prize for Socially Engaged Fiction, formerly known as the Bellwether Prize for Fiction is a biennial award given by the PEN American Center and Barbara Kingsolver to a U.S. citizen for a previously unpublished work of fiction that address issues of social justice. The prize was established by noted author Barbara Kingsolver, and is funded by her. Winning authors receive a 25,000 award and a publishing contract, from which they receive royalties. - A role-playing game (RPG and sometimes roleplaying game) is a game in which players assume the roles of characters in a fictional setting. Players take responsibility for acting out these roles within a narrative, either through literal acting or through a process of structured decision-making or character development. Actions taken within many games succeed or fail according to a formal system of rules and guidelines. - Marjorie Kowalski Cole ( July 20 , 1953 -- December 4 , 2009 ) was a writer of poetry , short stories and novels . She won the 2004 Bellwether Prize ( for previously unpublished works of fiction which address issues of social justice ) with her first novel Correcting the Landscape . - Language is the ability to acquire and use complex systems of communication, particularly the human ability to do so, and a language is any specific example of such a system. The scientific study of language is called linguistics. Questions concerning the philosophy of language, such as whether words can represent experience, have been debated since Gorgias and Plato in Ancient Greece. Thinkers such as Rousseau have argued that language originated from emotions while others like Kant have held that it originated from rational and logical thought. 20th-century philosophers such as Wittgenstein argued that philosophy is really the study of language. Major figures in linguistics include Ferdinand de Saussure and Noam Chomsky. - A novella is a work of written, fictional, narrative prose normally longer than a short story but shorter than a novel. The English word \\"\\"novella\\" derives from the Italian \\"novella\\", feminine of \\"novello\\", which means \\"new\\". The novella is a common literary genre in several European languages. - Literary fiction comprises fictional works that hold literary merit; that is, they involve social commentary, or political criticism, or focus on the human condition. Literary fiction is deliberately written in dialogue with existing works, created with the above aims in mind and is focused more on themes than on plot, and it is common for literary fiction to be taught and discussed in schools and universities. - Literature, in its broadest sense, is any single body of written works. More restrictively, it is writing considered as an art form, or any single writing deemed to have artistic or intellectual value, often due to deploying language in ways that differ from ordinary usage. Its Latin root \\"literatura\\"/\\"litteratura\\" (derived itself from \\"littera\\": \\"letter\\" or \\"handwriting\\") was used to refer to all written accounts, though contemporary definitions extend the term to include texts that are spoken or sung (oral literature). Literature can be classified according to whether it is fiction or non-fiction and whether it is poetry or prose; it can be further distinguished according to major forms such as the novel, short story or drama; and works are often categorized according to historical periods or their adherence to certain aesthetic features or expectations (genre). - JUSTICE is a human rights and law reform organisation based in the United Kingdom. It is the British section of the International Commission of Jurists, the international human rights organisation of lawyers devoted to the legal protection of human rights worldwide. Consequently, members of JUSTICE are predominantly barristers and solicitors, judges, legal academics, and law students. - Fiction is the classification for any story or universe derived from imaginationin other words, not based strictly on history or fact. Fiction can be expressed in a variety of formats, including writings, live performances, films, television programs, animations, video games, and role-playing games, though the term originally and most commonly refers to the narrative forms of literature (see \\"literary\\" fiction), including the novel, novella, short story, and play. Fiction constitutes an act of creative invention, so that faithfulness to reality is not typically assumed; in other words, fiction is not expected to present only characters who are actual people or descriptions that are factually true. The context of fiction is generally open to interpretation, due to fiction's freedom from any necessary embedding in reality; however, some fictional works are claimed to be, or marketed as, historically or factually accurate, complicating the traditional distinction between fiction and non-fiction. Fiction is a classification or category, rather than a specific mode or genre, unless used in a narrower sense as a synonym for a particular literary fiction form. - PEN America Center (PEN), founded in 1922 and based in New York City, works to advance literature, to defend free expression, and to foster international literary fellowship. The Center has a membership of 3,300 writers, editors, and translators. PEN America Center is the largest of the 144 centers that belong to PEN International, the worldwide association of writers that defends those who are harassed, imprisoned and killed for their views. PEN America Center is one of two PEN centers located in the USA, the other is PEN Center USA in Los Angeles, it covers the USA west of the Mississippi. - Poetry (the term derives from a variant of the Greek term, \\"poiesis\\", \\"making\\") is a form of literature that uses aesthetic and rhythmic qualities of languagesuch as phonaesthetics, sound symbolism, and metreto evoke meanings in addition to, or in place of, the prosaic ostensible meaning. - Writing is a medium of human communication that represents language and emotion through the inscription or recording of signs and symbols. In most languages, writing is a complement to speech or spoken language. Writing is not a language but a form of technology that developed as tools developed with human society. Within a language system, writing relies on many of the same structures as speech, such as vocabulary, grammar and semantics, with the added dependency of a system of signs or symbols. The result of writing is generally called \\"text\\", and the recipient of text is called a reader. Motivations for writing include publication, storytelling, correspondence and diary. Writing has been instrumental in keeping history, maintaining culture, dissemination of knowledge through the media and the formation of legal systems. - Rhythm (from Greek , \\"rhythmos\\", \\"any regular recurring motion, symmetry\\" ) generally means a \\"movement marked by the regulated succession of strong and weak elements, or of opposite or different conditions\\" . This general meaning of regular recurrence or pattern in time can apply to a wide variety of cyclical natural phenomena having a periodicity or frequency of anything from microseconds to several seconds (as with the riff in a rock music song); to several minutes or hours, or, at the most extreme, even over many years. - A short story is a piece of prose fiction that can be read in one sitting. Emerging from earlier oral storytelling traditions in the 17th century, the short story has grown to encompass a body of work so diverse as to defy easy characterization. At its most prototypical the short story features a small cast of named characters, and focuses on a self-contained incident with the intent of evoking a \\"single effect\\" or mood. In doing so, short stories make use of plot, resonance, and other dynamic components to a far greater degree than is typical of an anecdote, yet to a far lesser degree than a novel. While the short story is largely distinct from the novel, authors of both generally draw from a common pool of literary techniques. - A video game is an electronic game that involves human or animal interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word \\"video\\" in \\"video game\\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial. What is the relationship between 'marjorie kowalski cole' and 'novelist'? A:","response":"Marjorie Kowalski Cole was an American writer known for her works in poetry, short stories, and novels. She is primarily associated with the term \\"novelist\\" because her most notable work, \\"Correcting the Landscape,\\" is a novel. This work earned her the 2004 Bellwether Prize (now known as the PEN/Bellwether Prize for Socially Engaged Fiction) for previously unpublished works of fiction that address issues of social justice. As a novelist, Cole contributed to the literary world by creating stories that explore themes of social justice, human experiences, and emotional growth, making her an important figure in the realm of contemporary fiction."},{"question":"Homeland isn't just bad TV, it peddles the worst lies about US foreign policy • Editor's note: there are Season 3 finale spoilers in this piece. In one of the more famous moments in the Showtime thriller, Homeland, Saul Berenson – a man who looks like he should be teaching ethnomusicology to doe-eyed liberal arts undergrads, but instead is the acting director of the CIA – tells his impetuous, deeply unstable and yet oddly prized analyst Carrie Mathison that she is \\"the smartest and the dumbest fucking person I've ever known\\". Smart and dumb are excellent descriptions for Homeland, which in its scintillating first season conflated absorbing character studies with plot points so utterly implausible that it left viewers not sure whether to hate the show or love it. The initial impulse of many, at least initially, was the latter. Here was a taut, well-acted story with a deeper thematic message about the blowback effect of America's post-9/11 obsession with terrorism. Carrie, along with the show's other tent-pole character, Marine Captain (turned al-Qaida terrorist) Nicholas Brody, offered a sobering tale of how the dogged pursuit of a global war on terrorism can do great harm to both those targeted by it, and those tasked with fighting it. So what if portraying the CIA as a paramilitary organization, operating practically at will in the United States, was absurd and so clearly illegal that it was laughable; so what if the lead analyst in the show not only regularly broke the law but had a mental illness so severe she wouldn't have made it through five minutes of a CIA-mandated polygraph; so what if many of the show's characters, from the cartoonishly malevolent vice president to Brody's children appeared to have emerged fully-formed out of Hollywood's \\"Big Book of Sullen and One Dimensional Stock Characters\\"? The show was a true Sunday night guilty pleasure. But after two seasons of some of the \\"dumbest fucking\\" plot twists in recent television history, it's hard to imagine that many are still capable of watching this show with a straight face. Suspension of disbelief is one thing, but Homeland has gone far beyond that. This season alone, the producers of Homeland offered four episodes of Carrie's further descent into madness and betrayal by the CIA … and then basically said: \\"Psych! We were just kidding; ignore everything you've seen.\\" But this bit of subterfuge was all in pursuit of a larger goal: Saul's plan to bring the No 2 official in Iran's Revolutionary Guard, Majid Javadi, to the United States (mind you, this is the guy who is the alleged mastermind of a car bomb attack against the CIA that ended season two) and turn him into a double agent working against the Iranian government. Meanwhile, when Javadi savagely kills two people (including his ex-wife) Saul stops a police investigation into the murder … and does all this, by the way, without telling anyone else, including the White House. And of course no one finds out because, after all, if there is one thing we know about the US government – especially here at the Guardian – they do a bang-up job of keeping a secret. Meanwhile, Saul brings Brody (who is, by the way, the most wanted man in the world for that bombing) back from the daze of heroin addiction in Caracas (don't ask) to sneak across the border into Iran and kill Javadi's boss, so that Javadi gets the top job … and then peace breaks out, or something. In between all this, Carrie gets shot by her fellow CIA agent for disobeying an order and trying to prevent the murder of a suspect in the Langley bombing who gets murdered anyway – and yet no one seems to care. Yet not only is she in perfect health a week later, but Saul decides she is the best possible person to go undercover to Tehran and assist in getting Brody out of the country. Oh, did I mention that she's pregnant with Brody's baby? Like I said, fucking stupid. But as ludicrous as the plot developments have been this season, Homeland's real crime is that it's peddling a dangerous set of lies about terrorism, American omnipotence and the very nature of international politics. When Homeland first appeared it did something culturally unique. It provided viewers with a perspective rarely seen in the decade since 9/11 – that of the suicide bomber. Nicholas Brody didn't hate America because of its freedoms; he hated the nation that sent an unmanned drone to northern Iraq and killed the young son of the terrorist mastermind (Abu Nizar) who was holding him a prisoner. This season, Homeland eschewed such nuance, instead portraying al-Qaida and the Iranian government as being in actual cahoots – even though there is no love loss at all between these two Sunni-Shia rivals. Iran and its people are presented as a caricature of anti-American hatred – one that looks nothing like reality. In addition, Homeland never bothered itself with the niceties of global diplomacy. It is a show that presents change – or the potential for it – as being most likely found at the end of a gun barrel. This season it doubled down. In its make-believe world peace and rapprochement between long-time enemies is achieved not through the extension of an olive branch or even the application of political pressure, but rather a CIA assassination, which somehow melts away years of animosity between the US and Iran and transforms the Middle East. This is a bit how children understand foreign policy – grand sweeping gestures crafted by well-meaning individuals (or in this case a psychopathic killer being blackmailed by the CIA) that somehow transform whole societies. Indeed, when Saul unveils this grand plan for peace to Carrie, he tells her that, if successful, \\"two countries who haven't communicated for 30 years, except through terrorist actions and threats, can sit down and talk.\\" But, of course, for that to happen, someone has to die first. The irony of all this fictional intrigue is that at practically the exact moment that Saul uttered these words, two countries that hadn't communicated for 30 years were sitting down and talking in Geneva – and reaching an agreement on limiting Iran's nuclear program. Indeed, if there is anything we've learned about international relations this year, it's that the way countries often find agreement is through a series of very un-sexy activities: plodding diplomacy, laboriously constructed sanctions regimes, confidence-building measures and protracted negotiations. And even then there is hardly guarantee of success. The recent breakthrough in Geneva between the US and Iran was not a result of CIA manipulation or American skullduggery, but rather the strategic decision-making of leaders in the United States and Iran (as well as France, the United Kingdom, China, Russia and Germany) to pursue normalization. Of course, on Homeland, the Magical Mystery Tour season ends with Saul Berenson being given sole credit for transforming the strategic calculus of the Iranian government – and the achievement of a nuclear deal in Geneva. A show that labored (often successfully) in its first two seasons to offer nuance in its depiction of jihadist terrorists – and a sordid glimpse into the unintended consequences of American militarism – has become a paean to the supposed strategic brilliance of the CIA, the tactical efficacy of US special military operations and a dispiriting, black-and-white portrait of America's \\"Muslim\\" enemies. Making bad television is sin enough, but Homeland does far worse: it not only misunderstands the Middle East, it fetishizes the worst elements of American power and misrepresents how and why international political change occurs. What was this article about?","response":"This article discusses the Showtime thriller series, Homeland, and criticizes its portrayal of U.S. foreign policy, terrorism, and international politics.

And are you ready for chocolate chip? Countless bagel bakeries on the Island have bagels in several flavors, but at Bagel Boss in Hicksville, the varieties definitely break new ground. Chocolate chip and spinach bagels, which they bake regularly, might appeal to the curious, ready to sample anything new. The spinach is salt-free, slightly vegetal-tasting and good with cheese. As for the chocolate chip, it ranks fairly low on my list of culinary delights, about on a par with chocolate cream cheese. Cinnamon raisin, on the other hand, while no longer a novelty, is given distinctive character at Bagel Boss with the cinnamon traced in deep swirls and plenty of big juicy raisins throughout. These can become addictive. The cinnamon raisin bagels - like the chocolate chip, spinach, rich egg, savory rye and excellent whole wheat bagels - are huge, almost twice the size of a common bagel. And unlike what Mel Rosner, the owner of Bagel Boss, estimates to be 95 percent of the bagels sold today, they are made by hand, not machine. ''Someone invented a bagel machine about 15 years ago, and that changed the whole business,'' Mr. Rosner said. ''Until then, bagels were always made by hand, but now the handmade is dying out.'' The large bagels made and sold at Bagel Boss are all hand-rolled by Sol Sapadin, a baker, who estimates that he makes 72,000 bagels a week by hand to accommodate retail sales and wholesale accounts. A new vegetable flavor, combining sweet potatoes, carrots, broccoli and spinach in the dough, will be introduced shortly. Smaller bagels, the plain classic plus six other flavors (onion, garlic, salt, sesame, poppyseed and pumpernickel), are stamped out by machine. Bagel Boss, which does a lively wholesale business, also makes minibagels and even miniature bialys, these particularly appealing for elegant brunches. Onion boards, regular bialys, bialy sticks, onion and garlic breads and caraway-flavored braided bagel rolls, ideal for sandwiches, are some other specialties. For parties, Bagel Boss will take orders for giant bagels, two feet in diameter, that can be split and layered with various fillings to feed about a dozen guests. These are priced at 5. Fillings for bagels - whether giant, mini, extra large or normal - include the whitefish salad, baked salmon salad or all-natural vegetable cream cheese spread also made by Bagel Boss. Bags of ''bagel thins,'' crisp, toasted thin bagel slices, are 79 cents each. If you buy two bags, the third one is free. Similarly, purchasing a dozen bagels, either of the hand-rolled varieties at 30 cents each or the regular ones at 20 cents, entitles you to an extra one. Minibagels and minibialys are 1.30 a dozen, and many of the other specialty items are 40 cents each. Mr. Rosner's partners in the business are two of his sons, Randy and Jerry. A third son, Adam, who is 17 years old, is apprenticing. ''We bought what was a very ordinary and not particularly well-run bagel bakery about five years ago,'' said Mr. R osner, who has been inthe business for 35 years. ''Almost from the beginning we started adding flavor s and sizes, but it's been gradual. The salads and cheese are th e newest line.'' Bagel Boss, which also sells hot coffee, daily newspapers, dairy products and some very dreary commercial pastries that really do not deserve to be displayed alongside the bagels, is open every day, 24 hours a day.

Can you help me answer a few questions? If you can't, please say \\"No I can't\\". Question: What does the man give to the cougar> Movie title: Wrecked Movie plot: A man, referred to in the movie only as \\"Man\\" (Adrien Brody), wakes up, severely injured, in a wrecked car in the bottom of a ravine with his right leg stuck between the dashboard and the door. He has a broken leg and is suffering from amnesia. He hallucinates about a woman (Caroline Dhavernas) finding him. He also drives away a cougar after giving two warning shots from a revolver he retrieved inside the car. After a few days of being stuck in that position, he manages to escape the car by prying out the car door with a shifter lever. In the car, he finds bags of money and hears on the car radio about an armed robbery by a man named Raymond Plazzy. Finding a credit card under the passenger seat in the name of Raymond Plazzy, The Man assumes that he is Raymond Plazzy and that he committed the robbery. A man (Adrian Holmes) wearing hunting gear emerges from the woods and starts to loot the wrecked car. The Man tries to get help from the hunter, who just runs away with some of the stolen money. A dog appears, and The Man follows it into the woods. He finds a working cell phone inside a cave, discovering the tragic fate of the hunter who was possibly attacked by the cougar. The Man cannot obtain a signal in the woods. Frequently hallucinating about the woman, he finally shoots her with the revolver after realizing the hallucination led him back to the car. He then decides to get out of the ravine. After crawling for days, he finds a road and a dead body with a driver's license that says Raymond Plazzy. He then pieces together what happened to him: He was running errands with his wife (the Woman) when he witnessed an armed robbery and was taken hostage by Plazzy. They were driving down the road, arguing about the situation; and he used the moment to grab the wheel, causing the car to crash. Suddenly, the cougar appears; the man gives the dead body to the cougar to eat. The man now has a cell phone signal and calls for help. The man is picked up by a forest ranger. He gets into the truck; and, when he clicks his... The answer is:","response":"In the movie \\"Wrecked,\\" the man (Adrien Brody) gives the dead body of Raymond Plazzy to the cougar when it appears towards the end of the film. The cougar has been a looming threat earlier in the story, and by giving it the dead body, the man is able to deter the animal from attacking him, buying him enough time and safety to make a phone call for help using the cell phone he found earlier. This action showcases the man's resourcefulness and instinct for survival, even when faced with dangerous situations and under extreme physical and mental strain due to his injuries and amnesia. The movie's plot revolves around the man's struggle to piece together his identity and the events leading up to the car crash, while also navigating the challenging wilderness in an injured and vulnerable state. The presence of the cougar adds an element of suspense and danger to the story, as it represents a constant threat beyond the man's own challenges. The fact that the man was able to outsmart the cougar by providing it with the dead body, instead of fleeing or attempting to fight the animal, demonstrates his perseverance and wit in the face of adversity. In conclusion, the man's decision to give the dead body of Raymond Plazzy to the cougar can be seen as a clever and resourceful act, which ultimately marks a turning point in the narrative and allows him to secure assistance and survival."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: Given a premise, an initial context, an original ending, and a new ending, the task is to generate the counterfactual context that is aligned with the new ending.

He pitched from 1965 to 1988 for six different teams in his career, but it is his time with the Philadelphia Phillies where he received his greatest acclaim as a professional and won four Cy Young Awards. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1994. Carlton has the second-most lifetime strikeouts of any left-handed pitcher (4th overall), and the second-most lifetime wins of any left-handed pitcher (11th overall). Following a salary dispute, Cardinals owner Gussie Busch ordered Carlton traded. Eventually, he was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies before the 1972 season for pitcher Rick Wise. The trade is now considered one of the most lopsided deals in baseball history. However, at the time, the trade appeared to make sense from the Cardinals' perspective. Carlton had won 77 games to Wise's 75, and both were considered among the game's best pitchers. Tim McCarver, who had caught for Carlton in St. Louis and for Wise in Philadelphia, described the trade as \\"a real good one for a real good one.\\" He felt Carlton had more raw talent, but Wise had better command on the mound. Although Wise would stay in the majors for another 11 years (though only two of them were with the Cardinals), the trade is now reckoned as an epoch-making deal for the Phillies, as well as one of the worst trades in Cardinals history. In Carlton's first season with Philadelphia, he led the league in wins (27), complete games (30), strikeouts (310), and ERA (1.97), despite playing for a team whose final record was 59-97. His 1972 performance earned him his first Cy Young Award and the Hickok Belt as the top professional athlete of the year. His having won 46% of his team's victories that season is a record in modern major league history. Carlton attributed his success to his grueling training regimen, which included Eastern martial arts techniques, the most famous of which was twisting his fist to the bottom of a 5-gallon bucket of rice. Some highlights of Carlton's 1972 season included starting the season with 5 wins and 1 loss, then losing 5 games in a row, during which period the Phillies scored only 10 runs. At this point he began a 15-game winning streak. After it ended at a 20-6 record, he finished the final third of the year with 7 more wins and 4 losses, ending with 27 wins and 10 losses. Carlton also completed 30 of 41 starts. During the 18 games of the winning streak (3 were no-decisions), Carlton pitched 155 innings, allowed 103 hits and 28 runs (only 17 in the 15 winning games), allowed 39 walks, and had 140 strikeouts. From July 23, 1972 to August 13, 1972 he pitched five complete game victories, allowed only 1 unearned run while only giving up 22 hits in 45 innings, and threw four shutouts. He had a fastball, a legendary slider, and a long looping curve ball; and later a change-up, then a screwball. Baseball commentators during 1972 regularly remarked that Carlton's slider was basically unhittable, while Pittsburgh Pirates slugger Willie Stargell once remarked, \\"Hitting Steve Carlton's slider is like trying to drink coffee with a fork\\". He was also a good hitter for a pitcher; at times he pinch-hit for the Phillies during 1972. What other stats can be attributed to Carlton?","response":"Steve Carlton, also known as \\"Lefty\\", was a very good baseball pitcher. Some of his important stats are that he had the second-most lifetime strikeouts for a left-handed pitcher, and he also had the second-most lifetime wins for a left-handed pitcher.

(I) yes (II) it is not possible to tell (III) no","response":"(III) no The premise and hypothesis do not entail one another, as they present two different contexts. The premise provides a specific location, \\"In the wash-stand drawer in Mrs. Inglethorp's bedroom,\\" while the hypothesis states uncertainty about an item's location with the statement \\"I don't know where it is located.\\" Although both statements are about locations, they do not support or contradict each other. The premise is an explicit statement detailing the item's location, whereas the hypothesis expresses uncertainty about an item's whereabouts, potentially different from the object in the premise. To further elaborate, the premise is related to the wash-stand drawer within a specific person's bedroom (Mrs. Inglethorp). It does not mention which particular object is being referred to but suggests that an object can be found here. On the other hand, the hypothesis does not specify any location or object but is a general statement about not knowing where an item is located. The hypothesis could just as easily be applied to any object or location not mentioned in the premise.

The World Cup and the Olympic and Paralympic Games are approaching, and from high above, the iconic Christ the Redeemer statue is watching over the city. But there are others watching, too. Not far away from the bustling scene at Copacabana, city employees in white jumpsuits are making sure the 6.3 million Cariocas -- Rio locals -- are safe. Sitting in front of a wall of screens, they collect and analyze real-time data of what's going on in the city. Here, they can identify and help prevent anything from landslides to traffic jams. This is the master control of the city -- the Operations Center. Its control room boasts an 80 square meter high-definition video wall --- the biggest in Latin America. Combined with the identical white jumpsuits everyone's sporting, it could very well be straight out of NASA. \\"It's like our Big Brother, not in a private sense but in a sense where we can watch everything that is going on, that's happening in the city,\\" Rio's mayor Eduardo Paes told CNN during a tour of the state-of-the-art Operations Center. A smarter city welcomes the world. Brazil's growing economy and the fact that Rio will host the World Cup in 2014 and the Olympic and Paralympic Games in 2016 have reinforced the city's focus on sustainable initiatives. The mayor's vision is very clear: he plans to make Rio safer and to improve its infrastructure. The Operations Center means that the mayor now has more information about his city that he can use towards other initiatives. \\"I sleep better thanks to it. The worst thing is not having the information, to not have the tools to act. But we do now,\\" Paes says. Read more: Mayor's dream big, redefine urban living. The video wall in the center displays live information from 560 cameras, a weather forecasting system and a smart map capable of analyzing 60 different layers of data streamed from sensors around the city. The mayor commissioned IBM to set up the Operations Center in 2010, following a storm that killed 68 people. \\"We integrated more than 20 city agencies into one central command center, decreasing emergency response times by 30%,\\" says Michael Dixon, head of Smarter Cities for IBM Globally. Paes explains that it was tough to manage the city before the Operations Center was built, since the different departments were spread all over the city. Now they can quickly find solutions to help manage everyday life. \\"It's the place where we gather the minds of the city, we gather the departments but we also gather the technology. I would call that a technological center or urban app or urban technology,\\" he says. The landslides won't bring us down. Rio is surrounded by many steep hillsides on which most of its favelas, the shanty towns, are built. Up to 20% of Rio's inhabitants live in favelas, and many of them are at risk of landslides. \\"We have a history of big floods because of heavy rains and big landslides, especially during summer time,\\" says Paes. Rio has hundreds of favelas and the city authorities have launched a regeneration project called 'Morar Carioca' that aims to \\"urbanize\\" them all by 2020 -- improving the infrastructure in the favelas and integrating them better with the city. \\"We use it as a laboratory for new experiments on environmental and environmentally friendly public things,\\" Paes says of the project. Read more: Brazil's catadores turn trash into art. But until the favelas are urbanized and safe, the city relies on the Operations Center. So far, Paes is confident his city vision is paying off. \\"It's amazing because I would say that the biggest benefits are the bad things that don't happen, that won't come to reality because of it.\\" Summarize the highlights of this article.","response":"The article discusses the advanced systems set up in Rio de Janeiro to ensure the safety of its citizens, especially in the lead-up to major international sporting events such as the World Cup and the Olympic and Paralympic Games.

This data is extracted from an array of sources such as 560 cameras stationed around the city, a weather forecasting system, and a smart map capable of analyzing multiple data layers from sensors spread across the city. Providing city authorities with a comprehensive overview of the city's functioning in real-time, this sophisticated system has reportedly reduced emergency response times by 30%. Interestingly, the Operations Center, set up by IBM, is more than just a hub of data; Mayor Eduardo Paes refers to it as a gathering place \\"where we gather the minds of the city, we gather the departments but we also gather the technology.\\" Addressing another major challenge facing Rio - landslides in favelas (shanty towns built on steep hillsides) - the mayor speaks about a project called 'Morar Carioca'.

Nédia Coutinho and Martin Roy made the discovery during a dive in St. Margarets Bay, located about 40 kilometres from Halifax. “I was obviously not looking for a seahorse, but when I saw it, I could not believe my eyes,” said Coutinho on the University of British Columbia's website. “I was so excited, even without knowing that it’s not common around Nova Scotia. I have dived on the Great Barrier Reef in Australia and in the Caribbean and this is the first time I have ever seen a seahorse.” The pair reported the discovery to Project Seahorse, UBC's online seahorse tracking website. UBC researchers Amanda Vincent and Heather Koldewey started the program in 1996 to study and help protect vulnerable seahorse species across the globe. “This is a thrilling discovery,” said Vincent in a release. “These charismatic and mysterious animals are so highly cryptic — and, in many places, so threatened — that we often have to be very lucky to find them.” Lined seahorses typically live in coastal waters along North and South America, the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico. They're listed as vulnerable to extinction under the International Union for Conservation of Nature. The seahorses, which grow in length to be about 19 centimetres, can develop elaborate skin fronds in order to camouflage themselves within seaweed. According to the Project Seahorse website, many species are threatened by harmful overfishing. Part of the problem is that millions of the animals are caught and used in traditional Chinese medicine, caught for aquariums or dried for decorative purposes. Loss of habitat also poses a problem for seahorse populations. “Seahorses face so many challenges that they desperately need new allies,” said Vincent. “Globally, there are fewer than 15 scientists studying seahorses in the wild, which is why citizen science initiatives like iSeahorse are so important, and why divers like Nédia and Martin are so integral to their conservation.” There are dozens of seahorse species scattered in coastal waters across the globe. The specific number of species is difficult to pinpoint since seahorses have the ability to change their skin colour and grow skin filaments to blend in with their surroundings. Divers and snorkellers who spot seahorses are encouraged to upload information to the iSeahorse website, or use the handy iPhone app.","response":"\\"Finding a Rare Seahorse in Canada: Two Scuba Divers' Amazing Discovery\\""},{"question":"Complete the passage.

Over 5,000 operations were cancelled before the action and hospitals seemed to cope well on the first day. But NHS England said Thursday was likely to prove \\"more challenging\\". Dr Anne Rainsberry, who is in charge of planning during the strike, suggested hospitals might find it difficult to discharge patients without junior doctors working, which could then clog up hospital wards. She said this was because they had a vital role in chasing up test results and ensuring patients were ready for discharge. \\"So far the NHS is holding up, but we always expected the second half of the strike to be more challenging,\\" she said. She also urged patients to go to hospital only when absolutely necessary. \\"If people need medical help and it's not an emergency they should consider NHS Choices, visit their local pharmacy, or call their GP or NHS 111 for more serious matters. \\"If their condition is an emergency or life-threatening they should call 999 as usual or go to A&E.\\" Doctors are providing emergency cover during the walkout, which ends on Friday morning, and consultants, nurses and midwives are all working in hospital as normal. GP surgeries are largely unaffected. On Wednesday just over half of junior doctors expected in work did not turn up - a figure broadly in line with the previous strikes and to be expected considering the numbers needed to provide emergency care. The latest walkout is the third in the long-running dispute, but the first to last 48 hours. So far 19,000 operations and treatments have had to be postponed because of industrial action. The NHS carries out about 30,000 procedures a day. Thousands of check-ups, appointments and tests have been affected as well. Katherine Murphy, of the Patients Association, said she had \\"growing concern\\" about the dispute. \\"Whatever the rights and wrongs of the arguments put forward by either side, the failure to resolve the differences by agreement is bad for doctors, bad for the taxpayer, but above all bad for patients and the NHS.\\" The junior doctors row explained Will the dispute have a toxic legacy? What patients need to know during strike The situation across the rest of the UK Special report: Read more on the dispute This week's walkout is the first of three 48-hour stoppages planned by the British Medical Association as it continues its fight against the government's plans to force through the changes to pay and conditions. The next two are planned for April. The union has also said it will be launching a legal challenge to oppose the imposition of the contract that was announced following last month's strike.

Title: A Dangerous Method Movie plot: Sabina Spielrein (Keira Knightley) arrives at the Burghölzli, the pre-eminent psychiatric hospital in Zurich, Switzerland with a typical case of hysteria and begins a new course of treatment with the young Swiss doctor, Carl Jung (Michael Fassbender). He is using word association and dream interpretation as part of his approach to Sigmund Freud's (Viggo Mortensen) radical new science of psychoanalysis, and finds that Sabina Spielrein's condition was triggered by the humiliation and sexual arousal she felt as a child due to her short-tempered father's habit of spanking her naked. These conflicting feelings were compounded by her instinctive knowledge (imparted by an angel's voice that speaks in German) that she had done nothing to deserve such a punishment and in fact that she may have been a stand-in for her mother in her father's abuse (since her mother was unfaithful). Also, her affluent Russian Jewish family afforded her an exceptional education in preparation for university study, although not on the subject of sex, and she was a virgin.Her intelligence and energy were immediately recognized and encouraged by Jung and Eugen Bleule (André Hennicker), the head of the hospital, and since she plans to study medicine they allow her to assist them in their experiments, including measuring the physical reactions of subjects during word association, to provide empirical data as a scientific basis for psychoanalysis and ameliorate the more sensational aspects of Freud's theories, which contend that all mental illness is rooted in childhood sexual experience, be it real or fantasy. She soon learns that much of this new science is founded on the doctors' observations of themselves, each other, and their families, not just their patients. The doctors correspond at length before they meet, and begin sharing their dreams and analysing each other, and Freud adopts Jung as his heir and agent.Jung finds in Sabina a kindred spirit with a unique perspective as her self-awareness sharpens, and their attraction deepens in...

Let x be the desired two-digit whole number. We have two congruences: 1. x ≡ 2 (mod 9) 2. x ≡ 5 (mod 8) We can express these congruences as linear equations: x = 9k1 + 2 x = 8k2 + 5 where k1 and k2 are integers. We need to find the values of x that satisfy both equations in the two-digit range [10, 99]. Now, we can use the first linear equation to find the smallest two-digit number that satisfies the first congruence: x = 9k1 + 2 For k1 = 1, x = 9 + 2 = 11 (two-digit number) Consider the second linear equation: x = 8k2 + 5 We need to find an integer value for k2 such that x also satisfies the first equation. Let's test with different values: For k2 = 1, x = 8 + 5 = 13 For k2 = 2, x = 16 + 5 = 21 For k2 = 3, x = 24 + 5 = 29 For k2 = 4, x = 32 + 5 = 37 ⇨ x = 37 works (since 37 - 2 = 35, which is divisible by 9) Now we proceed by adding the LCM (Least Common Multiple) of 9 and 8, which is 72, to find the next value of x. 37 + 72 = 109 (three-digit number) So, we have only one two-digit whole number that satisfies both congruences, which is x = 37.

By 1707 this number had swollen to at least 120,000 despite casualties. Russia was able to mobilize a larger army but could not put all of it into action simultaneously. The Russian mobilization system was ineffective and the expanding nation needed to be defended in many locations. A grand mobilization covering Russia's vast territories would have been unrealistic. Peter I tried to raise his army's morale to Swedish levels. Denmark contributed 20,000 men in their invasion of Holstein-Gottorp and more on other fronts. Poland and Saxony together could mobilize at least 100,000 men. Ask a question about this article.","response":"Based on the information provided in the article, one possible question could be: \\"How did the size and capability of Charles XII's army compare to those of the Russian, Danish, Polish, and Saxon forces during the early 18th century?\\" To answer this, the article shows that in the earlier part of the 18th century, Charles XII of Sweden was able to successfully increase his standing army from 77,000 to 120,000 men despite suffering casualties. This showed a level of military management and organizational skill that contributed to the strength and efficiency of his forces. Furthermore, acknowledging the ineffective mobilization system in Russia, it can be inferred that the Swedes had the advantage regarding organization and deployment, allowing them to concentrate their forces and use them more effectively. Despite having the potential to mobilize a larger army, Russia was unable to simultaneously action all its troops due to its vast territories and need for defence in various locations. This indicates that size alone does not determine the capacity of an army; other factors like logistics, morale, and strategic deployment play significant roles. Further, the effort of Peter I to raise his army's morale to Swedish levels hints at the high morale and fighting spirit of the Swedish soldiers, which is a crucial factor in combat effectiveness. It would also seem that the Swedish king had implemented effective training and discipline routines that his counterparts sought to emulate. In terms of allied forces, Denmark made significant contributions, putting forth 20,000 men for the invasion of Holstein-Gottorp and additional troops on other fronts. Meanwhile, Poland and Saxony could together mobilize at least 100,000 men. In numbers, these combined forces would technically outnumber the Swedish Army. However, it's important to clarify that an alliance of forces does not necessarily guarantee a superior military capacity. Their effectiveness hinges on their coordination, shared strategies, and unity, which can be challenging to achieve among different nations. In summary, while Charles XII's army may have been outnumbered when considering the collective forces of the Russians, Danes, Poles, and Saxons, they had a qualitative edge in terms of training, morale, and the effective deployment of their troops. These factors, alongside their ability to quickly replenish their numbers despite war casualties, ensured their strong standing against their adversaries."},{"question":"Q:Information: - The Northeast Corridor (NEC) is an electrified railway line in the Northeast megalopolis of the United States.

Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (October 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Molly Mahoney (Natalie Portman) is an employee at \\"Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium\\", a magical toy shop run by the eccentric 243-year-old Mr. Edward Magorium (Dustin Hoffman). Besides Molly and Mr. Magorium, store bookbuilder Bellini (Ted Ludzik), a strongman, is also employed. Eric Applebaum (Zach Mills) is a boy who comes to the store daily and functions as an employee despite his young age. In response to Mahoney telling Mr. Magorium that she feels stuck, he gives her the Congreve Cube, a big block of wood, and tells her it will guide her to a new life and adventure if she has faith in it. Mahoney wants to become a composer and concert pianist, but has not been able to write any music since graduating. At home, she works on a concerto with little progress. Mr. Magorium suddenly announces that he intends to \\"leave\\" and is giving the shop to Mahoney to provide her with the means to move forward and become \\"unstuck\\" in life. In preparation for his departure, Mr. Magorium hires an accountant, Henry Weston (Jason Bateman), to organize the shop's paperwork and determine his legacy to Mahoney. Henry does not believe that the toy store is magical, arguing with Molly over its properties and debating the actuality of Magorium's records from the past 200 years. When Mahoney expresses her doubts and becoming upset about her ability to run the store, the store throws a tantrum, causing all the toys and its inner workings to go haywire, ambushing customers of all ages. Mahoney finally realizes that Mr. Magorium is leaving not to retire but instead he is going to die. Desperate to stop this, Mahoney rushes him to a hospital where he is discharged the next day because nothing is physically wrong with him. After leaving the hospital, Mr. Magorium asks Mahoney how she is doing with the Congreve Cube and asks... The answer to this question is:","response":"Mahoney feels stuck at the beginning of the movie, as she has been unable to progress in her career as a composer and concert pianist. When Mr. Magorium gives her the Congreve Cube, he hopes it will guide her to a new life and adventure, helping her overcome this feeling of being stuck. As Mr. Magorium prepares to leave and gives the shop to Mahoney, she is initially filled with doubts and is upset about her ability to run the store. This doubt is further fueled by Henry's skepticism about the magic and properties of the store. However, when the store throws a tantrum, Mahoney realizes the seriousness of the situation and that Mr. Magorium is planning to die, not just retire. She feels a sense of desperation as she tries to stop him by rushing him to the hospital. After the hospital visit, when Mr. Magorium asks her about the Congreve Cube, Mahoney is still struggling with her feelings regarding the cube and taking over the store, as well as with adjusting to the idea of Mr. Magorium's impending death. Throughout the movie, Mahoney's emotions evolve as she navigates her doubts, responsibilities, and the magic of the store. She ultimately learns to accept the magic and experiences personal growth, as the store's new owner and in her journey as a composer and pianist. This transformation of her feelings represents the central character arc of Mahoney within the film, providing viewers with a relatable and personal connection to the magical world of Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium."},{"question":"In this task, you are given an adjective, and your job is to generate its antonym.

What is the difference between tablets and pills? What is the difference between a Sedative and a Sleeping pill?","response":"While these two questions appear similar, they are actually inquiring about two distinct topics. The first question is focused on the differences between tablets and pills, which are two different forms of medicines. The second question, on the other hand, is concerned with the differences between a sedative and a sleeping pill, which are two types of medications with specific purposes. 1. What is the difference between tablets and pills? Tablets and pills are both oral dosage forms of medication, but they differ in their physical appearance, production processes, and composition. A. Tablets: Tablets are a solid dosage form that consists of one or more active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and other excipients. They are usually compressed and have a uniform shape, typically round or oval. Tablets can be coated or uncoated. A coating can be used for various purposes, such as to improve taste, delay the release of the API, or improve stability. Key features of tablets: - Compressed and usually have a uniform shape and size - May have a score line to be broken into smaller doses if needed - Can be coated or uncoated - May offer a controlled or delayed release mechanism B. Pills: Pills, on the other hand, are older forms of medication that were traditionally made by mixing active pharmaceutical ingredients and other excipients with a binding agent and rolling the mixture into a round shape by hand or using a pill machine. Today, the term \\"pill\\" is often used colloquially to describe any small, round, oral medication like a tablet or capsule. Key features of pills: - Typically refers to small, round oral medications - Can include solid dosage forms such as tablets or capsules - Historically, hand-rolled and may have been less uniform in shape and size - Modern usage of the term \\"pill\\" is often interchangeable with \\"tablet\\" 2. What is the difference between a Sedative and a Sleeping pill? The second question refers to different types of medication with specific purposes: sedatives and sleeping pills. A. Sedatives: Sedatives, also known as anxiolytics or tranquilizers, are a class of medications used to treat anxiety, panic disorders, and some other psychiatric conditions. They function by depressing the central nervous system, thereby promoting relaxation, reducing anxiety, and inducing drowsiness. Examples of sedatives include benzodiazepines (such as diazepam, alprazolam, and lorazepam), barbiturates, and some non-benzodiazepine drugs (like buspirone). Sedatives are typically prescribed for short-term use or as-needed to provide quick relief from acute anxiety symptoms. Key characteristics of sedatives: - Clinical purpose is to reduce anxiety and promote relaxation - Can induce drowsiness as a side effect - Generally prescribed for short-term use or on an as-needed basis - Examples include benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and some non-benzodiazepine drugs B. Sleeping Pills: Sleeping pills, also known as hypnotics, are a class of medications prescribed primarily for individuals with insomnia or other sleep disorders. These medications aim to help people fall asleep and stay asleep by targeting specific neurotransmitters and receptors in the brain. Some sleeping pills may also have sedative effects. Examples of hypnotics include benzodiazepines (e.g., temazepam), non-benzodiazepine receptor agonists (e.g., zolpidem, zopiclone), and melatonin receptor agonists (e.g., ramelteon). Key characteristics of sleeping pills: - Clinical purpose is to treat insomnia and sleep disorders - Help individuals fall asleep and stay asleep - May have sedative effects - Examples include benzodiazepines, non-benzodiazepine receptor agonists, and melatonin receptor agonists In summary, while both questions involve different forms or purposes of medications, they address different aspects of the pharmaceutical world. The first question discusses the distinctions between tablets and pills, which are both oral medication forms. The second question, however, compares sedatives and sleeping pills—two types of medications intended to serve different therapeutic purposes."},{"question":"The decisions taken over the last few days are - we think - very important.

Broadcasting began with AM radio, which came into popular use around 1920 with the spread of vacuum tube radio transmitters and receivers. Before this, all forms of electronic communication (early radio, telephone, and telegraph) were one-to-one, with the message intended for a single recipient. The term \\"broadcasting\\", borrowed from the agricultural method of sowing seeds in a field by casting them broadly about, was coined by either KDKA manager Frank Conrad or RCA historian George Clark around 1920 to distinguish this new activity of \\"one-to-many\\" communication; a single radio station transmitting to multiple listeners. - MCA, Inc.

Oil extraction and mining operations: This step involves the procurement of oil through various methods such as drilling, fracking, or offshore rigs. 2. Transportation of oil: Once the oil has been extracted, it is transported to different locations through pipelines, trucks, ships, or trains. 3. Oil purchases by homeowners: Homeowners buy oil from stores or local suppliers to heat their homes during cold weather. 4. Oil storage and placement: The homeowner stores the oil in their home and places it into the heating system, such as a stove. 5. Combustion of oil: The oil is lit on fire in the stove, producing heat as it burns. 6. Heat distribution: The warm air generated from the burning oil circulates throughout the house, creating a comfortable indoor temperature. Now, let's address the question: Suppose less cold weather occurs, how would this affect the need for more heat in the house? If there is less cold weather, the demand for heat in a house would decrease as the outdoor temperature would be higher than in colder conditions. As a result, homeowners would need to burn less oil to maintain a comfortable temperature inside their homes. This would subsequently reduce the amount of oil purchased and consumed by the homeowners. Therefore, the correct answer in this context would be B: Less. The occurrence of less cold weather would lead to a reduction in the need for more heat in a house, ultimately meaning less oil would need to be burned to maintain comfortable indoor temperatures."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given a context, a subject, a relation, and many options. Based on the context, from the options select the object entity that has the given relation with the subject. Answer with text (not indexes). Q: Context: Science fiction (often shortened to SF, sci-fi or scifi) is a genre of speculative fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a \\"literature of ideas.\\" It usually avoids the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have a grounding in science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection is now limited to hard science fiction., Time travel is the concept of movement (such as by a human) between certain points in time, analogous to movement between different points in space, typically using a hypothetical device known as a time machine, in the form of a vehicle or of a portal connecting distant points in time. Time travel is a recognized concept in philosophy and fiction, but traveling to an arbitrary point in time has a very limited support in theoretical physics, and usually only in conjunction with quantum mechanics or wormholes, also known as Einstein-Rosen bridges. In a more narrow sense, one-way time travel into the future via time dilation is a well-understood phenomenon within the frameworks of special relativity and general relativity, but advancing a large amount of time is not feasible with current technology. The concept was touched upon in various earlier works of fiction, but was popularized by H. G. Wells' 1895 novel \\"The Time Machine\\", which moved the concept of time travel into the public imagination, and it remains a popular subject in science fiction., A novelization (or novelisation) is a derivative novel that adapts the story of a work created for another medium, such as a film, TV series, comic strip or video game. Film novelizations were particularly popular before the advent of home video, but continue to find commercial success as part of marketing campaigns for major films. They are often written by accomplished writers based on an early draft of the film's script and on a tight deadline., For Love of Mother - Not ( 1983 ) is a science fiction novel written by Alan Dean Foster . The book is chronologically the first in the Pip and Flinx series , though it was written fourth , as a prequel to help flesh out Flinx 's early history ., Alan Dean Foster (born November 18, 1946) is an American writer of fantasy and science fiction, a prolific creator of and contributor to book series as well as the author of more than 20 standalone novels. He is especially prolific in his novelizations of film scripts., Speculative fiction is a broad umbrella genre denoting any narrative fiction with supernatural or futuristic elements; this encompasses the genres of science fiction, fantasy, horror, alternative history, magic realism, and superhero fiction, as well as combinations of the previous genres. It typically strays strongly from reality and so may feature fictional types of beings like mythical creatures and supernatural entities, technologies that do not exist in real life like time machines and interstellar spaceships, or magical or otherwise scientifically inexplicable elements. The term's popularity is sometimes attributed to Robert Heinlein, who referenced it in 1947 in an editorial essay, although there are prior mentions of speculative fiction, or its variant \\"speculative literature\\"., Del Rey Books is a branch of Ballantine Books, which is owned by Random House and, in turn, by Penguin Random House. It is a separate imprint established in 1977 under the editorship of author Lester del Rey and his wife Judy-Lynn del Rey. It specializes in science fiction and fantasy books, and formerly manga under its (now defunct) Del Rey Manga imprint. It publishes the \\"Star Wars\\" novels under the LucasBooks imprint (licensed from Lucasfilm, a subsidiary of The Walt Disney Studios division of The Walt Disney Company)., The Humanx Commonwealth is a fictional interstellar ethical/political entity featured in the science fiction novels of Alan Dean Foster. The Commonwealth takes its name from its two major sapient species, who jointly inhabit Commonwealth planets and administer both the political and religious/ethical aspects. They are the mammalian Humans of the planet Earth and the insectoid Thranx which dwell upon Hivehom. The Commonwealth is described as a progressive, well-intentioned liberal democracy spanning many star systems, and is somewhat similar to the United Federation of Planets from \\"Star Trek\\". The Humanx Commonwealth is notable for its portrayal of a humanalien relationship that is not just mutually beneficial but symbiotic, allowing an amalgamation of the two species., Philip Lynx, known by the nickname of \\"Flinx,\\" is a fictional character, an adventurous young man with unusual qualities in a series of books set in the \\"Humanx Commonwealth\\", written by Alan Dean Foster and published by Del Rey Books., The supernatural (Medieval Latin: \\"superntrlis\\": \\"supra\\" \\"above\\" + \\"naturalis\\" \\"natural\\", first used: 15201530 AD) includes all that cannot be explained by science or the laws of nature, including things characteristic of or relating to ghosts, gods, or other supernatural beings, or to things beyond nature., Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction., Subject: for love of mother-not, Relation: publisher, Options: (A) ballantine (B) creatures (C) del rey books (D) faster than light (E) naturalis (F) portal (G) star trek (H) success A:","response":"(C) del rey books"},{"question":"Generate a context and a hypothesis.","response":"Generating a context and a hypothesis requires attention to detail and careful consideration of the topic in question.

Yes or no? Answer: After four years of bloody combat that left over 600,000 soldiers dead and destroyed much of the South's infrastructure, the Confederacy collapsed, slavery was abolished, and the difficult Reconstruction process of restoring national unity and guaranteeing rights to the freed slaves began. Question: how did the civil war end Answer:","response":"The American Civil War, which lasted from 1861 to 1865, came to an end through a combination of military defeats, political developments, and the eventual surrender of Confederate forces. The war concluded with the collapse of the Confederacy, the abolition of slavery, and the initiation of the complex Reconstruction process aimed at restoring national unity and guaranteeing rights to the freed slaves. There were several key factors and events that contributed to the end of the American Civil War: 1. Military defeats of the Confederate forces: The Confederacy experienced several significant military losses in 1863 and 1864. Most importantly, the Union Army, under the leadership of General Ulysses S. Grant, achieved major victories at the battles of Vicksburg and Gettysburg in 1863. These victories weakened the Confederate forces and shifted the momentum of the war in favor of the Union. 2. The Anaconda Plan: The Union's strategic plan, known as the Anaconda Plan, aimed to strangle the Confederacy's economy and supply lines through a naval blockade and the control of the Mississippi River. By cutting off trade routes and supplies, the Union was able to severely weaken the Confederate economy and military capabilities. 3. Confederate states' internal divisions: Disagreements between states and the central government within the Confederacy caused political and logistical problems that further weakened its ability to fight and win the war. 4. The Emancipation Proclamation: In 1863, President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which declared freedom for all slaves within the Confederate states. This proclamation not only weakened the labor force that supported the Confederacy's war effort but also shifted the purpose of the war to include the abolishment of slavery, garnering greater support for the Union cause. 5. The 1864 presidential election: Despite initial concerns about Lincoln's reelection, he ultimately won a second term in office. This reaffirmed the Union's commitment to the war and ensured that the North would continue fighting until the Confederacy was defeated and slavery abolished. 6. Confederate surrender: In April 1865, following a series of military defeats, Confederate General Robert E. Lee retreated from Richmond, the Confederate capital, to avoid encirclement by Union forces. On April 9, 1865, Lee surrendered to General Grant at Appomattox Court House in Virginia, effectively marking the end of major combat operations in the Civil War. 7. Assassination of President Lincoln: Just days after the Confederate surrender at Appomattox, President Lincoln was assassinated on April 14, 1865, by Confederate sympathizer John Wilkes Booth. This shocking event further underscored the need for healing and reunification as a divided nation began the long process of Reconstruction. In conclusion, the American Civil War ended due to a combination of military victories by the Union forces, the weakening of Confederate resources and political unity, as well as the surrender of its key military leaders. The war's aftermath included the collapse of the Confederacy, the abolition of slavery, and the initiation of the complex Reconstruction process aimed at restoring national unity and guaranteeing rights to the freed slaves."},{"question":"Write an article based on this summary: Thousands of people in Argentina have walked out of work for an hour in protest over the horrific rape and murder of a teenage girl.","response":"Title: Argentinians Unite for Change, Demanding Justice for Brutal Rape and Murder of Teenage Girl Summary: Thousands of people in Argentina have walked out of work for an hour in protest over the horrific rape and murder of a teenage girl. --- Across Argentina, thousands of people came together to demand justice for a teenage girl who was brutally raped and murdered. The horrifying incident led to widespread protests, with citizens calling for an immediate end to gender-based violence. The teenage girl, found dead and mutilated in Buenos Aires, shocked the nation and brought attention to the pervasive issue of violence against women in Argentina. Demonstrators walked out of work for an hour, many dressed in black, to express their disgust at the crime and their resolve to see the issue addressed. Argentina's grim reality with gender-based violence Argentina has long been grappling with the problem of gender-based violence. According to a report by the United Nations, Argentina has one of the highest rates of femicide in the region, with a woman dying at the hands of her partner or former partner every 29 hours. The widespread protests in Argentina further bring to light this troubling reality, with many activists arguing that not enough is being done to protect women from such violence. They allege that a culture of impunity exists, where perpetrators often evade justice. Protestors took to the streets of Buenos Aires, chanting slogans such as \\"Ni una menos\\" – which means \\"not one less\\" in Spanish – and demanding an end to the cycle of violence harming Argentina's women and girls. Government response to the protests In response to the massive public outcry, the Argentinian government has acknowledged the need for stronger measures to combat gender-based violence. They have committed to investing in efforts to increase public awareness, strengthen support services for survivors, and improve access to justice for the victims of violence. But activists argue that mere investment is not enough. They believe that the government needs to take active, meaningful, and consistent action in the fight against gender-based violence. Only then will there be a noticeable change in the rates of these horrific crimes. Calls for legal reforms and education Further to their demands for more robust government action, protesters have called for legal reforms and increased education on issues surrounding gender-based violence and consent. Activists believe that greater understanding of these issues will lead to a change in social attitudes, ultimately preventing future instances of violence. Some of the critical legal reforms proposed include introducing more stringent penalties for femicide and gender-based violence perpetrators, ensuring that victims can access the necessary support and protection, and closing the loopholes in the justice system that allow criminals to walk free. Moreover, activists are demanding that sex education in schools and communities include comprehensive discussions around consent and gender-based violence to raise awareness and foster understanding. A call for unity against gender-based violence As Argentina continues to face the harsh reality of gender-based violence, the protests and public outcry are an essential step toward demanding change. For improvements to come, it is paramount that people unite – across diverse communities, social groups, and levels of power – to effect transformative and lasting change. By standing together against such violence, Argentinians send a powerful message that these crimes are unacceptable in their society. They pave the way for all people, irrespective of their gender, to live without fear of violence, with respect and dignity. In conclusion, the brutal rape and murder of a teenage girl in Argentina have sparked widespread protests and brought much-needed attention to the issue of gender-based violence. Thousands of people walking out of work for an hour serves as a testament to the resolve of Argentina's citizens to ensure justice prevails and that the government takes action to protect vulnerable populations. Legal reforms and increased education on consent and gender-based violence are essential steps to turning the tide against these abhorrent crimes that have troubled the nation for far too long."},{"question":"Olette kuitenkin varmasti tietoinen myös niistä lukuisista syistä, joiden vuoksi nykyinen hintataso on yksinkertaisesti kestämätön.

To get a peek at the inside of the salmon, use just the tip of a sharp knife to push into it about halfway down. You can use a fork, but they usually do more damage to the salmon, which may mar your presentation. While the fish should be an opaque white, beige, or brown on the outside depending on the cooking method, it should still be a slightly translucent pink in the center. If the center of the salmon is opaque, it’s likely overcooked. If the center is completely translucent, it likely needs to cook further. You don’t want the salmon to flake. If it flakes, it’s likely overcooked and dried out. Instead, the salmon should resist flaking but give way and pull apart into pieces when you press the knife into it. If the salmon is opaque on the outside and slightly translucent on the inside and gives slightly when you poke it, it’s likely done. It will still continue to cook for several minutes off the heat, so remove it from the stove, oven, or grill, and allow it to sit for about 5 minutes before serving. Because the salmon continues to cook off the heat, it's okay if you remove when it's slightly under cooked. If you wait until the center is a slightly translucent pink and the fish gives way easily with the fork, it should be perfectly done after it sits. Summary:","response":"1.

A: A:","response":"The only invertebrates that can fly are insects. Insects are a class within the phylum Arthropoda, which also includes other invertebrates like crustaceans, arachnids, and myriapods. However, insects are unique among invertebrates in their ability to fly. Many insects have two pairs of wings, which are lightweight, flexible, and powered by a complex system of muscles that enable flight. Insects have evolved flight through various mechanisms, allowing them to navigate their environment, escape predators, and explore new habitats. The ability to fly has contributed to the remarkable diversity of insect species, with over a million known species of insects and an estimated total number of species between 5-10 million. One of the insect groups most renowned for their flying capabilities is the Odonata, which includes dragonflies and damselflies. These insects are agile and powerful fliers, possessing excellent maneuverability and exceptional predatory skills. Dragonflies are particularly known for their rapid and agile flight, able to reach speeds of up to 34 mph (55 km/h), hover, and change directions instantly. Another notable group of flying insects is the Lepidoptera, consisting of moths and butterflies. These insects are not only essential pollinators, but they also possess an incredible diversity of wing patterns and morphological adaptations for flight. Butterflies and moths use their flight for a variety of purposes, including searching for suitable host plants, finding mates, and evading predators. Hymenoptera, which includes bees, ants, and wasps, also rely heavily on flight to navigate their environments and perform crucial roles such as pollination and predation. Bees, both solitary and social, mainly use their flying abilities to collect pollen and nectar, while many wasp species hunt other insects as a food source. Diptera, the true flies, form another critical group of flying invertebrates. This group includes species like house flies, mosquitoes, and midges. Dipterans' unique flight mechanism allows them sustained hovering and impressive aerial acrobatics. Mosquitoes, in particular, use their flight to locate hosts for feeding on blood, which is necessary for reproduction in many species. Lastly, Coleoptera, or beetles, is another prominent group of flying insects. With over 375,000 described species, beetles are the most diverse group of insects due in part to their ability to fly. Some notable examples include ladybugs, fireflies, and June beetles. In summary, insects are the only invertebrates capable of flight, thanks to their lightweight and flexible wings and complex muscle systems. This ability has allowed for a remarkable level of diversity and adaptability within the class, leading to the evolution and success of numerous species across a wide range of ecosystems. Therefore, flight plays a significant role in insect ecology, aiding in crucial functions such as predation, pollination, and escaping predators."},{"question":"Question: - Suns heat enters atmosphere - Green house gases enter from the earth - Heat is trapped in atmosphere - Different things on earth are hotter What might be the last step of the process?

Financial experts report that many lenders in recent years have pushed adjustable interest rates without really telling people what they are. A borrower should know whether their loan includes a fixed or adjustable interest rate.","response":"Alright buddy, let's talk about how to compare loan rates. It's like choosing between two different candies, and you want to pick the one that's the best deal for you! In our case, we have two types of candy (or interest rates), fixed and adjustable. Fixed interest rate is like your favorite candy that has the same taste all the time. The cost of this candy will always stay the same, so you know exactly how much you'll pay. Adjustable interest rate is like a surprise candy. It can change its taste from time to time. The cost of this candy may go up or down, so it's a bit harder to know how much you'll need to prepare to pay for it. Now, generally, fixed interest rates can be better if you like consistency and being confident about your payments. Adjustable interest rates can sometimes give you a better starting deal, but it's not guaranteed to stay that way. Sometimes, people who give you the candies (or loans) might not explain about these two types very well. So, when you're comparing different loan rates, remember to know which kind of candy (interest rate) you're choosing and how much it costs! When you understand the difference between these two, you can make a better decision about which candy (loan) to choose."},{"question":"(1) The building was expanded in 1967 , and a second major expansion was completed in 1999 .

Here are possible answers to this question: - driving - getting tired - traffic - accidents - ticket I believe the correct choice is \\"accidents\\", here's why: Answer:","response":"Moving cars without looking is most likely to result in accidents. This rationale is predicated on the fundamental axiom of safe driving, which codifies cautious observation and awareness as prerequisite requirements. Driving entails much more than simply propelling a vehicle down a stretch of road. It is about maneuvering safely amidst other road users, which include drivers, passengers, pedestrians, cyclists, and even animals. Key to achieving this paramount end of safety is the obligation on part of the driver to visually discern his/her surroundings at all times. This includes vigilance for any sudden incidents or changes in the road situation, such as children running onto the street, a car in front suddenly braking, shifting traffic signs, or even changing weather conditions. \\"Moving cars without looking\\", therefore, directly contradicts this safety imperative. An inevitable consequence is the heightened risk of automobile accidents. For instance, a car driver backing up without looking may hit another vehicle, a pedestrian, a cyclist, or a stationary object. A driver changing lanes on the freeway without looking might crash into a car occupying the blind spot. Or a driver turning into a road without looking can collide with oncoming traffic. On the other hand, while driving indeed involves moving cars, the key aspect is the necessity of looking and observing to do it safely and effectively. Therefore, it's not the most suitable answer. Similarly, \\"getting tired\\" may be a possible outcome of long-term driving but is not directly related to the act of moving cars without looking. \\"Traffic\\" is a broader term denoting the general flow of vehicles on a roadway and doesn't directly correlate with moving cars without looking. Finally, \\"ticket\\" depicts a legal consequence of unsafe actions or traffic rule violations that are observed and penalized by law enforcement; while this is possible, it is a secondary outcome that follows the potential accident that might occur as a direct result of not looking. Conclusively, for safety and legal reasons, always looking before moving cars is of utmost importance. If not observed, the most immediate and dangerous consequence is likely \\"accidents.\\" Hence, it is the most accurate answer to the question provided."},{"question":"Demi Moore's character in the movie was selected for the SEALs because of her looks.

Fatty acid monomers that are bound to glycerol backbones make up a type of lipid known as triglycerides, or triacylglycerols. Triglycerides are an essential component of our diet and are the primary form of stored energy in living organisms. They are vastly different from proteins, as proteins are composed of amino acids, while triglycerides consist of a glycerol molecule and three fatty acids. Triglycerides' structure comprises a glycerol backbone, which is an alcohol with three carbons, each having a hydroxyl group (-OH). Each hydroxyl group of glycerol is esterified with a fatty acid. The fatty acids in triglycerides can be of varying lengths and levels of saturation, which affects the triglyceride's properties, such as its melting point and chemical stability. In a triglyceride molecule, the fatty acid component consists of a long hydrocarbon chain with a carboxyl group (-COOH) at one end. Fatty acids can be saturated or unsaturated, determined by the presence of double bonds in the hydrocarbon chain. Saturated fatty acids have single carbon-carbon (C-C) bonds, while unsaturated fatty acids contain one or more double carbon-carbon (C=C) bonds. When a triglyceride has one or more unsaturated fatty acids, it is called an unsaturated fat, while when it is comprised entirely of saturated fatty acids, it is classified as a saturated fat. Triglycerides serve multiple functions in living organisms, including energy storage, insulation, and protection. They are primarily stored in specialized cells called adipocytes, which compose adipose tissue. When an organism requires energy, triglycerides are broken down into glycerol and free fatty acids, which can be further metabolized to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to fulfill energy needs. In summary, fatty acid monomers that are bound to glycerol backbones form a type of lipid called triglycerides (triacylglycerols). This structure is composed of a glycerol molecule and three fatty acid chains, and it plays essential roles in energy storage, insulation, and protection in living organisms. Triglycerides are distinct from proteins, which are made up of nitrogen-containing amino acids."},{"question":"These incoherent words threw the first glimpse of light on the meaning of her distress and penitence. I doubt if the best woman in Christendom would so reproach and abase herself, if convicted of even a worse sin than the secret use of those stimulants for which the \\"charny\\" is a Martial equivalent. No Martialist would dream of poisoning his blood and besotting his brain with alcohol in any form. But their opiates affect a race addicted to physical repose, to sensuous enjoyment rather than to sensual excitement, and to lucid intellectual contemplation, with a sense of serene delight as supremely delicious to their temperament as the dreamy illusions of haschisch to the Turk, the fierce frenzy of bhang to the Malay, or the wild excitement of brandy or Geneva to the races of Northern Europe. But as with the luxury of intoxication in Europe, so in Mars indulgence in these drugs, freely permitted to the one sex, is strictly forbidden by opinion and domestic rule to the other.

Only one teacher was acquitted of all charges. The 11 convicted represented teachers, testing coordinators and other administrators who were accused of participating in the conspiracy dating to 2005, motivated by pressure to meet federal and local standards to receive bonuses or keep their jobs in the Atlanta Public Schools district of about 50,000 students. A state investigation in 2011 found that educators gave answers to students or changed answers on tests after they were turned in. Evidence of cheating was found in 44 schools with nearly 180 educators involved, and investigators found teachers who tried to report it faced retaliation. A grand jury indicted 35 educators in March 2013 on charges including racketeering, false statements and theft. Many reached plea agreements, and some testified at the trial. Superintendent Beverly Hall never went to trial, successfully arguing she was too sick to mount a defense. She died last month of breast cancer. Hall insisted she was innocent and had no part in any cheating. But the educators said she was among those pressuring them to inflate students' scores to show gains in achievement — which were needed to meet federal benchmarks tied to extra funding. Defense attorneys argued those convicted should remain free until sentencing because they don't have prior records, have community ties and showed up to trial every day. However, only one was allowed to remain free on bond — teacher Shani Robinson — because she is expecting to give birth soon. \\"They are convicted felons as far as I'm concerned,\\" said Fulton County Superior Court Judge Jerry Baxter. \\"They have made their bed and they're going to have to lie in it.\\" Bob Rubin, the defense attorney for former elementary school principal Dana Evans, said he was angry the judge decided to take the convicted former educators into custody immediately. \\"I am shocked that he felt it necessary to do that,\\" Rubin said. \\"I felt it to be unnecessary and vindictive.\\" Prosecutors said the 12 former educators on trial were looking out for themselves, seeking bonuses for higher test scores rather than worrying about the education of the children they were charged with teaching. Defense attorneys said their clients were caught up in an overly broad prosecution that overreached in charging them with violating racketeering laws most often used for organized crime. The entire process was lengthy: The months-long trial began in August with more than six weeks of jury selection, and testimony concluded in late February. The criminal investigation by the Fulton County district attorney's office lasted nearly two years. The investigation involved at least 50 schools as well as hundreds of interviews with school administrators, staff, parents and students. Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard said it was the biggest and most complex case his office had ever handled. \\"Our entire effort in this case was simply to get our community to stop and take a look at the education system,\\" Howard said. The cheating came to light after The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that some scores were statistically improbable. Hall served as superintendent for more than a decade, which is rare for an urban schools chief. She was named Superintendent of the Year by the American Association of School Administrators in 2009 and credited with raising student test scores and graduation rates, particularly among the district's poor and minority students. But the award quickly lost its luster as her district became mired in the scandal. In a video message to schools staff before she retired, Hall warned that the state investigation launched by former Gov. Sonny Perdue would likely reveal \\"alarming\\" behavior. \\"It's become increasingly clear that a segment of our staff chose to violate the trust that was placed in them,\\" Hall said. \\"There is simply no excuse for unethical behavior and no room in this district for unethical conduct. I am confident that aggressive, swift action will be taken against anyone who believed so little in our students and in our system of support that they turned to dishonesty as the only option.\\" ||||| Guilty verdicts were reached for 11 of the 12 defendants in the Atlanta Public Schools CRCT cheating trial. Dessa Curb was the only defendant found not guilty on all charges. Listed below are the 12 educators that went to trial and what charges they were found guilty, or not guilty of: Racketeering - Guilty Influencing witnesses - Guilty Racketeering - Guilty Racketeering - Guilty False statements (2 counts) - Not Guilty False swearing - Not Guilty Racketeering - Guilty False statements & writings (3 counts) Not Guilty , Guilty, Guilty False swearing - Guilty Racketeering - Guilty Theft by taking - Not Guilty False statements & writing (2 counts) Guilty, Guilty Racketeering - Guilty False statements and writings - Not Guilty Theft by taking - Not Guilty Racketeering - Guilty False statements & writings (4 counts) - Not Guilty, Not Guilty, Not Guilty , Guilty Racketeering - Guilty False statements & writings (2 counts) - Guilty, Guilty False swearing (2 counts) - Guilty, Guilty Racketeering - Not Guilty False statements & writings (2 counts) - Not Guilty, Not Guilty Racketeering - Guilty False statements & writings - Guilty Racketeering - Guilty False statements and writings (2 counts) - Guilty, Guilty Racketeering - Guilty False statements & writings (2 counts) - Guilty, Guilty All of these educators have been accused of racketeering, in addition to charges ranging from theft by taking to making false statements. Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed issued the following statement after the verdict Wednesday afternoon: “The APS cheating scandal marked one of the darkest periods in the life of our city. I am hopeful that with the jury's verdict today, we can finally close this chapter and move forward with the education and development of our young people. I want to thank Judge Baxter and the Court for their service.” Unlike 21 others, the 12 educators on trial Wednesday did not take plea deals. Now their fates are sealed. \\"They have made their bed, and they're going to have to lie in it,\\" Judge Jerry Baxter said as he sent most of the educators directly to jail. Ten of the 11 educators found guilty were booked into the Fulton County jail. The men were taken to the jail in northwest Atlanta, while the women were taken to the South Jail Annex for women in Union City. Robinson was the only educator found guilty who was not immediately taken to jail due to her pregnancy. According to a spokesperson with Fulton County police, the 10 educators who were taken to jail Wednesday were all processed as any other inmate would be, including being searched, fingerprinted, given a medical screening, having their booking photograph taken and given inmate uniforms. A total of 35 educators were indicted in March of 2013. Prosecutors said they conspired to cheat or concealed cheating to boost test scores for financial gain. The case, which grabbed national headlines, stemmed from a 2009 investigation that revealed system wide cheating on the Criterion Referenced Competency Test. The test, which was issued to students in the APS system, measured student aptitude statewide. District Attorney Paul L. Howard, Jr. called the verdicts a victory for children. “When we indicted this case our goal was not to make a spectacle of the Atlanta Public School system. It was our attempt to encourage the people in our community to stop and take an honest look at what was happening in our schools and how changing test scores was ultimately harming our children,” says Howard. “We stand here today proud of our efforts, proud that we embarked upon a journey of truth, regardless of how long or arduous the task. We are certain today that our work has not been in vain.” Fulton County prosecutors said the cheating began under the leadership of former superintendent Doctor Beverly Hall.Hall became superintendent in 1999 and submitted her resignation letter in 2010 after cheating allegations surfaced. She officially stepped down in June of 2011. Hall had Stage 4 cancer and never made it to trial. She died on March 2. Atlanta Board of Education Statement This has been a sad and tragic chapter for Atlanta Public Schools that has now come to a close. It has been a painful time for our students, families, employees and the City. However, since Day One 2015, APS has remained focused on the students under the new student-centered Superintendent, Dr. Meria J. Carstarphen, and the new leadership in the Atlanta Board of Education. Reforms began almost three years ago and additional ones have been created under this new leadership to make sure something like this never happens again. Challenges remain, for sure, but we are making progress every day and there is great reason to be optimistic. Dr. Carstarphen and the school board continue to work together to create a new culture at APS, that is a caring one of trust and collaboration where every student graduates ready for college and career. Last fall, the district established a new vision of a high-performing school district where students love to learn, educators inspire, families engage and the community trusts the system. The district remains dedicated to always putting the needs of our students first. Copyright 2015 WGCL-TV (Meredith Corporation).

Output cannot be any other value than the four values. Note that if the user asks for the prices of items provided at a pub, restaurant or coffee shop but doesn't mention the price range they are looking for then the correct classification will be Don't Care. If the user does not mention a particular price, the correct classification will be Don't Care. Problem:System: 'Thank you for calling the Cambridge Information system.

Drawing upon her own life story, a story of discrimination shared by too many women across America, Lilly Ledbetter delivered a rousing speech as only she can. Ledbetter, the face of the fight for women's equality, reminded us all just how far we have come in the last four years. She framed fair pay as both an economic and moral issue. She reminded us all of President Barack Obama's first act in office, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which he signed thinking of his mother, wife and two young daughters. Ledbetter, a former manager at a tire plant, knows that her family was deprived of thousands of dollars because of discrimination, money that could have been put back into the U.S. economy. As my mother's son and the brother to two older and wiser sisters, this issue resonates particularly deeply with me. Equal pay for equal work should not be a controversial issue in the 21st Century, but like the debate over contraception and choice, somehow the Republican Party has reignited a debate that should have ended decades ago. Just to be clear, my sisters would scoff if my work was ever called equal to theirs. In addition, first lady Michelle Obama reminded Americans that her most important title is still \\"Mom in Chief.\\" She identified herself as yet another mother struggling with the difficulties of parenting who cares more than anything about the country that she will leave to her children. Michelle Obama did not need to shout, \\"I love you, women\\" in order to be understood by the women of America; her story is their story. While women will surely play a crucial role in this election, Tuesday night served as a reminder that Obama's commitment to women is not political -- it's personal. America will never succeed if half of its citizens don't have an ally in the White House. Highlights:","response":"1. The Democratic Party shows a strong dedication to women's equality. 2. Lilly Ledbetter, a person who fights for women's rights, gave an inspiring speech about fair pay. 3.

Dreams may work the same way for a messy brain, helping you learn by organizing memories and ideas. To test how much dreams can help learning, Robert Stickgold had some students play a shape-fitting game called Tetris for a few hours and then go to sleep. Soon they were dreaming of falling Tetris shapes. Interestingly, the worst Tetris players had the most Tetris dreams and improved their game the most. Similar tests have shown the same results for all kinds of skills. As we dream, many important tasks are getting done. The brain decides what to keep and what to forget. It is connecting new experiences to older learning. In fact, the brain is learning all night long. Another important task of dreams may be to help us deal with emotions . At night, emotions are in the driver's seat. People who have had an upsetting experience often dream about it afterward. Often the dream event changes somehow--another way the brain tries to make the memory less upset. So if your best friend moves away, you might dream that you're the one who's moving. In fact, dreams have a proven power to improve mood, and people who dream about what's bothering them usually feel better sooner than those who don't.

Google brings us abundant “free” content while raking in billions from the ads alongside their search results. The Pirate Bay delivers “free” music and movies to teenagers while living off the revenue from banner ads. But then there is television. One of the oldest free mediums, it has something to teach us about free information: It can be expensive. And, perhaps, we would be better off if we were allowed to pay for it. The TV spats of the past few weeks  between Cablevision and the Walt Disney Company over payments for ABC, and between Time Warner and the News Corporation over Fox  suggest that the future lies in the opposite direction from free. The most recent tussle was over Disney’s demand that Cablevision pay something between 50 cents and 1 per subscriber per month, according to news reports, to pipe ABC to Cablevision’s three million subscribers in the New York metropolitan region. Historically, cable companies have not had to pay for broadcast channels. They compensated broadcasters by buying access to sister networks. Cablevision says it pays Disney 200 million a year for about a dozen channels, including ESPN and the Disney Channel. On Sunday, as talks hit an impasse, Disney cut ABC’s signal from Cablevision for almost 21 hours, including 14 minutes of the Oscars  the second-highest ranked program on TV by ratings after the Super Bowl. The signal was restored by a tentative, undisclosed deal. If I were a Cablevision subscriber, I would probably want to pay. Compared with some of the other costs of free TV, 1 a month doesn’t seem too expensive. In fact, for the right broadcast, I would pay even more. Americans watch 153 hours of TV a month, on average, according to a Nielsen survey. On prime time, ABC has a 9 percent share. At 1 a month, a rough, back-of-the-envelope estimate (assuming families watch TV together) would suggest Disney wants, at most, 7 cents an hour from the average Cablevision subscriber to watch its shows. Compare that with today’s price of TV. Cablevision’s basic “family cable” package costs 55.95 a month, which works out at most to 37 cents an hour per home. That is cheap compared with the real price we pay for television: 18 minutes out of every hour that we are expected to spend watching ads. Those 18 minutes are much more valuable to me and you than they are to ABC. A study in 2009 estimated that advertisers paid about 230,000 for a 30-second spot on ABC’s “Desperate Housewives.” That amounts to 79 cents an hour for each of the 10.6 million homes plugged into the show on Sunday nights. But if average hourly wages are 22.05 an hour, 18 minutes of the average workers’ time are worth 6.60. Imagine a world in which information isn’t free. Your TV set is fitted with a coin slot  or a PayPal account. Wouldn’t you rather pay 79 cents for an hourlong show to get rid of the ads? Even the 50 or so national commercials on the Oscars, for which ABC reportedly charged up to 1.5 million per spot, amount to about 1.80 for each of the 41.3 million viewers. While we’re at it, why not add 37 cents and ditch the family cable bundle and its dozens of unwatched networks? We could even throw in 7 more cents for Disney. It seems to be a better deal than 55.95 a month, plus 18 minutes an hour. Technology might move us inevitably in this direction. Broadcast TV networks are badgering cable systems for money because falling ad revenues are forcing them to find new sources of income. Digital video recorders that offer customers the ability to strip out commercials could hasten the trend. If we’re lucky, we’ll get a world in which TV is not free, but we will only pay for it when we want to watch it. What are the most important parts of this news article?","response":"The most important parts of this news article can be summarized as follows: 1. The article highlights the debate around \\"free\\" media and the illusion that the internet has created regarding the cost of information. It argues that television, as an older medium, can teach us valuable lessons about the actual costs of content. 2. The article discusses recent disputes between Cablevision and Walt Disney Company as well as between Time Warner and News Corporation over payments for broadcast channels. These conflicts demonstrate the increasing need for revenue generation in the media industry and a shift away from the concept of \\"free\\" content. 3. The article provides an analysis of the costs associated with cable TV packages and the amounts that networks are demanding from cable providers for their content. It argues that, in comparison to the costs of free TV, paying a small amount per channel might not be as expensive as it seems. 4. The article explores the idea of a world in which information is not free and suggests that it might be more appealing to pay a small fee per content piece rather than being subjected to advertisements. This could result in a more tailored and efficient viewing experience. 5. The article also mentions the potential impact of technology, such as digital video recorders, on the shift towards a pay-per-view model in the television industry.

Context: I'm not good at sticking to the rules, not even the ones I set myself. I'm really terrible with the rules set by others, especially companies. Even as a child, I could never stay inside the lines in colouring books. Some of you might put this down to poor hand-eye coordination, but I maintain that I was a rule-breaker right from the beginning. One of my roles as an engineer with a multiplicity of companies was to set up projects, define the scope of the work, contract the work out and manage the project. I was setting up a robot-based manufacturing cell for the company in the business of making early cellphones. The cell design required some equipment to be designed and built from scratch, so I got a local designer, Fergus, to give me a quote and got him started on the work. Now, any project will run over budget and take longer than planned and the contractor may come back for more money. And so it was with this designer; he wasn't really vocal about it, but he indicated that the work did take a lot more time and expense than he's originally budgeted. My usual reaction to these things is that this is not my problem. Most of the companies I've work for have lost money, so why should I give a rat's ass if some other company comes up a little short? In this case though, I liked Fergus and, as he was really a one-man operation, I decided to cut him some slack. But first, I had to get permission from my boss to drop another few grand into Fergus's jeans. My boss refused. Having someone tell me I can't do something really brings out my dark side; especially around the time of the full moon. Not long before, we had just waved a fond(-ish) farewell to our president as he was going on to greener fields. As a parting gift, the company bought him either a boat or a motor home, I forget which, and equipped it with three of their cell phones.

It's very intense, and the closest I've come to crying in a movie in quite some time. That is a credit to Adam Sandler, who delivers a magnificent performance on many levels, and who probably deserves an Oscar nom for it, were it not coming out so early in the year. Don Cheadle gives his usual superb performance playing the straight man to Adam's disturbed. There is some humor, but most of it is really only funny in comparison to the tearjerking moments, as Adam deals with his loss and Don struggles to help him. Adam plays two levels very well... when he is mentally stable he is funny and likable, but when he is, well, less stable he's powerful and dark. I recommend it for anyone who likes intense mental dramas about difficult friendship and loss.","response":"The sentiment of this text is positive.

Could you help me answer this question? If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\". Plot title: Cape Fear Movie plot: After spending eight years in prison for rape, Max Cady (Robert Mitchum) is released. He promptly tracks down Sam Bowden (Gregory Peck), a lawyer whom he holds personally responsible for his conviction because Sam interrupted his attack and testified against him. Cady begins to stalk and subtly threaten Bowden's family. He kills the Bowden family dog, though Sam cannot prove Cady did it. A friend of Bowden's, police chief Mark Dutton (Martin Balsam), attempts to intervene on Bowden's behalf, but he cannot prove Cady guilty of any crime. Bowden hires private detective Charlie Sievers (Telly Savalas). Cady brutally attacks a promiscuous young woman named Diane Taylor (Barrie Chase) when she brings him home, but neither the private eye nor Bowden can persuade her to testify. Bowden hires three thugs to beat up Cady and persuade him to leave town, but the plan backfires when Cady gets the better of all three. Cady's lawyer vows to have Bowden disbarred. Afraid for his wife Peggy (Polly Bergen) and 14-year-old daughter Nancy (Lori Martin), Bowden takes them to their houseboat in Cape Fear. In an attempt to trick Cady, Bowden makes it seem as though he has gone to a completely different location. He fully expects Cady to follow his wife and daughter, and he plans on killing Cady to end the battle. A local deputy and he hide nearby, but Cady realizes the deputy is there and kills him. Eluding Bowden, Cady first attacks Mrs. Bowden on the boat, causing Bowden to go to her rescue. Meanwhile, Cady swims back to shore to attack the daughter. Bowden realizes what has happened and also swims ashore. The two men engage in a final violent fight on the riverbank. Bowden overpowers Cady, but decides not to kill him, preferring to let him spend the rest of his life in jail. The film ends with the Bowden family sitting together on a boat the next morning.

The process depends on a muscle called the diaphragm. This is a large, sheet-like muscle below the lungs. Inhaling, or breathing in, occurs when the diaphragm muscle tightens. This increases the size of the chest. This too decreases air pressure inside the lungs. This action allows air and gases to enter the lungs. Exhaling, or breathing out, occurs when the diaphragm muscle relaxes. This decreases the size of the chest. This increases air pressure inside the lungs. This action allows for air to leave the lungs. When you inhale, air enters the respiratory system through your nose and ends up in your lungs, where gas exchange with the blood takes place. What happens to the air along the way? In the nose, mucus and hairs trap any dust or other particles in the air. The air is also warmed and moistened. Next, air passes through a passageway that is connected to the windpipe. The air then finds its way to the lungs. In the chest, the windpipe splits so that air enters both the right and left lung. Question: \\"What is located below the lungs?\\" Response: \\"Biceps\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct?","response":"No, the response to the question is not factually correct. According to the paragraph, the diaphragm, a large, sheet-like muscle, is located below the lungs, not the biceps."},{"question":"Q: Given the sentence, generate \\"yes, and\\" response. \\"Yes, and\\" is a rule-of-thumb in improvisational comedy that suggests that a participant in a dialogue should accept what another participant has stated (\\"Yes\\") and then expand on that line of thought or context (\\"and...\\"). 1 In short, a \\"Yes, and\\" is a dialogue exchange in which a speaker responds by adding new information on top of the information/setting that was constructed by another speaker. Note that a \\"Yes, and\\" does not require someone explicitly saying 'yes, and...' as part of a dialogue exchange, although it could be the case if it agrees with the description above. There are many ways in which a response could implicitly/explicitly agree to the prompt without specifically saying 'yes, and...'. You're talking to Bulene, and I'm saying it was an accident. She wrapped her hands around her throat and she went to town. A:","response":"The task here is to generate a response according to the principle of \\"Yes, and\\" in improvisational comedy. This means you need to agree with the situation presented in the dialogue, and then add to it. Step 1: Understand the scenario In the given situation, a character is talking to someone named Bulene, explaining that an event (perhaps some sort of harm caused to someone else) was an accident. The mentioned character has said, \\"She wrapped her hands around her throat and she went to town,\\" which suggests something intense or unexpected happened. Step 2: Accept the Scenario In the response, it's important that you affirm the scenario - that it was an accident - as described by the speaker. You do this by agreeing with what the speaker has said, which means acknowledging what was directly expressed (the accident and its details). Step 3: Add to the scenario This next part is where the \\"and\\" from \\"Yes, and\\" comes in. Here, you'll add new elements to the situation. You might add information about how the characters respond next or what the present situation or feeling is like. Following these guidelines, a possible response could look something like this: \\"Yes, Bulene, that was certainly an unfortunate accident.
