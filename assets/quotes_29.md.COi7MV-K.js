Even after we parted , there was a part of me that thought this was a dream or I had halucinated the entire thing . By the time I 'd gotten back to the clinic , I had pinched myelf a few dozen times and still had n't woken up . Question Where may I have went after seeing Ranger ? Answer:","response":"After seeing Ranger, you most likely continued your journey back to the clinic, as mentioned in the context. It is understandable that you found the encounter with Ranger quite shocking, especially considering it occurred while on your way to his memorial. This shocking and almost surreal experience may have left you feeling disoriented and questioning the reality of the situation. As you tried to process what had just happened, you might have attempted a variety of strategies to assure yourself that you were indeed awake and not dreaming or hallucinating. Pinching yourself multiple times was one such method you employed to ground yourself in reality. Despite these efforts, you still found it difficult to accept the bizarre twist of events. Once you reached the clinic, you may have sought out a confidante or a close acquaintance who you could discuss the situation with, in hopes of gaining some perspective or clarity. This person could be a fellow staff member, your supervisor, or even a friend within the clinic. Sharing your experience with someone else might help you determine whether the encounter with Ranger was rooted in reality or simply a figment of your imagination. Alternatively, you could have sought solace in a quiet and private location within the clinic. Here, you could take some time to gather your thoughts and reflect on everything that had transpired. Engaging in deep breathing exercises, meditation, or self-reflection might help ease your confusion or anxiety surrounding the situation. Another possibility is that after arriving at the clinic, you may have decided to further investigate what had truly happened with Ranger, especially regarding his supposed death and memorial. This intrigue might have led you to research news articles, obituaries, or any available records concerning the circumstances and authenticity of Ranger's demise. Inquiring with mutual acquaintances, family members, or friends of Ranger could have provided you with additional information that might explain or clarify the bewildering encounter. Ultimately, your actions following your encounter with Ranger were most likely guided by your emotional state, as well as your desire to find answers and make sense of the perplexing situation. Regardless of which path you chose, your main objective would have been to regain your sense of stability and peace of mind in the aftermath of such an uncanny event."},{"question":"Do these mean the same?

In April 2008 , Mountain Hardwear opened its first retail location in Seattle , and a retail shop in Portland , Oregon , Washington , opened on December 5 , 2008 .","response":"Although both sentences discuss the opening of Mountain Hardwear's first retail location and a subsequent store opening, they contain discrepancies in their details. Here are the differences and similarities between the two sentences: 1. Similarity: Both sentences mention that Mountain Hardwear opened its first retail location in April 2008. 2. Difference: The first sentence states that the first retail location was opened in Portland, Oregon, while the second sentence suggests it was opened in Seattle. 3. Similarity: Both sentences mention the opening of another Mountain Hardwear store on December 5, 2008. 4. Difference: The first sentence claims that the December 5, 2008, store opening was in Seattle, Washington. In contrast, the second sentence indicates that the store opened in Portland, Oregon, Washington - which is an incorrect amalgamation of two separate locations (Portland, Oregon, and Seattle, Washington). In summary, the two sentences both discuss the opening of a Mountain Hardwear store in April 2008 and another store on December 5, 2008. However, they differ in the specific locations of those openings. The correct information, based on the first sentence, is that Mountain Hardwear opened its first retail location in Portland, Oregon, in April 2008 and opened a store in Seattle, Washington, on December 5, 2008. The second sentence inaccurately combines information from the first sentence, leading to confusion about the stores' locations."},{"question":"Q:What is the missing first step of the following process: - The aluminum is collected - Taken to a treatment plant - The aluminum is sorted and cleaned ready for reprocessing - The aluminum is re-melted - Turned into molten aluminum - The aluminum is made into large blocks called ingots - The ingots are sent to mills to be rolled out - The rolled out product is made into new aluminum products.

It is the largest hospital system in Europe. It provides health care, teaching, research, prevention, education and emergency medical service in 52 branches of medicine. The hospitals receive more than 5.8 million annual patient visits.\\" Answer: Answer:","response":"Based on the context provided, there were fewer people employed by the public hospital system than annual patient visits in the city of Paris and its suburbs. The Assistance publique - Hôpitaux de Paris (AP-HP) employs more than 90,000 people, including practitioners, support personnel, and administrators. In contrast, the hospitals receive more than 5.8 million annual patient visits. The AP-HP is responsible for providing health care, teaching, research, prevention, education, and emergency medical services in 52 branches of medicine. It is considered the largest hospital system in Europe, with 44 hospitals under its management. These hospitals are well-equipped and staffed with competent employees to cater to the diverse health needs of the population. Although the number of employees in the AP-HP is significant, it is evident that the demand for healthcare services in the city of Paris and its suburbs is even greater, resulting in a higher number of patient visits annually. This disparity might be explained by several factors, including the population size of Paris and its suburbs, the need for multiple patient visits for ongoing treatments, the broad range of medical services offered, and the excellent reputation of the AP-HP, attracting patients from both within and outside the region. In conclusion, there were fewer people employed by the public hospital system (over 90,000) than annual patient visits (more than 5.8 million) in the city of Paris and its suburbs. This illustrates the immense demand for healthcare services and the efficient functioning of the AP-HP in managing a vast number of patients and providing quality healthcare to the population."},{"question":"Read this article and answer this question The Steelers traveled to London, England and were considered the visitor team against a Matt Cassel-led Vikings team.

In addition, Democrats cheered a turnout that could have major implications for next year's congressional midterm elections, when all 435 House seats and one-third of the Senate will be on the ballot. Democrats are pointing to exit polls in both Virginia and New Jersey that showed that anger at Trump was a major factor in stimulating Democrats to get to the polls. They also note Democratic gains in the battle for state delegate seats in Virginia, another sign of grass-roots enthusiasm that could help Democrats in races for lower-level offices across the country. In New Jersey, Governor-elect Phil Murphy, a Democrat, saw his election as a direct rebuke of the Republican president. \\"New Jersey sent an unmistakable message to the entire nation. We are better than this!\\" Murphy told cheering supporters at his victory rally. In Virginia, Democrat Ralph Northam defeated Republican Ed Gillespie in a campaign that focused, in part, on Trump and his policies, especially on immigration. At a news conference Wednesday, Northam said his victory showed that Virginians had a message for the country and the world. \\"The divisiveness, the hatred, the bigotry, the politics that is tearing this country apart, that is not the United States of America that people love and it certainly not the Commonwealth of Virginia that they love,\\" he said. Political analysts said Democratic enthusiasm and a focus on Trump were clearly on display in both states. \\"We have heard for months and months about all this energy on the left.

Pick your answer from: [-] no. [-] yes.","response":"Yes, both questions are essentially the same, as they aim to understand why human red blood cells lack a nucleus. The slight difference in phrasing does not change the core intention of the inquiry. To provide an answer: 1. As an AI, I begin by understanding the primary components and functions of red blood cells (RBCs) to provide context for their unique structure. 2. It's important to recognize that the main function of RBCs is to transport oxygen from the lungs to the tissues and organs while also carrying carbon dioxide back to the lungs for removal. 3. To properly address the question, I consider that RBCs go through a process called enucleation during their maturation in the bone marrow. This process involves the expulsion of the nucleus from the cell. 4. Understanding why enucleation occurs, I consider the possible benefits of this characteristic: a. Without a nucleus, RBCs have more space to carry hemoglobin, which binds to oxygen molecules and allows efficient transport throughout the body. b. The absence of a nucleus prevents RBCs from performing typical cellular functions like cell division, which contributes to their short lifespan (approximately 120 days). This ensures that older, less efficient RBCs are continuously replaced to maintain optimal oxygen transport. 5. I finalize my response by summarizing the key points, which highlight the significance of RBCs lacking a nucleus: to maximize oxygen-carrying capacity and maintain a short lifespan for efficient oxygen transport throughout the human body."},{"question":"Instructions: In this task, you're given a review from Amazon and your task is to generate the name of the category of the product based on the review given by the user.

Keep your food journal with you wherever you go. Use your scale. Choose a token that reminds you to stay on track. Purchase high-quality clothing for yourself when you reach your goal weight. Article:","response":"Title: Keep Your Goals in Sight by Maintaining a Food Journal and Rewarding Your Achievements Introduction: Weight management and maintaining a healthy lifestyle are challenging tasks for many people. As the temptation to consume unhealthy food or indulge in an excessive amount of treats continues to grow, finding a way to stay on track with one's diet can be a significant hurdle to overcome. One proven strategy involves keeping a food journal and rewarding oneself for achieving milestones on the journey to better health. In this article, we'll discuss why recording everything you eat can be a game-changer and suggest some meaningful rewards to motivate yourself along the way. So, let's get started with the power of keeping a food journal. The Benefits of a Food Journal: 1. Track what you eat: By meticulously logging each meal, snack, and even beverage you consume throughout the day, you'll be able to assess your eating habits better. This level of accountability can help you make better food choices and identify patterns or triggers that may lead to overeating or indulging in unhealthy options. 2. Monitor portion sizes: Using a food scale can be a simple and effective way to ensure that you are consuming the right amount of food. Many individuals may be surprised to discover that their regular serving sizes are larger than recommended. A food journal will help you adjust portion sizes and provide an accurate picture of your daily caloric intake. 3. Emotional eating awareness: Recording not only what you eat but also how you feel before, during, and after each meal can be beneficial in identifying emotional eating patterns. This information will empower you to replace unhealthy coping mechanisms with healthier alternatives. Staying Accountable with a Token System: For added motivation, introduce a token system to remind you of your long-term goals and commitment to a healthier lifestyle. For example, you can: 1. Choose an item that symbolizes your dedication to weight management and place it in a prominent location, like a kitchen countertop or desk at work. It should be something that resonates with you emotionally and encourages you to make better choices. 2. Use a daily checklist to keep yourself accountable for meals, snacks, and exercise routines. Regularly updating and reviewing your progress will reinforce healthy habits and help you track your milestones effectively. Celebrate Your Success: When you reach your goal weight or achieve other significant milestones on your journey, it's crucial to reward yourself in a meaningful and motivating way. Consider: 1. Treating yourself to high-quality clothing: Invest in some clothing items that not only look great but also make you feel fabulous when you wear them. These purchase decisions are ideal rewards as they reinforce the importance of maintaining your goal weight and helps you look and feel your best. 2. Enjoy a self-care spa day: Stress and fatigue can sometimes contribute to poor eating habits. Rewarding yourself with a relaxing, rejuvenating spa day can help you reset your mindset, nurture your body, and reconnect with your goals. Conclusion: Monitoring your eating habits through a food journal, staying accountable with a token system, and celebrating your accomplishments with meaningful rewards can provide you with the tools and motivation necessary to maintain a healthy lifestyle and manage your weight effectively. As you embark on this journey of self-improvement, remember to remain patient, embrace small victories, and celebrate each milestone you achieve."},{"question":"Question: What is the final step of the following process: - Coal is burned in a boiler - Steam is produced under pressure - Flows into a turbine - The turbine spins Answer:","response":"The final step of the process is the generation of electricity.

Sean Penn was born on August 17, 1960, in Santa Monica, California. Both Sean and Madonna were successful in their respective fields of acting and music, making them one of the most famous couples of the 1980s. Sean Penn began his acting career in the late 1970s, initially appearing in television roles and small parts in films. He rose to prominence in the early 1980s with his breakout performance in the teen comedy-drama \\"Fast Times at Ridgemont High,\\" where he played the iconic surfer dude character, Jeff Spicoli. Penn garnered further recognition for his roles in \\"Bad Boys\\" (1983) and \\"The Falcon and the Snowman\\" (1985). Madonna, on the other hand, was an aspiring dancer, singer, and actress when she moved to New York City in the late 1970s. Her eponymous debut album was released in 1983, and it was followed by the hit album \\"Like a Virgin\\" in 1984, which catapulted her to superstardom. Madonna became an influential pop icon, known for her distinctive voice, musical versatility, strong visual identity, and unique fashion sense. Sean Penn and Madonna's relationship was intensely scrutinized by the media.

He was a key figure in the introduction of the Indian philosophies of Vedanta and Yoga to the Western world and is credited with raising interfaith awareness, bringing Hinduism to the status of a major world religion during the late 19th century. He was a major force in the revival of Hinduism in India, and contributed to the concept of nationalism in colonial India. Vivekananda founded the Ramakrishna Math and the Ramakrishna Mission. Vivekananda propagated that the essence of Hinduism was best expressed in Adi Shankara's Advaita Vedanta philosophy. Nevertheless, following Ramakrishna, and in contrast to Advaita Vedanta, Vivekananda believed that the Absolute is both immanent and transcendent. According to Anil Sooklal, Vivekananda's neo-Advaita \\"reconciles Dvaita or dualism and Advaita or non-dualism\\". Vivekananda summarised the Vedanta as follows, giving it a modern and Universalistic interpretation: Each soul is potentially divine. The goal is to manifest this Divinity within by controlling nature, external and internal. Do this either by work, or worship, or mental discipline, or philosophy--by one, or more, or all of these--and be free. This is the whole of religion. Doctrines, or dogmas, or rituals, or books, or temples, or forms, are but secondary details. Nationalism was a prominent theme in Vivekananda's thought. He believed that a country's future depends on its people, and his teachings focused on human development. He wanted \\"to set in motion a machinery which will bring noblest ideas to the doorstep of even the poorest and the meanest\\". Vivekananda linked morality with control of the mind, seeing truth, purity and unselfishness as traits which strengthened it. He advised his followers to be holy, unselfish and to have shraddha (faith). Vivekananda supported brahmacharya (celibacy), believing it the source of his physical and mental stamina and eloquence. He emphasised that success was an outcome of focused thought and action; in his lectures on Raja Yoga he said, \\"Take up one idea. Make that one idea your life - think of it, dream of it, live on that idea. Let the brain, muscles, nerves, every part of your body, be full of that idea, and just leave every other idea alone. This is the way to success, that is the way great spiritual giants are produced\\".

They aimed to embody his ideas in their daily lives, including the practice of brahmacharya (celibacy) and focusing their thoughts and actions on a single idea for success.

Adam Shergold. PUBLISHED:. 09:59 EST, 9 November 2012. |. UPDATED:. 14:51 EST, 9 November 2012. About eight thousand refugees fleeing violence in Syria have crossed into Turkey in the last 24 hours, a Turkish foreign ministry official said on Friday. It followed an offensive by rebels, who have driven President Bashar al-Assad's troops from much of northern Syria, on a frontier town on Thursday night. The rebels are now in control of a number of crossing points on the Syrian-Turkish border. Their latest assault captured the town of Ras al-Ain, an Arab and Kurd town in the north-eastern oil-producing province of Hasaka, 600km (375 miles) from Damascus. Ten people were killed in clashes as residents fled a few hundred metres across the border to the Turkish town of Ceylanpinar, according to unverified reports overnight. Scroll down for video. Fleeing the violence: Syrian refugees from the town of Ras al-Ain run for the Turkish border last night as clashes between rebels and Bashar al-Assad's troops escalated. Dangerous: An injured man is helped towards the Turkish town of Ceylanpinar. Ten people were reported dead as rebels took control of the neighbouring Syrian town of Ras al-Ain. 'The crossing is important because it opens another line to Turkey, where we can send the wounded and get supplies,' said Khaled al-Walid, a commander in the Raqqa Rebel Division. In the last three months, the mainly Sunni Muslim Arab rebels have captured a string of outposts on the 910km (560 mile) northern border, steadily moving towards the northeast which is home to many of Syria's one million Kurds. However, the encroachments have enraged many Kurds, who want no part in the violence. The Kurdish Council, a coalition of Kurdish parties opposed to Assad, called on the Free Syrian Army to leave Ain al-Arab, a border town of 54,000 people further west. Anxious moments: Syrian refugees of all ages scramble through barbed wire fences in broad daylight as they escape fierce fighting. They said the clashes, as well as the fear of reprisals by the Syrian army, had prompted most of the town's inhabitants to flee. 'While the Kurdish Council affirms it is part of the revolution to bring down this totalitarian regime, the province of Hasaka must remain a safe area for thousands of refugees who had fled to it from other regions,' a statement said.. 'Military elements have to pull out so their presence would not serve as an excuse to shell the town and destroy it.' Guard: Turkish soldiers watch Syrians trying to flee into their country at a border checkpoint close to the town of Ras al-Ain. Adrian Edwards, spokesman for the United Nations refugee agency, said in Geneva that there had been a 'large movement' of Syrian refugees into Turkey's Urfa province in the past 24 hours, a period co-inciding with the rebel offensive. Turkey is already sheltering more than 120,000 Syrian refugees. The Turkish state-run Anatolian news agency also reported that 26 Syrian military officers had also arrived in Turkey with their families overnight - the biggest mass desertion of senior soldiers from Assad's forces in months. Meanwhile, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 12 people were killed by army shelling in the eastern town of al-Qurriya. There were further clashes in the capital Damascus, with rebels and soldiers fighting in Kfar Souseh, a rich neighbourhood just a couple of miles from the presidential palace. On Wednesday, rebels fired mortars at the palace but missed. Air strike: Smoke rises from the eastern Damascus suburb of Arbeen on Thursday following an attack by a MIG fighter jet. An opposition activist in central Damascus said police stations and state buildings had been fortified in anticipation of further rebel attacks. 'First we saw the most important buildings protected. Now we are seeing police stations protected,' said the activist, who asked not to be named for security reasons. Damascus has become steadily more militarised as a result of rebel attacks and battles rage in pro-opposition suburbs. The activist added that extra guards were posted months ago at security centres, the central bank and government offices. Concrete blocks had been installed in recent weeks.

The earthquake, which was centered approximately 15 miles (24 kilometers) east-southeast of Los Angeles near La Verne, was felt as far away as San Diego and Orange County. Over a hundred aftershocks were recorded following the main event, with the largest registering at a magnitude of 3.4. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) categorized the earthquake as Light shaking, indicating that it would not likely cause significant damage. As Southern California residents scrambled to react to the shaking, social media was flooded with videos and pictures of the event, showing items falling off shelves and light fixtures swaying.

The LAPD and Los Angeles Fire Department immediately deployed resources to affected areas, but initial reports showed no significant damage to buildings, bridges, or other major structures. Local utilities also reported that there were no widespread power outages or service interruptions. California Governor Gavin Newsom used the event as an opportunity to remind residents of the importance of earthquake preparedness. In a statement, he urged Californians to take this time to ensure they have ample supplies of water, food, and other essentials in case of a larger-scale seismic event and to review their emergency plans with family members. USGS seismologist Dr. Lucy Jones stated that while the 4.4 earthquake may have been a jolt for many residents, it was not large enough to be classified as the \\"big one\\" that experts have been anticipating for years. However, she added that the event should serve as a reminder that living in an earthquake-prone region requires constant vigilance and preparedness. As the week continued, Los Angeles slowly returned to normalcy, with many residents expressing relief that the earthquake had not caused any major damage. Events like this one are a stark reminder of the constantly shifting tectonic plates beneath Southern California, which make the region one of the most seismically active areas in the United States. In the days following the earthquake, scientists and emergency personnel urged residents to be proactive about earthquake safety. This includes securing heavy items in one's home, having a plan for where to shelter during a quake, and keeping emergency supplies on hand. A few weeks after the initial event, researchers from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) reported that the La Verne earthquake provided important data to better understand the complex fault systems in the area and improve future seismic risk assessments. In conclusion, the magnitude 4.4 earthquake that shook Los Angeles served as a stark reminder of the seismic risk in Southern California, prompting both residents and officials to reassess their earthquake preparedness efforts. Fortunately, the quake did not result in any casualties or significant damage, but it highlighted the importance of vigilance and anticipation of a more powerful seismic event that could strike the region at any moment."},{"question":"Question: \\"Are there fewer community centers or tennis courts?\\" Context: \\"The Raleigh Parks and Recreation Department offers a wide variety of leisure opportunities at more than 150 sites throughout the city, which include: 8,100 acres (33 km2) of park land, 78 miles (126 km) of greenway, 22 community centers, a BMX championship-caliber race track, 112 tennis courts among 25 locations, 5 public lakes, and 8 public aquatic facilities.

You can catch them on your tongue or use them to make a perfect snowball. But have you ever thought about taking pictures of them? Ken Libbrecht did. He is a physics professor from California. Although the weather in California is usually warm and sunny, Ken's hobby is taking pictures of snowflakes. He travels to cold areas like Alaska and Canada to find snowstorms and take pictures of the snowflakes. \\"They are often beautiful, and every snowfall brings new surprises,\\" says Ken. Ken takes pictures of snowflakes with a high-quality digital camera. He uses a microscope to make the tiny snowflakes larger. To get the best images, Ken built a special photo-microscope just for snowflakes. He collects flakes by letting them fall onto a piece of foam board . The pictures must be taken outdoors, so Ken wears lots of clothes to stay warm. But his fingers often get cold, because it's difficult for him to take pictures of a tiny snowflake with gloves. Each snowflake has shapes and patterns that make it as unique as a person's fingerprint. The hobby of snowflake photography is also unique. Next time a snowstorm blows through your town, take a closer look at the flakes before you gather them into a snowball. See if you can notice their unique patterns. Millions of snowflakes are waiting for you! ,. Why do Ken's fingers often get cold? A) Because he doesn't wear enough clothes. B) Because he doesn't wear gloves. C) Because he likes making snowballs.

Unlike the rest of France, the Local law in Alsace-Moselle still provides for to the Napoleonic Concordat of 1801 and the organic articles, which provides public subsidies to the Roman Catholic, Lutheran, and Calvinist churches, as well as to Jewish synagogues; religion classes in one of these faiths is compulsory in public schools. This divergence in policy from the French majority is due to the region having been part of Imperial Germany when the 1905 law separating the French church and state was instituted (for a more comprehensive history, see: Alsace-Lorraine). Controversy erupts periodically on the appropriateness of this legal disposition, as well as on the exclusion of other religions from this arrangement.\\" Answer: Answer:","response":"Besides Jewish synagogues and Lutheran and Calvinist churches, public subsidies are also given to the Roman Catholic Church in the Alsace-Moselle region of France.

Contemporary hymnbooks did not contain music and were simply small books of religious poetry. The first known instance of Newton's lines joined to music was in A Companion to the Countess of Huntingdon's Hymns (London, 1808), where it is set to the tune \\"Hephzibah\\" by English composer John Husband. Common meter hymns were interchangeable with a variety of tunes; more than twenty musical settings of \\"Amazing Grace\\" circulated with varying popularity until 1835 when William Walker assigned Newton's words to a traditional song named \\"New Britain\\", which was itself an amalgamation of two melodies (\\"Gallaher\\" and \\"St. Mary\\") first published in the Columbian Harmony by Charles H. Spilman and Benjamin Shaw (Cincinnati, 1829). Spilman and Shaw, both students at Kentucky's Centre College, compiled their tunebook both for public worship and revivals, to satisfy \\"the wants of the Church in her triumphal march\\". Most of the tunes had been previously published, but \\"Gallaher\\" and \\"St. Mary\\" had not. As neither tune is attributed and both show elements of oral transmission, scholars can only speculate that they are possibly of British origin.

He captained the Australian team in two Tests, winning both. Trumble took 141 wickets in Test cricket--a world record at the time of his retirement--at an average of 21.78 runs per wicket. He is one of only four bowlers to twice take a hat-trick in Test cricket. Early in the 1889-90 Australian season, Trumble endured a period where he was not able to take wickets consistently. With selection of the Australian team to tour England in 1890 due at this time, Trumble was anxious about this poor run of form. Noting his anxiety while playing, a friend offered him a beer during the lunch break to revive his spirits. Previously a teetotaler, Trumble enjoyed his first taste and ordered another before re-entering the field of play. Feeling relaxed, although wondering about his steadiness of step, Trumble took a succession of wickets to ensure his selection in the Australian team. Trumble finished the season with 27 wickets at an average of 14.20 per wicket. The 1890 Australian team touring England was relatively inexperienced. The team missed the all-round ability of George Giffen, who had refused to join the squad, thinking it unlikely the tour would be a sporting or financial success. The Australians won 13 matches on tour, losing 16 and drawing 9. Trumble made his Test cricket debut in the First Test against the English team at Lord's Cricket Ground. He took only one wicket, dismissing Bobby Peel caught and bowled for 1. Batting at number eleven in the first innings he made 1 not out and in the second, 5 runs batting at number ten. Despite this lack of success, he retained his spot in the team for the Second Test at The Oval where he failed to take a wicket. He was selected for the Third Test at Old Trafford but continuous rain saw the match abandoned without a ball being bowled. Trumble played 28 first-class matches during the tour, scoring 288 runs at an average of 8.47 and took 52 wickets at an average of 21.75. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack wrote, \\"Reports from Australia had led us to expect a great deal of ... Trumble\\" but his \\"straightness and regular length [were] insufficient to compensate for an obvious lack of 'devil' and variety\\". Trumble was not selected for the Australian team to play Lord Sheffield's touring English team in 1891-92. He did not return to the Australian team until his selection in the squad to tour England in 1893. Before the Test matches he took 14 wickets for 116 runs (14/116) against the Players followed by 12/84 against Kent at Gravesend. He played in all three Test matches in 1893, taking 6 wickets at an average of 39.00. Trumble scored 58 runs in the Tests with a highest score of 35 but had more success in the other matches, scoring 774 runs, including one century in all first-class matches on tour. Wisden noted that \\"An immense improvement on his form of three years before was shown by Hugh Trumble, who bowled consistently well all through the tour\\" and \\"... the reports of Hugh Trumble's improvement in batting were amply borne out, his hitting in many matches being remarkably fine\\". When Andrew Stoddart's English team visited Australia in 1894-95, Trumble played only one Test, the Second at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. In the first innings, England scored 75 runs with Trumble taking 3 wickets. England fought back in their second innings, scoring 475 runs to win the Test by 94 runs; Trumble failed to take a wicket.

When the French Revolutionary Army of the Rhine was victorious, tens of thousands fled east before it. When they were later permitted to return (in some cases not until 1799), it was often to find that their lands and homes had been confiscated.

Some astrophysicists predicted the existence of another planet (Vulcan) that would explain the discrepancies; however, despite some early indications, no such planet could be found. When Albert Einstein formulated his theory of general relativity (GR) he turned his attention to the problem of Mercury's orbit and found that his theory added a correction, which could account for the discrepancy.

An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.

Title: The Navy vs. the Night Monsters Movie plot: A group of scientists with Operation Deep Freeze discover frozen prehistoric trees and other specimens in the Antarctic dating back to the first Ice Age. They collect samples of each for further study and load them aboard their C-47 military transport. The dull, workaday life at the Navy weather station base on Gow Island in the South Pacific is interrupted by that very same C-47 transport aircraft. On a routine approach for refueling, the transport experiences unusual trouble and suddenly crash lands on the island's single airstrip, destroying its control tower and the island's only two-way radio. The stricken aircraft also blocks the runway, preventing its further use. Lieutenant Charles Brown (Eisley) is in command of Gow's weather station. He, Navy nurse Nora Hall (Van Doren), and biologist Arthur Beecham (Walter Sande) reach the wreck only to find that seven scientists and crew aboard the cargo aircraft when it left Antarctica are now mysteriously missing. The only one found aboard is the transport's pilot, who is traumatized and in a state of shock, unable to speak. Unloading the prehistoric cargo from the crashed C-47, Dr. Beecham recommends planting the trees to ensure their survival in the island's tropical conditions. Somewhat later, Gow Island's bird population becomes disturbed by something unknown. At the same time, the weather station's scientists try to figure out a connection between this event and a corrosive residue that begins turning up at various island locations. It slowly becomes clear that the planted prehistoric trees have quickly grown into acid-secreting, carnivorous monsters that move about Gow Island at night, at will. They reproduce fast and eventually cut off the island with their growing numbers and nocturnal assaults on Gow's native islanders. Brown has to hold together his dwindling Navy personnel and the coterie of scientists and civilians while figuing out a way to stop this prehistoric menace. The Navy personnel's only available weapons prove largely ineffective against...

Until now, studios have offered “HD” streaming content, but they’ve held back on the true 1080p resolution out of fear of pirates, the Wall Street Journal explains. Intel’s new chips—codenamed “Sandy Bridge”—will have an “Intel Insider” feature that is intended to ensure the processor won’t copy such content. Intel will debut the chips at CES this week, and announce video distribution deals with several companies, including Warner Bros. and Fox. “The new Intel technology is a fundamental change for us,” says one Warner Bros. executive. “It creates a fundamentally more secure platform in the PC environment.” On the technical side, the chips also take a big step by grafting a graphics chip directly onto the main processor, which should improve visual performance and eliminate the need for a separate graphics card, CNet reports. Expand this summary.","response":"Intel is adding a special feature to its next generation of Core microprocessors called \\"Sandy Bridge\\" that will help protect against piracy. This feature, called \\"Intel Insider,\\" is designed to make sure that the processor doesn't copy certain types of content, like high-quality 1080p videos. This is important because movie studios have been afraid to stream super-clear 1080p videos, worried that pirates might steal and share them. Intel hopes the new feature will make studios feel more confident about streaming better quality videos. To make this possible, Intel is going to team up with some big companies, such as Warner Bros. and Fox. One person from Warner Bros. says that this new Intel technology is a big change and will make the computer environment more secure for sharing videos. Another interesting thing about the \\"Sandy Bridge\\" chips is that they have a graphics chip built right onto the main processor.

Article: Scientists have transformed men's minds into avirtual woman's body in an experiment that could throw light upon how humans distinguish themselves form others. In a study at Barcelona University, men wore a virtual reality headset that allowed them to see and hear the world as a female character. When they looked down, they could even see their new body and clothes. The \\"body-swapping\\" effect was so convincing that the men's sense of self was transferred into the virtual woman, causing them to react to events in the virtual world they wereimmersed . \\"This work opens up another avenue for virtual reality, which is not just to transform your sense of place, but also your sense of self,\\" said Mel Slater, \\"If you can temporarily give people the illusion that their bodies are different, then the evidence suggests it also affects their behavior and the way they think. They can have new experiences: a person who is thin can know what it is like to be fat. A man can have an experience of what it's like to be a woman.\\" During the experiment, a \\"female\\" approached and hit the face of the character another man was playing. \\"Their reaction was immediate,\\" said Slate. \\"They would take in a quick breath and maybeflinch . The more people reported being in the girl's body, the stronger physical reaction they had.\\" But in all cases, the feeling was temporary and lasted only as long as the study. The study shows that our minds have a very fluid picture of our bodies. The research is expected to shed light on the puzzle of how our brain tells the difference between a part of our own body and something else in the wider world. Thus the work might improve the conditions for those who have experienced strokes by placing them in a world that helps them to use their bodies to the full again.

He was influenced at a young age by the 1970s progressive rock bands King Crimson, Yes, Genesis, Camel, P.F.M., Hawkwind, and Gracious, and by heavy metal bands such as Iron Maiden, Slayer, Death, Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Celtic Frost, King Diamond, Morbid Angel, Voivod, and, most importantly, Judas Priest. Åkerfeldt considers Judas Priest's Sad Wings of Destiny (1976) the best metal album of all time, and notes that there was a time when he listened only to Judas Priest. While warming up before Opeth concerts, Åkerfeldt frequently sings \\"Here Come the Tears\\" from Judas Priest's third album Sin After Sin (1977). Åkerfeldt later discovered progressive rock and folk music, both of which had a profound impact on the sound of the band.Opeth's distinct sound mixes death metal with progressive rock. Steve Huey of AllMusic refers to Opeth's \\"epic, progressive death metal style\\". Ryan Ogle of Blabbermouth described Opeth's sound as incorporating \\"the likes of folk, funk, blues, '70s rock, goth and a laundry list of other sonic oddities into their trademark progressive death style.\\" In his review of Opeth's 2001 album Blackwater Park, AllMusic's Eduardo Rivadavia wrote, \\"Tracks start and finish in seemingly arbitrary fashion, usually traversing ample musical terrain, including acoustic guitar and solo piano passages, ambient soundscapes, stoner rock grooves, and Eastern-tinged melodies—any of which are subject to savage punctuations of death metal fury at any given moment.\\" Åkerfeldt commented on the diversity of Opeth's music: I don't see the point of playing in a band and going just one way when you can do everything. It would be impossible for us to play just death metal; that is our roots, but we are now a mishmash of everything, and not purists to any form of music. It's impossible for us to do that, and quite frankly I would think of it as boring to be in a band that plays just metal music.... contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who was influenced by Genesis?, what is it ?

The door to the cabin bursts open and a gunman enters, shooting at the sleeping man, who is barely able to grab his pistol and shoot back, killing his would-be killer. The man continues to aim at the sides of the cabin and shoots another man walking outside. Repeated shotgun blasts blow through the roof of the cabin but the man is out of shots for his revolver. He tosses the revolver at the wood burning stove in the cabin and distracts the roof shooter long enough to grab his Winchester rifle. He shoots upward and hits the roof shooter, who falls into the cabin. The man with the rifle, Emmett (Scott Glenn), walks outside and looks over the failed assassins. He also looks at the horses, seeing a familiar brand emblem. Emmett leaves the cabin and continues his journey.Far out in the desert, he comes across another man, lying on the ground in his long underwear. He gives the man some water and takes him along. Later, as they camp for the night, the man in the underwear tells Emmett that his name is Paden (Kevin Kline) and that he'd been riding with a group of men who looted him and stole his horse. The two stop at an Army outpost where Emmett gives Paden some money to buy proper clothing. Paden suddenly spots his horse and the man who stole it. He ducks into the nearby general store where he has an argument with the shopkeep. Paden wants to borrow a pistol but the clerk won't let him. Paden asks the man for a gun worth the money Emmett gave him and is given a rusty old pistol that the cylinder falls out of. Paden rushes out to the square and loads the gun; he is spotted almost immediately by the horse thief, who rides toward him, shooting. Paden takes quick but very careful aim and shoots the man off the horse. A few minutes later, while he kisses his horse, Paden is grilled by a US Army sergeant about the shooting.

According to the 1478 census Selânik (), as the city came to be known in Ottoman Turkish, had 6,094 Greek Orthodox households, 4,320 Muslim ones, and some Catholic. No Jews were recorded in the census suggesting that the subsequent influx of Jewish population was not linked to the already existing Romaniote Jews community. Soon after the turn of the 15th to 16th century, however, nearly 20,000 Sephardic Jews immigrated to Greece from the Iberian Peninsula following their expulsion from Spain by the 1492 Alhambra Decree. By c. 1500, the number of households had grown to 7,986 Greek ones, 8,575 Muslim ones, and 3,770 Jewish. By 1519, Sephardic Jewish households numbered 15,715, 54% of the citys population. Some historians consider the Ottoman regimes invitation to Jewish settlement was a strategy to prevent the ethnic Greek population from dominating the city. Question: How many more Greeks than Jews lived in Selânik by c. 1500? Answer:","response":"By c. 1500, there were 7,986 Greek households and 3,770 Jewish households in Selânik. To calculate the difference in the number of households between Greeks and Jews, we can subtract the number of Jewish households from the number of Greek households: 7,986 (Greek households) - 3,770 (Jewish households) = 4,216 So, by c. 1500, there were 4,216 more Greek households than Jewish households in Selânik.

The rationale to choose \\"yeast\\" as the answer is as follows: Step 1: Understand the purpose of the ingredient The question asks what ingredient is added to make the bread dough rise. To answer this question, we must understand the purpose of the ingredient and its role in the bread-making process. Step 2: Eliminate irrelevant and incorrect choices - Oven: This is not an ingredient but an appliance, so we can eliminate it. - Mess: This is not an ingredient and doesn't make sense, so we can eliminate it. - Flour: Flour is one of the main ingredients in bread dough, but it doesn't directly contribute to the dough rising, so we can eliminate it. - Biscuit: This is another baked good and not an ingredient, so we can eliminate it. Step 3: Choose the correct answer After eliminating the other choices, we are left with \\"yeast.\\" Step 4: Justification Yeast is a single-celled microorganism that ferments sugar, producing carbon dioxide and alcohol. When added to bread dough, it consumes the sugars present and produces carbon dioxide gas. This gas gets trapped in the dough, causing it to expand and rise.

Question: The average guy could not throw the ball as far as the professional baseball player because he was (A) stronger (B) weaker Answer:","response":"The average guy could not throw the ball as far as the professional baseball player because he was (B) weaker. The primary reason behind this difference in throwing abilities lies in the physical conditioning, training, and overall strength and skill level that separate the average person from a professional baseball player. Firstly, a professional baseball player commits a significant amount of time and energy to honing their skills and maximizing their physical potential. This means working on their endurance, agility, and strength in the gym and on the field. Regular workouts, strength exercises, and targeted training specifically focused on arm strength, grip, and throwing mechanics all significantly contribute to their superior throwing ability. On the other hand, the average person may have a sedentary lifestyle, irregular or minimal exercise routines, and a lack of targeted training that concentrates on developing the specific skills and muscle groups required for powerful throws. This results in a weaker physical condition, which directly impacts their ability to throw the ball as far as a professional baseball player. Secondly, the technique and muscle memory that professional baseball players develop through years of practice and coaching play a vital role in their ability to throw a ball further. Adequate training helps them master the correct posture, balance, wind-up, and release that allows them to effectively leverage their physical strength and generate maximum velocity and distance in a throw. This level of technical expertise is usually absent in an average person, contributing to the disparity in throwing abilities. Additionally, factors such as genetics, talent, and hand-eye coordination may also be contributing factors to the difference in throwing capabilities between an average person and a professional baseball player. While some individuals may be naturally gifted and possess innate athletic abilities, these traits are further enhanced through the rigorous training, commitment, and specialized coaching that professional baseball players undergo throughout their careers. In conclusion, the average guy could not throw the ball as far as the professional baseball player because he is weaker in terms of physical strength, conditioning, and skill level. The professional player has dedicated years of their life to building and refining their physical capabilities and mastering the techniques necessary for powerful throws, while the average person lacks such training, commitment, and resources, resulting in their weaker ability to throw the ball as far."},{"question":"What is the solution to this math problem?

So, let's move everything that's not 'x' to the other side. First, we will remove '+ 12' from the right side, so we'll do the opposite, which is '- 12' to both sides: -24 - 12 = -9*x + 12 -12 This simplifies to: -36 = -9*x Now, we want to get 'x' by itself. Since '-9' is multiplied by 'x', we'll do the opposite, which is to divide by '-9'. We'll do this to both sides: -36 / -9 = (-9*x) / -9 This simplifies to: 4 = x There you go! The answer is x = 4.

Had Bernie Sanders been nominated, how would the election have gone?","response":"While these two questions are related, they do not have the exact same meaning. They both revolve around the 2016 United States Presidential Election, Bernie Sanders, and Hillary Clinton. The main difference lies in the underlying assumptions and the potential scenarios they consider. Let's explore the two questions in greater detail. 1. Could Sanders have won had Hillary not stole the election from him? This question implies that there is a belief that Hillary Clinton somehow \\"stole\\" the Democratic party nomination for the presidency from Bernie Sanders during the 2016 primary elections. It suggests that there were manipulations or factors that unfairly led to Clinton's nomination, rather than Sanders, and this question speculates whether or not Sanders could have won the general election against the Republican nominee (in this case, Donald Trump) if he had been the Democratic nominee instead. The premise of this question assumes that there was an unfair advantage given to Clinton that prevented Sanders from receiving the nomination. This question asks about the possible outcome if this alleged wrongdoing did not occur, and how Sanders’ chances of winning the presidency would have then played out in a hypothetical scenario. 2. Had Bernie Sanders been nominated, how would the election have gone? This question doesn't involve any implications of wrongdoing within the Democratic nomination process. Instead, it simply considers a hypothetical scenario in which Bernie Sanders is the Democratic nominee for president and wonders how the general election would have gone under these circumstances. This question does not insinuate that Clinton \\"stole\\" the nomination, but rather just explores an alternate reality where Sanders received the nomination. The focus of this question is more about the electoral dynamics, potential voter reactions, and how the election might have played out differently with Sanders as the Democratic nominee rather than concentrating on the fairness of the nomination process. In summary, these two questions address related subjects, but they have different meanings. The first question assumes wrongdoing in the Democratic nomination process, while the second question simply considers a hypothetical scenario without insinuating any unfair circumstances. Both questions, however, prompt speculation about the potential outcome of the 2016 election if Bernie Sanders had been the Democratic nominee."},{"question":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

Part of being a free spirited person is learning to let some things go in life before they hold you back or weigh you down. As a free spirit, you can certainly still worry about and fight for things that matter. If something seems to be holding you back rather than helping you achieve your dreams, however, it might be time to let it go. A home that is larger or more complex than you need, filled with more material things than you need, costs too much, or is in a location you don’t want to be in can keep you from being a free spirit. You could move into a different or smaller home that is more manageable for your free-spirited lifestyle, such as a tiny house. No one can get through life without some material things. However, too many things can weigh you down if you are trying to be a free spirit. Try these techniques: Buying fewer things will decrease clutter and simplify your life. This will also free up finances for things that might matter more to you, such as traveling or spending time with friends. Buy less, but of better things. Having quality things but fewer things overall can help you be less materialistic. Higher-quality clothes, for instance, will last longer than lower-quality ones, and you will need to have fewer of them. Keep in mind that reducing is good for the environment. Consuming less means less production, less waste, less pollutants, etc. Decluttering your life is one of the first steps you can take toward becoming a more free spirited person. When choosing how to simplify things, consider the following: Think about how often you use particular items. Many experts suggest that if you are trying to declutter, if you haven’t used an item in six months, you should consider getting rid of it. Irreplaceable items of great sentimental value might be an exception. However, remember that memories are more important than things, and you might not need to keep everything. Photographs, for instance, can be scanned for safekeeping without taking up space, and then discarded. Consider donating items you no longer need to a thrift store, community center, religious organization, or other worthwhile cause. That way, others in need can benefit from the items you can live without. Summary:","response":"This article emphasizes the importance of decluttering and simplifying one's life to become a free-spirited person. It suggests that, to be a free spirit, one should let go of unessential material things and focus on their ideals and relationships. A home that is larger or more complex than needed can also hold you back, and downsizing to a smaller or simpler home may be beneficial. The article offers techniques for decluttering, such as buying fewer but higher quality items, consuming less for the environment, and regularly assessing the usage and value of possessions. Donating unwanted items to charitable organizations is another recommendation.

The band is well known for politically charged lyrics and activism, focusing on anti-war activism, anti-imperialism, class struggle, human rights, and various sociopolitical sentiments. The line-up includes singer/guitarist Justin Sane and drummer Pat Thetic, who founded the band; later members are guitarist Chris Head, and singer/bassist Chris Barker (#2) who replaced Jamie \\"Cock\\" Towns, who had replaced original bassist Andy Flag in 1997 following his departure one year prior. Anti-Flag is known also for their advocacy of progressive political action groups such as Greenpeace and Amnesty International. In 2000, Anti-Flag was invited to participate in Vans Warped Tour. During this time, the members of Anti-Flag met NOFX's Fat Mike, owner of the Fat Wreck Chords record label. This meeting spawned a friendship that would lead to Anti-Flag's release of two albums on the label. In 2001, Anti-Flag teamed with punk music producer Mass Giorgini to record the album Underground Network, released on Fat Wreck Chords. The release of the album is arguably the band's breakout from the hardcore underground to a more mainstream spotlight. The album continued to address the issues of fascism (specifically neo-Nazis infiltrating the \\"hardcore scene\\") and the United States' foreign policy. The album was the first to contain the now-commonplace booklet filled with essays from historians and political commentators, most notably Professor Howard Zinn. In February 2002, Anti-Flag released the album Mobilize on A-F Records. The album featured eight new studio tracks as well as eight live tracks of songs from other albums. In the wake of the September 11th terrorist attacks on the United States, Anti-Flag spoke out against the push for war with the album's title track \\"911 for peace\\". During this time, many music stores pulled Anti-Flag's records from shelves, as their music was labelled as \\"anti-American.\\" In 2003, Anti-Flag released the album The Terror State on Fat Wreck Chords. The album primarily focused on criticizing the Bush Administration's handling of the War on Terrorism. Again, the album contained a booklet full of essays from the band as well as other political commentators. The album contains a song whose lyrics were originally written by Woody Guthrie entitled \\"Post-War Breakout.\\" The track's music was arranged by the members of Anti-Flag, as Guthrie had never committed the arrangements to paper.

Such was the case when the currents of the Mediterranean Ocean recently washed a 13-foot-long, smelly body onto the shores of the village of Villaricos in Andalusia, Spain.

Locals joked that it was some kind of Loch Ness Monster. The media jumped right on the creature, of course. Some sites called it a horned sea monster. The popular newspaper Boing Boing called it a dragon. Some people guessed that it might be an oarfish , which is actually a rarely seen kind of big fish that can grow up to 55 feet long.

In 1865, General William Tecumseh Sherman proposed to divide the land and goods from Georgia and grant it to families of color which became the \\"Forty acres and a mule\\" policy. The proposal was never widely adopted due to strong political opposition. Nearly a century later (1950s-1960s), policies to assist classes of individuals reemerged during the Civil Rights Movement. The civil rights guarantees came through the interpretation of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. The decisions came to be known as affirmative action in which mandatory, as well as voluntary programs, affirmed the civil rights of people of color. Furthermore, these affirmative action programs protected people of color from the present effects stemming from past discrimination. In 1961, President John F.

Well-known products include the Plasma Desktop, KDE Frameworks and a range of cross-platform applications designed to run on modern Unix-like and Microsoft Windows systems. It further provides tools and documentation for developers that enables them to write software. This supporting role makes KDE a central development hub and home for many popular applications and projects like Calligra Suite, Krita or digiKam. The Plasma Desktop, being one of the most recognized projects of KDE, is the default desktop environment on many Linux distributions, such as openSUSE, Mageia, Chakra, Kubuntu, Manjaro Linux, and PCLinuxOS. It was also the default desktop environment on PC-BSD, but was later replaced with Lumina, a desktop environment which, like KDE, is written in C++ and Qt. The work of the KDE community can be measured in the following figures: K Desktop Environment (KDE) was founded in 1996 by Matthias Ettrich, who was then a student at the Eberhard Karls University of Tübingen. At the time, he was troubled by certain aspects of the Unix desktop. Among his concerns was that none of the applications looked, felt, or worked alike. He proposed the creation of not merely a set of applications but a desktop environment in which users could expect things to look, feel, and work consistently.

In this task, you're given a fill-in-the-blank question that contains two object names. Additionally, you're given one answer which is one of the objects present in the question. In this task, you need to minimally change the given question so that the answer flips to another object in the question. Remember the question has to be about both objects which are related but different; for example, \\"trophy\\" and \\"suitcase\\". This task typically involves replacing one word i.e., the 'trigger word' with its antonym (e.g., changing from \\"small\\" to \\"big\\"). You should not change any content in the given question beyond a word or two, i.e., the trigger word/phrase. The expected answer to your question must not be associated with just the trigger word; instead, it should depend on the context present in the question. The expected answer should not be ambiguous. For your question, there should be an agreed upon answer to fill in the blank. Your generations should NOT contain potentially explicit, offensive, or adult content. In your generated question, retain the object names from the input question. Avoid repeating the same style or phrase in generating your modified question e.g. this task can be always solved using a simple negation i.e. by adding not, never, etc. Instead, try to increase the word diversity. Your question must contain at least 15 and at most 30 words. Your question must have at least 70% overlapping words with the given question. You must utilize the given context word while writing the question. Your question must contain only one blank. The two objects should be used ONCE in your question. Here is a list of attributes and associated contrastive words that may help write contrastive trigger words. Note that contrastive trigger words help in flipping the label. | Attribute | triggerword | contrastive triggerword | | age | old | new | | altitude | low | high | | area | small | vast | | brightness | dark | light | | clarity | obscure | clear | | cleanness | dirty | clean | | complexity | simple | complex | | cost | cheap | expensive | | density | sparse | dense | | depth | shallow | deep | | distance | near | far | | electric conductivity | low | high | | flexibility | rigid | flexible | | granularity | fine | coarse | | hardness | soft | hard | | length | short | long | | magnitude | small | large | | mass | small | large | | odor | weak | strong | | pressure | low | high | | resistance | low | high | | shape | round | sharp | | shape | flat | spiky | | size | small | large | | sound | quiet | loud | | sound pitch | low | high | | speed | slow | fast | | stability | unstable | stable | | strength | weak | strong | | temperature | low | high | | texture | smooth | rough | | thermal conductivity | low | high | | thickness | thin | thick | | volume | small | large | | weight | light | heavy | | width | narrow | wide | | location | in | out | | location | up | down | | location | above | below | | location | on | off | | location | to | from | Context Word: music.

Answer: guitar.","response":"This task is asking to modify a given fill-in-the-blank question in a way that the answer switches to another object mentioned in the question. The question is about two musical instruments, the \\"guitar\\" and the \\"flute\\". The current answer is \\"guitar\\". The guidelines provided suggest that the change to the question should be minimal. Thus, the solution involves changing only a word or two, typically the 'trigger word', into its antonym, while ensuring that the resultant question is still applicable to both objects and provides a clear, unambiguous answer. Using the provided trigger word list, a word that can trigger the difference between guitar and flute could be the 'use of hands'. We know that while playing guitar, we primarily use our hands, but to play flute we also use our breath, even though we also hold it in our hands. A good contrastive word could be 'only' versus 'not only'. Applying these considerations, the new question could be: \\"He plays music on both the guitar and the flute, he likes the _ best because he uses not only his hands to play it.\\" The answer to the new question is \\"flute\\". This way, the task is solved by carefully identifying a distinguishing aspect between the two objects based on the trigger word list and making a small change that flips the expected answer while also keeping within the word count requirements and avoiding explicit or offensive content."},{"question":"Article: My name is Sue.

Most government IDs are printed on a proprietary cardstock that you won’t be able to purchase. Teslin paper is a good substitute and will closely resemble the feel of a government ID after you laminate and trim the final product. A lot of medium- and high-end laser printers have the capacity to print on Teslin paper, but the quality may be low if you try to use a printer that doesn’t have manual controls for the print settings. Once you print the ID on Teflin, you’ll need to laminate it to match the thickness and feel of the state that you’re replicating. Get a pouch laminator that matches the thickness of the style of ID that you intend on duplicating. Pouch laminators come in 4 sizes: 3, 5, 7, or 10 millimeters. You can use regular laminate pouches if you want, but butterfly laminates come with a crease that reduces the odds of air bubbles forming on your ID. Since air bubbles are one of the biggest tip-offs that an ID is fake, you really need to use a butterfly pouch. Get a laminate pouch with a holographic exterior to make your ID look authentic. You won’t be able to find identical patterns unless you buy some illegally or download the template on the deep web. To get an accurate ID template, you’ll need to download one from a torrent-hosting site. You may be able to buy or download one from the deep web as well. You can try digitally-editing a scan or photo of an ID, but the resolution is unlikely to match the original. The most popular torrent-hosting site is https://torrentfreak.com/. To digitally edit a real ID, you’ll need to use the duplicate/stamp clone tool and erase every single line of unique text. Some templates are form-fillable, meaning that you can simply type each line of text into the template and print it that way. If the ID photos for your state have a blue background, set up a blue drape or blanket behind you. Use three-point lighting to replicate the look of professional photos by setting up three light sources with 2 on either side of your camera and 1 above you. Set your camera on a tripod and use the self-timer to take your portrait. Don’t take your photo on a phone. Even if the picture looks good, the resolution is probably wrong for an ID card. Use a high-quality camera on a low shutter speed to take the photo. Set your photo up on a screen next to a copy of a real ID. Adjust the contrast, brightness, and saturation levels in your image until you’re confident that it looks like a real ID photo. Export your edited photo as a new image to save the original in case you aren’t happy with the final product. In Photoshop, click the adjustments panel on the side. Select the layer that your photo is on and slide the brightness, contrast, and saturation to adjust the colors and light in your photo. Import your new photo into the ID template and drag it to the proper location. Some templates will automatically center it for you, but you may need to crop the image so that it fits the slot for the portrait. If the photo stays behind the template when you move it, right click the photo and select the layers option. Click “front” or “bring to front.” Try to make as few adjustments to the size of your image as possible. This will reduce the odds that the resolution comes out fuzzy when you print the ID. In the United States (and many other countries), the eye color and hair color codes are 3 letters. They represent a corresponding color for hair and eyes. Use the code that most closely matches the hair and eye color of the person in the photo. Some IDs have restrictions and endorsements for drivers with disabilities, special exemptions, or unique licenses. Check your state’s ID to see if there are restriction and endorsement codes. If there are, write the endorsement code as “P,” for passenger vehicle, since this is the most common endorsement. The restriction code is usually either “A” or left intentionally blank for a regular driver. Other common restriction codes include “B” for people that wear corrective lenses or glasses, and “R” for motorcycles. If either of these apply to you, change the endorsement code. Use a thin drawing tool in your photo editing software to include the signature. Try to match the thickness of your line to the thickness of a real signature. Select black for the color of your line and use your mouse to carefully draw your signature. It may take multiple attempts before you get a signature that works. It can be kind of tough to free-hand a signature with the mouse. Feel free to redo it until you get a signature that matches your real one. On a lot of fake IDs, the signature is a dead giveaway that it’s not authentic. Do your best to get the thickness of the lines to match by adjusting the size of your brush in the editing software. Keep in mind that the signature on IDs will never extend beyond the allotted borders for it on a real ID. Use the erase tool to trim any sections that go past the box for your signature. Go into the printer settings on your computer and set each slider to the highest quality possible. On the printer itself, make sure that all of the ink levels are high so that the color isn’t cloudy when you print your ID. If you can, use a pigment-based inkjet printer. These tend to produce vibrant results and work well with Teslin, even though they’re inkjet printers. They are usually more expensive though. Print your image. It may take a longer time than usual for the image to print. Let the ink dry by letting the paper sit for 30-45 minutes. Open a butterfly pouch by lifting the sheet and sliding the ID into it. Place the protective paper that came with the pouch on top of the butterfly pouch. The butterfly pouch is just a folded sheet of laminate. The crease at the top is the side you enter into the laminator first. This ensures that no air bubbles get trapped in the laminate. Set your laminator to a medium heat level. Place the sheet, Teslin paper, and butterfly pouch into the laminator crease-first. Slowly guide the ID through the machine and let it sit for 30-45 minutes before opening the paper and discarding it. You will see the pouch sealed around the ID. Trim the edges with a utility knife, to get a clean cut against the edge.

Breaking down the sentence, we can infer the following: 1. The phrase \\"escape the shackles of its own clichés\\" suggests that the subject, presumably a film, overcomes the limitations or constraints typically associated with the genre. The word \\"shackles\\" portrays the clichés as something that hinders or restrains the film. The fact that the film seemingly \\"escapes\\" these constraints implies a positive sentiment. 2. The sentence continues, stating that this subject is \\"the best espionage picture to come out in weeks.\\" This concept accentuates the positive sentiment even further, as the film is not only breaking free from clichés but also being identified as superior among recently released espionage films. Being the best in a category is a clear indicator of positive sentiment. In summary, the sentence paints the film as an exceptional example of its genre, breaking free from clichés and standing out among other recent releases. This assessment is clearly positive in nature."},{"question":"Premise: Nearly half the Jewish inhabitants hail from overseas, and they have brought with them many of the accumulated customs and cultural traditions of their former homes.

When I was a child, she took me to museums, restaurants, dances. She showered me with gifts from her travels around the world. But I can only remember her giving me one book--a book that, to this day, I have not read. She presented me with her own favorite childhood book: Hans Brinker. My grandmother was happy to share this book with me. She even decorated the title page with her proud writing. I tried to read it. I adored reading, and would dive into a new pile of books from the library all at once. But something about Hans Brinker just wouldn't let me in. The story was set in Holland, a long time ago. It felt dull and unfamiliar--even though I was a fan of classics of other times and places. I simply read the first pages over and over. I could not progress. Standing on a bookshelf in our living room, the book was like something I avoided. It scolded me for not being interested, for not trying hard enough, for disappointing my grandmother. The book started to fit in, almost forgotten, until Adele asked. Had I read it? Did I like it? Always determined, she wanted to know the answer. I would make some kind of excuse, feel bad, and open it again, hoping for a new reaction. _ . Years passed and finally Adele and I both accepted that I would never read Hans Brinker. Eventually I cleared the book from the shelf. The Hans Brinker experience led me to set a rule that I've lived by ever since: Do not ask about a book given as a gift. Don't ask, despite your desire to discuss it to grow closer. The desire for such connection is what gives book-giving with special meaning--and increases the owner's possibility to be a letdown. Guilt is basically the same as for all gifts, though. If the giver doesn't have the pleasure of seeing or hearing about the gift being enjoyed, and asks whether it is, then the owner--unless she can truthfully say \\"yes\\"--either has to admit to not liking the present, or else lie on the spot. Neither is pleasant. So, don't ask. Question: What does the author think about the book his grandmother gave him?

Explanation: Given the advancements in technology, particularly in the fields of neuroscience and brain-computer interfaces, it is plausible to consider the possibility of connecting two individuals' minds in a way that would allow them to share a single stream of consciousness. The idea is to develop a device that can effectively transmit neuronal signals between their brains, such that their thoughts and experiences are shared in real-time. Some experimental studies have already demonstrated successful transmission of information between two individuals using brain-computer interfaces. For example, researchers at the University of Washington conducted an experiment where one person could control another person's hand movements through a non-invasive brain stimulation technique. This suggests that the technology for transferring information between brains is constantly advancing. However, the concept of sharing a single stream of consciousness goes beyond simply transmitting information and would require a much deeper understanding of the human mind. It is conceivable that future research in neuroinformatics and neurotechnology will allow us to understand and map the complex network of neuronal connections in the brain, possibly opening up the possibility of achieving such a shared consciousness. In conclusion, given the current state of knowledge in neuroscience and brain-computer interface technology, as well as the rapid pace at which these fields are advancing, it can be considered that the possibility of creating a single stream of consciousness for two people through a brain-computer interface is theoretically plausible. Therefore, the answer to the question is yes."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

How are German WWII veterans treated today? Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","response":"No, these two questions are not inquiring about the same information. These questions focus on different aspects of WWII. I will answer both questions separately. Question 1: How and where did WWII start? Answer: Step 1: Identify the event that triggered the beginning of WWII. The invasion of Poland by Germany was the main event that marked the beginning of WWII. Step 2: Describe the date and location of the invasion. The invasion of Poland took place on September 1, 1939. Poland is a country located in Central Europe, bordered by Germany to the west, among other countries. Step 3: Mention the main countries involved in the starting phase. Following the invasion of Poland, Germany was in conflict with the Allied nations, mainly the United Kingdom and France. Thus, WWII started when Germany invaded Poland on September 1, 1939, causing the United Kingdom and France to declare war on Germany. Question 2: How are German WWII veterans treated today? Answer: Step 1: Acknowledge the passage of time since WWII. World War II ended in 1945, and more than 75 years have passed since then. Step 2: Recognize the historical context and current attitude towards the war. The German population is generally aware of the atrocities committed during WWII, and there is a strong emphasis on learning from the past to prevent similar events from happening again. Step 3: Describe the treatment of German WWII veterans today. German WWII veterans are difficult to generalize about, as their treatment depends primarily on their individual actions during the war and the context in which they are discussed. In general, Germans have a nuanced understanding of the war and the veterans, as not all soldiers willingly participated in Nazi actions. Conversations and remembrance often emphasize the importance of reflecting on Germany's history and promoting peace and understanding. So, German WWII veterans are treated with varying degrees of respect or condemnation based on their individual actions during the war, and discussions about them often serve as a reminder of the importance of learning from history."},{"question":"In 2007, about 48 percent of Malians were younger than 12 years old, 49 percent were 15–64 years old, and 3 percent were 65 and older.

As the can heats up, it may explode. The kinetic-molecular theory explains why. The air inside the rigid can of soup is given more kinetic energy by the heat coming from the campfire. The kinetic energy causes the air molecules to move faster and they impact the container walls more frequently and with more force. The increase in pressure inside may eventually exceed the strength of the can and it will explode. An additional factor is that the soup may begin boiling which will then aid even more gas and more pressure to the inside of the can. Now, I have a new situation: When studying the kinetic-molecular theory, two teams of students did and experiment. Team A heated a can of soup over the fire without venting it first, team B heated a can of soup, but vented it first.

However, he did not believe that the morale-collapse could occur without the destruction of the German economy. The primary goal of Bomber Command's offensives was to destroy the German industrial base (economic warfare), and in doing so reduce morale. In late 1943, just before the Battle of Berlin, he declared the power of Bomber Command would enable it to achieve \\"a state of devastation in which surrender is inevitable.\\" A summary of Harris' strategic intentions was clear:\\" Answer:","response":"Arthur Harris, also known as \\"Bomber Harris\\" was the Air Officer Commanding (AOC) Bomber Command during World War II. He played a significant role in the planning and execution of the bombing strategies that were designed to weaken and ultimately break the German economy and morale. However, Harris' plan for economic warfare did seem to go against his original view of German morale. Initially, Harris identified the German populace's morale as a major objective in winning the war and acknowledged that a collapse in morale could not occur without the substantial destruction of the German economy. However, his later strategies placed a greater emphasis on economic warfare, specifically targeting the German industrial base. By crippling the German economy, Harris believed that the populace's morale would be directly impacted, and they would no longer have the will to fight or support their government. However, his strategy shifted with the intensification of bombing campaigns, such as the Battle of Berlin in late 1943. Harris stated that through the sheer force of Bomber Command, they could bring Germany to \\"a state of devastation in which surrender is inevitable.\\" This suggests that he believed the utter destruction of Germany's infrastructure would be the primary factor in forcing surrender, rather than focusing on breaking the morale of the German people. This shift in focus from morale to economic warfare seemingly contradicted Harris' initial beliefs about the importance of morale on the outcome of the war. In this change, the well-being and mindset of the German people took a back seat to the larger goal of crippling the country's economic and industrial capabilities. Some critics argue that Harris' strategies of relentless, area-wide bombing of German cities went beyond just breaking the economy and may have inadvertently strengthened the resolve of the German people to continue fighting. As the incessant bombing devastated German cities, the suffering populace might have been driven to rally together in defiance against the enemy, potentially negating the intended effect of reducing their morale. In summary, Arthur Harris' plan for economic warfare, particularly the focus on destroying Germany's industrial base, goes against his original view of German morale as a major objective in winning the war. While he initially emphasized the need to break the morale of the German people by attacking their economy, Harris later shifted his attention to creating a state of devastation that would render the enemy unable to continue fighting. This change in focus raised questions about the relationship between economic warfare, morale collapse, and the eventual surrender of Germany, and whether Harris' strategic intentions might have had unintended consequences on German morale."},{"question":"Tous les enfants qui le désirent peuvent obtenir des autorités nationales l'autorisation de rejoindre leur famille, que ce soit à l'intérieur ou à l'extérieur du pays.

Given a command in a limited form of natural language, provide the correct sequence of actions that executes the command to thus navigate an agent in its environment. A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. Actions and commands do not have quotations in the input and output. jump left thrice and walk around left","response":"Part #1: Command repetition Usage: \\"thrice\\" Sample response: Repeats the command it scopes over, three times. Example: \\"jump left thrice\\" would execute \\"jump left\\" three times: I_JUMP_LEFT, I_JUMP_LEFT, I_JUMP_LEFT. The word \\"thrice\\" is used to repeat the action three times. Part #2: Combining commands using 'and' Usage: \\"and\\" Sample response: Execute the following command after the previous command. Example: \\"jump left thrice and walk\\" would execute three jumps to the left (I_JUMP_LEFT, I_JUMP_LEFT, I_JUMP_LEFT), followed by walking (I_WALK). The word \\"and\\" connects these two actions in the specified sequence. Part #3: Execution with movement (around a specified direction) Usage: \\"around left\\" Sample response: Execute the action while turning around in the specified direction. Example: \\"walk around left\\" would execute the walking action while turning around to the left, resulting in: I_TURN_LEFT, I_TURN_LEFT, I_WALK. The agent turns around by 180 degrees to the left (two left turns) before walking. Final Execution: \\"jump left thrice and walk around left\\" Output: I_JUMP_LEFT, I_JUMP_LEFT, I_JUMP_LEFT, I_TURN_LEFT, I_TURN_LEFT, I_WALK The agent first jumps to the left three times, then turns around to the left and walks."},{"question":"Definition: Given a set of five words, generate the word from the set that does not belong (i.e. is the least relevant) with the other words.

Simplify the equation by combining like terms 2. Isolate the variable c on one side of the equation by dividing or multiplying both sides of the equation by a constant 3. Find the value of c Let's work through these steps. Step 1: Simplify the equation -154*c + 113*c = -123 Combine the like terms (the terms with 'c' in them) by adding them together: (-154 + 113) * c = -123 -41*c = -123 Step 2: Isolate the variable c Now we want to get c on its own on one side of the equation. To do that, we'll divide both sides of the equation by -41. (-41*c) / -41 = -123 / -41 This simplifies to: c = 3 Step 3: Find the value of c Now that we have isolated variable c, we have found the value of c: c = 3 So the solution to the linear equation -154*c + 113*c = -123 is c = 3."},{"question":"\\"It could happen today, it could happen 50 days from now, or it could happen ten years from now,\\" he said.

Let me break down how I did this: 1. First, it's important to understand the sentence structure and meaning in the original language (English) to ensure accurate translation. 2. Next, I went phrase by phrase: - '\\"It could happen today' Translates to 'Ar putea să se întâmple astăzi'. In Romanian, the verb usually comes before the subject unlike in English. - 'it could happen 50 days from now' Translates to 'ar putea să se întâmple peste 50 de zile'. In translating time expressions, Romanians often use 'peste', which literally means 'over', but in the context refers to 'from now'. - 'or it could happen ten years from now' Translates to 'sau ar putea să se întâmple peste zece ani'. 3. Last 'he said' is translated directly as 'a spus el'. In Romanian, the usual structure is 'a spus' followed by the speaker.

Education writer Gary Spruce refers to hundreds of similar cases, and cites that of William Crotch of Norwich who in 1778, at the age of three, was giving organ recitals. British scholar Jane O'Connor explains the 18th century fascination with prodigies as \\"the realisation of the potential entertainment and fiscal value of an individual child who was in some way extraordinary\\". Other childhood contemporaries of Mozart included the violinist and composer Thomas Linley, born the same year as Wolfgang, and the organist prodigy Joseph Siegmund Bachmann. Mozart eventually became recognised among prodigies as the future standard for early success and promise.Of seven children born to Leopold and Anna Maria Mozart, only the fourth, Maria Anna (Nannerl), born 31 July 1751, and the youngest, Wolfgang Amadeus, born 27 January 1756, survived infancy. The children were educated at home, under Leopold's guidance, learning basic skills in reading, writing, drawing and arithmetic, together with some history and geography. Their musical education was aided by exposure to the constant rehearsing and playing of Leopold and his fellow musicians. When Nannerl was seven her father began to teach her to play the harpsichord, with Wolfgang looking on; according to Nannerl's own account \\"the boy immediately showed his extraordinary, God-given talent. He often spent long periods at the clavier, picking out thirds, and his pleasure showed that they sounded good to him... When he was five years old he was composing little pieces which he would play to his father who would write them down\\".

Some random thoughts:","response":"To find the probability of choosing at least 1 Snickers bar when choosing 2 consecutive candy bars randomly, we can first find the probability of not choosing any Snickers bars and then subtract that from 1. There are a total of 5 candy bars in the bag (3 Snickers and 2 Milky Way). So, when choosing 2 candy bars, there are 5 choose 2 ways to make this selection which can be computed as: 5! / (2! * (5-2)!) Now let's consider the scenario where we choose no Snickers bars. That means we would have to choose both Milky Way bars. There is only 1 way to do this (2 choose 2), which can be computed as: 2! / (2! * (2-2)!) Now, to find the probability of not choosing a Snickers bar, we can divide the number of ways to choose 2 Milky Way bars by the total number of ways to choose 2 candy bars: P(No Snickers) = (2! / (2! * (2-2)!)) / (5! / (2! * (5-2)!)) Now, to find the probability of choosing at least 1 Snickers, we can subtract the probability of not choosing any Snickers from 1: P(At least 1 Snickers) = 1 - P(No Snickers) Let's compute P(No Snickers): P(No Snickers) = (2! / (2! * (2-2)!)) / (5! / (2! * (5-2)!)) = 1/10 Now let's compute P(At least 1 Snickers): P(At least 1 Snickers) = 1 - P(No Snickers) = 1 - 1/10 = 9/10 So the answer is (A) 9/10."},{"question":"Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative? pure , exciting moviemaking","response":"To understand the sentiment of the sentence, I'll analyze the keywords and their context. 1.

Many plants—like ginger, onion, gladioli, and dahlia—continue to grow from buds that are present on the surface of the stem. In some plants, such as the sweet potato, adventitious roots or runners can give rise to new plants Figure 32.25. In Bryophyllum and kalanchoe, the leaves have small buds on their margins. When these are detached from the plant, they grow into independent plants; or, they may start growing into independent plants if the leaf touches the soil.

This implies that the lighting of candles is an essential aspect of the tradition and is observed by the people in the Antilles region. The purpose of this tradition is to honor the saints and the deceased, creating a vivid representation of respect, love, and remembrance for their departed loved ones. On the other hand, the hypothesis suggests that All Saints' Day is observed by turning off all lights and blowing out all candles on the island, which goes against the act of illuminating graves with candles described in the premise. The hypothesis implies that there is darkness on the island, with no candles or lights in use during the observance of All Saints' Day. This presents an entirely different scenario from the premise, lacking the same visual and emotional impact that the candlelit graves in the cemetery achieve. While the premise and hypotheses contain different explanations of observing All Saints' Day, it is clear that if the premise is true, as given, then the hypothesis cannot be true, as it contradicts the premise's core practice. The tradition of illuminating graves with candles in cemeteries during All Saints' Day in the Antilles region suggests a more community-driven, visually symbolic, and poignant way of observing the day, while the hypothesis presents an opposing scenario grounded in darkness and the absence of light. In conclusion, based on the true premise, the hypothesis \\"All Saints' Day on November 1 is observed by turning off all lights and blowing out all candles on the island\\" is incorrect and incompatible with the established tradition in the Antilles. The observance of All Saints' Day, or La Toussaint, in the Antilles, entails the lighting of candles on graves in cemeteries rather than extinguishing lights and candles across the island."},{"question":"Complete the following sentence.

Well, there's something a bit strange going on with the numbers of the things we sold in February. EPMI and EES (think of them like two rooms filled with different toys) are having some differences in the number of toys we thought we sold and the ones we really sold. It's like when we count toys and discover there are more or fewer than we expected. We should all sit together, maybe during snack time or after we draw some pictures, and talk about what could have happened. We should double-check our numbers, like we do with counting our toys, and make sure everything is just right. Please let me know when you can meet to talk about it and fix it together. You can reply to this email, just like when you write a letter to a friend, or give me a call if you prefer talking. We want to make sure we have the right numbers of toys and clothes so that everyone can have fun and be happy. Thank you so much, and I'm looking forward to our little meeting!

As the capital and largest city of Jilin Province, Changchun is known as an important industrial base of the nation, particularly in the automotive sector. In this context, Hongqi and Changchun share a strong connection since FAW Group Corporation, the Chinese state-owned automotive manufacturing company headquartered in Changchun, owns the luxury car marque Hongqi. FAW Group Corporation, which was established in 1953, has played a significant role in the development of the automotive industry in China. It was in Changchun that FAW Group unveiled the nation's first domestically produced passenger car, Hongqi, in 1958. Hongqi cars were initially manufactured exclusively for high-ranking party elites and government officials, symbolizing prestige and the advancement of the Chinese auto industry. This marked a milestone in China's automobile production capabilities and highlighted Changchun's importance in this sector. Over the years, FAW Group has continued to grow, now producing a range of automobiles, buses, light, medium, and heavy-duty trucks, and auto parts, with Hongqi remaining as one of its key brands. The Hongqi brand currently offers a variety of models catering to a broader market and has become a symbol of Chinese automotive luxury.

The passage primarily discusses the call for the release of two kidnapped French journalists in Iraq, which is a matter related to international political issues and the Islamic world.

While there are references to various entities such as the government in Paris and individuals like Amr Mussa (the Secretary-General of the Arab League), there is no indication that this situation directly pertains to sports, business, or science/technology.

The fact that the passage points to numerous calls for the release of the kidnapped journalists from various stakeholders (including the French government and voices from the Islamic world) demonstrates an interaction between various international entities, which is the essence of world politics.

Answer the above question based on the context below: For a French composer of the 19th century, opera was seen as the most important type of music. Saint-Saëns's younger contemporary and rival, Massenet, was beginning to gain a reputation as an operatic composer, but Saint-Saëns, with only the short and unsuccessful La princesse jaune staged, had made no mark in that sphere. In February 1877, he finally had a full-length opera staged. His four-act \\"drame lyricque\\", Le timbre d'argent (\\"The Silver Bell\\"), to Jules Barbier's and Michel Carré's libretto, reminiscent of the Faust legend, had been in rehearsal in 1870, but the outbreak of war halted the production. The work was eventually presented by the Théâtre Lyrique company of Paris; it ran for eighteen performances.The dedicatee of the opera, Albert Libon, died three months after the premiere, leaving Saint-Saëns a large legacy \\"To free him from the slavery of the organ of the Madeleine and to enable him to devote himself entirely to composition\\". Saint-Saëns, unaware of the imminent bequest, had resigned his position shortly before his friend died. He was not a conventional Christian, and found religious dogma increasingly irksome; he had become tired of the clerical authorities' interference and musical insensitivity; and he wanted to be free to accept more engagements as a piano soloist in other cities. After this he never played the organ professionally in a church service, and rarely played the instrument at all. He composed a Messe de Requiem in memory of his friend, which was performed at Saint-Sulpice to mark the first anniversary of Libon's death; Charles-Marie Widor played the organ and Saint-Saëns conducted. In December 1877, Saint-Saëns had a more solid operatic success, with Samson et Dalila, his one opera to gain and keep a place in the international repertoire. Because of its biblical subject, the composer had met many obstacles to its presentation in France, and through Liszt's influence the premiere was given at Weimar in a German translation. Although the work eventually became an... A:","response":"The provided context does not specifically mention how many different countries Saint-Saëns visited.

Yehuda: Oh, great. Just my luck. (sighs) Thanks for letting me know, Amit. How long did they say it would take? Amit: They weren't sure, but they estimated it could take several hours. Yehuda: This is going to seriously disrupt my day. I can't even make calls now, and I still have so much work left to do. Not to mention, I promised Aria that I'd join her for a virtual movie night. (Aria enters. She was eavesdropping and heard the situation.) Aria: (worried) Oh no, Yehuda. Is it really that bad? The internet outage? Yehuda: Yep, unfortunately. Amit just filled me in. We might be offline for a while. Aria: What are you going to do about your meetings and the rest of your work? And our movie night? Yehuda: (sighs) I guess I'll have to go to a cafe or use my phone's internet hotspot for my meetings. It might not be perfect, but it'll have to do. As for the movie night, we can postpone it or maybe do something else offline? Aria: Hmm, you're right. We can always watch the movie another time. You know, this might be an opportunity for us to connect more offline. Maybe we could cook dinner together, or play board games. I've been dying to beat you at Scrabble! Yehuda: (smiles) That sounds like a great idea, Aria. We do spend a lot of our time online and this could be a chance to unplug and enjoy some quality time together. Amit: Hey, that sounds like fun! Can I join you guys? Yehuda: Of course, Amit! The more, the merrier. Aria: I'll start looking for some fun board games and make a list of ingredients for dinner. We can go shopping together later! This might turn out to be a fun evening after all. (Scene: Yehuda, Aria, and Amit all go about their day, adapting to life without the internet momentarily. In the end, they enjoy a memorable evening filled with good food, laughter, and friendly competition.) Lesson: The sudden loss of internet forced Yehuda, Aria, and Amit to adapt and find enjoyment in offline activities. They realized that sometimes disconnecting from the digital world can create cherished memories and strengthen relationships."},{"question":"Write highlights for this article: The chairman of the House panel responsible for green-lighting war spending warned the Obama administration Thursday that ruling out 'boots on the ground' in the battle against ISIS if it formally asks Congress to authorize future military operations. 'I will not support sending our military into harm’s way with their arms tied behind their backs,' said Armed Services Committee Chairman Buck McKeon, a California Republican who is in the last weeks before his retirement. He warned during a committee hearing that regardless of who holds his gavel when a formal Authorization for Use of Military Force comes to Capitol Hill from the White House, 'should the AUMF proposed by the president contain such limitations it will be DOA in Congress.' Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey said in the same hearing that Iraqi military forces are making progress restoring order in the Northern city of Mosul and re-establishing the country's border with Syria. As those operations gain traction, he said, the 'boots on the ground' question could be re-opened. 'I'm not predicting at this point that I would recommend that those forces in Mosul and along the border would need to be accompanied by U.S. forces, but we're certainly considering it,' Dempsey told lawmakers. Buck McKeon, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, issued a pointed warning that Congress would refuse to sign a permission slip for war unless the option of using ground troops were left on the table. 'I don't know specifically what they are going to propose': Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said he;s out of the loop on a new AUMF from the White House. 'WE'RE CERTAINLY CONSIDERING IT': Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey told lawmakers he was open to the idea of recommending US ground troops to Obama. As it conducts a long-term military operation to 'degrade and ultimately destroy' the self-declared Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS), the Obama administration has been relying on an AUMF hastily passed in the weeks following al-Qaeda's September 11, 2001 terror attacks on New York City and the Pentagon – and on an Iraq war resolution passed in 2003. Now, however, the enemy is ISIS, a Muslim caliphate that has rampaged across two-thirds of Syria and Iraq. Its members were expelled from al-Qaeda and the older terror group regards ISIS fighters as apostates. The result has been a White House that is relying on a battlefield permission-slip that many in Congress say is ill-fitting and obsolete. The administration has asked for 5.6 billion in new defense spending authority, raising eyebrows and new questions on the Hill as Obama pledged to double the U.S. military presence in the ISIS war while simultaneously claiming there would be no American battle engagement. McKeon warned Gen. Dempsey that 'limiting our advisers to headquarters buildings will not help newly trained Iraqi and Syrian opposition forces hold terrain, much less defeat [ISIS] in the field.' 'Yet the president has doubled down on his policy of 'no boots on the ground,' despite any advice you give him.' Texas Republican Rep. Mac Thornberry told Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel that vague commitments from the White House has made it impossible for Congress to do its job. 'Until you get words on paper it's kinda hard to make progress,' Thornberry said. Hagel was noncommittal and said the White House was internally debating whether it needs a new AUMF from lawmakers – and how a request should be worded. 'I don't know specifically what they are going to propose,' he said. 'I don't know specifically if they are going to send it up as a legislative proposal.' 'I know the president has had specific conversations with specific members of both the House and Senate on this.' Senate Democrats have found their voices since their Election Day drubbing, and have spent much of the last week demanding a vote on a new AUMF before Republicans take over committee chairmanships and swear in a new majority in January. On Wednesday at the Woodrow WIlson Center in Washington, D.C., Virginia Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine complained that the U.S. has been 'engaged in a war – that is not about imminent defense of the United States – without legal authority.' In a statement after the election, Kaine said he was 'troubled by suggestions ... that Congress should wait until the new Congressional session in 2015 to take this vote.' 'We have already asked too many U.S. service members to risk their lives without a political consensus behind this mission,' he said. ANTI-WAR PROTESTS ONLY ON DAYS ENDING IN 'Y': The Code Pink group sent an activist to disrupt Thursday's proceedings. THE ENEMY: An ISIS fighter gestures from a vehicle in the countryside of the Syrian Kurdish town of Kobane after the terror army took control of the area last month. BOOTS ON THE GROUND ARE KURDISH: While U.S. armed forces aren't carrying weapons into battle, the Peshmerga forces have been holding ISIS at bay. Republicans like North Carolina Rep. Walter Jones insist that anti-ISIS airstrikes are illegal without a congressional go-ahead. 'This is nothing more than an abdication of our constitutional responsibility,' he said Thursday. But moments later he hinted that many Republicans would play a dovish role unless the Obama administration clearly defined victory while asking for billions of dollars to achieve it. 'For goodness sakes, why in the world should be make such a commitment, and we don't even have an endpoint for it?' 'What is the end-state of what we are trying to accomplish?' he asked. 'I don't know how we convince the American people that a nation which is financially broke ... where is it coming from? Please explain to the Congress and the American people how it ends one day?' Hagel insisted that ISIS 'continues to represent a serious threat to American interests, our allies, and the Middle East ... and wields influence over a broad swath of territory in western and northern Iraq and eastern Syria.'","response":"The House Armed Services Committee Chairman, Buck McKeon, has warned the Obama administration to not rule out \\"boots on the ground\\" in the battle against ISIS if it officially requests Congress to authorize future military operations.

Germany midfielder poised to leave in summer before Xabi Alonso moved. Chelsea and Arsenal were chasing his signature and could return again. If no progress is made in contract negotiations, Madrid will sell for £10m. Write an article based on these highlights.","response":"Sure little buddy! So, imagine this, Sami Khedira is a super cool player who works much like a character in a video game. He belongs to a team called Real Madrid which is like a supercool squad in the football world. The thing is, just like we have times when we decide whether we want to keep playing with a certain toy or not, teams in football sometimes have to make a similar decision about their players. In Sami's case, Real Madrid has a decision to make. If Real Madrid and Sami can't agree on a new pact, just like when we can't agree with our friends on which game to play, then Sami will be sold or moved to another team in January. Remember your buddy Mike who moved to another kindergarten last summer because his mom got a new job? It's kind of like that. Sami might have to move to another team. Now, there were two other cool teams, Chelsea and Arsenal (think of them as two other groups of friends), and they wanted to play with Sami before, which is known as 'chasing his signature'. They might want to play with Sami again if he and Real Madrid can't decide on a new play agreement. If Sami and Real Madrid can't fix things up – which is called ‘making progress in contract negotiations’ – then, Madrid has decided, they will allow Sami to go to another team for £10m, which is a lot of money, like enough to buy all the ice-creams in the world!

But one of the regents was Ieyasu Tokugawa, who had been biding his time at Edo for 12 years, nurturing dynastic ambitions of his own. Of the cunning, ruthless triumvirate that came out on top at the end of the country's century of civil war, Tokugawa was without doubt the most patient, the most prudent — and most treacherous. He moved quickly to eliminate his strongest rivals, crushing them in 1600 at the great Battle of Sekigahara (near modern Nagoya). During its subsequent two and a half centuries of rule from the new capital established at Edo, the Tokugawa organized a tightly controlled coalition of some 260 daimyo in strategic strongholds throughout the country. The allegiance of this highly privileged and prestigious group was ensured by cementing their ethical principles in the code of bushido, \\"The way of the warrior\\": loyalty to one's master, defense of one's status and honor, and fulfillment of all obligations. Loyalty was further enforced by holding the vassals' wives and children hostage in Edo. All roads into Edo, the most famous being the Tokaido Highway, had checkpoints for guns coming in and for wives going out. One of the most effective ways of keeping a tight rein on the country was to cut it off from the outside world, to keep Japan Japanese. At first, Ieyasu Tokugawa was eager to promote foreign trade. He wanted silk and encouraged the Dutch and British as good, nonproselytizing Protestants just interested in trade. But he didn't like the Portuguese and Spanish Catholic missionaries, who he felt were undermining traditional Japanese values. He banned their activities in 1612 and two years later ordered the expulsion of all missionaries and unrepentant Japanese converts. Executions and torture followed. Converts were forced to renounce their faith by trampling crucifixes and effigies of Jesus and Mary. The Catholic Church has counted 3,125 martyrs in Japan from 1597 (beginning under Hideyoshi) to 1660. In 1635 the Japanese were forbidden, on pain of death, to attempt to travel abroad, and Japanese citizens already overseas were prevented from returning, in case they brought back subversive Christian doctrines. Western books were banned, as were Chinese books that mentioned Christianity. What question would one ask from this paragraph?","response":"One possible question someone might ask from this paragraph could be: How did Ieyasu Tokugawa's strategies and policies, such as the enforcement of bushido and isolation from the outside world, contribute to the stability and control of Japan during the Tokugawa Shogunate?"},{"question":"Answer the following question: Question: what is jerry lewis real name I found the following answer on Google: On February 22, 2009, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences awarded Lewis the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award .

The sentence you provided, once the spaces have been added, conveys the idea that what you see in front of you (in real life) may not always correspond to what is being depicted or portrayed in a cartoon. This statement points out the differences between reality and artistic representation, more specifically, that of cartoons. Cartoons are a form of visual art that typically involve a series of images combined to tell a story. They may be depicted in a humorous, satirical, or symbolic way, which is often quite different from reality. Cartoons are meant to be a form of entertainment, a thought-provoking tool, or simply a way to express emotions and ideas that may not always align with the real world. On the other hand, real-life situations are affected by complex factors that can't always be fully represented in cartoon form. These factors include emotions, non-verbal communication, cultural context, and individual experiences, among others. As a result, the way a situation unfolds in reality might vary greatly from how it is represented in a cartoon. In many cases, cartoons deliberately choose to simplify or exaggerate certain aspects to emphasize a point, entertain, or make a statement. While this creative license can give cartoons their appeal, it can also lead to unrealistic expectations or misconceptions about certain situations. For example, in various cartoons, a character might appear to fall from a great height without suffering any injuries or consequences. In the real world, such a fall would likely be fatal or lead to serious harm. Similarly, a cartoon about a complicated political situation might simplify issues in order to critique, explore, or make light of them, while in reality, these issues would require in-depth understanding and analysis. In such cases, the cartoon is not intended to accurately portray reality but to provide a unique perspective through exaggeration and simplification. In conclusion, the statement \\"That is not necessarily in front of you is the same situation as in the cartoon\\" serves as a reminder to consider the differences between reality and artistic representation, particularly in the realm of cartoons. While cartoons can be a valuable tool for expression, entertainment, and understanding, it's crucial to remember that reality is far more multifaceted and complex than the images we see on the page or screen."},{"question":"Choose your answer: If \\"A brown dog is licking its nose.\\", does it logically follow that \\"A black dog is licking themselves.\\"?

They appeared 83.5 million years ago in the Late Cretaceous period (Campanian stage) and are the closest living relatives of birds, as the two groups are the only known survivors of the Archosauria. Members of the order's total group, the clade Pseudosuchia, appeared about 250 million years ago in the Early Triassic period, and diversified during the Mesozoic era. The order Crocodilia includes the true crocodiles (family Crocodylidae), the alligators and caimans (family Alligatoridae), and the gharial and false gharial (family Gavialidae). Although the term 'crocodiles' is sometimes used to refer to all of these, a less ambiguous vernacular term for this group is crocodilians. - The clade Sauria was traditionally a suborder for lizards which originally ( before 1800 ) comprised crocodilians too . It has been redefined as the group containing the most recent common ancestor of archosaurs and lepidosaurs and all its descendants ; as such it was commonly thought that Sauria is a crowned - base grouping of diapsids . However , recent genomic studies and comprehensive studies in the fossil record suggest that turtles are closely related to archosaurs , not to parareptiles as previously thought . As such Sauria can be seen as a crowned - group of all modern reptiles ( including birds ) within the larger total group Sauropsida , which also contains various stem - reptile groups . - Reptiles are tetrapod (four-limbed vertebrate) animals in the class Reptilia, comprising today's turtles, crocodilians, snakes, amphisbaenians, lizards, tuatara, and their extinct relatives. The study of these traditional reptile orders, historically combined with that of modern amphibians, is called herpetology. - Herpetology (from Greek \\"\\"herpein\\"\\" meaning \\"to creep\\") is the branch of zoology concerned with the study of amphibians (including frogs, toads, salamanders, newts, and caecilians (gymnophiona)) and reptiles (including snakes, lizards, amphisbaenids, turtles, terrapins, tortoises, crocodilians, and the tuataras). Batrachology is a further subdiscipline of herpetology concerned with the study of amphibians alone. - Amphisbaenia (called amphisbaenians or worm lizards) is a group of usually legless squamates, comprising over 180 extant species. Amphisbaenians are characterized by their long bodies, the reduction or loss of the limbs, and rudimentary eyes. As many species have a pink body and scales arranged in rings, they have a superficial resemblance to earthworms. While the genus \\"Bipes\\" retains forelimbs, all other genera are limbless. Although superficially similar to the snakes and Dibamidae, recent phylogenetic studies suggest that they are most closely related to the Lacertidae. Amphisbaenians are widely distributed, occurring in North America, Europe, Africa, South America, and the Caribbean. Most species are less than long. Little is known of them outside of their anatomy, and even that is difficult to study due to the mechanics of dissecting such small animals. - Sauropsida (\\"lizard faces\\") is a group of amniotes that includes all existing birds and reptiles as well as their fossil ancestors and other extinct relatives. Large land animals are either in this group or in its sister group, Synapsida, which includes mammals and their fossil relatives. This clade includes Parareptilia and other extinct clades. All living sauropsids are members of the sub-group Diapsida, the Parareptilia clade having died out 200 million years ago. The term originated in 1864 with Thomas Henry Huxley, who grouped birds with reptiles based on fossil evidence. - Lizards are a widespread group of squamate reptiles, with over 6,000 species, ranging across all continents except Antarctica, as well as most oceanic island chains. The group, traditionally recognized as the suborder Lacertilia, is defined as all extant members of the Lepidosauria (reptiles with overlapping scales) that are neither sphenodonts (i.e., tuatara) nor snakes they form an evolutionary grade. While the snakes are recognized as falling phylogenetically within the Toxicofera clade from which they evolved, the sphenodonts are the sister group to the squamates, the larger monophyletic group, which includes both the lizards and the snakes. - Diapsids (\\"two arches\\") are a group of amniote tetrapods that developed two holes (temporal fenestra) in each side of their skulls about 300 million years ago during the late Carboniferous period. The diapsids are extremely diverse, and include all crocodiles, lizards, snakes, tuatara, turtles, and dinosaurs (both avian and non-avian). Although some diapsids have lost either one hole (lizards), or both holes (snakes and turtles), or have a heavily restructured skull (modern birds), they are still classified as diapsids based on their ancestry. At least 7,925 species of diapsid reptiles exist in environments around the world today (nearly 18,000 when birds are included). - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds. - Tuatara are reptiles endemic to New Zealand. Although resembling most lizards, they are part of a distinct lineage, the order Rhynchocephalia. Their name derives from the Mori language, and means \\"peaks on the back\\". The single species of tuatara is the only surviving member of its order, which flourished around 200 million years ago. Their most recent common ancestor with any other extant group is with the squamates (lizards and snakes). For this reason, tuatara are of great interest in the study of the evolution of lizards and snakes, and for the reconstruction of the appearance and habits of the earliest diapsids, a group of amniote tetrapods that also includes dinosaurs, birds, and crocodilians. - The superclass Tetrapoda (Ancient Greek s tetrapods, \\"four-footed\\"), or the tetrapods , comprises the first four-limbed vertebrates and their descendants, including the living and extinct amphibians, birds, mammals, reptiles and some ancient, exclusively aquatic creatures such as the Acanthostega. Tetrapods evolved from the lobe-finned fishes around 390 million years ago in the middle Devonian Period, with modern tetrapod groups having appeared by the late Devonian, 367.5 million years ago. The specific aquatic ancestors of the tetrapods, and the process by which land colonization occurred, remain unclear, and are areas of active research and debate among palaeontologists at present. - Mammals are any vertebrates within the class Mammalia (from Latin \\"mamma\\" \\"breast\\"), a clade of endothermic amniotes distinguished from reptiles and birds by the possession of a neocortex (a region of the brain), hair, three middle ear bones and mammary glands. The sister group of mammals may be the extinct \\"Haldanodon.\\" The mammals represent the only living Synapsida, which together with the Sauropsida form the Amniota clade. The mammals consist of the Yinotheria including monotrema and the Theriiformes including the theria. - Parareptilia (\\"at the side of reptiles\\") is a subclass or clade of reptiles which is variously defined as an extinct group of primitive anapsids, or a more cladistically correct alternative to Anapsida. Whether the term is valid depends on the phylogenetic position of turtles, the relationships of which to other reptilian groups are still uncertain. - Toxicofera (Greek for \\"those who bear toxins\\"), is a proposed clade of scaled reptiles (squamates) that includes the Serpentes (snakes), Anguimorpha (monitor lizards, gila monster, and alligator lizards) and Iguania (iguanas, agamas, and chameleons). Toxicofera contains about 4600 species, (nearly 60%) of extant squamata. It encompasses all venomous reptile species, as well as numerous related non-venomous species. There is little morphological evidence to support this grouping, however it has been recovered by all recent molecular analyses. - Snakes are elongated, legless, carnivorous reptiles of the suborder Serpentes that can be distinguished from legless lizards by their lack of eyelids and external ears. Like all squamates, snakes are ectothermic, amniote vertebrates covered in overlapping scales. Many species of snakes have skulls with several more joints than their lizard ancestors, enabling them to swallow prey much larger than their heads with their highly mobile jaws. To accommodate their narrow bodies, snakes' paired organs (such as kidneys) appear one in front of the other instead of side by side, and most have only one functional lung. Some species retain a pelvic girdle with a pair of vestigial claws on either side of the cloaca. - Amphibians are ectothermic, tetrapod vertebrates of the class Amphibia. Modern amphibians are all Lissamphibia. They inhabit a wide variety of habitats, with most species living within terrestrial, fossorial, arboreal or freshwater aquatic ecosystems. Thus amphibians typically start out as larvae living in water, but some species have developed behavioural adaptations to bypass this. The young generally undergo metamorphosis from larva with gills to an adult air-breathing form with lungs. Amphibians use their skin as a secondary respiratory surface and some small terrestrial salamanders and frogs lack lungs and rely entirely on their skin. They are superficially similar to lizards but, along with mammals and birds, reptiles are amniotes and do not require water bodies in which to breed. With their complex reproductive needs and permeable skins, amphibians are often ecological indicators; in recent decades there has been a dramatic decline in amphibian populations for many species around the globe. - Synapsids (Greek, 'fused arch'), synonymous with theropsids (Greek, 'beast-face'), are a group of animals that includes mammals and every animal more closely related to mammals than to other living amniotes. They are easily separated from other amniotes by having a temporal fenestra, an opening low in the skull roof behind each eye, leaving a bony arch beneath each; this accounts for their name. Primitive synapsids are usually called pelycosaurs or pelycosaur-grade synapsids; more advanced mammal-like ones, therapsids. The non-mammalian members are described as mammal-like reptiles in classical systematics; they can also be called stem mammals or proto-mammals. Synapsids evolved from basal amniotes and are one of the two major groups of the later amniotes; the other is the sauropsids, a group that includes modern reptiles and birds. The distinctive temporal fenestra developed in the ancestral synapsid about 312 million years ago, during the Late Carboniferous period.

She and Republican Rep. Tom Cole, a Native American Caucus member, have today sent a letter to NFL commissioner Roger Goodell condemning the name. Cole is one of two Native Americans on Capitol Hill, the Washington Post notes. \\"The National Football League can no longer ignore this and perpetuate the use of this name as anything but what it is: a racial slur,\\" the letter says, noting that \\"virtually every major civil rights organization in America has spoken out in opposition to this name.\\" The lawmakers call on Goodell and the NFL to formally back a name change; though they aren't explicit about the league's 501(c)(6) status being in jeopardy in the letter, they do mention that status.

If the NFL fails to address the situation, these lawmakers will \\"definitely\\" review the league's tax-exempt status. The Redskins' name has been a subject of debate and controversy for years, with many Native Americans and civil rights organizations arguing that the name is a racial slur. Despite these concerns, the NFL and team owner Daniel Snyder have yet to take any decisive action. Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell, head of the Indian Affairs Committee, stated in a New York Times interview that the NFL is receiving a tax break for educational purposes, while still promoting a name that many people perceive as a racial slur. Sen. Cantwell and Republican Rep. Tom Cole, a member of the Native American Caucus, sent a letter today to NFL commissioner Roger Goodell, condemning the use of the name. The Washington Post notes that Rep. Cole is one of two Native Americans on Capitol Hill. The letter sent by Cantwell and Cole highlights the fact that \\"virtually every major civil rights organization in America has spoken out in opposition to this name.\\" They call on Goodell and the NFL to formally support a name change. Although the lawmakers' letter does not explicitly state that the league's 501(c)(6) tax-exempt status is at risk, they do mention the status, sending a veiled warning to the NFL. In response, the Washington Redskins released a statement via a spokesperson to the New York Times. The representative questioned the priorities of Congress, arguing that there are more pressing issues to address, such as the war in Afghanistan, budget deficits, and healthcare. The spokesperson also pointed out that the name of Oklahoma means \\"red people\\" in Choctaw, making the lawmakers' request \\"a little ironic.\\" The Redskins' name controversy has persisted for years, with calls for a change growing louder. Many argue that the name is outdated and offensive, while others maintain that the name is a tradition and part of the team's history. Several media outlets have chosen to use alternative names when referring to the team, and some schools have dropped the name and mascot from their athletic programs. Despite these efforts, the NFL and team owner Daniel Snyder have resisted calls for a name change. The possibility of losing its tax-exempt status may force the NFL to reconsider its position on the matter. As a 501(c)(6) tax-exempt organization, the NFL is obligated to act in the best interests of its members and promote the common business interest of its industry. Some argue that by ignoring the controversy surrounding the Redskins' name and the concerns of Native Americans and civil rights organizations, the NFL is failing to fulfill this obligation. The intervention of lawmakers may be the catalyst needed to create change within the league, bringing the controversial team name to an end. In conclusion, the Washington Redskins name controversy is far from over, as lawmakers are now threatening to review the NFL's tax-exempt status if no action is taken. With increasing public pressure and potential financial repercussions, the NFL may finally be forced to address this long-standing issue. As the spotlight continues to shine on the Washington Redskins, only time will tell if this new challenge will lead to a significant and lasting change in the organization's approach to its name and identity."},{"question":"À la date d'entrée en vigueur, chaque Première nation Maa-nulth est propriétaire en fief simple des terres des Premières nations Maa-nulth qui lui appartiennent et, sous réserve de l'article 6, ce droit de propriété en fief simple n'est assujetti à aucune condition, restriction, exception ou réserve énoncée dans la Land Act, ni à aucune limitation assimilée prévue dans une loi fédérale ou provinciale.

Answer: Inhibition of bFGF synthesis in vivo with the use of adenoviral gene transfer of antisense RNA to bFGF promotes a vein graft with decreased tangential stress while maintaining the luminal area. The vein graft wall is remodeled and qualitatively resembles an artery so that wall tangential stress in Ad.ASbFGF and normal artery are not significantly different. The lack of significant difference in lumen circumference among groups suggests that wall thickening in the Ad. ASbFGF grafts is not at the expense of luminal narrowing.

The school is widely believed to be Williams College, Webb's alma mater (in the opening sequence of the movie, Dustin Hoffman, playing Benjamin Braddock, is wearing a Williams College tie). Benjamin is seen arriving at LAX International Airport over the opening credits.The movie really begins at a party that same evening celebrating his graduation at his parents' house in Pasadena, a suburb of Los Angeles. Benjamin is visibly uncomfortable at the party attended by his parents' friends. He remains aloof while his parents deliver accolades and neighborhood friends ask him about his future plans. Benjamin escapes from each person who comes to congratulate him, exposing his seeming embarrassment at all the honors he had won at college. Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft), the neglected wife of his father's law partner, asks Benjamin to drive her home, which he reluctantly does. We never learn Mrs. Robinson's first name (or, indeed, the first names of any of Benjamin's and Elaine's parents) during the course of the film (in the novel, we are told that the initial of Mrs. Robinson's first name is G).Arriving at her home, she pleads for Benjamin to come inside, saying that she doesn't like to enter a dark house alone.

Article: Slang is a popular, less official and often very current form of language. It is an important part of a living language and is constantly changing as language changes. Slang is often playful, direct and sometimes less respectful than the more official and traditional version of language. So now I'm going to lay it on you! To \\"lay it on\\" is American slang for \\"to tell\\" or \\"to explain.\\" Slang can take many forms. For example, slang can be local to one city or area. In Washington, D.C. there is a whole set of slang to describe politics and business in the city. For example, the term POTUS stands for President of the United States. POTUS can often be found with his wife, FLOTUS, the first lady of the United States. \\"Inside the Beltway\\" is a popular expression that describes the area of Washington, D.C. The beltway is the large highway that circles the city. The Internet has helped create a whole new kind of computer-related slang. An \\"angry fruit salad\\" is an expression that describes a website with too many bright colors. \\"Netiquette\\" is slang for correct behavior when using the Internet. Young people often develop the latest slang. For example, to say Special English \\"rocks\\" or is \\"phat\\" means Special English is really great. A \\"kegger\\" is a party where beer is served. If something is \\"wack\\", it is wild and crazy. Different professions often have their own slang as well. For example, medical workers might refer to a complaining patient as a \\"gomer\\". A \\"tough stick\\" is someone whose veins are difficult to find when he or she needs to have blood taken. No matter how well you speak English, there are always new and interesting slang words to discover. There are entire dictionaries for describing slang. Many experts do not even agree on what is and what is not slang. Often slang words later become a part of officially accepted language. Official or not, slang is an energetic and exciting part of the American language that continues to change. Question: Which of the following is NOT true for slang compared with the official language?

My family and I were excited to try The Grand Gourmet based on its reputation for being a high-quality establishment with exceptional service. Unfortunately, our experience there fell far short of our expectations, and I can't help but wonder if the glowing reviews are somehow fabricated. First and foremost, the service was abysmal. Upon arrival, we were greeted by a visibly irritated hostess who acted as if we were inconveniencing her by simply being there. There was a heavy air of unprofessionalism and indifference prevailing throughout the staff, and it immediately dampened our anticipation. After a 30-minute wait past our reservation time, we were finally seated at a cluttered table, which we had to clear by ourselves. No apologies were offered for the delay or dirty table. The waitstaff were no better. Our server appeared hurried and distracted, barely making eye contact as she took our order. She failed to notify us of menu alterations or specials and provided minimal guidance or recommendations. The time it took to receive our meals was almost an hour, and our server never once checked in on us during that time. When our food finally arrived, two of our orders were incorrect, and the meals were cold. With regards to the food itself, the taste was profoundly underwhelming. The Grand Gourmet supposedly prides itself on its “bold flavors” and “innovative cuisine.” However, both the appetizers and main courses we ordered were bland. The tomato basil soup was so watery it should be called tomato broth, and the Caesar salad hardly passed as a salad due to the paltry amount of greens topped with what seemed like store-bought dressing. The grilled salmon, marketed as “tender, flaky, and vibrant,” was dry and lacked seasoning. The steak, requested medium-rare, arrived overcooked and tough, leaving us questioning the skill of the kitchen staff. To make matters worse, the ambiance was chaotic. The music was far too loud, making it nearly impossible to have a conversation with my family. The tables were packed too closely together, resulting in an uncomfortable lack of privacy. Also, the overall cleanliness of the facility left much to be desired. When it came time to address our concerns, the manager failed to exhibit any form of genuine concern or willingness to rectify the situation, only offering hollow apologies without concrete action. At the end of the night, we left feeling deflated and unsatisfied, with no sense of value received for the exorbitant prices paid. In summary, The Grand Gourmet was an utter disappointment filled with poor service, subpar food, and a chaotic atmosphere. There are far better dining options available with superior quality, service, and ambiance. I regret that I cannot, in good conscience, recommend The Grand Gourmet to anyone, and I will not be returning in the future."},{"question":"Given the question: Title: Bella Tuscany Review: Anyone who loved the movie Under the Tuscan Sun should not expect the same manner of stories from Frances Mayes' books.

Passage:Diagnosis of MCC begins with a clinical examination of the skin and lymph nodes. Following, definitive diagnosis of Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) requires examination of biopsy tissue to identify its histopathologic features. An ideal biopsy specimen is either a punch biopsy or a full-thickness incisional biopsy of the skin including full-thickness dermis and subcutaneous fat. On light microscopy, MCC shows basaloid tumor nests with neuroendocrine features (\\"salt and pepper\\" chromatin, scarce cytoplasm, and brisk mitotic activity). In addition to standard examination under light microscopy, immunohistochemistry (IHC) is also generally required to differentiate MCC from other morphologically similar tumors such as small cell lung cancer, the small cell variant of melanoma, various cutaneous leukemic/lymphoid neoplasms, and Ewing's sarcoma. Similarly, most experts recommend longitudinal imaging of the chest, typically a CT scan, to rule out that the possibility that the skin lesion is a skin metastasis of an underlying small cell carcinoma of the lung.

Spelling and Grammar: The review contains spelling errors, such as \\"Awsome\\" instead of \\"Awesome\\" and \\"wothout\\" instead of \\"without.\\" Additionally, the phrase \\"You ould play\\" should be \\"You could play,\\" and \\"woth\\" should be \\"with.\\" Due to these errors, I would give it a 1 on this aspect. 2. Clarity and Communication: The message could be clearer. It is possible to understand that the reviewer is saying one can play games without using an APK, but it would be more effective if it were written more clearly. I would give it a 2 on this aspect. 3. Content and Information: The review is quite brief and does not provide much information about the product or service being reviewed. There is no mention of specific features or benefits, making it difficult for potential users to assess whether it would meet their needs. As such, I would give it a 1 on this aspect. 4. Objectivity and Fairness: The review expresses a generally positive sentiment, but it could be more objective by providing reasons for its enthusiasm and discussing potential drawbacks. This would help potential users make a more informed decision. In its current state, I would give it a 2 on this aspect. 5. Usefulness and Relevance: The review could be more useful if it described the specific features or functions that make it possible to play games without using APKs. Simply stating that it's possible does not provide much insight or guidance for potential users. As such, I would give it a 1 on this aspect. Averaging these scores, the overall rating for this review would be a 1.4/5. This indicates that it is not a particularly favorable review in terms of spelling and grammar, clarity, content, objectivity, and usefulness. To improve the rating, the review could be expanded to provide more information about the product or service, and written more clearly with proper spelling and grammar."},{"question":"Given the question: Adam wants to show his little brother a trick. He gets a bucket of water and says to him \\"I bet i can turn this bucket upside down and no water will fall out\\". His brother doesn't believe him of course. So Adam takes the bucket by the handle and quickly starts spinning it in a circle. Given Adam stops swinging the bucket, will its centripetal acceleration increase or decrease? Hint: Centripetal force is, simply, the force that causes centripetal acceleration. Objects that move in uniform circular motion all have an acceleration toward the center of the circle and therefore, they must also suffer a force toward the center of the circle. That force is the centripetal force. For orbiting satellites, such as the moon orbiting the earth or the earth orbiting the sun, the centripetal force is produced by gravity. When an Olympic hammer thrower whirls a massive ball on a chain, the centripetal force is created by the athlete and transmitted by the chain. The answer is:","response":"When Adam stops swinging the bucket, its centripetal acceleration will decrease. This is because the centripetal force that keeps the water in the bucket while spinning is no longer acting on it when he stops. As centripetal acceleration is directly related to the centripetal force, a decrease in force leads to a decrease in acceleration."},{"question":"Intermountain Healthcare is a not-for-profit healthcare system and is the largest healthcare provider in the Intermountain West.

Sines, one of the few seaports on the Alentejo coast, consisted of little more than a cluster of whitewashed, red-tiled cottages, occupied chiefly by fisherfolk. Vasco da Gama's father was Estevao da Gama, who had served in the 1460s as a knight of the household of Infante Ferdinand, Duke of Viseu. He rose in the ranks of the military Order of Santiago. From the earlier part of the 15th century, Portuguese expeditions organized by Prince Henry the Navigator had been reaching down the African coastline, principally in search of west African riches (notably, gold). They had greatly extended Portuguese maritime knowledge, but had little profit to show for the effort. After Henry's death in 1460, the Portuguese Crown showed little interest in continuing this effort and, in 1469, sold off the neglected African enterprise to a private Lisbon merchant consortium led by Fernao Gomes. Within a few years, Gomes' captains expanded Portuguese knowledge across the Gulf of Guinea, doing business in gold dust, Melegueta pepper, ivory and sub-Saharan slaves. When Gomes' charter came up for renewal in 1474, Prince John (future John II), asked his father Afonso V of Portugal to pass the African charter to him. Upon becoming king in 1481, John II of Portugal set out on many long reforms. To break the monarch's dependence on the feudal nobility, John II needed to build up the royal treasury; he considered royal commerce to be the key to achieving that. Under John II's watch, the gold and slave trade in west Africa was greatly expanded. He was eager to break into the highly profitable spice trade between Europe and Asia, which was conducted chiefly by land. At the time, this was virtually monopolized by the Republic of Venice, who operated overland routes via Levantine and Egyptian ports, through the Red Sea across to the spice markets of India. John II set a new objective for his captains: to find a sea route to Asia by sailing around the African continent. By the time Vasco da Gama was in his 20s, the king's plans were coming to fruition. In 1487, John II dispatched two spies, Pero da Covilha and Afonso de Paiva, overland via Egypt to East Africa and India, to scout the details of the spice markets and trade routes. The breakthrough came soon after, when John II's captain Bartolomeu Dias returned from rounding the Cape of Good Hope in 1488, having explored as far as the Fish River (Rio do Infante) in modern-day South Africa and having verified that the unknown coast stretched away to the northeast. An explorer was needed who could prove the link between the findings of Dias and those of da Covilha and de Paiva, and connect these separate segments into a potentially lucrative trade route across the Indian Ocean.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Who headed the explorations?","response":"A person named Vasco da Gama headed the explorations."},{"question":"Поддерживается работа в большинстве современных систем.

The latest figures reveal there were more than 7,000 complaints from the public to the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) in 2011/12, up from fewer than 5,000 the previous year. A Panorama investigation on Monday claimed that the Government-regulated service, the Telephone Preference Service, intended to allow people to block cold callers, was being ignored by some telemarketing firms. Increase: The latest figures reveal there were more than 7,000 complaints from the public to the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) in 2011/12, up from fewer than 5,000 the previous year. New legal powers mean the worst offenders now face fines of up to £500,000, but despite thousands of complaints to the ICO, the BBC programme revealed there had not been any fines imposed on offending companies for at least 18 months. Information Commissioner Christopher Graham said: 'Last year we gained tough new powers to tackle unsolicited marketing calls and texts. We are working to identify the operators responsible. 'The ICO has executed search warrants at a number of sites across the UK linked to companies we believe are breaking the law. 'We have also set up an online reporting mechanism on our website that allows people to report any marketing texts or calls from unidentified senders.' An exact total of 7,095 complaints were received under the Privacy and Electronic Communication Regulations (PECR), which govern electronic marketing, last year, up from 4,953 in 2010/11, the ICO's annual report showed. Irritating: Cold-calling can provoke a reaction in recipients who often. choose to opt to get such companies blocked. However, investigative. program Panorama has claimed that some companies have ignored this. Mr Graham added: 'We are confident that this work will help us identify those responsible.' Around 17.5 million phone numbers are registered with the Telephone Preference Service (TPS) - a scheme designed to prevent UK-based companies from making unwanted cold calls. Industry rules say telemarketing firms should crosscheck their database to ensure that people who have asked not to be cold called are left in peace. But Mike Lordan at the Direct Marketing Association, which runs the TPS, told Panorama that some companies were ignoring the rules. The UK public receive up to three billion marketing calls a year, Panorama reported.

Pastor Frank Pomeroy of the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs told leaders of the Southern Baptist Convention earlier this week that it would be too painful to continue using the church as a place of worship. Pomeroy, who lost his own 14-year-old daughter in the massacre, proposed turning the site into a memorial and building another church on a different site. The final decision on the fate of the building will be made by the denomination's top leaders, who traveled to the rural community in a show of support. But a national Southern Baptist spokesman said the pastor's wishes will be taken into consideration. Other sites of mass shootings have been torn down, including Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut, where a gunman killed 20 children and six adults in December 2012. A new school was built elsewhere. A one-room Amish schoolhouse near Lancaster, Pennsylvania, was torn down in 2006, 10 days after an assailant took children hostage and shot and killed five girls ages 6 to 13. The original site of the school is now a pasture. A nearly identical schoolhouse with a security fence was erected nearby. Also Thursday, the father of the Texas gunman broke his silence to say his family is in mourning. Michael Kelley spoke to ABC News on Wednesday from his home in New Braunfels, about 55 kilometers north of Sutherland Springs. He refused to comment further, saying he does not want the \\"media circus'' surrounding the attack by Devin Patrick Kelley to destroy \\"our lives, our grandchildren's lives.'' A motive for the carnage remains unclear, but the younger Kelley appears to have targeted the church because it was attended by his wife's family.

To help clarify, here are the items from your choices that emit electromagnetic radiation, along with explanations: 1. Light Bulb - A light bulb emits electromagnetic radiation in the form of visible light and heat when switched on. 2. Vehicles - Parts of a vehicle's electrical system emit electromagnetic radiation, such as radio units and in-car infotainment systems. 3. Satellites - Satellites emit electromagnetic radiation, primarily in the form of radio waves, to communicate with receivers on Earth. Satellites also use solar panels that absorb electromagnetic radiation from sunlight and convert it into electrical power. 4. Buses - Like vehicles, buses also come with electrical systems that emit electromagnetic radiation, including radio units, GPS devices, and infotainment systems. 5. Engines - Engine ignition systems emit electromagnetic radiation in the form of radio waves due to switching and sparking, although these emissions are generally minimal. Other items in the list, such as firecrackers, sensory neurons, and objects, do not emit significant electromagnetic radiation. Firecrackers primarily release chemical energy in the form of heat, light, and sound. Sensory neurons transmit electrical signals through the nervous system, which is not the same as emitting electromagnetic radiation.

Among the numerous talented players in the world of football, one rising star has recently grabbed the attention of fans and sports analysts alike: Austin. So, the pressing question for football enthusiasts remains, \\"how many yards did Austin pass?\\" To fully address this query, we will delve into Austin's recent games, analyze his overall performance, and identify the factors contributing to his passing yards. Step 1: Collect data from Austin's recent games To determine Austin's passing yards, we first need to gather data from his most recent games. We will focus on his performance within the current season, obtained from official sources like official team websites, sports news outlets, and player statistics databases such as ESPN or Pro-Football-Reference. This information will serve as the foundation for our analysis. Step 2: Calculate Austin's average passing yards per game Once we have gathered the necessary data on Austin's passing yards in each game, we'll calculate his average passing yards per game.

Step-by-step reasoning:","response":"Option: No Let's think first. Step-by-step reasoning: 1. The statement suggests that hanging as a form of execution or suicide always results in immediate death. However, this is not always the case. The outcome of a hanging depends on several factors such as the drop length, knot placement, and the individual's physical attributes. 2. There are different types of hanging, like short-drop hanging and long-drop hanging. In short-drop hanging, the drop is not long enough to break the neck, resulting in slow and painful death due to asphyxiation. In long-drop hanging, the drop is calculated based on the individual's weight and height to ensure a rapid and humane death by breaking the neck and severing the spinal cord. 3. Even in cases where the intent is to cause instantaneous death, hangings can still go wrong. For example, if the drop length is too short, the person may struggle and suffer for a prolonged period of time. Conversely, if the drop is too long, it can result in decapitation, which is undesirable from the perspective of a humane execution. 4. There are also cases where people have survived hanging attempts, either due to an interruption of the process or a miscalculation of the needed force to cause death. In conclusion, the statement \\"Hanging always results in instantaneous death\\" is not factual, as the outcome of a hanging depends on various factors, and there are instances where it leads to slow, painful, or even survivable outcomes."},{"question":"Read the following article and select the best answer.

Mill pretends to recognize Kahane in the lobby, and offers him a scriptwriting deal, hoping this will stop the threats. The two go to a nearby bar where Kahane gets intoxicated and rebuffs Mill's offer; he calls Mill a liar and continues goading him about his job security at the studio.

Trump told reporters Thursday that South Korea will make a \\"major announcement\\" concerning North Korea at 7 p.m. ET. On Thursday a South Korean delegation came to the White House to brief officials on its most recent talks with North Korea -- the most significant talks between the two countries in more than a decade. The South Korean officials visiting the White House on Thursday talked to Trump, a person familiar with the matter said. They delivered a letter from Kim to Trump inviting him to meet, according to a senior US official and a former US senior official. A senior administration official later told reporters that the message and invitation from Kim to Trump was not in a physical letter, but conveyed \\"orally\\" by South Korea's Chung Eui-Yong. \\"This was a message conveyed orally by Kim to the national security adviser of South Korea,\\" the official said. The senior US official said North Korea has offered to suspend their nuclear missile testing alongside their invitation for talks. The official also said there are no plans to suspend the upcoming planned military exercises with South Korea. It's not clear if the South Koreans spoke to the President before or after his surprise pop-in to the White House briefing room. The leader of the South Korean delegation, Chung Eui-yong, will make the announcement from the stakeout position outside the West Wing, according to White House press secretary Sarah Sanders. He will be flanked by rest of the South Korean delegation. National security adviser Lt. General H.R. McMaster will brief the UN Security Council on Monday regarding the situation in North Korea and the talks with the South Korean delegation, according to a senior US official. Trump has expressed an openness to dialogue with North Korea, but the Trump administration has said North Korea must first take concrete steps toward denuclearization. \\"All options are on the table and our posture toward the regime will not change until we see credible moves toward denuclearization,\\" a senior administration official told reporters on Tuesday. \\"What we are looking for is concrete steps toward denuclearization.\\" Trump's approach to North Korea has wavered between bellicose rhetoric and expressions of openness to diplomacy -- with the President saying the US would rain \\"fire and fury\\" on North Korea one day and then saying he would consider speaking directly with the country's leader, Kim Jong Un, under the right circumstances. Amid the potentially breakthrough talks between North and South Korea, the Trump administration has also credited its campaign of \\"maximum pressure\\" on North Korea as having brought Pyongyang to the negotiating table. Since Trump came in to office, the US has leveled some of its most significant and far-reaching sanctions against North Korea and has also succeeded in pressuring China to further isolate the regime. CNN's Will Ripley, Kevin Liptak and Michelle Kosinski contributed reporting. ||||| President Trump has agreed to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un for talks by the end of May, an extraordinary development following months of heightened nuclear tension during which the two leaders exchanged frequent military threats and insults. Kim has also committed to stopping nuclear and missile testing, even during joint military drills in South Korea next month, Chung Eui-yong, the South Korean national security adviser, told reporters at the White House on Thursday. Chung extended the invitation from Kim to meet while briefing Trump on the four-hour dinner he had with the North ­Korean leader in Pyongyang on Monday. After a year in which North Korea fired intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching all of the United States and tested what is widely thought to have been a hydrogen bomb, such a moratorium would be welcomed by the United States and the world. [Trump’s bellicosity secures a diplomatic coup — for now] But there is also significant risk for Trump in agreeing to a meeting apparently without the kind of firm preconditions sought by previous U.S. administrations. There has never been a face-to-face meeting, or even a phone call, between sitting leaders of the two nations because American presidents have been wary of offering the Kim regime the validation of a leaders-level summit on the global stage. A senior White House official said the North Korean leader’s message included a “commitment to denuclearization” and emphasized that the United States would demand verification that the North is meeting its obligations in any prospective deal. Trump told aides that, leading up to the talks, he expects them to maintain the severe economic sanctions imposed on the North over the past year by his administration and the United Nations, the official said. The news stunned Washington’s political leadership and foreign policy analysts who as recently as last month were fretting over the possibility of a military conflagration on the Korean Peninsula. Trump and Kim have spent the past year making belligerent statements about each other, with Trump mocking Kim as “Little Rocket Man” and pledging to ­“totally destroy” North Korea and Kim calling the ­American ­president a “dotard” and a “lunatic” and threatening to send nuclear bombs to Washington, D.C. But renewed dialogue between North and South Korea leading up to and during the Olympics last month offered an opening. Kim has “expressed his eagerness to meet President Trump as soon as possible,” Chung told reporters during a brief statement outside the White House after emerging from the meeting with Trump. “President Trump said he would meet Kim Jong Un by May,” Chung said, but he did not provide any information on where the meeting would be. In Seoul, the presidential Blue House clarified that the meeting would occur by the end of May. [Kim Jong Un wants to be seen as Donald Trump’s equal. A meeting would do that.] There was no immediate word on where a meeting would be held, although it would be unprecedented if it took place outside the Korean Peninsula. The White House confirmed that Trump had accepted Kim’s invitation, which came as a message from Chung rather than in a letter from the North Korean leader. “President Trump greatly appreciates the nice words of the South Korean delegation and President Moon [Jae-in]. He will accept the invitation to meet with Kim Jong Un at a place and time to be determined,” White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement. “We look forward to the denuclearization of North Korea. In the meantime, all sanctions and maximum pressure must remain.” Trump took to Twitter on Thursday night to laud the announcement. “Great progress being made but sanctions will remain until an agreement is reached. Meeting being planned!” he wrote. [Trump says North Korea is ‘sincere’ on reported offer to hold nuclear talks ] Former U.S. officials cautioned that the North has made promises before, only to break them. During President George W. Bush’s second term, after talks with the United States and several other nations, the North agreed to freeze parts of its nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of some economic sanctions. Then it violated the agreement by testing more missiles. Danny Russel, who served as senior Asia director at the National Security Council under President Barack Obama, noted that the Kim regime has sought talks with the U.S. president as a way to gain legitimacy as a nuclear power. “They have long said that ‘if the president would engage directly, then who knows what’s possible?’ ” Russel said. “The fact that they’re looking for the face and the legitimization and the validation of direct engagement of the president of the United States is not new. And it’s not inconsistent with their strategy of seeking to be treated like the Soviet Union, seeking to be accepted as a nuclear peer.” Any meeting between Trump and Kim would be historic. Former president Jimmy Carter met Kim’s grandfather Kim Il Sung, and former president Bill Clinton met his father, Kim Jong Il — during visits to Pyongyang after they had left office. Both Carter and Clinton also went to Pyongyang to collect Americans who had been imprisoned by the regime. Chung led the South Korean delegation earlier this week to North Korea, where Kim and his senior cadre expressed a willingness to hold talks with the United States and were prepared to discuss denuclearization and normalizing relations. During the meetings, Kim “made it clear” that the North would not resume provocations while engaged in those talks, Chung said Tuesday upon returning to Seoul. In front of the White House on Thursday night, Chung credited Trump for bringing the North Korean leader to the table, continuing Seoul’s deliberate efforts to flatter the American president. “I explained to President Trump that his leadership and his maximum-pressure policy, together with international solidarity, brought us to this juncture,” Chung said. It was an extraordinary scene — a foreign official, unaccompanied by U.S. leaders, briefing the press at the White House about the American president’s plans. Chung was flanked by Suh Hoon, the head of South Korea’s intelligence agency, who was also at the dinner in Pyongyang, and Cho Yoon-jae, the South Korean ambassador to the United States. A senior administration official said the White House meeting between Trump and the South Korean officials included senior presidential aides, among them Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Chief of Staff John F. Kelly, a retired Marine Corps general. Trump spoke with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe after the meeting, the official said. “President Trump has been very clear from the beginning, he is not prepared to reward North Korea in exchange for talks,” the official, who was not authorized to speak on the record, told reporters in a background briefing organized by the White House. “But he is willing to accept the invitation at this time to meet . . . and he expects North Korea to start putting action to the words they conveyed.” Asked why the administration did not seek to establish lower- level talks as a prerequisite to a presidential summit, the official said lower-level engagement has taken place for 27 years, and “that history speaks for itself.” “President Trump has a reputation for making deals,” the official added. “Kim Jong Un is the one person able to make decisions in their uniquely totalitarian system, and so it made sense to accept the invitation with the one person who can make decisions instead of repeating the long slog of the past.” [Trump administration unveils sanctions aimed at starving North Korea of resources ] Some analysts agreed with the Trump administration that Kim is suddenly interested in talks because the sanctions are beginning to hurt and because he is genuinely afraid of U.S. military strikes. Trump and his top aides have said that time is running out to blunt the North’s nuclear program, and the White House has privately explored options that include limited strikes on North Korean targets, according to foreign policy analysts who have spoken with administration officials. “The worst possible thing you can do is meet with President Trump in person and try to play him,” Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), who credited Trump with bringing Kim to the negotiating table, warned in a message to the North posted on Twitter. “If you do that, it will be the end of you — and your regime.” But others say Kim is feeling more confident than ever. In November, he declared that he had “completed” his missile program and is now ready to deal with the United States — on an equal footing, nuclear state to nuclear state. The invitation was the result of Kim’s “broad minded and resolute decision” to contribute to the peace and security of the Korean Peninsula, said North Korea’s ambassador to the United Nations in New York, who is responsible for handling communications with the United States. By the “great courageous decision of our Supreme Leader, we can take the new aspect to secure the peace and stability in the Korean Peninsula and the East Asia region,” Pak Song Il wrote in an email to The Washington Post. The decision to hold the meeting was consistent with North Korea’s principle that the issues should be solved through negotiation, Pak said. “The United States should know and understand our position and should further contribute to the peace and security-building in the Korean Peninsula with [a] sincere position and serious attitude,” he wrote. [Kim Jong Un: Is North Korea’s leader desperate or confident? ] A meeting would be a huge step between the two countries, avowed enemies for 70 years, and particularly between two leaders. Ahead of the announcement, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson urged caution about any forthcoming talks, despite what he described as “potentially positive signals coming from North Korea.” “In terms of direct talks with the United States, and you asked negotiations, we’re a long way from negotiations; we just need to be very clear-eyed and realistic about it,” Tillerson said while on a diplomatic visit to Ethiopia. Officials said Tillerson spoke with Trump about the development before the announcement. Trump has also repeatedly said he would be willing to talk to Kim. While running for president in 2016, Trump said he wouldn’t host Kim for a state visit but would be happy to sit down for hamburgers at a boardroom table with the North Korean leader. The North Koreans have been confused by Trump’s un­or­tho­dox leadership style, making contact with analysts in Washington with Republican ties. Senior North Korean officials have even read “Fire and Fury,” the explosive book by Michael Wolff about Trump’s White House. Since he took over the leadership of North Korea from his father at the end of 2011, Kim has not met any other head of state. Discussions are now underway to hold a summit with South Korean President Moon in the demilitarized zone between the two Koreas at the end of next month. Kim sent his sister, Kim Yo Jong, to South Korea at the opening of the Winter Olympics last month to deliver an invitation to Moon for a summit. Preparations are underway for that meeting, set for the end of April, even as the United States and South Korea prepare to begin drills that anger North Korea every year. There has been no word on the three American men who have been detained in North Korea, one for 2½ years. North Korea has been treating them as prisoners of war and has denied Swedish diplomats, representing the United States in North Korea, consular access to them since June last year. Fifield reported from Tokyo. Anne Gearan and Ashley Parker in Washington contributed to this report.

Lindsey asked Laura if the new living room furniture had been expensive to purchase but","response":"Laura simply smiled and shrugged her shoulders, leaving Lindsey to wonder just how much of a dent the elegant sofa, love seat, and matching chairs had made in her friend's wallet. Laura, being a bit older and more established in her career, had a knack for navigating financial matters, and although she didn't mind discussing money, she realized that it was often a sensitive topic for others. The furniture, Laura recalled, had been meticulously chosen and selected, with months spent browsing websites, visiting furniture showrooms, and thumbing through catalogs to find the perfect pieces. She had had her eye on a specific contemporary set, with sleek lines and a rich dark grey fabric. The pieces were accented with bold, colorful pillows, adding a pop of life and fun to the already inviting room. Despite the considerable price tag, Laura knew that the chance to create a comfortable, stylish living space for her and her friends to enjoy was worth the investment. \\"It all depends on how you define 'expensive,' Lindsey,\\" Laura finally replied, taking a sip from her glass of wine. \\"I did have to do my research and save up for them. But at the end of the day, it's all about finding the right pieces that suit your style and budget. And, as you know, I love quality and am willing to prioritize a bit of splurging on items that will last for years.\\" Lindsey nodded, her curiosity sated by Laura's response, and thought back to her own experience in decorating her first apartment. It hadn't looked nearly as inviting and put-together as Laura's living room, but then again, she had been fresh out of college and working with a shoestring budget at the time. Lindsey had relied on thrift store finds and hand-me-downs from her parents, making the best of what she had while setting aside a small amount of her monthly income as savings. Over time, she had managed to slowly upgrade her home and furnishings, but she had never attempted a complete overhaul like Laura had just done. As the friends continued to chat and reminisce about their home design journeys, the conversation turned to the importance of creating a space that truly reflected their individual personalities and provided a welcoming environment for everyone who entered. They agreed that, in the grand scheme of things, the price of the furniture mattered far less than the joy and satisfaction it brought to those using and viewing it. \\"I have to say, Laura, you've done a fantastic job here,\\" Lindsey remarked while scanning the room, taking in the carefully curated gallery wall and cozy accent rugs. \\"I do agree that spending on quality items is worthwhile, and I think your new furniture is a testament to that.\\" Laura smiled and raised her wine glass in a toast. \\"Cheers to creating spaces that bring us happiness and serve as a true reflection of ourselves,\\" she declared. Lindsey joined her, clinking glasses, and the conversation carried on throughout the evening, fueled by laughter and the occasional debate over the best statement piece for a living room. In the end, the friends came to appreciate and respect each other's unique design preferences, and the time they spent admiring Laura's new living room only served to strengthen their bond."},{"question":"Stream of consciousness rationale: One needs to learn to row boat.

Can you fix that?","response":"There had been a previous international confrontation of the United States over Texas. The confrontation in question has its roots in the early 19th century when Texas, then a part of Mexico, attracted a significant number of American settlers. Mexican laws were relaxed to encourage migration, but by 1830, there were more Anglos than native Mexicans living in Texas. This demographic shift led to rising tensions between the newcomers and the Mexican government, which imposed tariffs and restrictions on these settlers. In 1835, these disputes escalated into a full-scale revolution known as the Texas Revolution. Texas settlers, aided by volunteers from the United States, fought for independence and defeated Mexican General Santa Anna at the Battle of San Jacinto in April 1836. This victory resulted in the formation of the Republic of Texas, which gained independence but was not yet recognized internationally. The annexation of Texas became a contentious issue in the United States. Slave states in the South were in favor of incorporating Texas into the Union, as it could potentially become several slave-holding states, while abolitionist Northern states opposed this move to preserve the balance between free and slave states. This delicate situation delayed the annexation of Texas, as U.S. politicians sought to avoid sparking a national crisis and potentially creating an international incident. However, in 1844, James K. Polk, a staunch expansionist, was elected as President of the United States. This allowed the Texas annexation process to move forward, and in December 1845, Texas officially joined the Union as the 28th state. This event triggered a diplomatic crisis between the United States and Mexico, which still claimed sovereignty over Texas. Disputes over the Texas-Mexico border led to a series of skirmishes and eventually culminated in the Mexican-American War (1846-1848). During this conflict, the United States ultimately emerged victorious, securing a vast amount of land from Mexico through the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. The acquired land included present-day Texas, as well as California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, Wyoming, and Kansas. The acquisition of these territories further reinforced the United States' influence and marked a significant expansion of its territory. In conclusion, the previous international confrontation of the United States over Texas had its roots in the demographic and political changes following American migration to the region. The annexation of the Republic of Texas into the United States, fueled by expansionist sentiments, created diplomatic tensions with Mexico and paved the way for the Mexican-American War. This conflict solidified America's hold on Texas and intensified the contentious debate over the expansion of slavery, which was an issue that eventually contributed to the U.S. Civil War."},{"question":"Data: Bacon Explosion, country, United States; United States, leader, Paul Ryan; United States, ethnicGroup, Native Americans in the United States; United States, capital, Washington, D.C.

For example, a songwriter who excels at writing lyrics might be paired with a songwriter with a gift for creating original melodies. Pop songs may be written by group members from the band or by staff writers songwriters directly employed by music publishers. Some songwriters serve as their own music publishers, while others have outside publishers. - Simon Fuller (born 17 May 1960) is an English entrepreneur, artist manager and television producer.

This is classically recognized as a \\"thumbs down\\" gesture, symbolizing disapproval or disagreement. In terms of naive physics reasoning, when we fold all our fingers and leave the thumb sticking out downwards, we naturally create the thumbs down symbol. Option 2: Make your hand a fist, and only leave your thumb straight up. This option describes the hand gesture for a \\"thumbs up\\" which, traditionally, symbolizes approval or agreement. This is not consistent with the task, which is to demonstrate a \\"thumbs down\\" gesture.

These factors include but are not limited to: the context of the review, the specificity provided, the objectivity, and the offered solution. With these elements in mind, it is possible to give the review a rating. 1. Context: The context of the review is important when determining its value. This particular review seems to address an issue with a weather application or website where the weather information is not being updated for an unidentified reason. The user may be facing a problem that could affect other users, which highlights the relevance of the review. However, without knowing which specific service or application the review is referring to, it becomes less insightful. 2. Specificity: A useful review should provide enough details to help other users and developers better understand the problem faced by the reviewer. In this case, the reviewer does not provide any additional context or details about the issue that they've encountered. It is unclear if this issue is specific to the reviewer's location, device, or connection - information that would be valuable for other users and potentially for the developers to improve the service. 3. Objectivity: An effective review should be objective and unbiased, presenting facts and findings without imposing personal opinions or preferences. This review offers a direct statement regarding the problem, without any personal bias or emotional responses. However, the lack of objective details leaves room for improvement in terms of evaluating its objectivity. 4. Offered solution: A good review not only brings up an issue but also might propose ways to solve it or at least show the attempts the reviewer made to resolve the problem. In this case, the reviewer neither mentions the steps they have taken to resolve this issue nor offers any advice for other users who may face similar issues. This lack of solution significantly diminishes the overall value of the review. Taking these factors into account, I would rate this review a 2 out of 5. Though the review raises a relevant issue regarding a weather service or application, it falls short in terms of specificity, context, and offered solutions. A higher score could be achieved if the reviewer were to provide more detail and context about the issue, which would better serve the needs and interests of both users and developers."},{"question":"You are given a sentence in Italian.

After traveling and living in numerous locations while growing up in his military family, Denver began his music career with folk music groups during the late 1960s. Starting in the 1970s, he was one of the most popular acoustic artists of the decade and one of its best-selling artists. By 1974, he was firmly established as one of America's best-selling performers, and AllMusic has described Denver as \\"among the most beloved entertainers of his era\\". Denver's first marriage was to Anne Martell of St. Peter, Minnesota. She was the subject of his hit \\"Annie's Song,\\" which he composed in only ten minutes as he sat on a Colorado ski lift after the couple had an argument. They lived in Edina, Minnesota, from 1968 to 1971. Following the success of \\"Rocky Mountain High,\\" inspired by a camping trip with Anne and some friends, Denver purchased a residence in Aspen, Colorado. He lived in Aspen continuously until his death. The Denvers adopted a boy, Zachary John, and girl, Anna Kate, who Denver would say were \\"meant to be\\" theirs. Denver once said, \\"I'll tell you the best thing about me. I'm some guy's dad; I'm some little gal's dad. When I die, Zachary John and Anna Kate's father, boy, that's enough for me to be remembered by. That's more than enough.\\" Zachary, who is African-American, was the subject of \\"A Baby Just Like You,\\" a song that included the line \\"Merry Christmas, little Zachary\\" and which he wrote for Frank Sinatra. Denver and Martell divorced in 1982. In a 1983 interview shown in the documentary John Denver: Country Boy (2013), Denver said that career demands drove them apart; Anne said that they were too young and immature to deal with John's sudden mega-success. The ensuing property settlement caused Denver to become so enraged, he nearly choked Martell, then used a chainsaw to cut their marital bed in half. Denver married Australian actress Cassandra Delaney in 1988, after a two-year courtship. Settling at Denver's home in Aspen, the couple had a daughter, Jesse Belle. Denver and Delaney separated in 1991 and divorced in 1993. Of his second marriage, Denver would later recall that \\"before our short-lived marriage ended in divorce, she managed to make a fool of me from one end of the valley to the other\\". In 1993, Denver pleaded guilty to a drunken driving charge, and was placed on probation. In August 1994, while still on probation, he was again charged with misdemeanor driving under the influence after crashing his Porsche into a tree in Aspen. Though a jury trial in July 1997 resulted in a hung jury on the second DUI charge, prosecutors later decided to reopen the case, which was closed only after Denver's accidental death in October 1997. In 1996, the FAA decided that Denver could no longer fly a plane, due to medical disqualification for failure to abstain from alcohol, a condition that the FAA had imposed in October 1995 after his prior drunk-driving conviction. Denver's talent extended beyond music. Artistic interests included painting, but because of his limiting schedule he pursued photography, saying once \\"photography is a way to communicate a feeling\\". Denver was also an avid skier and golfer, but his principal interest was in flying. His love of flying was second only to his love of music. In 1974, he bought a Learjet to fly himself to concerts. He was a collector of vintage biplanes, and owned a Christen Eagle aerobatic plane, two Cessna 210 airplanes, and in 1997, an experimental, amateur-built Rutan Long-EZ.

Hypothesis: Then prove it to me. Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","response":"To determine whether the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, we must first understand the structure and meaning of both statements. Entailment in this context refers to a logical relationship between two propositions, where the truth of one proposition (the premise) guarantees or implies the truth of the other proposition (the hypothesis). Premise: \\"Then show it to me.\\" This statement requests or demands that someone demonstrate or provide evidence for something (particularly an assertion or claim). The underlying assumption is that the person making the request will consider the evidence presented and form an opinion as to whether the assertion or claim is valid or true. Hypothesis: \\"Then prove it to me.\\" This statement also requests or demands that someone provide evidence to substantiate an assertion or claim, but with a stronger emphasis on the need for absolute certainty or formal demonstration of the truth. In this case, the person making the request is explicitly seeking proof that the assertion or claim is valid and true. Now, let's evaluate whether the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. Both statements involve a request for evidence to support an assertion or claim. However, the level of certainty required by the evidence differs between the two statements. \\"Show it to me\\" implies that the person is open to considering the evidence and deciding based on its overall credibility or persuasiveness, whereas \\"prove it to me\\" requires a more stringent demonstration, usually involving a logical explanation or formal proof. While there is a clear connection between the two statements in terms of the underlying purpose (seeking evidence to support a claim), the hypothesis does not necessarily follow from the premise. The premise of \\"Then show it to me\\" does not guarantee that the evidence provided will be considered a definitive \\"proof\\" of the claim, as required by the hypothesis \\"Then prove it to me.\\" The hypothesis requires a higher standard of certainty or proof, which is not necessarily implied by simply \\"showing\\" someone the evidence. In conclusion, while the hypothesis and premise are related, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. The premise merely demands the presentation of evidence, but the hypothesis demands a more stringent and conclusive demonstration of the truth."},{"question":"Briefly summarize this sentence: nissan motor co. rolled into the full-size truck market with its offering called the titan , a hulking truck that the company 's chief executive said will play an important role in the automaker 's ongoing turnaround .","response":"A big car company called Nissan made a giant truck named Titan.

Meanwhile, city B hasn't had a single rainy day in the same time span. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which city would have had less rock and soil material carried away by the rain? A:","response":"City B would have had less rock and soil material carried away by the rain compared to City A. The reasoning behind this conclusion can be explained by understanding the effects of rainfall on geological processes and the role it plays in erosion, transportation, and sediment deposition. Heavy rainfall, as experienced in City A, has a significant impact on the rate of erosion and the transportation of rock and soil materials. When large amounts of rainwater infiltrate the ground and flow over the surface, it can cause the rocks and soil to become loosened and more susceptible to erosion. This is especially true if the area has steep slopes, sparse vegetation, or easily erodible soil and rock types. The increased water flow, combined with the loosened materials, results in a more rapid rate of erosion and transportation of rock and soil. In contrast, in City B, where there has been no significant rainfall in the same time period, the rate of erosion and transportation of rock and soil materials would be much lower. Without the presence of significant rainwater to dislodge and transport materials, the natural processes of erosion and transportation would occur at a much slower pace. In these conditions, wind might be the primary agent of erosion, but this typically occurs at a slower pace than water-induced erosion. Furthermore, areas with little to no rainfall often have different vegetation cover and soil types, which can also influence how rock and soil materials are eroded. This includes vegetation that is better adapted to the arid climate, which could help to hold the soil together, thus reducing the rate of erosion. In summary, due to the significant difference in rainfall between City A and City B, there would be less rock and soil material carried away by rain in City B compared to City A. The heavy rainfall in City A creates an environment with increased rates of erosion and transportation of rock and soil materials, while the lack of rainfall in City B slows down these geological processes and preserves more of the area's natural materials."},{"question":"This is some data: East Godavari AREA_KM2 10807; East Godavari OFFICIAL_WEBSITE http://eastgodavari.nic.in/; East Godavari DENSITY_(/KM²) 477; East Godavari 2011_POPULATION 5151549; East Godavari CODE EG; East Godavari HEADQUARTERS Kakinada.

Please remove spaces between words.","response":"WordPress themes are often designed with a sense of responsiveness to ensure that your website looks great and functions seamlessly on all devices. However, it may sometimes seem that a few of these themes are \\"rowing\\" or lagging a little because of their feature-rich, graphics-heavy designs which can lead to longer loading times and a less than optimal user experience. You mentioned \\"Spritz\\" - this is a fantastic example of a WordPress theme created with site performance in mind. Branded as a clean and minimalist theme, Spritz offers faster loading times due to its lightweight design and optimized coding. It offers responsiveness, scalability, and adaptability to help create a seamless website browsing experience. Spritz eliminates unnecessary bloatware and focuses on critical website aspects, making it a choice theme for those prioritizing efficiency and velocity. It is also updated regularly, keeping in line with the latest coding standards and trends, therefore ensuring that your website runs smoothly with contemporary browsing standards. Do note that despite being a performance-oriented theme, Spritz still offers various customization options to help you shape your website according to your specific preferences and requirements. The theme includes a variety of page templates and layouts, customizable headers and footers, and a host of typography and color options. These help ensure that while your site is running quickly and smoothly, it also looks visually pleasing and aligns with your brand image.

From SEO plugins to social sharing, from e-commerce solutions to contact forms - the theme can accommodate diverse plugin integrations. This facilitates optimal website operations without risking site performance, offering you the best of both worlds.

Regular maintenance, updates, and optimization practices such as caching, using a content delivery network (CDN), and optimizing images can further boost the performance of your WordPress site running on the Spritz or any other theme. Regarding your last instruction about removing spaces between words, I believe it's important to clarify that removing the spaces between words would make your content difficult to read and comprehend. It's typically essential to maintain spaces in written content to uphold readability and comprehension. But if you meant reducing the spaces between elements or sections in a theme, this task can be often handled within theme customizer settings or via additional CSS coding in many WordPress themes including Spritz. All in all, Spritz is indeed a strong contender among performance-oriented WordPress themes, with numerous customization options, regular updates, and a lightweight design. Always remember, the choice of theme for your website should be guided by both your performance targets as well as the aesthetic and functional requirements of your website."},{"question":"Continue the following story.

They found it easier to navigate the shifting sands barefooted, the natural movement of their feet giving them better balance and speed. Step 1: Identify where the story is heading This story seems to be about soldiers in some sort of sandy environment where they are not using boots. The narrative has an element of military adventure and possibly survival in tough terrains. Step 2: Maintain the tone and setting of the story Keeping up with the tone of the story previously set, I continue the narrative in a way that follows the soldiers' experiences involving their environment and daily life in it. Step 3: Detailing and moving the plot forward In order to make the story vivid and engaging, additional details about the soldiers' experience, their environment, and their reasoning behind their actions are included. So, let's continue: The hot, dry winds whipped their faces, and they squinted against the stinging sand. The desert sun bleached their fatigues and the usually dazzling white vests to a muted tone. Their uniforms flapped against their wiry bodies, the only sound in the otherwise deadly silent desert. Despite the hardships, they trudged onwards, their skin gradually hardening to the harsh elements. The desert, initially seeming like an adversary, gradually became a strange kin. They adapted to its mood swings - the sweltering days, the freezing nights, the occasional sandstorms, and the deceptive mounds hiding treacherous pits. In an ironic twist, their boots, initially discarded due to the burden, became their saviors in a different way. They used them to carry meager rations of water from the rare oasis they stumbled upon. The boots, once meant for protection, now carried the precious substance of life, responsible for their survival in those unforgiving sands. With gritty determination, the soldiers traversed the endless expanse of the desert, their footprints the only evidence of the arduous journey undertaken. As they moved deeper into the desert, they began to realize that surviving wasn’t just about making it through to the next oasis but developing a deep connection to the hostile ambience, becoming a part of the desert as much it was a part of them.

The reviewer seems enthusiastic about the book and claims it's the best of the series. They also mention that there is important information shared by Dumbledore and that \\"YOU KNOW WHO\\" is involved, which implies that there are some exciting plot developments. However, this review lacks details that would provide a deeper understanding of the book's content, style, or overall quality. Additionally, the excessive use of exclamation marks, informal language, and slang can make the review seem less credible or insightful to some potential buyers. Therefore, while the overall positive sentiment of the review is encouraging, it might not greatly influence the final decision, especially for potential buyers who require more comprehensive information before making a purchase.

Lasting for 13 days before the final battle, Mexican revolutionaries began a siege of what Texas mission on Feb 23, 1836?","response":"The siege in question took place at the Alamo, a Franciscan mission located in present-day San Antonio, Texas. This pivotal event unfolded during the Texas Revolution and has since grown to symbolize resistance and the fight for independence. Established in the early 18th century, the Alamo Mission was initially a facility for Spanish missionaries to convert indigenous peoples to Christianity. By the time Texas settlers sought independence in the 1830s, the Alamo had become a strategic military post. The Mexican army eventually set their sights on the Alamo and its Texian occupants as a means of quelling dissent and controlling the region. On February 23, 1836, Mexican President General Antonio López de Santa Anna led an army of approximately 1,500–6,000 soldiers to besiege the Alamo. The mission was defended by roughly 200 Texian and Tejano soldiers, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel William Barrett Travis and folk hero James Bowie. Many of these defenders were volunteers from various backgrounds, including the famous frontiersman Davy Crockett. For 13 days, the vastly outnumbered defenders managed to hold their ground amidst constant assaults and repeated demands for surrender. Travis, the Alamo's commander, penned a legendary letter in which he vowed to defend the garrison, \\"victory or death,\\" firing up the revolutionaries' resolve. Despite their fierce resistance, Mexican forces ultimately breached the walls of the Alamo in the early morning hours of March 6, 1836. The final battle was swift and brutal. Overwhelmed by enemy forces, nearly all of the Alamo's defenders perished in the fight, and historians estimate that at least 600 Mexican soldiers were killed or wounded. A few survivors, including women, children, and enslaved persons, were spared by the Mexican troops. Although the Texians suffered a devastating loss at the Alamo, the 13-day siege served as a rallying cry for the cause of Texas independence. \\"Remember the Alamo!\\" became the battle cry of the Texian army, and their subsequent victory over the Mexican army at the Battle of San Jacinto on April 21, secured Texas's independence from Mexico, ultimately leading to the establishment of the Republic of Texas. Today, the Alamo stands as a symbol of courage and sacrifice in the face of insurmountable odds, playing a vital role in Texas history and the broader narrative of American statehood."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Title: This is THE one Review: This is THE book to give as a gift for every newborn.

A supercooled liquid behaves as a liquid, but it is below the freezing point of the material, and in some cases will crystallize almost instantly if a crystal is added as a core. The change in heat capacity at a glass transition and a melting transition of comparable materials are typically of the same order of magnitude, indicating that the change in active degrees of freedom is comparable as well. Both in a glass and in a crystal it is mostly only the vibrational degrees of freedom that remain active, whereas rotational and translational motion is arrested.

Simone employed a broad range of musical styles including classical, jazz, blues, folk, R&B, gospel, and pop. Born in North Carolina, the sixth child of a preacher, Waymon aspired to be a concert pianist. Context: In an interview for Jet magazine, Simone stated that her controversial song \\"Mississippi Goddam\\" hurt her career. She claimed that the music industry reprimanded her by boycotting her records. Hurt and disappointed, Simone left the US in September 1970, flying to Barbados and expecting Stroud to communicate with her when she had to perform again. However, Stroud interpreted Simone's sudden disappearance, and the fact that she had left behind her wedding ring, as an indication of a desire for a divorce. As her manager, Stroud was in charge of Simone's income. Simone recorded her last album for RCA, It Is Finished, in 1974, and did not make another record until 1978, when she was persuaded to go into the recording studio by CTI Records owner Creed Taylor. The result was the album Baltimore, which, while not a commercial success, was fairly well received critically and marked a quiet artistic renaissance in Simone's recording output. Her choice of material retained its eclecticism, ranging from spiritual songs to Hall & Oates' \\"Rich Girl.\\" Four years later Simone recorded Fodder on My Wings on a French label. During the 1980s, Simone performed regularly at Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club in London, where she recorded the album Live at Ronnie Scott's in 1984. Although her early on-stage style could be somewhat haughty and aloof, in later years, Simone particularly seemed to enjoy engaging her audiences sometimes by recounting humorous anecdotes related to her career and music and by soliciting requests. In 1987, the original 1958 recording of \\"My Baby Just Cares for Me\\" was used in a commercial for Chanel No. 5 perfume in Britain. This led to a re-release of the recording, which stormed to number 4 on the UK's NME singles chart, giving her a brief surge in popularity in the UK. When Simone returned to the United States, she learned that a warrant had been issued for her arrest for unpaid taxes (as a protest against her country's involvement with the Vietnam War), and returned to Barbados to evade the authorities and prosecution. Simone stayed in Barbados for quite some time and she had a lengthy affair with the Prime Minister, Errol Barrow. A close friend, singer Miriam Makeba, then persuaded her to go to Liberia. Later, she lived in Switzerland and the Netherlands, before settling in France in 1993. During a 1998 performance in Newark, she announced, \\"If you're going to come see me again, you've got to come to France, because I ain't coming back.\\" Simone published her autobiography, I Put a Spell on You, in 1992. She recorded her last album, A Single Woman, in 1993, where she depicted herself as the \\"single woman\\". She continued to tour through the 1990s but rarely traveled without an entourage. During the last decade of her life, Simone had sold more than one million records, making her a global catalog best-seller. Question: What was the name of her last album?

Nigel was more prone to viral infections, so one day he got infected with the HIV virus. Manny had contracted some sort of bacterial infection. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which friend received more interferon? The answer to this question is:","response":"Nigel received more interferon. Interferons are proteins produced by our immune system in response to various pathogens, such as viruses, bacteria, and parasites. They play a crucial role in the body's defense mechanisms. Interferons primarily function by signaling other cells to heighten their defenses against infections and can also inhibit the replication of pathogens within the host cells. As mentioned in the paragraph, Nigel is more prone to viral infections and has contracted the HIV virus. HIV is a severe viral infection that targets the immune system, specifically CD4 cells (T cells), which are essential in aiding the immune system to fight off infections. In response to a viral infection such as HIV, the body will produce higher levels of interferons to protect itself and attempt to control the viral replication. On the other hand, Manny had contracted some sort of bacterial infection. Although interferons can also play a role in the immune response to bacterial infections, their primary focus is on defending against viral infections. In the case of bacterial infections, other components of the immune system, such as neutrophils and macrophages, would be more actively involved in combating the infection. Considering this information, Nigel, who was infected with the HIV virus, likely received more interferon in response to his viral infection than Manny did for his bacterial infection. The production of interferons is a crucial part of the body's attempt to defend itself against viruses and would be produced in higher quantities in Nigel's body to try to help control and mitigate the effects of the HIV infection."},{"question":"If For example, discussions among members gradually led those from the private sector to gain an, can we conclude that \\"There was no private sector that benefited from the talks.\\"?

It is unclear what initial musical education he received; his father, Georg Händel, was not a music lover, and did not at first appreciate or encourage his son's precocious talents. Nevertheless, by the age of ten Handel had become an accomplished organist; his playing in the royal chapel at Weissenfels, where his half-brother Karl was in the service of the Duke of Saxe-Weissenfels, impressed the duke, who persuaded Händel senior that the boy should have a proper musical education. As a result, Handel began formal study under Friedrich Zachow, the organist of the Lutheran church at Halle.Handel's biographer Jonathan Keates writes that: \\"From [Zachow] Handel learned not only a great deal about the line and shape of an aria, about strong, adventurous bass lines and solid choral writing, but also about those delicacies of instrumental colouring which he later perfected in his own style\\". Handel's musical development also benefited from an early and lasting friendship with Georg Philipp Telemann, whom he met in 1700. In February 1702 Handel enrolled at the University of Halle, perhaps intending to study law. In March he took up the post of organist at Halle's Calvinist cathedral (Domkirche), a prestigious appointment for one so young and indicative of his burgeoning musical reputation in the city.At some time, possibly in late 1702 or early 1703, Handel visited Berlin, where his father had held an honorary post as physician to the elector who, in 1701, had become the Prussian king Frederick I. In Berlin Handel first experienced Italian opera, and may have met the Italian composers Giovanni Bononcini and Attilio Ariosti, who were writing operas for Frederick's court. The king heard of Handel's abilities, and wanted him to train as a future court composer, but Handel's horizons had been broadened by his sojourn in Berlin and he was developing his own ideas for his future.

Athens dominates the Attica region and is one of the world's oldest cities, with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years, and its earliest human presence starting somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennia BC. Classical Athens was a powerful city-state that emerged in conjunction with the seagoing development of the port of Piraeus, which had been a distinct city prior to its 5th century BC incorporation with Athens. A centre for the arts, learning and philosophy, home of Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum, it is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy, largely because of its cultural and political impact on the European continent, and in particular the Romans. In modern times, Athens is a large cosmopolitan metropolis and central to economic, financial, industrial, maritime, political and cultural life in Greece. In 2015, Athens was ranked the world's 29th richest city by purchasing power and the 67th most expensive in a UBS study. - Chamber pop (or \\"ork-pop\\") is a subgenre of indie pop or indie rock which grew in the mid 1990s as a reaction against the fuzz distortion and \\"lo-fi aesthetic\\" prominent in alternative music. Inspired partly by the era's lounge music revivalism, chamber pop is typified by the use of strings, horns, and piano, and a dissociation from contemporary genres of the time, like grunge or electronica. The Beach Boys' Brian Wilson heavily influenced much of the genre, as did composer Burt Bacharach. Specific works which helped define chamber pop include the Beach Boys' albums \\"Pet Sounds\\" (1966) and \\"Smile\\" (196667), as well as the majority of Louis Phillipe's productions for él Records (198489). - Twee pop is a subgenre of indie pop that maintained a reasonable amount of success and notoriety distinctive from the overall indie pop current. - Athens (formally known as Athens-Clarke County) is a consolidated citycounty in the U.S. state of Georgia, in the northeastern part of the state, comprising the former city of Athens proper (the county seat) and Clarke County. The University of Georgia, the state's flagship public research university, is located in this college town, and contributed to its initial growth. In 1991, after a vote the preceding year, the original city abandoned its charter to form a unified government with Clarke County, referred to jointly as Athens-Clarke County. As of the 2010 census, the consolidated city-county (including all of Athens-Clarke County except Winterville and a portion of Bogart) had a total population of 115,452; all of Clarke County had a population of 116,714. Athens is the sixth-largest city in Georgia, and the principal city of the Athens-Clarke County, Georgia Metropolitan Statistical Area, which had a population of 192,541 as of the 2010 census. Athens-Clarke County has the smallest geographical area of a county in Georgia. - Albums of recorded music were developed in the early 20th century, first as books of individual 78rpm records, then from 1948 as vinyl LP records played at rpm. Vinyl LPs are still issued, though in the 21st century album sales have mostly focused on compact disc (CD) and MP3 formats. The audio cassette was a format used from the late 1970s through to the 1990s alongside vinyl. - I Am Not A Freemdoom is the second album by Masters of the Hemisphere, released in 2000 on Kindercore Records. It is a concept album containing a comic book, for which the songs provide the soundtrack. - Masters of the Hemisphere is the first full album by the Athens , Georgia based indie pop band of the same name . Though it lacks the elaborateness of their followup , the heavily concept - based I Am Not A Freemdoom , it still maintains the essential element of the band 's indie pop songcraft , drawing comparisons to R.E.M. , among others . - Indie pop is a subgenre and subculture of alternative/indie rock that originated in the United Kingdom in the late 1970s. The style is inspired by punk's DIY ethic and related ideologies, and it generated a thriving fanzine, label, and club and gig circuit. Indie pop differs from indie rock to the extent that it is more melodic, less abrasive, and relatively angst-free. Its substyles include chamber pop and twee pop. - Kindercore Records is an independent record label based in Athens, Georgia, which was founded in 1996 by Ryan Lewis and Daniel Geller to document the emerging music scene in Athens, Georgia. - Indie rock is a genre of alternative rock that originated in the United States and the United Kingdom in the 1980s. Indie rock encapsulates indie pop and lo-fi, among others. Originally used to describe record labels, the term became associated with the music they produced and was initially used interchangeably with alternative rock. As grunge and punk revival bands in the US, and then Britpop bands in the UK, broke into the mainstream in the 1990s, it came to be used to identify those acts that retained an outsider and underground perspective. In the 2000s, as a result of changes in the music industry and the growing importance of the Internet, some indie rock acts began to enjoy commercial success, leading to questions about its meaningfulness as a term. - A concept album is an album unified by a larger purpose or meaning to the album collectively than to its tracks individually. This may be achieved through a single central narrative or theme, or through a sense of artistic cohesiveness. The scope and definition of a \\"concept album\\" varies, and there is no consensus over what exactly the term constitutes. - Masters of the Hemisphere are an American indie pop group, founded by Bren Mead and Sean Rawls. The two moved to Athens, Georgia, to attend college in 1996. There they met Ryan Lewis, co-founder of Kindercore Records, who played drums at the first Masters of the Hemisphere show. Jeff Griggs (also of The Mendoza Line) soon replaced Lewis. In 1997 Kindercore released their debut seven-inch ep, \\"Going on a Trek to Iceland\\". The group then recorded their first full length album, the eponymous \\"Masters of the Hemisphere\\", which was released on Kindercore Records in 1998. The band soon expanded to a four-piece, adding multi-instrumentalist Adrian Finch. Several singles and compilation appearances followed, including a release on the Happy Happy Birthday To Me Records singles club, before the band released their second full length, the concept album \\"I Am Not a Freemdoom\\", also on Kindercore. The record garnered mixed reviews, which in part was likely due to the album's rather complicated concept, regarding an island of reservoir-dwelling creatures being enslaved by an evil dog. The \\"Permanent Stranger\\" EP followed in 2002, on the dcBaltimore2012 label. The band split up after their next album, 2002's well received \\"Protest a Dark Anniversary\\". A recording of their then-final show at Athens, Georgia's 40 Watt Club was later released as \\"The Last Show Ever\\".

His address was the first of two speeches the president is scheduled to make this week to frame his administration's ongoing response to the recession, less than two months ahead of midterm elections in which Democratic majorities in the House and Senate are in jeopardy. \\"Today, I am announcing a new plan for rebuilding and modernizing America's roads, and rails and runways for the long term,\\" said Obama, who spoke on Labor Day in Milwaukee, Wisconsin -- a state with competitive gubernatorial and U.S. Senate races. \\"We used to have the best infrastructure in the world. We can have it again,\\" he said to loud cheers from a crowd of union workers. The proposal envisions -- over a six year period -- rebuilding 150,000 miles of roads, 4,000 miles of rail and 150 miles of airport runways. It also would include modernizing the nation's air traffic control system in an effort to reduce delays and travel time. \\"This will not only create jobs immediately. It's also going to make our economy hum over the long haul,\\" said the president. Obama hopes to work with Congress to enact an up-front investment of 50 billion -- an amount a White House statement said would represent a significant chunk of new spending on infrastructure. The investment would then be paired with what the administration called a framework to improve transportation spending. The long-term plan would include the establishment of an Infrastructure Bank, which would leverage federal dollars and focus on projects that could deliver the the biggest bang for the buck, Obama said. The president stressed the need for Democrats and Republicans to work together on the transportation initiative, which would need to be approved by Congress.

Imagine that roads, train tracks, and airports are like toys that help people move from place to place. But these toys have been used for a very long time and need fixing.

The equation can be simplified by removing \\"- 0\\", as subtracting zero does not change the value of the expression. The simplified equation is: 0 = 5*g - 15 Step 2: Isolate the variable g. To isolate g, we need to get rid of the constant term \\"-15\\" on the right side of the equation. We can do this by adding 15 to both sides of the equation: 0 + 15 = 5*g - 15 + 15 This simplifies to: 15 = 5*g Step 3: Solve for g. Now we have an equation with only one term involving g on the right side. To find the value of g, we need to get rid of the coefficient \\"5\\" in front of g. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 5: 15 / 5 = (5*g) / 5 This simplifies to: 3 = g So, the solution to the equation 0 = 5*g - 0 - 15 is g = 3."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What's the first name of the person whose plan Sebastian decides to get on board with?

Does all of the music bring happiness to you? Do you know some music is noise? What is noise? Noise is a loud or unwanted sound. It is also called noise pollution. Where is noise from? Noise can be caused by many kinds of machines, such as motorcycles, planes, farm tractors and TVs. And, to some people, rock bands are also noise. What happens to people who live near noisy machines or use them over a period of time? Doctors find that noise pollution can influence both our health and behavior. It can cause high stress levels, hearing loss, sleep problems, and other harmful effects. Scientists use a unit of measure called a decibel to measure the loudness of a sound. The sound of a quiet room, for example, measures 35 decibels. Talk measures between 40 to 65 decibels. Sounds from traffic and from some rock bands can measure over 120 decibels. Noise at this high level causes the greatest hearing loss. How do we reduce noise damage? Turn down your music player or wear ear muffs when you are working in a noisy environment.

A: A:","response":"A decline in blood flow to the kidneys stimulates the release of the enzyme renin, which in turn stimulates the reabsorption of sodium and water. In this case, the correct option would be: 2). Kidneys The release of renin is a crucial part of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), which is a hormone system that regulates blood pressure and fluid balance. When blood flow to the kidneys decreases, this system is activated, causing the kidneys to release renin. This enzyme converts angiotensinogen, a protein produced by the liver, into angiotensin I. Angiotensin I is then converted into angiotensin II by the action of an enzyme called angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), which is mainly produced in the lungs. Angiotensin II is a potent vasoconstrictor, meaning it narrows the blood vessels, thereby increasing blood pressure. Furthermore, it also stimulates the production and release of aldosterone, a hormone produced by the adrenal glands. Aldosterone acts on the kidneys, promoting the reabsorption of sodium and water, which leads to an increase in blood volume and blood pressure.

Sunday’s decision to declare a bank holiday was a signal that Greece’s five-year battle to stay in the shared euro currency may swiftly be coming to an end, as leaders elsewhere urged steps to find a way to avoid that. Panicked citizens tried to pull their money from their accounts while they still could. ATMs in Athens were running out of money, and tensions were running high as Greeks stood in line for hours to scrape together cash for basic supplies. Lines mounted at gas stations as worried residents topped off their tanks for what could be a protracted period of time in a cashless nation. [Euro, stocks retreat on prospect of Greek default] “The decision not to prolong financial aid to Greece is offensive, and it’s a disgrace for Europe in general,” Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said in a brief Sunday evening address broadcast across Greek television networks. He said he was seeking an extended and enlarged bailout from European lenders that would carry the country past Tuesday, when it will otherwise face default. There were signs that Greece’s creditors — the International Monetary Fund and euro-zone governments — were leaving the door open to negotiations. But it remained unclear ahead of Tuesday’s IMF repayment deadline how Greece would be able to satisfactorily arrange its finances. Tsipras said that the threat by European Union leaders to hold Greece to the deadline and not extend further assistance amounts to “blackmail.” But he gave no concrete indications that he had made any concessions that would change their minds. Negotiations over Greece’s future have been dragging for months. The disagreements are about the extent of the painful reforms it must make to continue receiving the rescue funds that keep the nation’s finances afloat. But talks came to a halt Saturday after Tsipras announced he would hold a referendum on July 5 to ask Greeks whether they would accede to the austerity demands of the nation’s creditors. Greek leaders have urged their citizens to vote no. The government early Monday published the decision to close banks until after the referendum, as well as to impose 66 daily limits on ATM withdrawals. Greeks can continue to pay bills online, but they cannot move their money abroad. A Greek economic official also said that the Greek stock market would remain closed Monday. Most Asian markets were sharply lower on the news, and the euro plunged more than 1 percent against the dollar. The decision to close the banks could help them preserve their vital remaining reserves of cash. But it also remained possible that whenever they reopen, their deposits would no longer be denominated in euros but rather another currency whose value would quickly be worth far less. In a measure of deepening U.S. concern about the consequences for global stability if Greece is kicked out of the euro zone, President Obama and Treasury Secretary Jack Lew worked the phones over the weekend to urge European leaders to take every possible measure to keep Greece within the currency union. The White House said that Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke and “agreed that it was critically important to make every effort to return to a path that will allow Greece to resume reforms and growth within the euro zone.” Greeks queue up to withdraw money amid worries the country could be forced to implement capital controls. (Reuters) And the Treasury Department said Sunday that Lew had spoken a day earlier to key European officials, urging them to maintain financial stability in the coming days — and to consider “potential debt relief.” The decision to close the banks came after the European Central Bank announced Sunday that it would not enlarge an emergency loan program that has been a vital lifeline in recent weeks to Greece’s overextended financial institutions. Fearful Greeks have been pulling their money out of the banks, worried that they could lose access to it altogether or that it could turn into a less valuable currency in the event Greece is kicked out of the euro zone. Greek bank officials said that about 1.1 billion was withdrawn from banks over the weekend. But the ECB also decided not to eliminate the emergency assistance altogether, a step that would have caused immediate bank failures and quickly cast Greece out of the euro zone. Greek finance officials also pledged Sunday to do all they could to keep their nation on an even keel. “The Bank of Greece, as a member of the eurosystem, will take all measures necessary to ensure financial stability for Greek citizens in these difficult circumstances,” Bank of Greece Gov. Yannis Stournaras said in a statement. The closure sought to avoid dealing a grievous blow to Greek tourism, one of the few remaining supports to the country’s economy, by sparing foreign bank cards the withdrawal limits. Earlier Sunday, nations warned their citizens to bring extra cash to Greece if they planned to travel there. But the consequences of Greece’s troubles extend far beyond the realm of economics. Russia has been seeking to exploit the situation by dangling the prospect of aid to Greece while calling for a conciliatory approach toward its actions in the Ukrainian conflict. Top Greek cabinet officials have expressed sympathy for Russian President Vladimir Putin, and in the European Union’s consensus-driven decision-making system, even a single dissenting nation’s vote is enough to put an end to sanctions against Russia. Tsipras has been seeking a decision to unlock the final 8.1 billion installment of emergency funds to help pay for Greece’s short-term financial needs. Without the money, Greece will default on a Tuesday repayment of a 1.7 billion IMF loan. The international bailout program for Greece will expire Tuesday, removing a significant financial shield. E.U. finance ministers said Saturday that Tsipras’s decision to hold a referendum signaled an effective end to the negotiations, and they met immediately to start discussions about how they would bolster the remainder of the euro system if Greece leaves it. But with less than 48 hours before a default, IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde on Sunday indicated that the organization remained willing to keep talking, keeping open a window of hope that a deal could be reached. Lagarde said in a statement that she had “shared my disappointment and underscored our commitment to continue to engage with the Greek authorities.” No nation has left the 19-member common currency system since it was started in 1999, and any exit would bring unpredictable consequences. But E.U. leaders say they are far better prepared to guard against Greece’s exit than they were in 2011 and 2012, when the possibility first arose. The mechanics of a Greek exit from the euro zone also remained deeply unclear, because there are no procedures for doing so. Austrian Finance Minister Hans Jörg Schelling suggested in an interview with the Austrian daily Die Presse that Greece would have to leave the European Union altogether. ATMs across central Athens were empty Sunday evening, as worried Greeks pulled as much money as they could from their accounts ahead of an unpredictable week. At the few ATMs that were still dispensing cash, long lines quickly formed. “Everybody was taken by surprise, and people started panicking,” said John Tzamaloukas, 35, who waited 90 minutes to reach the front of an ATM line in central Athens, only to have the machine run out shortly before his turn. He said he had a month-old daughter and needed cash to buy the basics. “You need money to buy milk,” he said.

What is the solution?","response":"To solve this equation, we'll follow these steps: Step 1: Combine like terms on both sides of the equation. The equation is: 1931*k - 18 = -1927*k + 3856*k On the right side of the equation, we have two terms with the variable k, so we can combine them: 1931*k - 18 = ( -1927 + 3856 )*k Step 2: Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses. -1927 + 3856 = 1929 Now the equation becomes: 1931*k - 18 = 1929*k Step 3: Move the terms with the variable k to one side of the equation and the constant term to the other side. To do this, we'll subtract 1929*k from both sides of the equation: (1931 - 1929)*k - 18 = 0 2*k - 18 = 0 Next, we'll add 18 to both sides of the equation: 2*k = 18 Step 4: Solve for k by dividing both sides by 2: k = 18 / 2 Step 5: Evaluate the expression. k = 9 So the solution to the equation is k = 9."},{"question":"Write the next sentence in the following story.

Passage:Bergevin was drafted by the NHL's Chicago Blackhawks in the 1983 NHL Entry Draft, third round, 59th overall. After a junior career with the Chicoutimi Saguenéens of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL), he made the Black Hawks in 1984 and played with Chicago for the next five seasons before being traded to the New York Islanders. His career with the Islanders was brief, and he spent much of that time with their American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate Springfield Indians, whom he helped lead to consecutive Calder Cup championships in 1990 and 1991. In the 1991 season he was traded to the Hartford Whalers and became a fan favorite for his skilled checking. The 1991–92 was his best season statistically, scoring 7 goals and 17 assists for 24 points.

Let's denote the cost of the old car as 'x'. Then, the cost of the new car is 2x. From Step 1, we know that the total cost of the new car is 3800.

He reveals to them his secret identity as the keeper of the Supreme Sound. When he beeps for the first time, using his device on his chest, he's actually set off a chain reaction within him that unlocks the Supreme Sound's power. To prevent the Supreme Sound's power from falling into the wrong hands, the Road Runner must keep it hidden and stay on the run. He beeps twice in rapid succession to activate his extraordinary speed and leaves a trail of sound. Milo and Lily learn that their ultimate goal is no longer about finding the sound, but instead helping the Road Runner retrieve a lost component of his beeping device so he can harness the Supreme Sound's full potential and save the world. As the trio races against time to obtain the lost component, they are repeatedly pursued and thwarted by Mr. Sinister and his loyal henchmen. However, with the help of Milo's intelligence, Lily's knowledge of sign language, and Road Runner's speed, they are able to outsmart and outmaneuver their pursuers. In an epic showdown, Milo and Lily join forces with the Road Runner to face off against Mr. Sinister. Racing against the clock, they recover the lost device component and restore the Supreme Sound to its full potential. The Road Runner beeps twice, activating the device and releasing an immense wave of sound that engulfs the world and breaks the silence once and for all. Now living in a world where sound has returned, Milo and Lily bid farewell to their feathery friend, the Road Runner, who sets off down the road to new adventures, with a beep and a burst of speed. The friends are forever grateful to him and find themselves equipped to take on any challenge that comes their way, knowing that the power of teamwork and true friendship makes anything possible."},{"question":"Write highlights for this article: By.

The Brazilian government has spent £4.2 million (7.2 million) on robots to prepare the country ahead of the Pope's visit next year and the Rio Olympics in 2016. The iRobot 510 PackBots, built by Massachusetts-based robotics firm iRobot Defense and Security, have previously served in the war in Iraq and are described as 'multi-mission, battle-tested' robots. They are set to be used during the construction of Olympic stadiums to help clear routes and hunt for explosives. Scroll down for video. The Brazilian government have spent 7.2 million (£4.2 million) on iRobot 501 PackBots to get the country ready for the Pope's visit next year, and for the Rio Olympics in 2016. The robots can clear routes, find hazardous material and carry out other reconnaisance missions across the country. The iRobot 510 travels at up to 5.8 miles per hour and can be fitted with sensors that detect hazardous materials. A thermal camera can also be fitted to the PackBot's chassis. After winning the government contracts, Frank Wilson, senior vice president and general manager of iRobot’s Defense and Security said:. 'iRobot continues its international expansion, and Brazil represents an important market for the company’s unmanned ground vehicles. 'iRobot is excited to be providing the company’s state-of-the-art robotic technologies to Brazil as the country prepares for several high profile international events, including the 2014 FIFA World Cup.' The £4.2 million contract also includes robot spares and associated equipment. The company has delivered more than 5,000 robots to military and civil missions worldwide. Its mobile robots have performed multiple missions for troops and public safety officers. Speed. Up to 5.8 mph (9.3 kph) Height. 7\\" (17.8 cm) with no payload or manipulator.

They can go into areas that are. considered a risk to human life, including areas containing hazardous. materials, as well as bring back data. The robots bought by the Brazilian government are the iRobot 510 PackBot models and they have been hired until December 2013. They are reminiscent of the Omni Consumer Products (OCP) robots from the 1987 film Robocop in the kind of missions they carry out. The PackBots are battery powered and can climb stairs and slopes of up to a 60-degree angle. They can travel up to 5.8 miles per hour, and continue to be fully operation in water up to three-feet deep. PackBots are waterproof and can work in all weather conditions. iRobots including the 310 and the 510 PackBots have been sent to war zones, including Iraq, to help soldiers carry out reconnaissance missions. The robots can go into dangerous situations and collect data for troops. The iRobot can be fitted with GPS mapping technology, which means it can retrace its steps if communications are disrupted. iRobots can be used to clear routes and get rid of debris including gun shells and unexploded bombs. It uses sensors and built-in cameras to find the objects and can be fitted with small arms that can collect the items and move them out of the way. Peter Weller starred in the 1987 film Robocop in which officials in Michigan hire robots to police to the state. Depending on the mission, PackBots can be fitted with various payloads. they can be fitted with sensors and tools including small arms to help carry and move items, explosive detection kits, a thermal camera, and cable cutters. If the PackBot is flipped over, it can also automatically right itself. If communication to the PackBot is cut off, the robot will retrace its steps to find its mission team. The UAP models of the PackBot are semi-autonomous, which means they can travel and make decisions by themselves. It can automatically avoid bumps, debris and other obstacles and it uses GPS mapping to navigate around a mission area. The 510 PackBots can climb up and down stairs and have a built-in inclinometer to help it navigate up slopes. It can travel up to 5.8 miles per hour up a slope of 60 degrees.

They join the countless species that have gone extinct over the course of Earth's history - and extinction means forever. At least it used to. Scientists are now closing in on the ability to bring back extinct species. No, this doesn't mean the plot of Jurassic Park is going to become a reality. Researchers need DNA to bring back a species. DNA is the chemical that carries the structure for a living thing. Dinosaurs have been gone too long for any of their DNA to remain in fossils. But there's a very real chance that we will be able to bring back more recently extinct species. This could even include Ice Age animals like the woolly mammoth. In 2003, a team of Spanish and French scientists re-created the Pyrenean ibex, which had gone extinct three years earlier. The new animal didn't survive long, but scientific advances should improve the success rate. In January, Australian scientists announced that they were on their way to bringing back the gastric brooding frog. That we can bring species back doesn't mean that we should. There may be benefits to reviving a species. But there's no way to know how it will turn out. For example, would a passenger pigeon fit into its old habitat? Or might it crowd out existing species? Environmentalists worry that our ability to bring species back might cut down support for the hard work of traditional conservation. Why worry about preserving a wildlife habitat or fighting poachers if we know we can just make up for our mistakes? But those extinctions are our mistakes to correct, which may give us an obligation to do so. As businessman and environmentalist Stewart Brand recently said, \\"Humans have made a huge hole in nature. We have the ability now to repair some of that damage.\\" We would do well to remember the lesson of Jurassic Park: Proceed with caution. The answer to this question is:","response":"Which of the following statements is true regarding the possibility of bringing back extinct species? A. Scientists have successfully brought back dinosaurs using their DNA found in fossils. B. Bringing back extinct species might negatively impact existing species and their habitats. C. Environmentalists unanimously support the revival of extinct species as it promotes conservation efforts. D. Scientists do not have the chemical structure needed to attempt reviving extinct species.

It means that they're saying his songs were never on the popular song list in the 1980s. But, the text says that the song \\"I'll Be Lovin' You\\" was #16 on the \\"Billboard\\" list. That means it was popular! So, the sentence is not true because Lee Greenwood did have a song on the list in the 80s."},{"question":"Given the following question, let's solve step-by-step.

The statement mentions the villager as holding a blacksmith hammer and a wooden shield, which are different weapons and forms of equipment compared to a sword and a dagger. It is important to evaluate such statements based on the available evidence and facts in order to make accurate and logical conclusions. To further analyze the situation, let us first understand the key elements present: 1. Blacksmith hammer: A blacksmith hammer is a specific tool used primarily for forging and shaping metal, particularly in the process of blacksmithing. While it can be used as a weapon in certain circumstances, it is functionally different from a sword or a dagger. 2. Wooden shield: A wooden shield is a form of protective equipment commonly used in different cultures throughout history to block or deflect incoming attacks. This defensive item is employed by either warriors or villagers for personal safety but it does not possess offensive capability like a sword or a dagger. Neither the blacksmith hammer nor the wooden shield are direct substitutes or functionally equivalent to a sword or a dagger. A sword is a long-edged weapon primarily designed for cutting or thrusting, emphasizing on offensive and straightforward combat. A dagger, likewise, is a shorter, pointed weapon often used for slashing, stabbing, or close-quarters self-defense. These two items have distinctive purposes and properties compared to those mentioned earlier. It is crucial to distinguish between these different pieces of equipment and their potential applications. Drawing a conclusion that the villager held a sword and a dagger when the actual situation involves a blacksmith hammer and a wooden shield does not reflect the facts. Without additional information connecting or implying the use of a sword and a dagger, we cannot assume the villager held them. In conclusion, based on the given statement that the villager held a blacksmith hammer and a wooden shield, we cannot accurately claim that the villager also held a sword and a dagger. Making such a conclusion would be a leap of logic and an unwarranted assumption without any supporting evidence in the presented scenario."},{"question":"I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

They divided the universe into 3600 sectors, with one Green Lantern per sector. One such Green Lantern, Abin Sur of Sector 2814, defeated the malevolent being Parallax and imprisoned him in the Lost Sector on the desolate planet Ryut. In the present day, Parallax escapes from his prison after becoming strengthened by an encounter with crash survivors on the planet, feeding off of their fear to gain strength before pursuing and nearly killing Abin Sur, who escapes and crash-lands on Earth where he commands his power ring to find a worthy successor. Hal Jordan, a cocky test pilot working at Ferris Aircraft, is chosen by the ring and transported to the crash site, where the dying Abin Sur appoints him a Green Lantern, telling him to take the lantern and speak the oath. At home he says the oath and is later whisked away to the Green Lantern Corps home planet of Oa, where he meets and trains with veteran Corps members Tomar-Re and Kilowog and Corps leader Sinestro, who believes he is unfit and fearful.

According to the New York Times, the mother had lived in Brazil last year, a hotspot for the mosquito-borne illness, and was likely infected early in her pregnancy before moving to Hawaii.

Elizabeth walked across the street. At the gallery, she stopped. Her feet refused to move forward. Anita said, \\"good luck, honey,\\" and shoved her into the bustling crowd. Step 1: Understand the text and context. In this passage, a character (possibly the protagonist) is described wearing a beautiful cloisonne necklace and having her hair in thick braids. She's urging someone to hurry, and then she disappears inside a building. Then, Elizabeth, another character, walks to a gallery but hesitates to enter. Anita provides support and pushes her into the crowd inside. Step 2: Add a fitting continuation. It's important that the narrative continues to reflect the atmosphere, tone, and flow present in the original passage. The protagonist might be nervous about attending a gallery event, so we'll include an element of uncertainty and continuing interaction with Anita. As Elizabeth stumbled into the swarm of art enthusiasts, her heart raced with anticipation and anxiety. Anita, ever supportive, guided her past the first few exhibits, encouraging her to take in the array of vibrant colors and intricate designs.

Maria got an A in English class, while Angela got an F because OPT: (A). Maria never studied.; (B). Angela never studied.;","response":"Maria got an A in English class, while Angela got an F because Angela never studied. Their paths, although seemingly intertwined by fate, took distinctly different turns as their academic journeys unfolded. It all began when Maria and Angela walked into Mr. Thompson's English class at the start of the semester. Maria was all smiles, equipped with a notepad, pen, and tremendous enthusiasm in her heart. Her innate love for literature, coupled with her insatiable desire to learn, fueled her passion for English class. She knew the value of hard work and understood that success in school would translate into opportunities for her future. Angela, on the other hand, came into class looking disheveled and disinterested. Her gaze would often drift towards the window, where she would be easily lost in her daydreams. She carried no notepad, no pen, and her lack of enthusiasm was palpable. She didn't see the point in attending English class, as her aspirations led her to believe that academic performance held no bearing on her future success. As the semester progressed, Maria diligently worked on her assignments, participated in class, and remained engaged with the material. Her efforts culminated in an A for the class, a testament to her dedication to expanding her knowledge and enriching her life. Maria knew she achieved that grade through perseverance and unwavering commitment, and she felt proud of herself for her accomplishments in Mr. Thompson's class. Despite her considerable potential, Angela failed to utilize her time effectively. She would often hand in assignments late or not at all and underestimated the importance of studying for exams. Although Angela possessed unique insights into literature and human nature, her inability to keep up with coursework and engage with her classmates created a barrier between her and academic success. It was her lack of studying and sheer disinterest in putting in the required effort that led to the dismal F on her report card. In the end, the consequences of Maria and Angela's contrasting study habits became evident as their respective grades materialized. While Maria enjoyed the fruits of her labor, Angela's stagnation in English class became a significant obstacle in her academic progress. This tale of two students serves as a sobering reminder of the power of diligence and the sway that studying holds over one's future. Efforts invested during the academic years often help to shape the trajectory of one's life, and Maria and Angela became prime examples of this reality."},{"question":"Question: Do you get angry when your friends sing loudly while you are trying to work, or when your best friend does not wait for you after school?

The fire is quickly returned by pro-Democratic groups that defend the former secretary of state, who's seriously considering a 2016 White House run. And the frequency of the skirmishes are increasing with \\"Hard Choices,\\" Clinton's much anticipated memoir of her years as America's top diplomat, hitting bookshelves next week. Hillary Clinton to take part in live CNN town hall The Republican National Committee and the pro-GOP opposition research shop America Rising have been at the forefront of the Clinton anti-Clinton assault, which mainly focuses on the September 11, 2012, attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi that killed the U.S. ambassador to Libya and three other Americans. \\"Find out the TRUTH about @HillaryClinton,\\" tweeted America Rising, which in a pre-buttal is going up with an e-book titled \\"Failed Choices\\" that's a critique of Clinton's tenure at the State Department. What's behind stepped up GOP attacks on Clinton Correct the Record responded with a post headlined \\"Shame On America Rising for Willfully Misleading Americans On Secretary Clinton's Record.\\" Correct the Record was launched last year by American Bridge, the leading Democratic opposition research outfit. Correct the Record was created to defend the records of potential Democratic presidential candidates. In reality, that means protecting Clinton, who has said she'll decide by the end of this year on a presidential bid, and would instantly become the overwhelming frontrunner for the Democratic nomination if she runs. The group is run by some former top Clinton advisers, but says it doesn't coordinate in any way with the former secretary of state or her top aides. Correct the Record officials say they're not doing anything special for the release of the book and the ensuing coast to coast book tour by Clinton. \\"We're operating business as usual. We are continuing to do what we do every day, defending Secretary Clinton's strong record of accomplishments from baseless, right-wing attacks,\\" Adrienne Elrod, the group's chief spokeswoman, told CNN. Last weekend the group held media training sessions for surrogates going on television to discuss the book and Clinton's record. \\"It wasn't only for the book. The purpose of the media training was to make sure that our surrogates, people who are on TV, active on TV, are able to articulate her positions effectively. Especially her accomplishments as Secretary of State,\\" a Correct the Record official told CNN. The Democratic National Committee's also playing a role when it comes to defending Clinton. The DNC has a mandate to protect the Democratic brand, and Clinton was, and continues to be a major player in that brand. The DNC, of course, also plays a major role in defending President Barack Obama and his administration. And GOP attacks on Clinton that target her record at State are also attacks on the President. \\"With the recent Republican attacks on Hillary Clinton, you've seen them really focus on foreign policy, attacking the President's foreign policy,\\" said a Democratic Party official. \\"Hillary's book is about her work with the President during his first term. It's about the Obama administration's foreign policy accomplishments and what we've seen is Republicans trying to distort every aspect of the President's foreign policy accomplishments.\\" It was no surprise then that Clinton aides deferred to the DNC when it came to responding to the America Rising e-book. In another sign of stepped up cooperation, Democratic surrogates and communicators who publicly support both Obama and Clinton met at the White House recently with Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri and Deputy National Security Adviser for Strategic Communications Ben Rhodes to talk about a number of issues, including Benghazi and Clinton's upcoming book, according to a source familiar with the meeting. While the topic was not on the official meeting agenda, one surrogate asked about it and the President's aides made clear they want no daylight between Obama and Clinton on foreign policy issues as the book rolls out, the source added. The messaging, according to the source, is this: Obama's team of rivals became an unrivaled team. And Tommy Vietor, a communications veteran of the 2008 Obama campaign who served as National Security Council spokesman during the President's first term, has been brought on by the Clinton team to coordinate and assist in the response to the book. In addition to working with the White House, the Clinton camp has stepped up their messaging around the book's release to include a coordinated surrogate operation. Clinton's team, according to sources familiar with the book rollout, tapped Kiki McLean, a former Clinton senior adviser and veteran of five presidential campaigns, to lend a hand with the surrogate operation. This group includes a war room of former diplomats who stand ready to respond to criticism of Clinton's tenure at the State Department, according to the source. From book tour to bus tour Also upping their game as the book releases is Ready for Hillary, the pro-Clinton super PAC that concentrates on grassroots outreach. The group, which over past year has organized demonstrations in support of Clinton outside of many of her speaking events, says it will step up its presence on during the book tour. The most visible way is with what they call \\"The Hillary Bus.\\" \\"The Bus will travel from coast to coast, channeling the enthusiasm around a potential Hillary 2016 candidacy to activate supporters in the 2014 midterms, while further building a grassroots army of supporters who are encouraging her to run and ready to help her win,\\" the group said earlier this week. Ready for Hillary says that throughout the summer, their bus will also visit events other than the \\"Hard Choices\\" book tour, such as Democratic party gatherings, state fairs and community festivals. And that come the autumn, the bus will head to college campuses and states with key contests in this November's midterm elections. The group touts that their bus \\"is a mobile advertisement allowing our organization to reach new supporters in every corner of America as Hillary backers who see the Bus are prompted to sign up at readyforhillary.com. The Bus will also allow Ready for Hillary to dispatch volunteers and sign up new supporters at designated stops.\\" What are the most important parts of this news article?","response":"1.

A:","response":"The No. 28 Squadron of the Indian Air Force, also known as \\"The First Supersonics,\\" is a noteworthy unit of the IAF for its historical significance and contributions to the nation's defense. However, it is essential to note that it is not possible to rank the No. 28 Squadron with other air forces globally, as squadrons are subunits within an air force and not a separate entity. Instead, we can discuss the Indian Air Force's global ranking as a whole. Although rankings can differ based on various factors and criteria, the Indian Air Force is considered one of the top air forces in the world. In terms of personnel and aircraft strength, Global Firepower Index (2021) ranks the Indian Air Force as the 4th strongest air force globally. As for the No. 28 Squadron itself, it was initially raised in 1963 with Folland Gnat aircraft, consisting of pilots, technicians, and personnel required to maintain and operate the fighter jets. They participated in the 1965 and 1971 Indo-Pak wars. The squadron was later re-equipped with the MiG-29 multirole fighter aircraft in the 1980s, becoming the first IAF squadron to have supersonic aircraft in its inventory. The No. 28 Squadron played a prominent role in the Kargil War in 1999. The squadron's significance and contributions to the Indian Air Force merit acknowledgement. Still, its ranking must be considered within the context of the overall strength and capabilities of the IAF and not in comparison to other air forces around the world."},{"question":"Generate a sentence about this data: 3 WINNING_COUPLE Kyal and Kara; 3 2ND_COUPLE Chantalle and Steve; 3 CHUMPS Brad and Dale","response":"Step 1: Identify the key components in the data provided. - Winning couple: Kyal and Kara - 2nd couple: Chantalle and Steve - Chumps: Brad and Dale Step 2: Determine the relevant information to include in the sentence. - The fact that Kyal and Kara are the winning couple, Chantalle and Steve are the 2nd couple, and Brad and Dale are the chumps.

If one is unable to focus or react appropriately to road conditions or traffic signals, it can put both the driver and other road users in danger. This can lead to numerous negative outcomes such as accidents, injuries, or fatalities. Laws are also established to discourage drunk driving due to its inherent risks. In most jurisdictions, driving while intoxicated is considered a criminal offense, which can result in penalties such as fines, license suspension, and potentially imprisonment. Considering the risks associated with driving a car while intoxicated and the potential consequences on both a personal and societal level, as well as legal implications, the most reasonable answer to the question is: no, it is not safe to drive a car while intoxicated."},{"question":"Trinity Christian Academy is a private Christian school in Jackson Tennessee consisting of grades Pre-K through 12.

The next morning, Mitch and Dave realize they have switched bodies. Mitch remembers the wish they made the night before and they drive back to the park, planning to urinate again in the fountain and wish for their original lives back, but find the fountain has been removed for restorations. Forced to wait a few days until the parks department can locate the fountain, Mitch and Dave agree to pretend to be each other for the day. When Mitch arrives at Dave's law firm office, he befriends Dave's attractive assistant, Sabrina McKay. However, Mitch's lack of professionalism and legal knowledge cause a big merger to fall through. Meanwhile, Dave arrives at Mitch's film shoot to discover that it is a lorno (light porno). Tired of pretending to be Mitch, Dave has them go back to his house to tell his wife Jamie the truth, but Jamie does not believe him. Dave gives Mitch advice on how to behave professionally and Mitch sets Dave up on a date with Sabrina, who Mitch has had a crush on. After speaking with his father, Mitch rededicates himself to doing everything Dave's life demands, from taking care of the kids and buying groceries to making decisions at the firm.

Here are possible answers to this question: - shed - garage - cutting grass - lawn - neighbor's house I believe the correct choice is \\"neighbor's house\\", here's why: Answer:","response":"The correct choice is indeed \\"neighbor's house,\\" and there are a few reasons why this is the most appropriate answer among the given options: 1. Context: You mentioned hearing the lawnmower from \\"across the street,\\" which indicates that the source of the noise is not within your own property. This logically points toward the lawnmower being at a neighbor's house rather than in your shed or garage. 2. Function: Lawnmowers are specifically designed for cutting grass, and the sound produced by them typically signifies that they are actively in use. While it is technically possible for a lawnmower to be stored in a shed or garage, the fact that you can hear it in operation strongly suggests that it is currently being used to cut grass. In this case, the neighbor's house would be where this activity is taking place. 3. Specificity: Among the given options, \\"cutting grass\\" and \\"lawn\\" both accurately describe the activity the lawnmower is engaged in and the general location of the task. However, these answers are too generic to provide a precise location of where the lawnmower is.

Oreo cookies may be as addictive as hard drugs, at least to lab rats, a research team found. That sugar high you experience after noshing on sweets may be more literal than you think. Oreo cookies are just as addictive as drugs, according to new research. In a study of lab rats, Connecticut College scientists found the classic chocolate and creme cookie activated even more neurons in the brain's \\"pleasure center\\" than drugs like cocaine and morphine. RELATED: FISH OIL FOUND TO SLOW DOWN EFFECTS OF JUNK FOOD ON THE BRAIN The scientists devised a test in which rats encountered Oreos on one side of a maze and rice cakes on the other side, and took note of how long the animals spent on each. They compared the results to a similar maze test in which rats were given an injection of cocaine or morphine on one side and saline on the other. Researchers then measured protein levels in the nucleus accumbens area of the brain, which \\"basically tells us how many cells were turned on in a specific region of the brain in response to the drugs or Oreos,\\" said neuroscience professor Joseph Schroeder. The Oreos activated \\"significantly more\\" neurons than the drugs. RELATED: FORTIFIED JUNK FOOD STILL JUNK The study supports evidence that high-fat and high-sugar foods are addictive, said researcher Jamie Honohan. “Even though we associate significant health hazards in taking drugs like cocaine and morphine, high-fat/high-sugar foods may present even more of a danger because of their accessibility and affordability,” Honohan said in a statement. RELATED: JUNK FOOD MAKES BAD MOODS WORSE FOR BODY-CONSCIOUS PEOPLE: STUDY While the best ways to eat an Oreo are hotly debated among humans - does one nibble the cookies first, lick out the center, or dunk it in milk and bite the whole thing? - the rats showed a clear preference. \\"They would break open the middle and eat it first,\\" Honohan said.","response":"This news article talks about a research study.

Context: I have another guest post for you today. This one comes from Selina from Beautystorm. Beautystorm are proudly the cheapest stockists of Dermalogica products in Australia and provide online skin consultations with their in house Skincare Therapists. Selina will be giving us advice on how to repair sun damaged skin. Whilst we are blessed to be living in such a sun drenched country, here in Australia, as a consequence the majority of us will have sun damaged skin. Here are Selina's tips to repair some of the damage: The severe, Australian suncauses a multitude of cases of serious skin damage every year. However, there are ways, to repair rough, dry, wrinkled skin that may also suffer from redness and brown spots. The very first step to reverse some of that skin damage is some gentle cleansing. Never wash the face with an ordinary bar of soap. This will make the situation worse and cause severe dry skin. In order to wash the sun-damaged skin effectively without causing further injury, use a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser. This will remove, not only dirt and oil, but also the top layer of dead skin cells, providing a nice glow. This will reveal fresh skin cells ready for treatment. After cleansing the skin, follow with a mud mask or a facial mask made specifically for skin that’s been damaged by the sun. The purpose of a mask is to draw out impurities in the skin while adding key ingredients like moisturisers and minerals back into the skin. After gently rinsing the purifying mask, a lotion, cream or serum containing key ingredients should be applied to the skin. The difference between the three is that a lotion is best for daytime use, worn under makeup or for those prone to breakouts. Creams are considered heavier and best used at night or for those with dry skin. Serums are usually highly concentrated formulas that can be used day or night, but a little goes a long way. Those with the most severe sun damaged skin should use them. Question: What does Selina think will help repair redness and brown spots from skin? Options: - using a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser - use just water to cleanse - use abrasive soap - not enough information Answer:","response":"- using a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser"},{"question":"Please answer the following question: I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it.

Although I had to squint my eyes during some of the scary scenes, I loved it – in particular because I was fairly sure that Harrison Ford’s character was based on my dad. My father was a palaeontologist at the University of Chicago, and I’d gone on several field trips with him to the Rocky Mountains, where he seemed to transform into a rock-hammer-wielding superhero. That illusion was shattered some years later when I figured out what he actually did: far from spending his time climbing dangerous cliffs and digging up dinosaurs, Jack Sepkoski spent most of his career in front of a computer, building what would become the first comprehensive database on the fossil record of life. The analysis that he and his colleagues performed revealed new understandings of phenomena such as diversification and extinction, and changed the way that palaeontologists work. But he was about as different from Indiana Jones as you can get. The intertwining tales of my father and his discipline contain lessons for the current era of algorithmic analysis and artificial intelligence (AI), and points to the value-laden way in which we “see” data. My dad was part of a group of innovators in palaeontology who identified as “palaeobiologists” – meaning that they approached their science not as a branch of geology, but rather as the study of the biology and evolution of past life. Since Charles Darwin’s time, palaeontology – especially the study of the marine invertebrates that make up most of the record – involved descriptive tasks such as classifying or correlating fossils with layers of the Earth (known as stratigraphy). Some invertebrate palaeontologists studied evolution, too, but often these studies were regarded by evolutionary biologists and geneticists as little more than “stamp collecting”. Question: Who seemed to transform into a rock-hammer wielding superhero? Options: - Darwin - Harrison Ford - not enough information - The author's father === The correct answer is The answer is:","response":"The author's father. In the given passage, it is mentioned that the author's father was a palaeontologist at the University of Chicago who would transform into a \\"rock-hammer-wielding superhero\\" when they went on field trips to the Rocky Mountains. This description conveys how the author perceived their dad as a heroic figure, possibly similar to Harrison Ford's character in Raiders of the Lost Ark. However, this image was later altered when the author discovered that their father's actual work primarily focused on data and computational analysis in the field of paleontology. The father's role in advancing the study of paleontology through the development of the first comprehensive database on the fossil record of life emphasizes the evolving nature of this scientific discipline. His work, along with that of other paleobiologists, shifted the focus from a primarily geology-based approach to a more comprehensive understanding of the biology and evolution of past life. This transformation had a profound impact on the field, and the author shares this story to illustrate the importance of innovative thinking, interdisciplinary collaboration, and the expanding role of data analysis in scientific research. Moreover, the story offers valuable lessons for the rapidly growing fields of artificial intelligence and algorithmic analysis. It highlights the potential for technological advancements to revolutionize traditional methods and enable researchers to explore new dimensions of their disciplines. The dynamic relationship between the author's father and the field of paleontology serves as an inspiring reminder of the importance of continued innovation, critical thinking, and the pursuit of deeper understanding in any field of study. In conclusion, the author's father, a palaeontologist at the University of Chicago, is the one who seemed to transform into a rock-hammer wielding superhero in the eyes of the young author. This perception was sparked by their field trips to the Rocky Mountains and the father's dedication to advancing the study of paleontology through data analysis and collaboration with fellow researchers. Ultimately, this story showcases the power of innovative thinking, the evolving nature of scientific knowledge, and the transformative role of technology in the pursuit of understanding the world and its history."},{"question":"Write a summary based on this article: Lindsay Lohan and ex-girlfriend Sam Ronson are bringing the drama once again. \\"Fun @coachella but tonight @ my friernds bday party, @samantharonson spit in my face and left w/ @mileycyrus 's ex,\\" Lindsay tweeted early Wednesday morning.

Step 1: Understanding the term First of all, understand the term 'self-righteousness'. It refers to a feeling of moral superiority, the self-perception that one's beliefs, values, or actions are superior to those of others. Step 2: Assessing the Sentiment The sentiment of the word seems to be mostly negative when considered in isolation. This is because it often implies a position of arrogance, judgment, and lack of empathy towards others. Step 3: Context consideration However, keep in mind that sentiment may change based on the context in which the word is used. For instance, if someone says, \\"I appreciate her self-righteousness in standing up for her beliefs,\\" it could be positively interpreted as a person who holds themselves to high moral standards. Without any context, my qualitative assessment of the word 'self-righteousness' leans more towards a negative sentiment due to its typical usage and interpretation."},{"question":"Are these paraphrases?

In the words of the late Vince Lombardi, \\"Winning isn't everything, it's the only thing.\\" This article will attempt to provide a thorough examination of the final score total in various formats and the impact it has on the outcome of the competition. I. The Role of Scoring Systems Scoring systems vary considerably across different disciplines, which in turn affects how the final score total is computed and interpreted. For instance, football and basketball often see high score totals, while games such as soccer or hockey typically have lower scoring margins. Understanding the scoring system of a particular event is crucial to making sense of the final score total. a. Points-Based Scoring Systems Most modern sports rely on a points-based system, with specific actions or goals earning a distinct number of points. The final score total is simply the sum of all these points earned by each competitor or team. Common examples of points-based systems include football, basketball, and tennis. b. Head-to-Head Scoring Systems In sports like boxing or wrestling, there's a focus on directly competing against an opponent rather than achieving a numeric score. In these cases, the final score total can be expressed as a win-loss record, or in the form of judges' decisions after a set number of rounds. c. Time-Based Scoring Systems Racing sports like swimming, track and field, or motorsports base their results on the fastest completion times rather than points. For these disciplines, the final score total is expressed in terms of the duration it took each competitor to finish the race. II. Factors That Influence the Final Score Total Multiple factors can influence a final score total in any competition. Here are some key elements that can have a significant impact: a. Strategy and Tactics A team or competitor's approach to the game can greatly affect the final score. Offensive strategies may lead to high score totals, prioritizing scoring chances over defending. On the flip side, defensive strategies might result in lower scores, focusing on preventing the opposition from scoring. b. Performance and Skills The overall performance of the competitors in any given event is inherently linked to the final score total. The better their skills, decision-making, and execution, the more likely they'll be able to rack up a higher score. c. Weather and Environmental Factors Outdoor sports require competitors to adapt to varying conditions like wind, rain, snow, or harsh temperatures. These circumstances can have a significant impact on the ability to score points or execute strategies, ultimately affecting the final score total. III. The Significance of the Final Score Total a. Determining a Winner The most simple and obvious function of the final score total is to determine a winner or competitor who has outperformed the rest. b. Contextualizing the Competition The final score total, when interpreted alongside the context of the game (e.g., historical rivalries, player backgrounds, level of play), can provide valuable insights into the dynamics and intensity of the event. c. Comparing Performances Over Time By comparing final score totals across a series of competitions or seasons, one can gauge a team or individual's progress, hot streaks, or slumps. Conclusion In essence, the final score total serves as a comprehensive representation of the contest that has unfolded between competitors or teams. It is crucial to understand not only the numbers themselves but also the factors that contribute to these totals to truly appreciate and analyze a competition's outcome. Whether it's the nail-biting, last-second victory or the long-awaited record-breaking performance, the final score total is etched into the history books, providing fans and analysts with a numerical snapshot of that moment in time."},{"question":"I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: How many inches tall is Monument 7? ?

Q: Paragraph: Licenses for hemp cultivation topped a half-million acres (200,000 hectares) last year, more than 450% above 2018 levels, so there’s intense interest in the rules the U.S. government is creating. Critical comments on the draft have poured in from hemp farmers, processors, retailers and state governments. Growers are concerned the government wants to use a heavy hand that could result in many crops failing required tests and being destroyed. The U.S. Department of Agriculture, the agency writing the rules, estimates 20% of hemp lots would fail under the proposed regulations. “Their business is to support farmers — and not punish farmers — and the rules as they’re written right now punish farmers,” said Dove Oldham, who last year grew an acre (0.40 hectares) of hemp on her family farm in Grants Pass. “There’s just a lot of confusion, and people are just looking for leadership.” The USDA did not respond to the criticism but has taken the unusual step of extending the public comment period by a month, until Jan. 29. The agency told The Associated Press it will analyze information from this year’s growing season before releasing its final rules, which would take effect in 2021. Agricultural officials in states that run pilot hemp cultivation programs under an earlier federal provision are weighing in with formal letters to the USDA. “There are 46 states where hemp is legal, and I’m going to say that every single state has raised concerns to us about something within the rule. They might be coming from different perspectives, but every state has raised concerns,” said Aline DeLucia, director of public policy for the National Association of State Departments of Agriculture. Most of the anxiety involves how the federal government plans to test for THC, the high-inducing compound found in marijuana and hemp, both cannabis plants. The federal government and most states consider plants with tiny amounts — 0.3% or less — to be hemp. Anything above that is marijuana and illegal under federal law. Yet another cannabis compound has fueled the explosion in hemp cultivation. Cannabidiol, or CBD, is marketed as a health and wellness aid and infused in everything from food and drinks to lotions, toothpaste and pet treats. Many have credited CBD with helping ease pain, increase sleep and reduce anxiety. But scientists caution not enough is known about its health effects, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration last year targeted nearly two dozen companies for making CBD health claims. Still, the CBD market is increasing at a triple-digit rate and could have 20 billion in sales by 2024, according to a recent study by BDS Analytics, a marketing analysis firm that tracks cannabis industry trends. About 80% of the 18,000 farmers licensed for hemp cultivation are in the CBD market, said Eric Steenstra, president of the advocacy group Vote Hemp. The remaining 20% grow hemp for its fiber, used in everything from fabric to construction materials, or its grain, which is added to health foods. But hemp is a notoriously fickle crop. Conditions such as sunlight, moisture and soil composition determine its ratio of THC to CBD. Choosing the right harvesting window is critical to ensuring it stays within acceptable THC levels. Under the draft USDA rules, farmers have no wiggle room. They must harvest within 15 days of testing their crop for THC, and the samples must be sent to a lab certified by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. Samples must be from the top of the plant, where THC levels are highest, and the final measurement must include not just THC, but also THCA, a nonpsychoactive component. Crops that test above 0.3% for the two combined must be destroyed. Growers with crops above 0.5% would be considered in “negligent violation,” and those with repeated violations could be suspended from farming hemp. In addition, a pilot program for federal crop insurance that would be available to hemp growers in some states specifies that crops lost because of high THC levels won’t be covered. Those provisions are causing alarm among growers and states with pilot hemp programs allowed under the 2014 Farm Bill. Some states allow THC levels above 0.3%, and not all include THCA in that calculation. Many permit more harvesting time for growers after THC testing. Farmers are lobbying for a 1% THC limit and a 30-day harvest window to give them more flexibility while remaining well under THC levels that can get people high. The draft regulations don’t “seem to be informed by the reality of the crop,” said Jesse Richardson, who with his brother sells CBD-infused teas and capsules under the brand The Brothers Apothecary. “If no one can produce (federally) compliant hemp flower, then there will be no CBD oil on the market.” Growers are also worried about the proposed rule requiring that all THC testing be done in a DEA-certified lab because there are so few of them. Some states have only one, which would serve hundreds of growers in a short harvest window. Samantha Ford, a third-generation farmer in North Carolina, waited two weeks to get back THC results from a lab last fall and then spent 45 days harvesting her 1 acre (0.40 hectares) of hemp by hand. “The 15-day window — that’s not feasible, and that was on a small scale,” she said. “I can’t imagine farmers who have acres and acres and acres of it.” Concerns also have emerged about the workload the draft rules would place on states. Many do random sampling for THC levels, but the USDA would require five samples from every hemp lot — a burden for state agricultural departments, said DeLucia, of the national ag agencies group. If federal rules are too onerous and expensive, some states might drop their hemp programs. In those cases, farmers would have to apply for licenses with the USDA, and at this stage it’s unclear how U.S. officials would manage or pay for a nationwide licensing program, DeLucia said. Under the 2018 Farm Bill, the USDA must approve state plans for hemp programs. Louisiana, Ohio and New Jersey last month were the first to get the green light — but those plans might need to be reworked after final rules are written. “What we don’t want to see is states having to write their rules and then have to change the rules again and rewrite them” after 2021, said Steenstra, of Vote Hemp. Claim: High anxiety: Proposed US hemp rules worry industry . A:","response":"The given claim states that the proposed U.S. hemp rules are causing anxiety within the industry. The paragraph supports this claim as it describes the concerns that hemp farmers, processors, retailers, and state governments have raised about the draft rules. These concerns include the stringent THC testing requirements, fear of crop destruction, and the heavy-handed approach of the U.S. government towards hemp cultivation. Moreover, it highlights the fact that there is confusion regarding the rules, and people are looking for guidance. The USDA's extension of the public comment period and plans to analyze information from the current growing season before releasing the final rules indicate that the agency is taking the concerns seriously. The anxiety over draft rules also stems from variations in state regulations and the potential workload that would be placed on states, risking some to drop their hemp programs. In conclusion, the industry's anxiety is based on the potential negative impacts of the proposed rules, lack of guidance, and the disagreement between state and federal regulations."},{"question":"Graysonskému admirálovi v rozevřeném županu prosvítala holá hruď a spánkem napuchlé oči mu svítily.

I was horribly disappointed. The storyline was, basically, the first script with a few extra characters and the situation turned around. Ariel and Eric have a daughter, Melody who isn't satisfied with life on land. She wants to become a mermaid. However, Ariel has kept her past from her daughter because she wants to protect her-and when Melody finds out she's upset and angry. And she then decides to run away, and she becomes a mermaid. So she's happy swimming around, and Ariel sets out to find her-as a mermaid. The story doesn't sound too bad written down, but the clichés and repeats of situations from the first movie are just too obvious. And adding the fact that Melody is, overall, extremely annoying, and the movie becomes almost unbearable. There's also a whole load of other new characters-Tip and Dash being two of them. They aren't too bad as characters in themselves-just try not to think of Timon or Pumbaa! The songs leave a lot to be desired too, they just don't have the same magical energy as the songs from the original did. The animation obviously didn't have a whole load of work put into it either-in parts it's jumpy, and not much imagination is used for the characters movements. Another piece of advice-try to forget about Ariel's original character while watching this movie. The beautiful, rebellious, curious teenager has 'all grown up' into a bland, boring wife and mother, and her trademark red hair is all tied up. This is much better viewed if you've never seen the original-you'll have nothing to compare it to. However, all in all, it could have been worse-it's not as bad as certain other sequels, such as Cinderella II. But it's not in the same league as the original.

Seattle is a charter city, with a mayor–council form of government. From 1911 to 2013, Seattle's nine city councillors were elected at large, rather than by geographic subdivisions. For the 2015 election, this changed to a hybrid system of seven district members and two at-large members as a result of a ballot measure passed on November 5, 2013. The only other elected offices are the city attorney and Municipal Court judges. All city offices are officially non-partisan.Like some other parts of the United States, government and laws are also run by a series of ballot initiatives (allowing citizens to pass or reject laws), referenda (allowing citizens to approve or reject legislation already passed), and propositions (allowing specific government agencies to propose new laws or tax increases directly to the people). Jenny Durkan was elected as mayor in the 2017 mayoral election and took office on November 28, 2017. The mayor's office also includes two deputy mayors, appointed to advise the mayor on policies; As of 2017, the city's deputy mayors are Michael Fong and Shefali Ranganathan.Seattle's political culture is very liberal and progressive for the United States, with over 80% of the population voting for the Democratic Party. All precincts in Seattle voted for Democratic Party candidate Barack Obama in the 2012 presidential election. In partisan elections for the Washington State Legislature and United States Congress, nearly all elections are won by Democrats. Although local elections are nonpartisan, most of the city's elected officials are known to be Democrats. In 1926, Seattle became the first major American city to elect a female mayor, Bertha Knight Landes. It has also elected an openly gay mayor, Ed Murray, and a third-party socialist councillor, Kshama Sawant. For the first time in United States history, an openly gay black woman was elected to public office when Sherry Harris was elected as a Seattle city councillor in 1991.

ADVERTISEMENT Multiple protesters interrupted House floor debate on the tax bill Tuesday, including people who shouted \\"kill the bill, don't kill us!\\" as well as a woman in a wheelchair who said she relies on Medicaid and warned that the bill would \\"starve\\" the public.

This is their money, after all,\\" Ryan said. A woman in the public visitors gallery then shouted, \\"You're lying!\\" Tax reform has long been a top priority for Ryan and other congressional Republicans, who view it as necessary to improve business competitiveness and boost economic growth. Trump also promised large tax cuts on the campaign trail and in his first months in office. Republicans view the tax overhaul as critical to maintaining their congressional majorities in 2018, after they failed this year to fulfill their seven-year pledge to repeal ObamaCare. The first overhaul of the tax code since 1986 sped through Congress at a rapid pace, from House Republicans first unveiling a bill in early November to passing a final bicameral compromise a month later. By contrast, the 1986 tax-reform effort had bipartisan support and didn’t reach then-President Reagan’s desk until nearly a year after it was first introduced in the House. Public polling on the GOP’s tax overhaul indicates support hovering at less than 30 percent, which is even lower than the favorability toward ObamaCare when Democrats passed it in 2010. Republicans have battled the perception their plan primarily benefits corporations and the wealthy, even though many middle-class taxpayers will get at least a modest tax cut. But GOP lawmakers insist people will come to appreciate the changes made by the tax overhaul over time. “When they get another 100 to 150 a month, by February when the new brackets come out, they’re going to say, ‘Honey! [Senate Minority Leader Charles] Schumer [D-N.Y.] was lying to me! [House Minority Leader Nancy] Pelosi [D-Calif.] was lying! [Rep.] Louise Slaughter Dorothy (Louise) Louise SlaughterLawmakers remember Slaughter in Capitol ceremony McGovern tapped to replace Slaughter as top Dem on Rules panel House majority rules spark minority fights MORE [D-N.Y.] was lying! I got more money!’ ” said Rep. Chris Collins Christopher (Chris) Carl CollinsGOP lawmakers back discharge petition to force immigration votes GOP in retreat on ObamaCare Obstacles for Trump in push to expand the death penalty MORE (R-N.Y.). The final tax bill involved lawmakers making some concessions from their original wish lists, but achieves the goals of cutting taxes across the board and making the U.S. corporate tax system more in line with the systems in other countries. The bill lowers the top individual rate from 39.6 percent to 37 percent, slashes the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and creates a 20-percent deduction for income of pass-through businesses that pay taxes through the individual code. It increases the exemption amounts for the individual alternative minimum tax and estate tax, and it moves the U.S. to a territorial tax system that generally exempts U.S. companies’ foreign earnings from U.S. taxes. Additionally, the bill effectively repeals ObamaCare’s individual mandate that requires people to buy health insurance or face a tax penalty, and it allows for drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge — two top priorities for many Republicans. In order to comply with budget rules that allow the Senate to pass the bill with a simple-majority vote, most of the tax cuts for individuals expire after eight years while the corporate tax cuts are permanent. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that income groups across the board would on average get a tax cut in 2019. But in 2027, after the individual cuts are set to expire, income groups under 75,000 would on average see their taxes go up. Republicans say they expect the temporary tax cuts will be extended. The committee also estimated the bill would add 1.46 trillion to the debt over 10 years. The House Republicans who voted against the bill were mostly lawmakers from New York, New Jersey and California who were troubled by the bill’s 10,000 cap on the state and local tax deduction. Rep.

John Cornyn, R-Texas, speaks to reporters outside his office as Congress prepares to vote on the biggest reshaping of the U.S. tax code in three decades, on Capitol Hill, Tuesday,... (Associated Press) WASHINGTON (AP) — The Latest on the push in Congress to pass a sweeping tax cut bill (all times local): 4:50 p.m. Democrats say three provisions in the Republican 1.5 trillion tax bill violate Senate rules and will likely be removed before that chamber votes on the measure. The House approved the legislation Tuesday. But this means the House will have to vote again on the legislation once it's been amended and approved by the Senate. Senate passage was expected Tuesday night or early Wednesday. GOP House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy's office says the House would reconsider the bill Wednesday morning and send it to President Donald Trump for his signature. Democrats said the Senate parliamentarian had found three items that violated Senate rules. These included one provision that would let families use tax-advantaged 529 accounts for home-schooling expenses. The problem was revealed by Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders and Oregon Democrat Ron Wyden. ___ 3:50 p.m. House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (skuh-LEES') says the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee should retain his position even though he voted against the GOP tax overhaul, the most important vote of the year to Republican leaders. Scalise says New Jersey Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen (FREE'-ling-hy-zehn) long ago informed GOP leaders that he opposed the bill because of its impact on high-tax states such as New Jersey. Frelinghuysen voted against the bill Tuesday, leading some House conservatives to say he should be replaced as Appropriations chair. Scalise called that an overreaction, saying Frelinghuysen is \\"doing a really good job in a tough position\\" on Appropriations. Scalise praised an emergency spending bill largely crafted by Frelinghuysen that will offer 81 billion in emergency aid to states hard-hit by hurricanes and wildfires. ___ 3:45 p.m. A sweeping tax package speeding its way through Congress has cleared a key procedural vote in the Senate. The Senate voted 51-48 to begin debating the bill. The House passed the bill Tuesday afternoon and the Senate is expected to pass it Tuesday evening, sending it to President Donald Trump for his signature. The 1.5 trillion package would provide steep tax cuts for businesses and the wealthy and more modest cuts for middle- and low-income families. The business tax cuts would take effect in January. Workers would start to see changes in the amount of taxes withheld from their paychecks in February. The bill would nearly double the standard deduction used by most taxpayers, while those who itemize would lose some deductions ___ 3:30 p.m. President Donald Trump is celebrating the House's passage of sweeping Republican tax legislation on Twitter.

It was the realization of Ryan's yearslong work on tax policy. Protesters disagreed. On woman yelled from the visitors' gallery: \\"You're lying. You're lying. Only rich will benefit.\\" She was escorted out of the chamber by Capitol Police. Another woman told the Wisconsin Republican he needs to learn math. ___ 1:50 p.m. Several protesters have briefly disrupted House debate on the tax bill, yelling, \\"kill the bill. Don't kill us.\\" Police removed the demonstrators from the visitors' gallery and debate proceeded, with Republicans and Democrats alternating in speaking about the 1.5 trillion package. Several Democratic lawmakers applauded. The last protester escorted out of the gallery nodded toward the Democrats and said, \\"thank you.\\" Republicans did not applaud, but several could be seen smiling. The House was expected to pass the bill shortly. ___ 12:05 p.m. A sweeping tax package speeding its way through Congress has cleared a key procedural vote in the House. The House approved the rule to begin debating the bill by a mostly party line vote of 233-193.

The bill would nearly double the standard deduction used by most taxpayers, which those who itemize would lose some deductions. ___ 10:25 a.m. Gleeful House Republicans are taking a victory lap ahead of expected passage of their tax package. At a news conference Tuesday morning, members of the GOP hailed the bill that would slash taxes for businesses and the wealthy while offering modest cuts for other Americans. Republicans argue that corporations, flush with cash, will create more jobs and boost the economy. Speaker Paul Ryan told reporters: \\"This is the greatest example of a promise being made and a promise being kept.\\" Ryan rejected polling that shows the bill is widely unpopular. He insisted that \\"results are going to make this popular.\\" Ryan was joined by other members of the House GOP leadership who called the day historic and praised the legislation. The House was expected to vote around 2 p.m. The Senate is expected to vote Tuesday evening. ____ 8:45 a.m. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders says the tax overhaul legislation facing votes today in Congress is a \\"huge deal for America.\\" Speaking on \\"Fox and Friends\\" Tuesday, Sanders said, \\"Today is a huge day, not just for the White House, not just for Congress but most importantly for America.\\" Sanders said middle class Americans will \\"see the biggest benefit out of this tax package.\\" The sweeping 1.5 trillion tax bill slashes the tax rate for corporations from 35 percent to 21 percent and reduces taxes on the wealthiest Americans, while making more modest tax reductions for most others. It's not expected to win any Democratic votes. Speaking in front of the White House, she said Democratic lawmakers should have been \\"banging down the door of the building behind me to be part of this process.\\" ____ 6:40 a.m. President Donald Trump is hailing the performance of the stock market as the House and Senate brace for votes that majority Republicans are confident will produce the most far-reaching overhaul of the U.S. tax code in decades. In an early morning tweet Tuesday, Trump savors what would be his biggest legislative accomplishment as president, and says \\"DOW RISES 5000 POINTS ON THE YEAR FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER — MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\\" He also says, \\"Stocks and the economy have a long way to go after the Tax Cut Bill is totally understood and appreciated in scope and size.\\" The president adds, \\"Immediate expensing will have a big impact. Biggest Tax Cuts and Reform EVER passed. Enjoy. And create many beautiful JOBS!\\" ___ 3:55 a.m. Their long-sought political goal within grasp, Republicans in Congress are set to catapult sweeping 1.5 trillion tax legislation through the House, rolling over a dozen GOP defectors from high-tax states. The Republicans' final drive to deliver the tax package to an eager President Donald Trump begins Tuesday with a vote in the House. Quickly following, a vote later in the day or on Wednesday in the Senate is expected to seal the deal. Both tallies likely will cling along party lines. The Senate result was in doubt in recent weeks. Only on Friday did Republican leaders cement the needed support for the legislation, securing endorsements from wavering GOP senators Marco Rubio of Florida and Bob Corker of Tennessee. More holdout GOP senators— moderate Susan Collins of Maine and Mike Lee of Utah — came into the fold on Monday. ||||| A summary of this is?","response":"The U.S. Congress is voting on a big tax bill that can change how much money people and businesses have to pay in taxes.

The premise is essentially a simple description of a scene, while the hypothesis attempts to explain the possible motivation behind the woman's actions. Premise: \\"A woman in jeans and a revealing top is jumping in front of a green hoop-like structure.\\" This statement describes the attire and action of a woman, as well as the presence of a green hoop-like structure. However, there is no information given concerning the reason behind the woman's actions, her emotional state, or any context-specific circumstances. Hypothesis: \\"A woman is jumping for joy because she got a raise.\\" This hypothesis suggests that the woman's jumping is a result of her excitement due to receiving a raise at work. However, there is no information in the premise to support this claim. No details are provided about the woman's occupation, salary, or emotions. Stream of thoughts: 1. The premise provides a visual description of the scene but does not include specific information about the events that led to the woman jumping. 2. The hypothesis tries to explain the reason behind the woman's action by suggesting she is excited about receiving a raise. 3. However, the premise does not contain any information about the woman's job situation, earnings, or emotions. 4. Thus, the hypothesis cannot be confirmed or proved based on the information given in the premise. 5. Developing a solid hypothesis would require more context and knowledge about the circumstances leading up to the moment the woman decided to jump. In conclusion, there is a lack of information in the premise to confirm or support the hypothesis. To have a more informed understanding of the woman's motivations, a context that includes details about her job situation, emotional state, and any relevant events would be required. Without such context, we cannot determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given two strings A,B.

It is known for musical improvisation, extended jams, blending of genres, and a dedicated fan base. The current line-up--guitarist and lead vocalist Trey Anastasio, bassist and vocalist Mike Gordon, drummer and vocalist Jon Fishman, and keyboardist and vocalist Page McConnell--performed together for 15 years before going on hiatus from October 7, 2000, to December 30, 2002. They resumed touring from December 31, 2002, until August 15, 2004, when they announced that the Coventry Festival would be their last show. Phish was formed at the University of Vermont (UVM) in 1983 by guitarists Trey Anastasio and Jeff Holdsworth, bassist Mike Gordon, and drummer Jon Fishman. For their first gig, at Harris Millis Cafeteria at the University of Vermont on December 2, 1983, the band was billed as \\"Blackwood Convention\\". (\\"Blackwood convention\\" is a term from the card game contract bridge.) The band was joined by percussionist Marc Daubert in the fall of 1984, a time during which they promoted themselves as playing Grateful Dead songs. Daubert left the band early in 1985, and Page McConnell then joined the group on keyboards and made his debut on May 3, 1985, at a show at Wilks/Davis/Wing Dormitory on Redstone Campus at UVM. Holdsworth left the group after graduating in 1986, solidifying the band's lineup of \\"Trey, Page, Mike, and Fish\\"--the lineup to this day. Following a prank at UVM with his friend and former bandmate Steve Pollak--also known as \\"The Dude of Life\\"--Anastasio decided to leave the college. With the encouragement of McConnell (who received 50 for each transferee), Anastasio and Fishman relocated in mid-1986 to Goddard College, a small school in the hills of Plainfield, Vermont. Phish distributed at least six different experimental self-titled cassettes during this era, including The White Tape. This first studio recording was circulated in two variations: the first, mixed in a dorm room as late as 1985, received a higher distribution than the second studio remix of the original four tracks, c. 1987. The older version was officially released under the title Phish in August 1998. Jesse Jarnow's book Heads: A Biography of Psychedelic America details much of the band's early years at Goddard College, including their early relationship with fellow Goddard students Richard \\"Nancy\\" Wright and Jim Pollock. Pollock and Wright were musical collaborators, experimenting with multi-track cassette records to be broadcast on local radio. Phish adopted a number of Nancy's songs into their own set, including \\"Halley's Comet\\", \\"I Didn't Know\\", and \\"Dear Mrs. Reagan\\", the latter song being written by Nancy and Pollock. Jarnow argues that despite an eventual falling out between the members of Phish and Nancy, Nancy and his music were highly influential to Phish's early style and experimental sound. Pollock continued to collaborate with Phish over the years, designing some of their most iconic concert posters. The band's actions demonstrate an identity with their \\"hometown\\" of Burlington, Vermont. By 1985, the group had encountered Burlington luthier Paul Languedoc, who would eventually design four guitars for Anastasio and two basses for Gordon. In October 1986, he began working as their sound engineer. Since then, Languedoc has built exclusively for the two, and his designs and traditional wood choices have given Phish a unique instrumental identity. Also during the late 1980s, Phish played regularly at Nectar's restaurant and bar in Burlington. In 1992 the album A Picture of Nectar, named as a tribute to the owner, featured a large orange with Nectar's photo superimposed subtly within the orange.

Which word can go after Black, Hard and Star to make three other words?","response":"The word that can go after \\"Black,\\" \\"Hard,\\" and \\"Star\\" to make three other words is \\"board.\\" When combined with each of the initial words, we create the following compound words: 1. Blackboard: A large flat, usually dark, surface on which writings, drawings, or teachings are displayed, commonly using a piece of chalk. Blackboards are often found in the classroom setting and are widely used as an instructional tool. 2. Hardboard: A type of engineered wood product that is more rigid, durable, and hard as compared to particleboard or medium-density fiberboard (MDF). Hardboard is made from wood fibers that are compressed under high pressure and heat, resulting in a smooth surface on one or both sides of the board. This material is used for various applications such as furniture, cabinetry, and flooring underlayment. 3. Starboard: A nautical term that refers to the right-hand side of a ship or a boat, when facing the bow (the front). The opposite of starboard is the port side, which is the left-hand side of the vessel. The terms \\"starboard\\" and \\"port\\" are used to provide clear directions and avoid confusion while navigating and communicating aboard a ship, regardless of the observer's orientation or position on the vessel. In conclusion, the word \\"board\\" can be added to \\"Black,\\" \\"Hard,\\" and \\"Star,\\" resulting in the formation of \\"blackboard,\\" \\"hardboard,\\" and \\"starboard,\\" which are distinct and meaningful compound words, each with its unique context and application."},{"question":"Q:Read the bio below and try to give details on wouter van der steen 's: - clubs - caps - position - currentclub - height - clubnumber - youthclubs - birth date - fullname - name - birth place - goals Bio: wouter van der steen -lrb- born 3 june 1990 in vught -rrb- is a dutch professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for helmond sport in the dutch eerste divisie .

Hypothesis: He was struggling to sit up because of a severe headache. Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","response":"The hypothesis that he was struggling to sit up because of a severe headache is not necessarily entailed by the premise. While the premise does describe the character as struggling to sit up, it doesn't provide any clear information about the cause of the struggle, which could be due to various reasons including illness, injury, disorientation, or physical limitations. In order to better understand whether the hypothesis you provided is entailed by the premise, let's take a closer look at the premise and examine possible alternative explanations. The premise states that the character managed to struggle up to a sitting position in the bed, which suggests that they had difficulty reaching this position. It also says that the character was trying to make out more of their surroundings, implying some level of uncertainty or confusion regarding their environment. The hypothesis you provided guesses that the struggle to sit up was due to a severe headache, but this information is not explicitly mentioned in the premise. It's important to consider alternative explanations for the character's struggle to sit up and to understand their surroundings. For instance: 1. The character could have been disoriented or confused due to being in an unfamiliar environment or waking up from a deep sleep, which might not involve a severe headache. 2. The character may have suffered from a physical injury that made sitting up painful or difficult, such as a back or neck injury, rather than a headache. 3. A medical condition, such as sleep paralysis or muscle weakness, could have caused the character to struggle to move while waking up, regardless of whether or not they were experiencing head pain. Although the hypothesis of a severe headache causing the character's difficulties is plausible, it is not directly entailed by the premise, as there is no explicit mention of a headache being the primary reason for their struggles. The premise is open to multiple interpretations, and the hypothesis is only one possibility among others."},{"question":"Based on the premise \\"The 2001 survey was cosponsored by the Employee Benefit Research Institute, the American Savings Education Council, and Mathew Greenwald and Associates, Inc.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"Mathew Greenwald was a cosponsor for the survey. \\" is true (see options)? Possible answers: * yes * it is not possible to tell * no","response":"yes The correct answer is \\"yes\\" because in the premise, it clearly states that Mathew Greenwald and Associates, Inc. was one of the cosponsors for the 2001 survey. This means they helped support and organize the survey. The other options are wrong because they say that either we can't tell if Mathew Greenwald was a cosponsor or that he wasn't a cosponsor, but we already know from the premise that his company was indeed a cosponsor."},{"question":"Q:Article: With an overwhelming variety of educational toys and learning tools in the market, you really wonder if these educational products are really beneficial to children. There have been many educational DVDs in the market that promise to stimulate a child's learning and enhance his or her cognitive skills. Parents feel good about buying these products for their children. After all, these educational tools try to do a parent's job of participating in the child's education, especially when the parent can't be present due to his or her busy schedule. Moreover, children seem to love these DVDs that contain pictures, words, and loads of stories. Some DVDs contain fun, sing-along songs or read-aloud words to help the children learn different concepts and words. Although these are fun for the parents and the children, the question that needs to be asked is whether these DVDs are actually beneficial to the child, as they claim to be. Although parents expected \\"educational\\" products to give their child some educational advantage, research has shown otherwise. Researchers in a recent study concluded that there was indeed no difference between the language and cognitive ability of the infants who were repeatedly exposed to educational DVDs and those who were not exposed to the DVDs. In fact, contrary to expectations, it was found that babies who were exposed to the DVDs at an earlier age had lower overall language scores at a later age. This suggested a damaging effect of such DVDs on younger children. For several years the American Academy of Pediatrics has recommended that toddlers under age of 24 months or 2 years should not watch videos or television. However, there are many parents who believe these DVDs really help in stimulating the child and keep him or her entertained. While it may work as a great babysitter, it is important to limit activities like video games, computer games, DVDs or TV programs.

Yes or no, is the answer \\"Do educational DVDs Really Work?\\"? A:","response":"Yes, the answer \\"Do Educational DVDs Really Work?\\" could be considered as the best title for the passage due to its questioning of the effectiveness and potential harmful effects of educational DVDs on children's learning and cognitive abilities.

It was acknowledgment rather than a greeting, delivered in a cool tone.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"Captain Bayliss had a cool tone.\\" is true?","response":"Based on the given premise, \\"Captain Bayliss. It was acknowledgment rather than a greeting, delivered in a cool tone.\\", we can analyze the statement and the context provided to determine if the hypothesis \\"Captain Bayliss had a cool tone.\\" is indeed true. First, let's break down the given premise: 1. \\"Captain Bayliss.\\": This statement introduces the character \\"Captain Bayliss.\\" 2. \\"It was acknowledgment rather than a greeting,\\": In this segment, \\"it\\" refers to the mention of Captain Bayliss, and it is stated that the mention serves as an acknowledgment, distinguishing it from being a friendly greeting. 3. \\"delivered in a cool tone.\\": The final part of the sentence describes the manner in which the acknowledgment was expressed. In this case, \\"cool\\" can be interpreted as detached, disinterested, or possibly unfriendly. Given these three parts of the premise, we can now determine if the hypothesis \\"Captain Bayliss had a cool tone.\\" is true or not. The premise tells us that the acknowledgment of Captain Bayliss is what was delivered in a cool tone, rather than suggesting that Captain Bayliss themselves inherently had a cool tone. It is important to clarify that the cool tone referred to in the premise is associated with the acknowledgment and not directly attributed to Captain Bayliss as a character. Therefore, based on the provided context, the hypothesis \\"Captain Bayliss had a cool tone.\\" cannot be conclusively determined as being true. Additional context or information about Captain Bayliss' demeanor or behavior would be required to validate this hypothesis. However, it can be inferred that the manner in which Captain Bayliss was acknowledged was characterized by a cool tone, which could potentially imply a strained relationship or lack of warmth between the individuals involved, but this inference alone cannot confirm Captain Bayliss' personal tone."},{"question":"I lost sight in one eye when in college, I had two preschool children at the time.

Traditionally this has always been somewhat ad-hoc: people join a team and work on whatever they feel like. Ideas are ten-a-penny though. For most teams that work on larger projects (such as events, software, products and more) to actually be productive, coordinating this work can be complex: some projects require coordination across many people with different skill-sets, time-availability and resources. Something I would like us to work towards in the Ubuntu community is encouraging a culture of best-practise in how we plan our work and coordinate our awesome teams to work together on projects. I believe this kind of coordination can help our teams increase the opportunity for success in their work, feel more empowered and productive and provide greater insight to people outside those teams on what the team is doing. An effective way of doing this is to build a Roadmap for each cycle. This provides an opportunity to capture a set of goals the team will work together to achieve in each six-month period. This article outlines how to build such a Roadmap. While at first a roadmap can feel a little like a nod to the gods of bureaucracy, they actually possess many benefits: * Direction – one of the biggest complaints teams often report is a lack of direction. If a team gets into the habit of creating a roadmap at the beginning of a cycle, it gives the team a sense of focus and direction for the coming cycle. * Documented commitments are more effective – a common rule in Project Management training is that actions assigned to people in a shared document are more effective than ad-hoc or private commitments. By documenting who will work on what in a cycle and putting their name next to an action can help seal a sense of accountability for their contributions to the project. * Feeling of success – regularly revisiting a roadmap and...

Why do I get so scared when I think about what happens after death? Please tell me if those questions are the same.","response":"The questions you've posted are similar as they both explore the fear surrounding the unknown aspect of what happens after death. However, they are not exactly identical. The first question focuses on understanding the fear of death in general, while the second question is more personal, asking why the individual gets scared when pondering the afterlife. Now, let's discuss both aspects in detail. First, it's important to recognize that the fear of death is a natural and universal human experience. Throughout history, human beings have grappled with the concept of mortality and the uncertainty associated with what comes after death. Many theories and beliefs exist, ranging from religious views of an afterlife to philosophical perspectives on consciousness and reincarnation. Despite the multitude of viewpoints, there remains no definitive proof or consensus about what happens after we die. This lack of certainty can be a significant source of anxiety and fear for many individuals. Our brains are wired to seek patterns, create order, and make sense of the world around us. The ambiguity of what comes after death leaves us with questions that have no clear answers, leading to feelings of unease. Moreover, the fear of death is also tied to our instincts for self-preservation and survival. From an evolutionary standpoint, avoiding death has been crucial for the survival of our species and the propagation of our genetic material. As a result, the prospect of dying can evoke powerful emotional and psychological reactions. Moving on to the second question, the reason you may feel particularly scared when thinking about what happens after death is likely due to the combination of these factors and your unique psychological makeup. Some individuals may find the uncertainty of the afterlife more unsettling than others because they have a greater need for cognitive closure and a preference for definite answers. Additionally, personal experiences and upbringing can also play a significant role in shaping an individual's thoughts and emotions surrounding the concept of death. Your cultural background, religious beliefs, and encounters with death in your personal life can influence the intensity of your fears. To cope with the fear of death, some individuals may seek comfort in religious or spiritual beliefs that provide a sense of meaning and reassurance about the afterlife. Others may turn to philosophical inquiry or engage in self-reflection and personal growth to come to terms with their mortality. Ultimately, finding ways to confront and manage your fear surrounding death often involves a combination of self-awareness, open-minded exploration, and the willingness to embrace uncertainty."},{"question":"Leo: If \\"Two jockeys racing on horses.\\" does that mean that \\"Two jockeys are racing.\\"?

Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text. Tommy Lynn Sells, 49, was the first inmate to be injected with a dose of recently replenished stocks of the powerful sedative pentobarbital. US states are facing a shortage of execution drugs as a growing number of firms have refused to sell them. Sells' lawyers tried unsuccessfully to find out the names of the suppliers. Debate about the source of execution drugs has recently become contentious in several states as numerous drug makers have refused to sell their products if they are used in executions. Opposition is especially strong among European drug makers, where concern over capital punishment is fiercest. A lower court earlier stopped Sells' execution, ordering the Texas Department of Criminal Justice to reveal more information about the drug supplier, but its ruling was overturned on appeal. The convicted man's attorneys argued that they needed to know the name of the pharmacy supplying the pentobarbital in order to verify the drug's quality and protect him from unconstitutional pain and suffering. \\"Without transparency about lethal injections, particularly the source and purity of drugs to be used, it is impossible to ensure that executions are humane and constitutional,\\" lawyers Maurie Levin and Jonathan Ross said in a statement. But the Supreme Court agreed with Texas prison officials, who argued that information about the drug supplier must be kept secret to protect the pharmacy from threats of violence. The justices did not elaborate on the reasoning behind their ruling, which was issued about an hour before Sells' execution. Last month a pharmacy in the state of Oklahoma said that it would not supply pentobarbital to neighbouring Missouri for use in an execution. Sells was convicted of murder in 2000 for stabbing Kaylene Harris, 13, to death and slashing her 10-year-old friend, Krystal Surles, who survived and helped police find him. US media reports said Sells had confessed to as many as 70 killings across the US. He declined to give a statement prior to his execution. Sells was pronounced dead 13 minutes after being given the pentobarbital. His execution was the fifth lethal injection this year in Texas, the busiest state in the US for enforcing the death penalty. Nearly 1,400 men have been put to death since the US Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976.","response":"US inmate executed in Texas amid debate over drug source, as states face a shortage of execution drugs and drug makers increasingly refuse to sell their products for use in executions."},{"question":"Avrupa Komisyonu (AK), 17 Avro Bölgesi ülkesinin ulusal bütçeleri üzerindeki yetkilerini artıracak ve ciddi mali sorunlarla karşı karşıya olan üyeler üzerindeki denetimini güçlendirecek iki yeni yönetmeliği 23 Kasım Çarşamba günü masaya koydu.

Here are possible answers to this question: - detention - stupidity - overwhelmed - dropping out - much work I believe the correct choice is \\"much work\\", here's why: A:","response":"Some graduates may choose not to attend school later in life due to having much work, and here's a step-by-step justification for this choice: Step 1: Eliminate irrelevant answers First, we can eliminate \\"detention\\" and \\"stupidity\\" as they do not directly address the reasons why some graduates might not attend school later in life. Detention is a temporary disciplinary measure within a school setting and does not influence long-term educational decisions. Similarly, labeling someone as \\"stupid\\" is a reductive and unhelpful way to discuss the complexities of a person's educational choices. Step 2: Compare remaining options Now, we are left with three options: \\"overwhelmed,\\" \\"dropping out,\\" and \\"much work.\\" Step 3: Assess each option \\"Overwhelmed\\" can be a reason for graduates to not attend school later in life; however, it is a vague term that could encompass many feelings or situations. It is not as specific as the other remaining options. \\"Dropping out\\" could be a reason for not continuing education; however, this term is more applicable to individuals who leave school before completing their degree. Since the question is about graduates, who have already completed a degree, \\"dropping out\\" is less relevant. Step 4: Choose the most appropriate option Finally, \\"much work\\" seems to be the most appropriate choice. Many graduates find themselves with increased professional and personal responsibilities after completing their education. They may have a demanding job, start a family, or care for aging relatives. All of these factors can contribute to the decision not to attend school later in life, as they might not have the time or resources to dedicate to further education. In conclusion, I believe that \\"much work\\" is the most fitting choice to explain why some graduates might choose not to attend school later in life, as it accurately reflects the real-life challenges and responsibilities they may face."},{"question":"Can we conclude from \\"A woman with her nose in a book.\\" that \\"A woman is doing the laundry.\\"?

Here's an example of a task that would test someone's ability to perform physical reasoning: Task: Design a simple Rube Goldberg machine. Step 1: Define the end goal or action to be achieved. Justification: Having a clear objective helps to outline the necessary steps in the machine and visualize the intended outcome. Step 2: Identify and gather the necessary materials. Justification: Knowing which common household objects or materials can be used helps determine what interactions can be established between them. Step 3: Develop an outline of the sequence of events and the physics principles involved. Justification: Understanding how different objects interact, such as by transferring energy or causing a chain reaction, will create a functional and efficient design. Step 4: Construct the Rube Goldberg machine, positioning each element correctly. Justification: Proper positioning ensures that the energy is transferred smoothly between components and that the desired effect occurs at each step. Step 5: Test the machine and troubleshoot any issues. Justification: Testing and troubleshooting allows for any necessary adjustments to be made, ensuring that the machine functions as intended. Step 6: Document the final design and the reasoning behind each element in the machine. Justification: Explaining the logic and reasoning behind each component of the machine demonstrates an understanding of physical reasoning principles. By completing these steps, the person's ability to perform physical reasoning will be tested by applying principles of physics and engineering in creating a functioning Rube Goldberg machine."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you will be presented with a passage, and you need to write an **implausible** answer to to fill in the place of \\"_\\".

So, what's the best answer to the question? a). sex b). spring c). bird d). DNA e). ova f). production g). factories h). ovum A:","response":"The best answer to the question \\"What gives rise to offspring?\\" is a). sex. This is because, as your teacher mentioned, reproduction is the process by which living things give rise to offspring. Furthermore, they added that physiologically, sex is for the purpose of reproduction. Based on these hints, we can infer that sex is the process that leads to the creation of offspring. Let's briefly analyze the other options as well: b). Spring: Spring is a season and not related to the creation of offspring. c). Bird: While birds do reproduce and give rise to offspring, the question is asking for the process that leads to offspring, not a specific organism. d). DNA: DNA carries genetic information but is not the process responsible for giving rise to offspring. e). Ova: Ova (plural for ovum) are female reproductive cells (eggs) that play a crucial role in reproduction, but the question is referring to the process rather than a specific cell type. f). Production: Production is a broad term and can relate to manufacturing, agriculture, and more, but in this context, it does not specifically refer to the process that gives rise to offspring. g). Factories: Factories are industrial buildings where products are manufactured or assembled, not the process that gives rise to offspring. h). Ovum: An ovum, or egg cell, is a female reproductive cell. While it is involved in the process of reproduction, it is not the best answer to the question, as we are looking for a process leading to the creation of offspring. In summary, based on the teacher's hints and the analysis of the given options, a). sex is the best answer to the question as it directly corresponds to the process of reproduction that gives rise to offspring in living beings."},{"question":"the drilling of china 's deepest well for geological research will soon start in donghai county , jiangsu province in east china .

However, there is no scientific evidence or fossil record that supports the existence of unicorns as real animals. The idea of unicorns has evolved over time, and they have become a popular symbol in fantasy literature, art, and folklore. Despite their popularity and presence in stories, unicorns are considered mythical creatures and not real animals that currently exist on Earth.

Released in 2017, this otherworldly fairy tale features a stellar cast, including Sally Hawkins, Michael Shannon, Octavia Spencer, and Doug Jones. Step 2: Briefly outline the plot Set against the backdrop of the 1960s Cold War era, the story follows Elisa Esposito (Sally Hawkins), a mute janitor working at a high-security government laboratory. In an unexpected twist, Elisa forms a deep, emotional connection with a mysterious amphibious creature (Doug Jones) who's held captive in the facility, which ultimately leads her into a daring plot to rescue the creature from the clutches of the merciless Colonel Richard Strickland (Michael Shannon). Step 3: Analyze the acting and performances Sally Hawkins delivers a phenomenal performance as Elisa, employing her expressive facial gestures and body language to convey intense emotions without the need for spoken words. Doug Jones, despite being limited by a full-body costume, manages to evoke a sense of humanity within the creature, allowing the audience to sympathize with the central love story. Michael Shannon's portrayal of the sadistic Colonel Strickland adds a dark layer to the film, balancing out the whimsical nature of the plot. Step 4: Comment on the direction and visual style Guillermo del Toro's masterful direction is evident throughout the film, seamlessly blending romance, fantasy, and thriller elements into a cohesive narrative. The movie's visual style is both enchanting and evocative, with artful shots that transport the audience into the fantastical world it creates. Step 5: Discuss the soundtrack and audio effects Alexandre Desplat's Oscar-winning musical score adds substance and emotional depth to the film, with fluid melodies that harmoniously complement the story's theme of water. The sound design also deserves recognition for effectively using silence and ambient noises to heighten the tension in certain scenes. Step 6: Share personal opinions and summarize In my opinion, The Shape of Water is a brilliant ode to love and acceptance, transcending the boundaries of language and species. While it certainly won't appeal to everyone, I would highly recommend it to those who appreciate visually-enriching fantasy stories that tug at the heartstrings. In conclusion, del Toro has created an enchanting, captivating tale that leaves a lasting impression long after the credits roll."},{"question":"Q: Michael Morzeny put his hands into the pockets of his overcoat and hugged the fabric tighter around his body.

Multiply the daily jogging time by the number of days in two weeks Step 1: Determine total jogging time per day in hours Mr. John jogs for 1 hour and 30 minutes every day. We'll convert the 30 minutes to hours. 30 minutes = 30/60 hours = 0.5 hours So, Mr. John jogs for 1 + 0.5 = 1.5 hours every day. Step 2: Calculate the number of days in two weeks A week has 7 days, so two weeks will have: 2 weeks × 7 days/week = 14 days Step 3: Multiply the daily jogging time by the number of days in two weeks Mr. John jogs for 1.5 hours every day, so in two weeks, he will have spent: 1.5 hours/day × 14 days = 21 hours Therefore, Mr. John will have spent a total of 21 hours jogging after two weeks."},{"question":"Generální tajemník vykonává pravomoci orgánu oprávněného ke jmenování ve smyslu článku 2 služebního řádu úředníků Evropských společenství a pravomoci orgánu oprávněného uzavírat smlouvy se zaměstnanci ve smyslu článku 6 pracovního řádu ostatních zaměstnanců Evropských společenství, pokud rozhodnutí Účetního dvora o výkonu pravomocí orgánu oprávněného ke jmenování a orgánu oprávněného uzavírat smlouvy se zaměstnanci nestanoví jinak.

The first points in the Cowboys' new home were scored by Tynes, whose 30-yard field goal in the first quarter was his first of four on the night. The Cowboys responded by scoring their first points on the ensuing drive&#8212;a 2-yard run by running back Marion Barber. Giants rookie cornerback Bruce Johnson scored his first career points returning a Tony Romo interception 34 yards. Cowboys tight end Jason Witten responded with a 1-yard touchdown pass in the second quarter. Later, Giants safety Kenny Phillips caught an odd interception off Witten's foot, setting up quarterback Eli Manning's 100th career touchdown pass&#8212;a 22-yard strike to Manningham. Romo ran a quarterback sneak to open the scoring in the second half, but the Giants sent wide receiver Steve Smith into the end zone in the fourth quarter. The Cowboys punched in one more touchdown on a 7-yard Felix Jones run, but Tynes' 37-yard field goal as time expired was enough to postpone the Cowboys' first home win in Arlington and boost the Giants to 2-0. The Giants lost two more notable players to injuries; defensive end Justin Tuck suffered a sprained shoulder and wide receiver Domenik Hixon sprained a knee.

Born on December 12, 1929, in London, England, Osborne became a defining figure in post-World War II British theater, initiating the wave of \\"angry young men\\" playwrights who sought to challenge the social norms and traditional values of their time. These authors were noted for their harsh critiques of British society and its institutions, as well as for their focus on the experiences of the working class. \\"The Entertainer\\" was first performed in 1957 at the Royal Court Theatre in London, under the direction of Tony Richardson. The play is set against the backdrop of the 1956 Suez Crisis, a political event which had major implications for British society and its perception of its position on the world stage. The play tells the story of Archie Rice, a failing music-hall performer whose career is in decline, mirroring the struggling British Empire of the post-war years. Through Archie's family, which includes his father Billy Rice, a successful performer from a previous generation, his wife Phoebe, and his son Mick, a soldier deployed during the Suez Crisis, the play explores themes such as disillusionment, the loss of national pride, and the crumbling of the British class system. Osborne's portrayal of Archie Rice as a bitter, disillusioned, and deeply flawed man was groundbreaking for its time, as it shattered the theatrical convention of protagonists being heroic and morally upright. The character was brought to life by iconic British actor Laurence Olivier, who gave a powerful performance both on stage and later in the 1960 film adaptation, which was also directed by Tony Richardson. The play and Olivier's portrayal of Archie Rice solidified John Osborne's status as an important and innovative playwright, and \\"The Entertainer\\" remains one of his most well-known and acclaimed works, signaling a critical turning point in the history of modern British theater."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: In the opening animated segment, the Queen (Julia Roberts) begins by telling us the story of Snow White's birth (throwing in some sarcastic comments with modern day slang).

Given a context passage, generate a question from the passage such that its answer is shortest continous span from the passage. In physics, resistance is opposition to the flow of electric charges in an electric current as it travels through matter. The SI unit for resistance is the ohm. Resistance occurs because moving electrons in current bump into atoms of matter. Resistance reduces the amount of electrical energy that is transferred through matter. Thats because some of the electrical energy is absorbed by the atoms and changed to other forms of energy, such as heat. Q: In the rugby analogy to resistance in physics, what do the players on each team represent? A: The player on the blue and black team represents a moving electron in an electric current. The players on the red and blue team represent particles of matter through which the current is flowing. How much resistance a material has depends on several factors: the type of material, its width, its length, and its temperature. All materials have some resistance, but certain materials resist the flow of electric current more or less than other materials do. Materials such as plastics have high resistance to electric current. They are called electric insulators. Materials such as metals have low resistance to electric current. They are called electric conductors. A wide wire has less resistance than a narrow wire of the same material. Electricity flowing through a wire is like water flowing through a hose. More water can flow through a wide hose than a narrow hose. In a similar way, more current can flow through a wide wire than a narrow wire. A longer wire has more resistance than a shorter wire. Current must travel farther through a longer wire, so there are more chances for it to collide with particles of matter. A cooler wire has less resistance than a warmer wire. Cooler particles have less kinetic energy, so they move more slowly. Therefore, they are less likely to collide with moving electrons in current. Materials called superconductors have virtually no resistance when they are cooled to extremely low temperatures. Resistance can be helpful or just a drain on electrical energy. If the aim is to transmit electric current through a wire from one place to another, then resistance is a drawback. It reduces the amount of electrical energy that is transmitted because some of the current is absorbed by particles of matter. On the other hand, if the aim is to use electricity to produce heat or light, then resistance is useful. When particles of matter absorb electrical energy, they change it to heat or light. For example, when electric current flows through the tungsten wire inside an incandescent light bulb like the one in the Figure 1.1, the tungsten resists the flow of electric charge. It absorbs electrical energy and converts some of it to light and heat. Q: The tungsten wire inside a light bulb is extremely thin. How does this help it do its job? A: The extremely thin wire has more resistance than a wider wire would. This helps the wire resist electric current and change it to light.

A: The SI unit for resistance is the ohm."},{"question":"What kind of task would test someone's ability to perform physical reasoning?","response":"A task that would test someone's ability to perform physical reasoning typically requires the individual to apply their understanding of the physical world, natural laws, and principles (such as force, gravity, or inertia) to solve a problem or perform a certain action. Here's an example of a task for this purpose: Task: Design a basic Rube Goldberg machine that uses everyday household items to pop a balloon. Step 1: Analyze available household items - Assess which common household objects can be utilized as components of the Rube Goldberg machine, such as dominoes, fans, balls, ramps, pulleys, etc. Step 2: Determine the sequence of events - Layout the series of events that must occur in order to pop the balloon (for example: toppling dominoes, rolling a ball down a ramp, or using a pendulum to trigger a pin to pop the balloon). Step 3: Apply physical reasoning - Use principles of force, gravity, and inertia to determine how to place and arrange the components in an efficient and effective manner. This may involve calculating angles, force, and timing to ensure that each sequence in the machine works smoothly. Step 4: Assemble the components - Begin assembling the machine by setting up the components in the order of the sequence of events. Adjust and fine-tune the positions as necessary to ensure proper operation. Step 5: Test the machine - Run a test of the Rube Goldberg machine to see if it successfully pops the balloon. Observe each section of the machine to determine if any adjustments are required to make it work more accurately or efficiently. Step 6: Iterate and improve - Based on the results of the test, iterate and make any necessary improvements to the machine. This might involve adjusting the placement of components, adding new elements, or refining the overall design to optimize its performance. This task tests an individual's physical reasoning as they must employ their understanding of mechanics, forces, and motion, as well as problem-solving and critical thinking, in order to successfully plan and assemble the Rube Goldberg machine."},{"question":"Student: Given the sentence \\"A high school football running back sprints towards the end zone.\\" is it true that \\"A high school football is running back.\\"?.

About a hundred years ago the word was first used for organized games. This is the usual meaning of the word today. People spend a lot of their spare time playing football, basketball, tennis and many other sports. Such people play because they want to. A few people are paid for the sport they play. These people are called professional sportsmen. They may be sportsmen for only a few years, but during that time the best ones can earn a lot of money. For example, a professional footballer in England earns more than 30,000 dollars a year. The stars earn a lot more. International golf and tennis champions can make more than 500,000 dollars a year. Of course, only a few sportsmen can earn as much money as that. Perhaps the most surprising thing about sportsmen and money is that the stars can earn more money from advertising than from sports. An advertisement for sports equipment does not simply say \\"Buy our things\\". It says \\"Buy the same shirt and shoes as ...\\". Famous sportsmen can even advertise things like watches and food.

Spark plug emits a spark that ignites it causing combustion: This step might not function correctly due to the lack of compression. Since the air-fuel mixture is not compressed, the ignition may be incomplete or lacking in intensity, leading to suboptimal combustion. 5. Combustion gases expand: This step will also be affected, as the incomplete or weaker combustion will lead to less forceful expansion of the combustion gases. 6. Pushes piston during power stroke: This is the primary step that will be directly affected by the perturbation. With the piston stuck in the down position, it will not be able to be pushed up during the power stroke, which compromises the generation of mechanical energy from the combustion process. 7. Exhaust valve opens to vent exhaust out tail pipe: This step might still occur, yet the exhaust gases generated from the compromised combustion process may not have the same composition or volume as those from a normal combustion process. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation of the piston being stuck in the down position will have a direct and significant effect on the internal combustion engine's process, leading to reduced or non-existent power generation and potentially harming other engine components due to the disrupted combustion process."},{"question":"Given the question: On a scale of 1-5 (with 1 being least favorable and 5 being most favorable), how would you rate this review? \\"Damage Very bad\\" The answer is:","response":"The given review, \\"Damage Very bad,\\" seems highly unfavorable.

There's a man standing in the hot sun on an extremely hot day with very high temperatures, showing how he can bake cookies in the open without using an oven. He is standing in a parking lot where several other cars are parked. he","response":"begins to lay out all the ingredients and materials needed for making cookies on a table nearby. He wants to prove that it is hot enough outside to cook the cookies without needing a traditional oven. Step 1: Gather the materials. The man ensures that he has everything he needs for baking, including a tray, parchment paper, a mixing bowl, a spoon, and the ingredients (flour, sugar, eggs, butter, and chocolate chips). Gathering the materials first will allow him to work efficiently without any interruptions. Step 2: Mixing the ingredients. He starts by mixing together the dry ingredients (flour, sugar, and a pinch of salt) in the mixing bowl. Doing this separately before combining with the wet ingredients ensures the cookies have a consistent texture. Step 3: Incorporate the wet ingredients. Next, he prepares the wet ingredients by melting the butter (which is made easier by the hot temperatures) and beating the eggs. He then incorporates the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients, being careful not to overmix. Overmixing could result in tough cookies. Step 4: Fold in the chocolate chips. Gently folding in the chocolate chips is the final step in mixing the cookie dough. This ensures that the chips remain intact and do not break into smaller pieces. Step 5: Scoop cookie dough onto the tray. Using a spoon or cookie scoop, the man places the dough onto the parchment paper-lined tray, leaving ample space between the cookies for them to expand as they cook. Step 6: Place the tray under the sun. The man finally finds a spot in the sunniest area of the parking lot, ensuring that the tray is exposed to as much sunlight and heat as possible. Ideally, the tray should be placed on a relatively flat surface, like the hood of a car or the ground. Step 7: Monitor the baking process. As the cookies begin to \\"bake\\" under the sun, the man needs to keep a close eye on them, checking for signs of doneness by observing their edges and surface. He should also avoid leaving them outside for too long, as the cookies may become overcooked or even burnt due to the extreme temperatures. Step 8: Let the cookies cool down. Once the cookies are fully baked, the man removes the tray from the sun and transfers the cookies to a cooling rack or plate, allowing them to cool down before enjoying them."},{"question":"Given the sentence \\"A woman in a suit and gloves is conducting a small orchestra in a bright room.\\" can we conclude that \\"A woman is conducting an orchestra.\\"?

The video features a black man… Following an uproar over decades-old racist newsletters published under Ron Paul's name, a newly released ad seems designed to address the perception that the GOP presidential hopeful is prejudiced. The video, released by Revolution PAC, features a black man whose sick, pregnant white wife was neglected at a Texas hospital during the early 1970s because of what he saw as prejudice â until \\"Ron Paul came to the rescue.\\" Paul worked as a doctor at the facility. In the ad â which never mentions the newsletter controversy â James Williams, of Matagorda County, Texas, recounts a harrowing experience at the hospital, where he said the biracial couple fell victim to racism. He says that his ailing wife was left unattended, and his repeated requests for help made to the head nurse were not only rebuffed, but prompted a call to police, because the nurse felt harassed. As Williams despaired, he said Paul emerged, and offered to care for his wife. Ten minutes later, Williams said, their child was delivered â a stillborn boy. Paul told him he'd take care of the bill, and Williams said he was never charged. \\"He was a doctor of medicine, and that's what he was doing, practicing medicine. And it didn't matter who and what and why,\\" Williams said. Paul helped, Williams said, because \\"he thinks of one human being just as much as another one. Heâs just an honest man. And thatâs something we need now in this day and time. \\" Veering into politics, Williams condemns attempts to \\"blot out\\" Paul because he is an honest politician. The ad ends with a call to donate money to get the video shown on television, but itâs clearly had no trouble attracting attention. Paul has repeatedly disavowed the content of the controversial newsletters, saying they were penned by ghostwriters and conceding he should have done a better job of keeping track of them. The screedsâ targets included blacks and homosexuals. \\"Dr. Paul has assumed responsibility, apologized for his lack of oversight and disavowed the offensive material,\\" his spokesman told Reuters recently. Despite the controversy, Paul has been faring well in recent days, with an NBC/Marist poll Friday showing Paul running two percentage points behind frontrunner Mitt Romney as Tuesday's Iowa caucuses loom. Jonathan Capehart argued in the Washington Post on Thursday that the new ad does not go far enough to address concerns raised by the newsletters. \\"Paul, a man who wants to be entrusted with the presidency, owes the American people a clear accounting of how hatred came to be scribbled regularly in publications bearing his name and how he had no knowledge of it. His dismissive disavowal of the matter is beyond inadequate. As is the ad from supporter,\\" Capehart wrote. MSNBC's First Read reported that part of the ad was played for Paul during an appearance on WHO radio in Iowa, and the congressman was moved. He said that while he was just doing his job that day in Texas, \\"I never had the knowledge [of] how grateful he was and to me that is magnificent,\\" MSNBC quoted Paul as saying","response":"A new advertisement by Revolution PAC aims to confront the perception that GOP presidential candidate Ron Paul is prejudiced, following controversial racist newsletters published under his name years ago.

Article: A practical English Grammar is intended for intermediate and post-intermediate students. We hope that more advanced learners and teachers will also find it useful. The book is a comprehensive survey of structures and forms, written in clear modern English and illustrated with numerous examples. Areas of particular difficulty have been given special attention. Differences between conversational usage and strict grammatical forms are shown but the emphasis is on controversial forms. In the fourth edition the main changes are as follows. 1. Explanation and examples have been brought up to date. 2. There is now more information on countable and uncountable nouns, attributive and predicative adjectives, adverbs of place, sentence adverbs, cleft sentences, prepositions, conjunctives, modal verbs, perfect tenses, infinitive constructions, the passive, purpose clauses and nouns. 3. Some material has been rearranged to make comparisons easier. For example, parts of chapters on can, may, must etc. are now grouped by functions; verbs of liking and preference have a chapter to themselves; suggestions and invitations have joined the chapter on commands, requests and advice. 4. The contents list now summaries every edition heading, and there is a new index containing many more entries references. In this edition the sign \\"~\\" is frequently used to show a change of speaker in examples of dialogue. Note also that although the sign \\"=\\"\\"\\" sometimes connects two words or expressions with the same meaning, it is often used more freely, e.g. to indicate a transformation from active to passive or direct to indirect speech.

Developments in AI technology have led to the automation of various tasks across several industries. While many view technological advancements as a means of improving productivity, efficiency, and the living standards of society, others argue that the rapidly advancing field poses a threat to human employment and could potentially lead to widespread unemployment. Consequently, this debate has sparked an interest among researchers, policymakers, and the public, seeking to understand the implications of AI on the global economy and workforce. Hypothesis: The integration of artificial intelligence in various industries has the potential to replace numerous traditional jobs in the short-term. However, in the long-run, this development could lead to the creation of new job opportunities and the emergence of roles not previously considered, resulting in a dynamic shift in labor market demands. The successful adaptation to this shift would require significant investments in education and training to equip the workforce with the necessary skills and knowledge to thrive in an AI-driven economy.

In Arkansas, a large portion is contained within the northwestern and northcentral region. Much smaller pieces of the Ozarks extend westward into northeastern Oklahoma and extreme southeastern Kansas. - The tallgrass prairie is an ecosystem native to central North America. Natural and anthropogenic fire, as well as grazing by large mammals (primarily bison), were historically agents of periodic disturbance, which regulates tree encroachment, recycles nutrients to the soil, and catalyzes some seed dispersal and germination processes. Prior to widespread use of the steel plow, which enabled conversion to agricultural land use, tallgrass prairies expanded throughout the American Midwest and smaller portions of southern central Canada, from the transitional ecotones out of eastern North American forests, west to a climatic threshold based on precipitation and soils, to the southern reaches of the Flint Hills in Oklahoma, to a transition into forest in Manitoba. - Richard Hanson ( born February 20 , 1940 ) served as secretary of state of Missouri in 1994 following the removal from office of his predecessor , Judith Moriarty .

But don't get me wrong, this heterogeneity of the genres the movie deals with, adds veracity to the experience this rich movie offers to its spectators. That doesn't mean that it lacks unity : on the contrary, it's rare to see such a dense and profound portrait of a woman in pain. Shin-ae, who's in quest for a quiet life with her son in the native town of her late husband, really gives, by all the different faces of suffering she's going through, unity to this movie. It's realistic part is erased by the psychological descriptions of all the phases the poor mother is going through. Denial, lost, anger, faith, pert of reality : the movie fallows all the steps the character crosses, and looks like a psychological catalog of all the suffering phases a woman can experience. The only thing is to accept what may look like a conceptual experience (the woman wears the mask of tragedy, the man represents the comical interludes) and to let the artifices of the movie touch you. I must say that some parts of the movie really did move me (especialy in the beginning), particularly those concerning the unability of Chang Joan to truly help the one he loves, but also that the accumulation of suffering emotionally tired me towards the end. Nevertheless, some cinematographic ideas are really breathtaking and surprising (the scene where a body is discovered in a large shot is for instance amazing). This kind of scenes makes \\"Secret Sunshine\\" the melo equivalent of \\"The Host\\" for horror movies or \\"Memories of murder\\" for thrillers. These movies are indeed surprising, most original, aesthetically incredible, and manage to give another dimension to the genres they deal with.

The identity of the donor has not been established, although a number of suggestions have been advanced over the last 200 years. Harbison suggests the work's small scale indicates that it functioned as a portable altarpiece rather than as a private devotional work, and thus was commissioned by or for a member of the clergy. Other art historians have argued that the donor may have been a Genoese merchant. This belief has been fed by the triptych's similarity to Giovanni Mazone's Virgin and Child altarpiece in Pontremoli, Tuscany, which may place it in the Italian region of Liguria at latest by the end of the 15th century. Damaged coats of arms on the inner frames have been linked to the Giustiniani family, known for establishing trade links with Bruges in the 14th and 15th centuries. If not commissioned by that family, historical record place the work at least in their possession by the end of the century. In the early 1800s, Frances Weale attempted to place Michele Giustiniani as the donor, however later historical research has been unable to verify his presence in Bruges around 1437, and he seems to have returned to Italy by 1430.Mid-twentieth century technical examination revealed the Giustiniani coats of arms may have been painted over an earlier heraldic design, perhaps as early as the 15th century, whose signifiance and history is now lost. Dhanens theorises that a member of the Giustiniani family may have established other associations with St. Michael and St. Catherine, advancing that they were a member of the Italian Rapondi family, whose trading house in Paris was named after St. Catherine.

Question 2: Is Business Insider the TMZ of business news? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","response":"Answer 1: Is Business Insider Republican-leaning? Business Insider, founded in 2007, is a business, celebrity, and technology news website that primarily focuses on delivering quick information about the latest happenings in these fields. While the site does cover some political topics and content, it is not specifically affiliated with any political party or ideology. As for its political leaning, some people might argue that it has a slight conservative or Republican tilt, while others may argue it leans more towards neutral or even slightly left-leaning. In the absence of a declared affiliation, it can be challenging to pinpoint the exact political leaning of Business Insider. Having said that, it is essential to recognize that individual authors and stories published on the site may display specific political biases depending on the topic or the personal perspectives of the authors. This is quite common in media organizations and, as readers, it is crucial to be critical thinkers and analyze the credibility and bias of any news source. Answer 2: Is Business Insider the TMZ of business news? While both Business Insider and TMZ are online news platforms, they cater to different segments and have distinct approaches to news reporting. TMZ, primarily known for its celebrity-focused content, often shares gossip and scoops about the entertainment industry. Their coverage can be controversial and, at times, sensationalist. In contrast, Business Insider covers a wider range of topics, including business, technology, and financial news. Although they do occasionally cover celebrity news as it pertains to their main focus areas, their primary goal is to provide readers with up-to-date information about the business world and market trends. Hence, it may not be accurate to label Business Insider as \\"the TMZ of business news.\\" While Business Insider aims to present news in a captivating and easily digestible manner, its journalistic goals and audience differ significantly from those of TMZ. Therefore, the answer to these two questions is not the same, as they address different aspects of the Business Insider platform – one referring to political leanings, and the other to its journalistic style and content focus in comparison to TMZ."},{"question":"Solve -9298*l + 6426 = -9451*l for l. Solve this problem.","response":"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step, like we're talking to a five-year-old. We have this equation: -9298*l + 6426 = -9451*l Our goal is to find out what \\"l\\" is. We can do this by moving all the \\"l\\" parts to one side of the equation and all the other parts (the numbers) to the other side. Step 1: Add 9298*l to both sides of the equation to move all the \\"l\\" parts to one side: -9298*l + 9298*l + 6426 = -9451*l + 9298*l This simplifies to: 6426 = -153*l Step 2: Now we need to move the -153 on the same side as 6426 so l is by itself. To do this, we'll divide both sides of the equation by -153: 6426 / -153 = (-153 * l) / -153 This gives us: -42 = l So, our answer is l = -42. And there you go! We found out that \\"l\\" is equal to -42."},{"question":"Sentiment possibilities Possible answers: A. negative. B. positive..

For instance, an evocative painting, a moving piece of music, and a profound piece of writing can all inspire feelings of love, loss, hope, or nostalgia, among many other emotional responses.

The question and answer pair are described below.","response":"Question: How many hours do children watch TV in two weeks if they watch 45 minutes a day for 4 days a week? Answer: Children watch 6 hours of TV in two weeks. Rationale: The children watch TV for 45 minutes a day, 4 days a week. In order to calculate the total minutes they watch in a week, we can multiply these numbers: 45 minutes/day x 4 days/week = 180 minutes/week Now, we need to convert the total minutes into hours by dividing the total minutes by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 180 minutes/week ÷ 60 minutes/hour = 3 hours/week Finally, to find out the total hours they watch TV in two weeks, we can simply multiply the weekly hours by 2: 3 hours/week x 2 weeks = 6 hours in two weeks.

Step-by-step reasoning:","response":"Step 1: Identify the main subjects of the statement The main subjects of the statement are the \\"Spanish Armada\\" and the \\"English.\\" Step 2: Understand the context of the Spanish Armada The Spanish Armada was a large fleet of ships sent by King Philip II of Spain in 1588 to invade England and overthrow Queen Elizabeth I. This was due to a series of political, economic, and religious reasons, including the support England provided to Dutch Protestants rebelling against Spanish rule. Step 3: Identify the historical events and conflicts involving the Spanish Armada and England The most significant engagement (a series of encounters) between the Spanish Armada and the English occurred in 1588, known as the Anglo-Spanish War (1585-1604). In this series of encounters, the English navy, led by Sir Francis Drake and Lord Howard of Effingham, managed to outmaneuver and significantly damage the Spanish fleet, preventing them from achieving their main objective of invading England. Step 4: Evaluate the truthfulness of the statement While the Spanish Armada and the English did engage in conflicts during the course of the Anglo-Spanish War, it is important to note that this was primarily a naval conflict, with multiple encounters but not necessarily distinct \\"battles.\\" The statement might be considered a simplified version of the historical events, as the \\"many battles\\" might not accurately describe the nature or number of conflicts. Conclusion: The statement, \\"The Spanish Armada fought many battles against the English,\\" can be considered partially true. The Spanish Armada did engage in conflicts with the English, specifically during the Anglo-Spanish War, but the term \\"many battles\\" might not accurately describe the number or nature of these encounters."},{"question":"For this chain-of-thought reasoning and answer, what was the question?

How much money, in dollars, can the school save by buying the 60 software package instead of the 40 software package? Let's think first. Chain of thought:","response":"Let's break down the problem step by step: 1. Calculate how many devices each package covers: - The 40 software package covers 5 devices. - The 60 software package covers 10 devices. 2. Determine how many packages the school needs to buy to cover 50 devices for each package: - For the 40 package, the school needs to buy 50 devices / 5 devices per package = 10 packages. - For the 60 package, the school needs to buy 50 devices / 10 devices per package = 5 packages. 3. Calculate the total cost for each package: - For the 40 package, the total cost is 10 packages * 40 per package = 400. - For the 60 package, the total cost is 5 packages * 60 per package = 300. 4. Calculate the savings: - The school can save 400 (cost with 40 package) - 300 (cost with 60 package) = 100 by buying the 60 software package instead of the 40 software package.

Where did come from? Question 2: Can I use prime minister picture as my WhatsApp profile picture? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","response":"To answer these questions, I will break down each question into smaller parts, find the required information, and ensure the answer is relevant and well-founded. Question 1: Why is it that people call it DP in FB and WhatsApp instead of profile picture? Where did it come from? Step 1: Understand the meaning of the abbreviation DP. DP stands for Display Picture, which is another term for a profile picture. Step 2: Research the origin and usage of DP. The term DP (Display Picture) became more popular in countries like India and Pakistan during the early days of social media platforms and instant messaging apps. It was commonly used on platforms like Orkut, Yahoo Messenger, BBM, etc. Step 3: Compare the usage of \\"DP\\" and \\"profile picture.\\" While \\"profile picture\\" is the more common term used by platforms like Facebook and WhatsApp, earlier platforms used the term \\"Display Picture\\" or simply \\"DP.\\" The term continues to be used by social media users in some regions as colloquial language. Answer to Question 1: People call it DP (Display Picture) in FB (Facebook) and WhatsApp because the term became popular in the early days of social media platforms and instant messaging apps, particularly in countries like India and Pakistan. The legacy of the term has since been carried forward to more current platforms like Facebook and WhatsApp in those regions. Question 2: Can I use the prime minister's picture as my WhatsApp profile picture? Step 1: Analyze the legality of using the prime minister's picture. There aren't any specific laws against using a prime minister's picture as a profile picture. However, depending on your country, laws around the depiction of public figures and the manner in which their images are used can vary. Step 2: Assess the platform's terms and conditions for profile pictures. WhatsApp's terms of service don't explicitly prohibit using a politician's image as a profile picture. But as a user, you should ensure that the image is not offensive or violating any copyright laws. Step 3: Evaluate potential consequences. Using the prime minister's picture as a profile picture, depending on the context, can lead to misunderstandings and confusion amongst your contacts. Consider the aim of such usage before uploading the image. Answer to Question 2: You can use the prime minister's picture as your WhatsApp profile picture as long as it doesn't violate any laws or platform regulations, such as being offensive or violating copyright laws. Be mindful of the potential implications and consequences, including misunderstandings and confusion. Would the answer to these two questions be the same? No, the answers to these two questions are not the same. While the first question deals with the origin of the term \\"DP\\" and its usage on social media platforms, the second question concerns the legality and implications of using a prime minister's picture as a profile picture on WhatsApp."},{"question":"Write a dialog about anything you want","response":"Timmy: Hey there, Mr. Assistant!

Arriving undetected, the team sweeps the first floors and subdues various criminal tenants; they also temporarily detain an innocent, law-abiding tenant delivering medicine to his sick wife in apartment #726. Continuing undetected to the sixth floor, the team is spotted by a young lookout, who passes on the message to another adolescent lookout just before he is shot dead by Wahyu; but the latter youth raises the alarm. Tama calls down reinforcements and the SWAT team are brutally attacked.

According to the premise, the situation presented is that by the end of the month, there's a possibility of running out of money, hence no more milk can be bought.

Here, the fact that by the end of the month no money may be available to buy milk (premise) doesn't guarantee the truth of the given hypothesis (We never have to worry about money). In fact, the premise suggests financial instability or at least occasional financial difficulties, hence the possibility of not being able to afford basic necessities such as milk by the end of the month. On the other hand, the hypothesis suggests financial stability or abundance, where worrying about money is not a concern.

He tells her that he's received a play called \\"Deathtrap\\" from a former student from a playwriting seminar.

Beyond Reasonable… We find ourselves on the closing page of the chapter – the one where ‘reasonable’ was the key theme. The government & industry had the chance to deal with reasonable people, engage in reasonable debate, discussion and knowledge sharing; without agenda or bias. Instead they chose propaganda, spin, PR, marketing, bribes (they call it sponsorship), sharply tailored reports paid for with industry money and slander and attack on those who questioned their story. The government & industry had the chance to accept the reasoned findings of a local parish, borough and county council, that along with many in the community, said no to fracking. Instead they chose to make those council officers impotent – to deny them a voice as they deny the community ours. They told us this decision was too big for us and that only Westminster could decide what risks would be taken with the health of the children of Lancashire. The government & industry has gambled it all and decided they’re willing to put our children as chips on the table. They are drilling the democracy right out of Lancashire in order to clear the way for this risky business. For those responsible for young ones (I thinks that’s about all of us)… we stand between the frackers and our children and nothing will make us step aside and take this gamble with them. Nothing. So ‘reasonable’ has been exhausted, drained and laid to rest as before us lies a great unknown – the place where the rules of engagement afforded by democracy, are now done with. I can’t find a chapter-guide for this bit. I read a line yesterday that said: “Riot is the language of the unheard.” I wouldn’t have even understood what that could mean just a few years ago. I didn’t know this rage, this obligation, this way. It’s a loose and wild guess but I figure from visiting frack-free groups throughout the UK, that our movement is roughly 80% brand-new to campaigning, activists. People who had not had cause or occasion to object before. People who are all asking themselves, what comes next? What am I able to do? How much can I take? What choices are there? What the hell am I doing…. I had only a modicum of a head start on activism; having gone down to Occupy and learned more over three months than I had my entire life… around the time that fracking was coming very slowly into view in 2011. But what I learned in Tent City University was not about this, about what we currently face – I didn’t find out about fracking till I came home to Blackpool. I learned amazing things about people who became active… and about my self; how wrong I’d been in my assumptions and judgements, how much my fellow humans could inspire me and that there was often more to be heard in a whisper, than a shout. There was realisation too… that there was a door marked activism and once you walked through it… you realised firstly that you’d been in the wrong room all this time and secondly… that there are a lot more doors. So here we all find ourselves on the eve of the next chapter and at the tail end of days of media frenzy. The old traditional media hounded us for opportunities to film and document the ‘moment you find out if they’re going to frack’ – a perverse desire to stare into the eyes of the grieving, the broken, the exhausted – like some side-show. I’ve seen press over the years that allowed itself to frame us as ‘emotional’ ‘scaremongers’ ‘nervous nellies’ ‘luddites’ ‘eco terrorist’ …and now they want to stare into our souls. We’d all have preferred they used the air time to highlight some of the truly key points in the nearly 900 peer-reviewed studies into the risks of shale but that’s not their gig. And while we’re on it, there’s nothing wrong with having emotion – it’s honest. So who are we then… the campaigners? Here in Lancashire I’m with those who struggle to find time but still do even as they dash off to collect children from school, to care for elderly relatives, to manage businesses and families… the campaigners who send apologies to a meeting because they had to give a kidney to a sibling but would be back as quick as possible and another who asked if the next meeting could be held in the Chemo Suite at the hospital as she was key to the plans but booked for cancer treatment… the campaigners who grieved while we marched and campaigned because the one we lost would have been so angry if we hadn’t carried on in her name, the campaigners who like all who do this stuff… are acting from the best of themselves, their obligations. The media this week always asked: What will you do now and will you break the law? For me, I feel I’d need a really lengthy chat about Law before being able to honestly answer. Right now for instance, the Law tells us that challenging this decision can only be limited to a point of law or procedural error – what about outright dishonesty, corruption and bias? Is that not covered by our laws? I’m in court on 19 Oct to face a charge of contempt of court, that for me is actually reflective of my contempt of abuse of justice system by Cuadrilla… there are no laws to help me with moral conviction, there is no box that can be ticked in law and so therefore I am apparently un-lawful. So Law… who the hell does it work for? Those with money are using it as a tool to deter activism in my case and to bypass democracy in our county case. So would I break the law? I want to say that maybe the law deserves a good breaking – but I’m in enough trouble with it. Easier perhaps to say that none wish to be made criminal by this situation or to see it escalate… but we WILL stand in self-defence for our families and communities against what we know to be certain harm. Tomorrow we gather to have a huge discussion about what next. We have had a genuinely reasonable and fair relationship with the local Lancashire police – unique for those of us who experienced Balcombe and Barton Moss as well as London actions. Our local force has been mainly the same faces for 5 years now and they are very aware of our reasonable behaviour as well as our exhaustive lawful attempts to be heard. They know us to be parents, employers, residents… as well as activists and… like our local media, who too have journeyed with us on this heck of a ride, we are all reaching the same milestones. I don’t want any of this to change… but everything WILL change because the government just silenced us and is telling us to act negligently in our responsibilities as parents. I think this next chapter’s key themes may just be Empowerment & Rearranging Hierarchies …whatever happens next will come from the best of people so I have complete faith that we will find our way to defeat what is clearly acting from the worst of itself - government & industry. Namaste x ||||| 1 of 10. Members of the Occupy Wall Street movement march down Wall Street during a protest march through the financial district of New York October 14, 2011. LONDON (Reuters) - For an October revolution, dress warm. That's the word going out - politely - on the Web to rally street protests on Saturday around the globe from New Zealand to Alaska via London, Frankfurt, Washington and, of course, New York, where the past month's Occupy Wall Street movement has inspired a worldwide yell of anger at banks and financiers. How many will show up, let alone stay to camp out to disrupt city centers for days, or months, to come, is anyone's guess. The hundreds at Manhattan's Zuccotti Park were calling for back-up on Friday, fearing imminent eviction. Rome expects tens of thousands at a national protest of more traditional stamp. Few other police forces expect more than a few thousand to turn out on the day for what is billed as an exercise in social media-spread, Arab Spring-inspired, grassroots democracy with an emphasis on peaceful, homespun debate, as seen among Madrid's \\"indignados\\" in June or at the current Wall Street park sit-in. Blogs and Facebook pages devoted to \\"October 15\\" - #O15 on Twitter - abound with exhortations to keep the peace, bring an open mind, a sleeping bag, food and warm clothing; in Britain, \\"Occupy London Stock Exchange\\" is at pains to stress it does not plan to actually, well, occupy the stock exchange. That may turn off those with a taste for the kind of anarchic violence seen in London in August, at anti-capitalism protests of the past decade and at some rallies against spending cuts in Europe this year. But, as Karlin Younger of consultancy Control Risks said: \\"When there's a protest by an organization that's very grassroots, you can't be sure who will show up.\\" Concrete demands are few from those who proclaim \\"We are the 99 percent,\\" other than a general sense that the other 1 percent - the \\"greedy and corrupt\\" rich, and especially banks - should pay more, and that elected governments are not listening. \\"It's time for us to unite; it's time for them to listen; people of the world, rise up!\\" proclaims the Web site United for #GlobalChange. \\"We are not goods in the hands of politicians and bankers who do not represent us ... We will peacefully demonstrate, talk and organize until we make it happen.\\" By doing so peacefully, many hope for a wider political impact, by amplifying the chord their ideas strike with millions of voters in wealthy countries who feel ever more squeezed by the global financial crisis while the rich seem to get richer. \\"ENOUGH IS ENOUGH\\" \\"We have people from all walks of life joining us every day,\\" said Spyro, one of those behind a Facebook page in London which has grown to have some 12,000 followers in a few weeks, enthused by Occupy Wall Street. Some 5,000 have posted that they will turn out, though even some activists expect fewer will. Spyro, a 28-year-old graduate who has a well-paid job and did not want his family name published, summed up the main target of the global protests as \\"the financial system.\\" Angry at taxpayer bailouts of banks since crisis hit in 2008 and at big bonuses still paid to some who work in them while unemployment blights the lives of many young Britons, he said: \\"People all over the world, we are saying 'Enough is enough'.\\" What the remedy would be, Spyro said, was not for him to say but should emerge from public debate - a common theme for those camping out off Wall Street since mid-September, who have stirred up U.S. political debate and, a Reuters poll found, won sympathy from over a third of Americans. A suggestions log posted at 15october.net (\\"This space is ready for YOUR idea for the revolution\\") range from a mass cutting up of credit cards (\\"hit the banks where it counts\\") to \\"use technology to make education free.\\" For all such utopianism, the possibility that peaceful mass action, helped by new technologies, can bring real change has been reinforced by the success of Arab uprisings this year. \\"I've been waiting for this protest for a long time, since 2008,\\" said Daniel Schreiber, 28, an editor in Berlin. \\"I was always wondering why people aren't outraged and why nothing has happened and finally, three years later, it's happening.\\" Quite what is happening, though, is hard to say. The biggest turnouts are expected where local conditions are most acute. Italian police are preparing for tens of thousands to march in Rome against austerity measures planned by the beleaguered government of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. Yet in crisis-ravaged Athens, where big protests have seen violence at times of late, a sense of fatigue and futility may limit numbers on Saturday. In Madrid, where thousands of young \\"indignados,\\" or \\"angry ones,\\" camped out for weeks, many also feel the movement has run out of steam since the summer. Germans, where sympathy for southern Europe's debt troubles is patchy, the financial center of Frankfurt, and the European Central Bank in particular, is expected to be a focus of marches calling by the Spanish-inspired Real Democracy Now movement. Complicating German sentiments, however, a series of small bombs found on trains has stirred memories of the left-wing guerrilla attacks that grew in the 1970s from frustration at a lack of change after the student protests of 1968. CITY OF LONDON British student protests a year ago were marked by some acts of violence by what authorities say were hard-core anarchists. Days of looting in London in August were put down to motives that mingled political discontent with criminal opportunism. As an international center of finance, the City of London is key target. But organizers know strong police powers make setting up a Wall Street-style protest camp there far from easy. \\"There's quite a bit of fatigue setting in,\\" said one young veteran of last year's protests against higher university fees. \\"But if it's still going by Monday or Tuesday, I think that will excite students and they will head down. The City is much more the focus of people's anger now, compared to a year ago.\\" A long Saturday of rallies may start in New Zealand, where the Occupy Auckland Facebook page provides links recommending \\"suitable clothing ... a sleeping bag, a tent, food\\" -- but, in a family-friendly spirit, strictly no drugs or alcohol. Asian authorities and businesses may have less to fear, since most of their economies are still growing strongly. Tracking across the time zones, through towns large and small (\\"Occupy Norwich!\\" reads a website from the picturesque English city), the New York example has also prompted calls for similar occupations in dozens of U.S. cities from Saturday. In Houston, protesters plan to tap into anger at big oil companies. As the world's day ends, hardy souls will be marching in Fairbanks. \\"We will be obeying traffic lights,\\" insist the authors of OccupyAlaska.org, and they \\"will be dressed warm.\\" History suggests such actions are unlikely, of themselves, to change the world. As one anonymous poster at 15october.net writes, \\"Fleshing out ideas into living reality has always been the bugbear of radical politics.\\" And while anger at corporate greed is widespread, there are plenty of voters who would agree with the Australian who posted on the OccupySydney site that those marching will be \\"the lazy, the paranoid, the confused.\\" But some analysts do see a potential for political change. Jeff Madrick, a prominent economics writer, speaks warmly of the serious and reasonable debate he found at Zuccotti Park. Revolutions may be rare, but the protests could push lawmakers to act on some of the demands, he said last week: \\"It may begin to change public opinion enough to give Congress, people in Washington, the courage of their own convictions.\\" ||||| What is a summary?","response":"A summary is a short and simple explanation of a longer piece of information, like a story or an article.

So her basic earnings are: 7.50 per hour × 160 hours = 1200 Step 2: Calculate the commission Kristy sold 25,000 worth of items and earns 16% commission on her sales. Therefore, her commission is: 25,000 × 16% = 4,000 Step 3: Calculate total monthly earnings Now, we'll add her basic earnings and commission to find her total monthly earnings: 1,200 (basic earnings) + 4,000 (commission) = 5,200 Step 4: Calculate the monthly budget Kristy's monthly budget for food, clothing, rent, transportation, bills, and savings is 95% of her total monthly earnings: 5,200 × 95% = 4,940 Step 5: Calculate the insurance allocation Now that we have her monthly budget, we can find out how much she allocates to insurance by getting the remaining 5% of her total monthly earnings: 5,200 × 5% = 260 So, Kristy allocated 260 to insurance this month."},{"question":"Translate \\"Some interesting cases of acceleration due to the force of global gravity are:\\" to Spanish.","response":"Step 1: Identify the key terms and phrases that need translation.

Their manager prostitutes the beautiful Gong-gil to rich customers, and Jang-saeng sickens of this practice. After Gonggil kills the manager in defense of Jang-saeng, the pair flees to Seoul, where they form a new group with three other street performers.Together the group comes up with a skit mocking some members of the Royal Court, including the king and his new concubine Jang Noksu. After they are arrested for treason, Jang-saeng makes a deal with Choseon, who turns out to be one of the King's servants, to either make the king laugh at their skit or to be executed. They perform their skit for the king, but the three minor performers are too terrified to perform well. Gong-gil and Jang-saeng barely save themselves with one last joke at the king, who laughs and then makes them part of his Court. The King falls for the effeminate Gong-gil, whom he calls to his private chambers often to perform finger puppet shows. Jang-saeng becomes jealous of this relationship. Meanwhile, the King becomes more and more unstable. He makes the clowns perform a skit depicting how his mother, the favorite concubine of the former king, was forced to take poison after being betrayed by other jealous concubines. The King then slaughters these concubines at the end of the play. Jangs-aeng asks Gong-gil to leave with him and the gang at once before the King kills them too during one of his homicidal fits.

Welcome to CNN Reset, a new feature revisiting news that's been unforgettable. Here's the latest on video and online. Oklahoma twister. Science calls it an EF5. The people of Moore, Oklahoma, know it as the most powerful category of tornadoes. The twister's destruction was merciless: it struck the Plaza Towers Elementary School, killing seven children there. In all, 24 people perished, including 10 children. The human response to the catastrophe has been powerful too. Locals call it the \\"Oklahoma standard\\" -- \\"persistence and a great positive attitude by the people to never give in,\\" as University of Oklahoma football coach Bob Stoops puts it. Cleveland captivity. It was a horror worthy of Stephen King's imagination: three young women allegedly held captive in a house for roughly 10 years beginning at ages 21, 16 and 14. They were allegedly abducted off the street in a Cleveland neighborhood by the homeowner, Ariel Castro, 52, who's now facing four counts of kidnapping and three counts of rape. Alleged violence and threats made the captive women afraid to seek an escape. But one of the women -- the one who bore a child by Castro -- finally shouted for help after Castro left the house and forgot to lock a big inside door. Neighbors responded. The women and a 6-year-old girl were freed. Now tourists visit the neighborhood. And as the city seeks donations to support the women, it struggles with a dark legacy. Texas explosion. The explosion of a fertilizer plant shook the Earth like an earthquake. In fact, the blast in West, Texas, registered a 2.1 on the Richter scale, and people felt it 50 miles away. The first responders experienced a scene for which no training could ever prepare them: a mushroom-cloud fireball lay waste to 37 blocks, including a nursing home, the local high and middle school, and many houses. Fifteen people -- including 12 first responders -- were killed. Volunteer firefighter Robert Payne was blown out of his boots and knocked senseless. He woke up in intensive care wondering what happened. Now recovering from several injuries, he's thankful he's alive. As the town of 2,800 rebuilds, will it want the fertilizer plant back? The mayor doubts it. Boston Marathon bombings. Among those injured in the Boston Marathon bombings were two brothers. Paul and JP Norden have shared much in life. Now they are together in recovery: Each brother lost a right leg in the attack. As hard as the limb loss was for the brothers, equally difficult was not seeing other each for weeks as they underwent 12 surgeries in all. The siblings finally saw each other about two weeks ago for the first time since the marathon. They want the public to know their uncommon brotherhood is lifting them through an arduous recuperation. London slaying. The British soldier was well-liked by many. He was even a military recruiter and played the drum outside the Royal Palaces on behalf of his regiment, the Fusiliers. But the life of Drummer Lee Rigby, 25, came to a grisly end on a London street at the hands of a man with a meat cleaver and knife. What has shocked the world is how the alleged attacker -- Michael Adebolajo, 28, a British national of Nigerian descent -- made a video of the gory scene and spoke to the camera about the killing, saying it was \\"an eye for an eye\\" and \\"because Muslims are dying daily.\\" A total of five men have been arrested in the slaying. Now far-right activists are calling upon Muslims to leave the country. Capital calamities. The second term of President Barack Obama was supposed to be about immigration reform, gun control and the economy. Instead, it's seemingly been one scandal after another. The Justice Department secretly collected two months of telephone records from the Associated Press. Questions resurfaced about whether the administration downplayed the role of terrorism in the attack against the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya. And the IRS allegedly targeted politically conservative groups. The president says he's angry about it, too.","response":"CNN Reset introduces a new feature revisiting unforgettable news events.

Ned is contacted by Edmund's lawyer about a new will that Racine supposedly drew up on Edmund's behalf, which was witnessed by Mary Ann Simpson. The new will is so poorly prepared it is declared null and void, resulting in Matty inheriting the entire fortune. Matty later admits to Ned that she forged the will.

Total repair cost: 1200 (total labor cost) + 1200 (part cost) = 2400 So, the repairs cost in total 2400."},{"question":"Translate the following.

(D). runs throughout the track zooming back and fourth..","response":"Correct answers: (A). then jumps over a beam and onto a mat. Explanation: In this paragraph, we have a person with a pole running down a track. This is describing an action that could be found in pole vaulting - a sport where the person uses the pole to jump over a high bar and land on a mat. So, the most likely ending for this paragraph is the person doing the actual act of jumping, which is option (A). Now, let's explain why the other options are not correct: (B). This option says that the person uses the pole to slow down. It doesn't make sense for our situation since the main purpose of the pole is to jump, not to slow down. That's not what happens when doing pole vaulting. (C). This option talks about the person looking and speaking to the camera. Although it's possible in real life, this ending doesn't really describe an actual outcome of pole vaulting, which is the action being described in the paragraph. The focus is on the pole and the track, not the camera. (D). This option mentions the person running throughout the track, zooming back and forth. This doesn't match the description of pole vaulting, which is about jumping over a high bar using a pole, not simply running back and forth. So this ending is not correct either."},{"question":"Raúl Alberto Osella (born 8 June 1984 in Morteros) is an Argentine association footballer who currently plays for FC Locarno in Swiss Challenge League.

Options: - cold water - aquarium - tidepools - pacific ocean - boiling water Step-by-step reasoning process below:","response":"1. First, we eliminate the options that would lead to more danger or harm for the crab. Boiling water would be dangerous for the crab, so it would not choose to go there. 2. Cold water could be a potential option for the crab, but it depends on the specific type of crab and the temperature of the water. It's not necessarily a safe option for all crabs. 3. An aquarium could be a safe environment for the crab, as it would be removed from the immediate danger of being eaten and placed in a contained space with food and water. However, this would depend on the availability of an aquarium at the Tokyo fish market. 4. Tide pools could be an option, as they are often a natural habitat for crabs. However, the crab would need to know the location of nearby tide pools and be able to make its way there from the fish market. 5. The Pacific Ocean would be a more natural and wide-ranging habitat for the crab. It might choose to escape to the ocean, where it could find safety among the vast expanse of water and marine life. Based on the given options, the most reasonable choice for the crab to escape to would be the Pacific Ocean. This is because it offers the greatest chance of survival in a natural environment, as opposed to being in a confined space like an aquarium or relying on other potentially unsafe or less familiar options like tide pools or cold water."},{"question":"Zakariya Essabar, a Moroccan citizen, moved to Germany in February 1997 and to Hamburg in 1998, where he studied medical technology. Soon after moving to Hamburg, Essabar met Binalshibh and the others through a Turkish mosque. Essabar turned extremist fairly suddenly, probably in 1999, and reportedly pressured one acquaintance with physical force to become more religious, grow a beard, and compel his wife to convert to Islam. Essabar's parents were said to have made repeated but unsuccessful efforts to sway him from this lifestyle. Shortly before the 9/11 attacks, he would travel to Afghanistan to communicate the date for the attacks to the al Qaeda leadership. Mounir el Motassadeq, another Moroccan, came to Germany in 1993, moving to Hamburg two years later to study electrical engineering at theTechnical University. A witness has recalled Motassadeq saying that he would kill his entire family if his religious beliefs demanded it. One of Motassadeq's roommates recalls him referring to Hitler as a \\"good man\\" and organizing film sessions that included speeches by Bin Laden. Motassadeq would help conceal the Hamburg group's trip to Afghanistan in late 1999. Abdelghani Mzoudi, also a Moroccan, arrived in Germany in the summer of 1993, after completing university courses in physics and chemistry. Mzoudi studied in Dortmund, Bochum, and Muenster before moving to Hamburg in 1995. Mzoudi described himself as a weak Muslim when he was home in Morocco, but much more devout when he was back in Hamburg. In April 1996, Mzoudi and Motassadeq witnessed the execution of Atta's will. During the course of 1999, Atta and his group became ever more extreme and secretive, speaking only in Arabic to conceal the content of their conversations. 87 When the four core members of the Hamburg cell left Germany to journey to Afghanistan late that year, it seems unlikely that they already knew about the planes operation; no evidence connects them to al Qaeda before that time. Witnesses have attested, however, that their pronouncements reflected ample predisposition toward taking some action against the United States. In short, they fit the bill for Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM. Going to Afghanistan The available evidence indicates that in 1999, Atta, Binalshibh, Shehhi, and Jarrah decided to fight in Chechnya against the Russians.

The most significant of these 13th-century prose romances was the Vulgate Cycle (also known as the Lancelot-Grail Cycle), a series of five Middle French prose works written in the first half of that century. These works were the Estoire del Saint Grail, the Estoire de Merlin, the Lancelot propre (or Prose Lancelot, which made up half the entire Vulgate Cycle on its own), the Queste del Saint Graal and the Mort Artu, which combine to form the first coherent version of the entire Arthurian legend. The cycle continued the trend towards reducing the role played by Arthur in his own legend, partly through the introduction of the character of Galahad and an expansion of the role of Merlin. It also made Mordred the result of an incestuous relationship between Arthur and his sister Morgause and established the role of Camelot, first mentioned in passing in Chrétien's Lancelot, as Arthur's primary court. This series of texts was quickly followed by the Post-Vulgate Cycle (c. 1230–40), of which the Suite du Merlin is a part, which greatly reduced the importance of Lancelot's affair with Guinevere but continued to sideline Arthur, and to focus more on the Grail quest. As such, Arthur became even more of a relatively minor character in these French prose romances; in the Vulgate itself he only figures significantly in the Estoire de Merlin and the Mort Artu. During this period, Arthur was made one of the Nine Worthies, a group of three pagan, three Jewish and three Christian exemplars of chivalry. The Worthies were first listed in Jacques de Longuyon's Voeux du Paon in 1312, and subsequently became a common subject in literature and art. contains an answer for the question: What are the two names for the Middle French prose work that made up half of the entire Lancelot-Grail Cycle?, what is it ? Answer:","response":"The two names for the Middle French prose work that made up half of the entire Lancelot-Grail Cycle are the Lancelot propre and the Prose Lancelot."},{"question":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Long before that time there had come a reaction in his favour. The new consuls were well disposed towards him; Clodius's insolence had already disgusted Pompey; Caesar was absent with his legions in Gaul; his own friends, who had all along been active in his favour (though in his querulous mood he accused them of apathy) took advantage of the change, his generous rival Hortensius being amongst the most active; and all the frantic violence of Clodius and his party served only to delay for a while the return which they could not prevent. A motion for his recall was carried at last by an immense majority. Cicero had one remarkable ally on that occasion. On one of the days when the Senate was known to be discussing his recall, the 'Andromache' of Ennius was being played in the theatre. The popular actor Esop, whose name has come down to us in conjunction with that of Roscius, was playing the principal character. The great orator had been his pupil, and was evidently regarded by him as a personal friend.

This can be achieved by using the lowest brightness setting while increasing the exposure. To begin with, the brightness setting on your device affects the visibility of the captured image or video. A lower brightness will yield a darker image, whereas a higher brightness results in more vivid colors and more light. However, higher brightness can also lead to washed-out colors and loss of detail due to overexposure. On the other hand, exposure is the duration of time the camera's sensor is exposed to light, as well as the amount of light gathered in that time period. Increasing the exposure will allow more light to reach the sensor, which can be beneficial when capturing images in dimly lit environments or situations where the subject is poorly lit. Proper exposure is crucial for obtaining an image with well-balanced colors and good contrast between the light and dark areas of the scene. In some situations, it might be advantageous to lower the brightness and increase the exposure to obtain the best results. For example, when capturing a scene with high contrast, such as a sunset or a brightly lit stage on a dark night, using a combination of low brightness and increased exposure will allow you to achieve a balance between the brightest and darkest areas of the scene. This results in a more detailed and visually pleasing image, as the shadows and highlights retain their respective details, and the colors appear more true-to-life—neither too dark nor blown out. To achieve the perfect balance of brightness and exposure, you can follow these steps: 1. Access the camera settings on your device. Most smartphones and cameras have manual controls that allow you to tweak various settings, including brightness and exposure. 2. Lower the brightness setting on your device. This will help to prevent overexposed or washed-out images due to excessive lighting. 3. Increase the exposure time. Find the optimal exposure setting that will allow you to capture the scene with the right balance of light and shadows. Keep in mind that increasing the exposure time might result in motion blur if your subject is moving or if the camera is not steady. Using a tripod or a stable surface is recommended in such cases. 4. Adjust the ISO sensitivity if needed. Along with brightness and exposure settings, you may also need to experiment with the ISO sensitivity of your device to adjust the decision-making process of your device's sensor while taking in more or less light. 5. Take a test shot and assess the results. You may need to make a series of minor adjustments until you achieve your desired image quality. Be patient and experiment with different settings to see which combination works best for the particular scene you are capturing. In conclusion, the combination of the lowest brightness setting along with increased exposure can help you capture images and videos with a more balanced and detailed appearance. Carefully adjusting these settings will enable you to take advantage of all the nuances in the scene and produce an image that reflects the desired level of detail, contrast, and vibrancy."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Given the following context: The seabed contains enormous reserves of minerals which can be exploited by dredging. This has advantages over land-based mining in that equipment can be built at specialised shipyards and infrastructure costs are lower. Disadvantages include problems caused by waves and tides, the tendency for excavations to silt up and the washing away of spoil heaps. There is a risk of coastal erosion and environmental damage. Seafloor massive sulphide deposits are potential sources of silver, gold, copper, lead and zinc and trace metals since their discovery in the 1960s. They form when geothermally heated water is emitted from deep sea hydrothermal vents known as \\"black smokers\\". The ores are of high quality but prohibitively costly to extract. Small scale mining of the deep sea floor is being developed off the coast of Papua New Guinea using robotic techniques, but the obstacles are formidable.There are large deposits of petroleum, as oil and natural gas, in rocks beneath the seabed. Offshore platforms and drilling rigs extract the oil or gas and store it for transport to land. Offshore oil and gas production can be difficult due to the remote, harsh environment. Drilling for oil in the sea has environmental impacts. Animals may be disorientated by seismic waves used to locate deposits, probably causing the beaching of whales. Toxic substances such as mercury, lead and arsenic may be released. The infrastructure may cause damage, and oil may be spilt.Large quantities of methane clathrate exist on the seabed and in ocean sediment at a temperature of around 2 °C (36 °F) and these are of interest as a potential energy source.

A month-long clinical trial shows a once-daily male pill is safe and effective at suppressing the hormones needed for sperm production, and has no negative effect on sex drive, according to researchers who presented their findings Sunday at the Endocrine Society's annual conference in Chicago, per the Telegraph. The hormone pill, dimethandrolone undecanoate (DMAU), overcomes issues that plagued earlier versions of the male contraceptive. In addition to concerns about how low testosterone would affect sex drive, researchers feared the pill would need to be taken twice daily, given the speed that hormones clear the male body, reports the Guardian. DMAU, however, contains fatty acid undecanoate which is believed to slow the clearance. Some 100 men aged 18 to 50 received a placebo or varying doses (100mg, 200mg, or 400mg) of the pill, which contains an androgen and a progestin and must be taken with food. After 28 days, all pill-popping patients saw low testosterone levels, while patients given the 400mg dose saw a \\"marked suppression\\" in testosterone and two other hormones needed for sperm production, reports the Telegraph. Patients also saw mild weight gain and a slight drop in HDL or \\"good cholesterol\\" levels, per NBC News. But \\"very few subjects reported symptoms consistent with testosterone deficiency or excess,\\" and liver and kidney function remained healthy, senior researcher Stephanie Page says in a release. \\"These promising results are unprecedented in the development of a prototype male pill.\\" Research will now focus on effects over longer periods. (Another male pill might leave hormones alone.)","response":"Once upon a time, in a science lab far away, some smart researchers wanted to help men share the responsibility of having babies. They thought, \\"Why should women be the only ones to take a pill?\\" So they worked very hard and discovered a new kind of pill that men can take to help them control when they want to have a baby. This magic pill is called DMAU. It's a really special pill because it doesn't have some of the problems that made the other pills not work well. The researchers wanted to make sure DMAU wouldn't make men feel less like themselves or have to take it many times a day, so they figured out how to make it last longer and not change their feelings. They shared their exciting discoveries in a big city called Chicago, where lots of other smart people were learning new things too. They told everyone how they had a group of 100 men try the pill and how it made their special baby-making hormones go on a little vacation. Some of the men gained a little bit of weight and had a tiny change in their blood that helps their hearts, but overall they felt just fine. The researchers even noticed that their bodies still worked well inside. Now, the scientists want to keep learning about this magic pill and how it can be a big helper for men and women who want to decide when to have a baby. They will keep testing the pill to make sure it works and is safe in the long run.

The whole world felt sorry about the death of Mandela, a great man of history. Mandela is mostly remembered for his efforts to end apartheid in South Africa. Mandela was born in 1918. In South Africa, there are both black and white people. But at that time, Black people couldn't live or travel where they wanted. They didn't have the right to vote, either. Mandela didn't think that was right. He organized many activities against it, but he was sent to prison for 27 years. Under international pressure, the government set Mandela free in 1990. Great changes in the law began to end apartheid. At that time, Mandela chose to forgive his enemies. He shook hands with the people who wanted him dead. He also encouraged black people to forgive the whites. Because of his forgiveness, Mandela is remembered as a moral model by the whole world. In1993,Mandela won the Nobel Peace Prize. A year later, he became the first black president of South Africa. Both black people and white people voted. Apartheid ended. In 1999, Mandela left office at the highest point of his power.

Options: A: a president B: a leader C: a moral model D: an officer Answer:","response":"C: a moral model"},{"question":"Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: Harvard student Julie Zauzmer turned 20 on January 22, and her birthday couldn't have been better: She got to working the overnight shift at the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter. That might seem an extraordinary act of selflessness for someone turning 20. But there's increasing evidence that commitment to community service is becoming much more ordinary to today's young adults. \\"Young adults are doing more volunteer service than in any point in history,'' said Scott Seider, an assistant professor of education at Boston University who studies the civic development of young adults. At Harvard, the Winthrop Street Homeless Shelter is one of 86 social service programs associated with the Phillips Brooks House Association, which is a student-run nonprofit organization. Students can work with deaf children, bring pets to nursing homes, and prepare Chinese students to become US citizens, and so on. Volunteerism develops well outside of colleges, too. Applications to AmeriCorps have risen to a very high level, jumping from 91,399 in 2008 to 258,829 in 2010. City Year, which puts young people in high-poverty schools as tutors and mentors for at-risk students, has had a 140 percent increase in applications since its 2007-2008 service year. Citizen Schools, which uses volunteers to work with students in middle schools, has had a 28 percent jump in applicants between 2008 and 2009. \\"Most of my friends know it's their duty to give back before they settle down,'' said Samantha Wolf, a 23-year-old Boston University graduate serving with City Year in a Mattapan school.

McDade want to make a National Historic Site?, using the article: When Scranton agreed to take on Steamtown, U.S.A., it was estimated that the museum and excursion business would attract 200,000 to 400,000 visitors to the city every year. In anticipation of this economic boon, the city and a private developer spent 13 million to renovate the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad (DL&W) station and transform it into a Hilton hotel, at a time when the unemployment rate in the city was 13 percent. Only 60,000 visitors showed up at Steamtown in 1987, and the 1988 excursions were canceled. After only three years, it was 2.2 million in debt and facing bankruptcy. Part of the problem was the cost of restoration of the new property and the deteriorating equipment. In addition, while the tourists in Vermont had enjoyed the sights of cornfields, farms, covered bridges, a waterfall and a gorge on a Steamtown excursion, the Scranton trip to Moscow, Pennsylvania, cut through one of the nation's largest junkyards, an eyesore described by Ralph Nader as \\"the eighth wonder of the world\\".In 1986, the U.S. House of Representatives, under the urging of Scranton native, Representative Joseph M. McDade, voted to approve the spending of 8 million to study the collection and to begin the process of making it a National Historic Site. By 1995, Steamtown was acquired and developed by the National Park Service (NPS) at a total cost of 66 million, and opened as Steamtown National Historic Site the same year. In preparation for its acquisition of the collection, the NPS had conducted historical research during 1987 and 1988 on the equipment that still remained in the foundation's possession. This research was used for a Scope of Collections Statement for Steamtown National Historic Site and was published in 1991 under the title Steamtown Special History Study.

OPTIONS: (a). Use the top of a full glass and press into dough.. (b). Use the top of an empty glass and press into dough..","response":"To determine the better solution, we need to analyze the practicality of each option. Step 1: Understand the problem The goal is to shape the dough into a circle, which could be important in baking applications or for creating symmetrical pieces. Step 2: Analyze the options Option (a): Using the top of a full glass and pressing it into the dough. - The glass will have a solid surface to press the dough. - The added weight from the liquid inside the glass may provide more stability and precision. - However, the liquid might spill during the process, causing a mess and possible contamination of the dough. Option (b): Using the top of an empty glass and pressing it into the dough. - The glass will still have a solid surface to press the dough. - There is no risk of liquid spilling, which eliminates potential mess and contamination. - Less stability and precision due to reduced weight, but it is still possible to control the pressure applied manually. Step 3: Compare the options, highlighting positives and negatives. Option (a) has the potential advantage of more stability and precision due to the added weight from the liquid inside the glass. However, it carries the risk of spilling the liquid and contaminating the dough or creating a mess. Option (b) eliminates the risk of spills and still allows users to make circular shapes in the dough. The only potential disadvantage is having less stability and precision due to reduced weight. Step 4: Choose the better option Given the considerations, Option (b) - using the top of an empty glass and pressing it into the dough - appears to be the better solution. While it may not offer the same stability and precision as Option (a), it eliminates the risk of spills and contamination, which could negatively impact the final product. Additionally, users can still control the pressure applied manually for more precision, making it a more practical and safer choice."},{"question":"Jason is hiring two construction workers, one electrician and one plumber.

Thoughts? Step-by-step reasoning:","response":"To find the overall labor costs for one day, let's break it down step by step. 1. Find the daily salary of each construction worker: There are two construction workers, and each worker makes 100/day. So, for two workers, you would pay: 100 * 2 = 200/day 2. Find the daily salary of the electrician: The electrician makes double what a worker is paid. A worker's daily salary is 100, so the electrician's daily salary is: 100 * 2 = 200/day 3. Find the daily salary of the plumber: The plumber makes 250% of a worker's salary. First, calculate 250% of 100: (250/100) * 100 = 250/day 4. Calculate the overall labor costs for one day by adding the daily salaries of all the workers: Construction workers: 200 Electrician: 200 Plumber: 250 Total labor cost = 200 + 200 + 250 = 650/day So, the overall labor costs for one day would be 650."},{"question":"Given the question: Choose between \\"walking away from beach\\" and \\"walking on beach\\".

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. A:","response":"No, the provided answer does not directly explain how hydrogen fuel for cars work, but rather discusses the drawbacks of hydrogen use. Let me explain how hydrogen fuel for cars work step-by-step: 1. Hydrogen fuel cells: Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles use a fuel cell that combines hydrogen with oxygen from the air to produce electricity. This electricity powers the electric motor, which drives the vehicle. 2. Hydrogen storage: Hydrogen is stored in high-pressure tanks within the vehicle, typically at pressures of around 700 bar (10,000 psi). 3. Hydrogen refueling: To refuel, a driver connects a specialized nozzle from a hydrogen fueling station to the vehicle's fueling port. The station pumps pressurized hydrogen into the vehicle's storage tank. 4. Fuel cell reaction: Inside the hydrogen fuel cell, hydrogen is passed over a catalyst (usually made out of platinum), causing the hydrogen molecules to split into protons and electrons. 5. Electricity generation: The protons pass through a membrane, while the electrons are forced to travel around an external circuit, creating an electric current that is used to power the vehicle's electric motor. 6. Combining with oxygen: As the electrons complete their circuit, they recombine with protons and oxygen from the air on the other side of the membrane, forming water as a byproduct. 7. Water emission: The water produced in the reaction is the only emission from the vehicle, making it a zero-emission vehicle.

She is best known for her role as \\"Mammy\\" in Gone with the Wind (1939), for which she won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, the first Academy Award won by an African American entertainer. In addition to acting in many films, McDaniel was a radio performer and television star; she was the first black woman to sing on radio in the United States. She appeared in over 300 films, although she received screen credits for only 80 or so. The whereabouts of McDaniel's Oscar are currently unknown. In 1992, Jet magazine reported that Howard University could not find it and alleged that it had disappeared during protests in the 1960s. In 1998, Howard University stated that it could find no written record of the Oscar having arrived at Howard. In 2007, an article in the Huffington Post repeated rumors that the Oscar had been cast into the Potomac River by angry civil rights protesters in the 1960s. The assertion reappeared in the Huffington Post under the same byline in 2009. In 2010, Mo'Nique, the winner of the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, wearing a blue dress and gardenias in her hair, as McDaniel had at the ceremony in 1940, in her acceptance speech thanked McDaniel \\"for enduring all that she had to so that I would not have to\\". Her speech revived interest in the whereabouts of McDaniel's plaque. In 2011, J. Freedom duLac reported in the Washington Post that the plaque had disappeared in the 1960s. In November 2011, W. B. Carter, of the George Washington University Law School, published the results of her year-and-a-half-long investigation into the Oscar's fate. Carter rejected claims that students had stolen the Oscar (and thrown it in the Potomac River) as wild speculation or fabrication that traded on long-perpetuated stereotypes of blacks. She questioned the sourcing of the Huffington Post stories. Instead, she argued that the Oscar was likely returned to Howard University's Channing Pollack Theater Collection between the spring of 1971 and the summer of 1973 or had possibly been boxed and stored in the drama department at that time. The reason for its removal, she argued, was not civil rights unrest but rather efforts to make room for a new generation of black performers. If neither the Oscar nor any paper trail of its ultimate destiny can be found at Howard today, she suggested, inadequate storage or record-keeping in a time of financial constraints and national turbulence may be blamed. She also suggested that a new generation of caretakers may have failed to realize the historic significance of the 5 1/2\\" x 6\\" plaque. Ask a question about this article.","response":"Hattie McDaniel was an African-American stage actress, professional singer-songwriter, and comedian, best known for her role as \\"Mammy\\" in Gone with the Wind, for which she won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. This notable win marked the first Academy Award claimed by an African American entertainer. McDaniel broke many barriers, having not only appeared in over 300 films, earning screen credits in around 80, but also as the first black woman to perform on American radio. Despite her immense accomplishments, the whereabouts of McDaniel's Oscar remains a mystery. Various rumors started circulating in the mid-nineties about the Oscar's disappearance, with allegations that the prestigious award had vanished during 1960's protests. However, it wasn't until Mo'Nique's heartfelt 2010 Academy Awards speech thanking McDaniel for her endurance and trailblazing spirit that widespread interest in the missing award was revived. There isn't a definitive answer as to where the Oscar currently resides. In 2011, W.B. Carter of George Washington University Law School presented the results of her lengthy investigation into the Oscar's fate. Carter's research discredits the common rumor that the Oscar was stolen and thrown into the Potomac River during a civil rights protest sparked by racial tensions. Instead, Carter suggests a far more mundane outcome. She postulates that the Oscar was likely either returned to Howard University's Channing Pollack Theater Collection somewhere between 1971 and 1973 or it was boxed for storage. The removal, Carter argues, was not due to civil unrest but an effort to make space for the upcoming generation of black performers. Lack of documentation regarding its relocation may be attributed to poor record-keeping and less-than-ideal storage conditions during an era fraught with financial and national turbulence. Carter also suggests that a new generation of caretakers may not have grasped the historical value of the 5 1/2\\" x 6\\" plaque. Despite the inconclusive fate of McDaniel's Oscar, the transformative change she started within the entertainment industry is undeniable.

Political Editor. PUBLISHED:. 10:40 EST, 6 November 2013. |. UPDATED:. 10:55 EST, 6 November 2013. Democrats in New Jersey outnumber Republicans by 700,000. But Chris Christie, the state's swaggering GOP governor, won re-election easily on Tuesday night in what was certainly a preview of his presidential aspirations. 'I know that if we can do this in Trenton, New Jersey,' Christie told supporters after his landslide victory, 'then maybe the folks in Washington, D.C., should tune in their TVs right now and see how it’s done.' Christie, a political moderate in every way, prevailed by a wide margin in a year when establishment Republicans have been steamrolled in public by tea party partisans. His success came via voting blocs that have traditionally been in Democrats' corner, giving GOP insiders hope that President Barack Obama's two victories might be historical anomalies rather than trends in the making. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO. Two terms: Christie hasn't pledged to serve out his second term as New Jersey's governor, leaving the door open for a 2016 presidential run. Studying up for the electoral college: Chris Christie is perfectly positioned to enter the presidential race as a moderate who can appeal to both Republicans and Democrats. Everybody loves you now: Christie won a landslide victory over Democrat Barbara Buono, cementing his bipartisan appeal and making him a virtual shoo-in for presidential favorite status in the GOP. 'We’ll be led back by our governors, and Chris Christie is now at the forefront of that resurgence,' former Republican National Committee chairman Ed Gillespie told The New York Times on Wednesday. 'He’s proved that a conservative Republican can get votes from Hispanics and African-Americans, that a pro-life governor can get votes from women. This means that those voters are available to us, that we’re not shut out demographically or geographically – that it’s worth the effort.' The larger-than-life Christie already casts a nation-sized shadow, but his national profile is set to grow even bigger this month when he takes over the leadership of the Republican Governors Association. That position affords him some control over which state-level candidates the party's machine will endorse and financially support state candidates the party will support – giving him key leverage in advance of the 2016 presidential cycle. And in order to store up favors, Christie is hitting the road. Man of the hour: Christie is poised to raise his profile even more as he takes over leadership of the Republican Governors Association while running New Jersey and entering the 2016 presidential fray. Born in the USA: The Bruce Springsteen-loving governor cast his ballot on Tuesday amid speculation that his world-beating poll numbers, his no-nonsense style and his universal appeal would make him a White House shoo-in. Larger than life but smaller than before: Christie's hirsute form has shrunk in the last eight months following lap-band surgery to control his weight. Shedding pounds will also make him a more appealing White House hopeful. Christie said Wednesday that he would be popping into 'places like Ohio and Michigan and Florida,' states with both contentious gubernatorial races and key electoral votes for the next presidential victor. Observers expect Christie to support moderate candidates at the expense of tea party stalwarts. A GOP strategist told MailOnline on Wednesday that the tea party surge still has momentum at the state level, but 'the future of presidential politics belongs to the party's centrists.' 'Reading the tea leaves,' he said, 'it seems that 2016 is Christie's for the taking, and that's good news for Republicans. Tea party be damned, the next GOP presidential primary season will be the anti-2012. And Christie's not going to be a milquetoast-y centrist like Mitt Romney. He's as bold as Ted Cruz but as universally appealing as Bill Clinton.' 'This is a guy who has shown that a moderate in a blue state can sweep aside left-wing opponents by the sheer force of his personality. If we could just clone him a dozen times, we'd keep the White House until the second coming.' What are highlight points for this article?","response":"This article talks about a man named Chris Christie, who was the governor of New Jersey in the United States. People were excited about him because he won an important election, even though New Jersey had more people who were Democrats than Republicans, and he was a Republican.

They thought Chris Christie could get people from both parties, Republicans and Democrats, to like him and vote for him, which is important for winning big elections."},{"question":"Answer the following question: I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

Lyla and Louis meet at a party after their respective concerts, and sleep together on the rooftop under a full moon, to the music of a street performer below. The day after, they separate in a hurry, and are unable to maintain contact as Lyla is ushered away by her father to Chicago. Later, Lyla realizes she is pregnant, and after an argument with her father, she is struck by a car. Due to the accident trauma, she gives birth prematurely, and her father secretly puts the baby boy up for adoption, allowing her to believe that her son died. Eleven years later, Evan Taylor (Freddie Highmore) is living in a boys' orphanage outside New York City, where he meets Richard Jeffries (Terrence Howard), a social worker with Child and Family Services. Evan has the savant-like ability to hear music wherever he is, making him a bullying target for the older orphans. Convinced that his parents will find him, Evan runs away to New York City, \\"following the music\\" in the hope it will lead him to his family. He finds a boy named Arthur (Leon Thomas III) performing in Washington Square Park. Louis, who left the band the same night Lyla was struck, now lives in San Francisco as an agent, while Lyla has also given up performing and now lives in Chicago teaching music. Louis reconnects with his brothers at a birthday party for one of the other band members, and after an argument and fistfight over breaking up the band, he decides to reconnect with the woman he now knows is Lyla. Lyla is called to her father's deathbed, where he confesses that her son is alive and in New York. Lyla abandons her father to his fate and heads to New York to look for him. Evan follows Arthur to his home in a condemned theater, and is taken in by Maxwell \\"Wizard\\" Wallace (Robin Williams), a vagrant musician... My question: Who believes he hears music from his parents? Answer:","response":"Evan Taylor (Freddie Highmore) is the character who believes he hears music from his parents. Evan has a savant-like ability to hear music wherever he is, and this extraordinary talent serves as a driving force in his life. It fuels his belief that his parents will find him, and ultimately leads him on a journey to New York City in hopes that the music will guide him to his family. Throughout the film, Evan's unique connection to music, his unwavering faith, and his strong desire to be reunited with his parents are key elements that shape his character and the story."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Lee received every threat that was sent to him from his stalker. Given the context: What does Lee need to do after this? Possible answers: go to the police, ignore the threat, meet his stalker Answer:","response":"Lee needs to go to the police. Step 1: Assess the situation - Lee has received multiple threats from a stalker, which indicates that this is not an isolated incident and may pose a potential danger to his safety. Step 2: Consider the responsible option - Going to the police is the most responsible option, as it allows Lee to report the threats and potentially receive protection or assistance in dealing with the stalker. Step 3: Evaluate the other options - Ignoring the threat might allow the stalker to escalate the situation or harm Lee, and meeting the stalker could be extremely risky as it may potentially put Lee in direct physical danger. Step 4: Make a decision - Given the steps above, it is clear that the best course of action for Lee in this context would be to go to the police. They have the authority and resources to intervene and help ensure Lee's safety."},{"question":"In the Mexico City airport, the government engaged in an extensive restructuring program that includes the addition of a new second terminal, which began operations in 2007, and the enlargement of four other airports (at the nearby cities of Toluca, Querétaro, Puebla and Cuernavaca) that, along with Mexico City's airport, comprise the Grupo Aeroportuario del Valle de México, distributing traffic to different regions in Mexico.

Gather materials: Ensure you have all necessary materials and tools readily available. These will typically include: - Styrofoam sheets or pieces (recycled or new) - A planter of appropriate size - Ruler or measuring tape - Pencil or marker - Utility knife or saw (for cutting the styrofoam) - Optional: landscape fabric or mesh for drainage 2. Clean the planter: Before starting, ensure the planter is clean and free of any debris or residue from previous plants. This will prevent the spread of bacteria or plant diseases to your new plant. 3. Assess the planter's drainage needs: Check the planter for drainage holes at the bottom. If none exist, consider drilling a few small holes to ensure excess water can escape and prevent root rot. 4. Measure the planter's interior dimensions: Using a ruler or measuring tape, measure the length, width, and depth of the planter's interior. Accurate measurements will ensure a snug fit for the styrofoam. 5. Mark and cut the styrofoam: With the measurements in hand, mark the dimensions onto the styrofoam sheet or pieces with a pencil or marker. Use a straight edge or ruler to help draw straight lines. Then, use a utility knife or saw to carefully cut along the marked lines. Make sure the blade is sharp enough to ensure clean cuts; dull blades may cause the styrofoam to crumble or break unevenly. 6. Test the fit of the styrofoam: Place the cut styrofoam into the planter to ensure a proper fit. It should sit snugly in the bottom of the container, covering the entire base. If necessary, trim any excess styrofoam to achieve the desired fit. 7. Optional - Drainage layer: If preferred, you can place a layer of landscape fabric or mesh on top of the styrofoam to provide an additional barrier for drainage purposes. This is particularly helpful in planters without drainage holes, as it prevents soil from seeping through the styrofoam and clogging the planter. 8. Add soil and plants: Once the styrofoam is correctly positioned, fill the planter with an appropriate potting soil or growing medium, leaving enough space at the top for your desired plants. When adding plants, take care not to damage their root systems or cram them into tight spaces. Arrange the plants according to the desired design, taking into account their specific light and watering needs. 9. Proper care: Be mindful of the fact that styrofoam has insulating properties, which can affect the temperature and moisture levels in the planter. Adjust your watering schedule and monitor your plants to ensure they receive consistent and adequate care. 10. Periodic Inspection: Periodically inspect your planter to ensure there is no damage to the styrofoam or signs of root rot due to poor drainage. When necessary, replace the styrofoam to maintain proper functioning. By following these steps, you will successfully place styrofoam into the bottom of a planter to help with drainage, insulation, and maintaining a healthy plant environment."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Read the bio below and try to give details on yuri burago 's: - doctoral students - caption - fields - workplaces - doctoral advisor - birth date - name - image size - image - alma mater Bio: yuri dmitrievich burago -lrb- -rrb- -lrb- born 1936 -rrb- is a russian mathematician . he works in differential and convex geometry .

There's nothing like the presence of some Nazis to ruin a perfectly good party. On Tuesday night, the comedian Russell Brand was thrown out of GQ magazine’s Men of the Year Awards after-show for making jibes about the event’s sponsor, Hugo Boss, and the fashion company’s historic links to the Nazi party. While on stage, Brand told the gathered celebrities and politicians, ‘If anyone knows a bit about history and fashion, you know it was Hugo Boss who made uniforms for the Nazis.’ He then added, with less than subtle irony, ‘But they looked f***ing fantastic, let’s face it, while they were killing people on the basis of their religion and sexuality.’ But the connection between Hugo Boss and the","response":"Nazi party is not a new revelation. The German fashion brand's founder, Hugo Ferdinand Boss, publicly acknowledged the company's role in producing uniforms for the SS, SA, and Hitler Youth during World War II. Since then, the company has made efforts to distance itself from this dark chapter in its history, including compensating victims of forced labor and supporting projects that promote understanding and tolerance. As for the GQ Men of the Year Awards, the event organizers did not take kindly to Brand's comments. They promptly escorted him out of the after-show party, citing his unsuitable remarks about the event's sponsor as the reason for his removal. In light of this incident, GQ magazine and Hugo Boss may face increased scrutiny over their partnership and will likely have to address Brand's controversial comments. They may issue a joint statement condemning the Nazis' actions and reaffirming their commitment to promoting diversity and inclusion in all aspects of their businesses. Additionally, they might consider donating to related charities and organizations in an effort to further distance themselves from this historical association. Overall, it is important to remember that while history cannot be changed, people and corporations can learn from it and grow. As for Russell Brand, he may face some backlash for his provocative statement, but ultimately, it has sparked a conversation about the fashion industry's past and how it can forge a more responsible and inclusive future."},{"question":"Translate the following sentence to Turkish: Hundreds of heads of state and government and religious leaders are expected to gather in St Peter's Square for the funeral.

Context: Jesse had a bump on his leg and it wasn't going away. Jesse got it checked out to be sure. Question: What does Jesse need to do before this? Here, \\"this\\" refers to Jesse getting his leg checked out to be sure. Thus, the question is asking about the step that Jesse must take before seeking a medical professional's help. Now, let's evaluate the given answer choices: A: Get the doctor to lance the lump. This option doesn't fit the question, as lancing the lump would be an action taken by the doctor after Jesse has already sought medical help. The question is asking about the step that Jesse must take before seeing a doctor. B: Get the results from the doctor. This answer also doesn't fit the question because receiving results would occur after seeking medical help. Again, the question asks about the step Jesse must take before seeing a doctor. C: Needed to get a bump. This answer choice suggests that Jesse needs to acquire a bump. However, the context clearly states that Jesse already has a bump on his leg, so this option doesn't make sense. Since none of the provided answers (A, B, or C) accurately answer the question according to the context, it's necessary to create a more suitable answer. A better answer would be: D: Notice the bump on his leg and monitor its persistence. Before seeking medical help for the bump on his leg, Jesse would need to observe the bump and determine that it isn't going away. This awareness and self-monitoring process would be the needed step before choosing to get it checked out by a doctor.

What are some examples of situational ethics? Choose your answer. Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? Possible answers: A). no B). yes","response":"B). yes Both questions ask for examples of situational ethics, which refers to a moral philosophy that considers the specific context of a situation when determining the right course of action. This approach emphasizes the unique variables and consequences of each situation, rather than relying on a set of fixed moral rules or laws. Here are a few examples of situational ethics: 1. Saving a life over following the law Suppose you're a doctor who's treating a critically ill patient, but the most effective medicine is not yet approved by the regulatory authorities. In this case, situational ethics might encourage you to administer the unapproved medicine to save the patient's life, even if it goes against the law or professional guidelines. 2. Lying for a greater good Imagine a scenario where a friend confides in you that they're escaping an abusive relationship and asks for your help. Later on, the abusive partner comes looking for your friend and asks you about their whereabouts. Situational ethics would support lying about your friend's location to protect them from harm, even though dishonesty is typically considered morally wrong. 3. Prioritizing the needs of a group In a workplace or organizational setting, situational ethics could involve selecting a course of action that benefits the majority, even if it comes at the expense of a few individuals. For example, a manager might need to lay off a small number of employees in order to save the company and secure the jobs of many others. 4. Breaking a promise to help someone in need If you've promised to meet a friend for dinner, but on the way, you come across a person who has been in an accident and requires urgent assistance. You might decide to break your promise and help the injured person, even though this goes against the principle of keeping one's word. 5. Engaging in civil disobedience There may be times when a government's actions are considered morally unjust, and citizens feel compelled to engage in civil disobedience or non-violent protest. In such cases, situational ethics might support breaking established laws or norms in order to fight for justice and the greater good. In all these examples, situational ethics involves making moral decisions based on the specific circumstances at hand, rather than adhering to pre-established moral codes or principles. This approach enables individuals to navigate complex, real-world dilemmas with a greater emphasis on compassion, empathy, and practical consequences."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: At the home of John Rutka and Eddie Santin, Rutka is apparently shot.

Santin identifies three upcoming targets: Slinger, children's show host Ronnie Linklater, and an unidentified man. Strachey finds a torn-off mudflap and initials for three persons Rutkin paid off. Strachey tracks the first two to local hotel owners who spied on their guests for Rutka. They reveal that Slinger was sexually connected to Linklater and that Linklater had weekly sex with another man who possibly accidentally died. Strachey traces a license plate to Art Murphy, a used car dealer, who refuses to cooperate. The man who visited Rutka's hospital room attacks Callahan at their home. Strachey arrives in time to drive him away, but Callahan is hospitalized. The experience shakes Strachey enough to consider abandoning the case until Callahan, who has had a change of heart about Rutka, convinces him to continue.

A one-year-old baby died in Upstate New York on Tuesday after it ingested liquid nicotine, the chemical used in the popular e-cigarettes. The baby died at its home in Fort Plains on Tuesday and when it was found unresponsive it was taken to the hospital and pronounced dead. ABC reports that police say the death was a 'tragic accident' and that no foul play was involved. Dangerous: Liquid nicotine that could have been for an e-cigarette killed a one-year-old in Upstate New York who ingested the dangerous chemical. It's unclear as to whether or not the liquid was for an e-cigarette but officials expressed their concern about similar accidents happening to children of e-cigarette smokers in the future. 'One teaspoon of liquid nicotine could be lethal to a child, and smaller amounts can cause severe illness, often requiring trips to the emergency department,' the American Association of Poison Control centers in a statement yesterday. They also states that even though liquid nicotine is dangerous for children there are currently no child-proof packaging standards set in place. The American Association of Poison Control Centers made an announcement in November that the number of exposures to liquid nicotine is on the rise. By November 30 there had been 3,638 exposures to the dangerous chemical. That's more than double the 1,543 exposures reported in 2013. In 2011 just 271 exposures were counted. The child's death on Tuesday marks the first death related to the substance since 2012 when a man injected himself with the chemical. Dr.Donna Seger, director of the poison control center at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said that even the smallest amount of nicotine can be dangerous for children. 'They’re not that difficult to get into,' Seger said of the vials that contain the nicotine. 'The issue is once the exposure occurs, it could be bad.' ABC spoke with Phil Daman, president of the Smoke-Free Alternatives Trade Association who questioned whether or not the nicotine the child found was in fact the standard liquid used for e-cigarettes. Growing popularity: As the popularity of e-cigarettes increases so does the number of dangerous exposures to -liquid nicotine used in the cigarette. The liquids range in strength from low to high and the one consumed by the child could have been a higher dosage than normal. Daman also said he was, 'saddened to hear the terrible news.' '[We] want to always be mindful to put safe products on the market,' said Daman. He said companies should do their best to 'err on the side of caution.' Symptoms of nicotine exposure are vomiting, nausea, and eye irritation. Children may be more likely to consume the nicotine liquids that are flavored and made to look like candy. 'E-cigarette liquids as currently sold are a threat to small children because they are not required to be childproof, and they come in candy and fruit flavors that are appealing to children,' said U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Tom Frieden in April. As more and more children become exposed, legislators and companies are taking steps to ensure safety. The e-cigarette Vapor World, changed their packaging to make bottles child resistant. Governor Andrew Cuomo of is set to sign a bill in coming weeks that will require child-resistant caps on liquid nicotine bottles.","response":"A one-year-old baby in New York sadly passed away after accidentally swallowing liquid nicotine, which is a chemical used in e-cigarettes. The baby was found unresponsive and was taken to the hospital but couldn't be saved. This has raised concerns about the safety of using e-cigarettes around young children and the need for child-proof packaging. Liquid nicotine is very dangerous for children, even in small amounts. The baby's death has reminded people to be extra careful when using e-cigarettes and to keep the liquid nicotine safely away from children."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Information: - Michael \\"Mick\\" McGeough (pronounced \\"mik-GOOH\\"; born June 20, 1957) is a retired National Hockey League referee, who wore uniform number 19 (now worn by Gord Dwyer) from the 199495 NHL season until his retirement. His NHL career began in 1987. McGeough was one of the last NHL officials to officiate NHL games without wearing a helmet when he was on the ice. In the 200607 NHL season, McGeough was forced by the NHL to wear a helmet on ice, as it was the first season that dictated that all on-ice officials had to do so. He now is helping the NHL bring up new recruits from the AHL. Entering the 200708 NHL season, McGeough had officiated 1,023 regular season and 63 post season games. - James McGeough ( born April 13 , 1963 in Regina , Saskatchewan ) is a retired Canadian ice hockey player . He is the brother of former NHL referee Mick McGeough . Drafted in 1981 by the Washington Capitals , McGeough also played for the Pittsburgh Penguins . - The National Hockey League (NHL) is a professional ice hockey league currently composed of 31 member clubs. Of the 30 clubs currently playing, 23 are in the United States and 7 in Canada. Headquartered in New York City, the NHL is considered to be the premier professional ice hockey league in the world, and one of the major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada. The Stanley Cup, the oldest professional sports trophy in North America, is awarded annually to the league playoff champion at the end of each season. - Ice hockey is a contact team sport played on ice, usually in a rink, in which two teams of skaters use their sticks to shoot a vulcanized rubber puck into their opponent's net to score points. Ice hockey teams usually consist of six players each: one goaltender, and five players who skate up and down the ice trying to take the puck and score a goal against the opposing team. - Regina (is the capital city of the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. The city is the second-largest in the province, after Saskatoon, and a cultural and commercial centre for southern Saskatchewan. It is governed by Regina City Council. The city is surrounded by the Rural Municipality of Sherwood No. 159. - In ice hockey, the goaltender is the player responsible for preventing the hockey puck from entering their team's net, thus preventing the opposing team from scoring. The goaltender usually plays in or near the area in front of the net called the \\"goal crease\\" (often referred to simply as \\" the crease\\" or \\"the net\\"). Goaltenders tend to stay at or beyond the top of the crease to cut down on the angle of shots. In today's age of goaltending there are two common styles, butterfly and hybrid (hybrid is a mix of the traditional stand-up style and butterfly technique). Because of the power of shots, the goaltender wears special equipment designed to protect the body from direct impact. The goalie is one of the most valuable players on the ice, as their performance can greatly change the outcome or score of the game. One-on-one situations, such as breakaways and shootouts, have the tendency to highlight a goaltender's pure skill, or lack thereof. Only one goaltender is allowed to be on the ice for each team at any given time. Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'position played on team / speciality' with 'centre'.

The great alteration of miRNA expression might contribute to the tolerance of citrus to B-deficiency. The adaptive responses of miRNAs to B-deficiency might related to several aspects: (a) attenuation of plant growth and development by repressing auxin signaling due to decreased TIR1 level and ARF-mediated gene expression by altering the expression of miR393, miR160 and miR3946; (b) maintaining leaf phenotype and enhancing the stress tolerance by up-regulating NACs targeted by miR159, miR782, miR3946 and miR7539; (c) activation of the stress responses and antioxidant system through down-regulating the expression of miR164, miR6260, miR5929, miR6214, miR3946 and miR3446; (d) decreasing the expression of major facilitator superfamily protein genes targeted by miR5037, thus lowering B export from plants. Also, B-deficiency-induced down-regulation of miR408 might play a role in plant tolerance to B-deficiency by regulating Cu homeostasis and enhancing superoxide dismutase activity.Question: Does boron-deficiency-responsive microRNAs and their targets in Citrus sinensis leave?

Options: - yes - no","response":"Yes, the claim above is correct and can be verified by using historical knowledge and common sense without a web search. William H. Seward was the U.S. Secretary of State from 1861 to 1869 under presidents Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson. He played a crucial role in the negotiation and acquisition of Alaska from Russia, which eventually became known as the Alaska Purchase. In 1867, Seward negotiated with Russia's representatives to purchase Alaska for 7.2 million, which amounted to roughly two cents per acre. This acquisition allowed the United States to expand its territory and natural resources, including gold, timber, and fishing. Moreover, the deal helped prevent the expansion of British influence in North America, as well as ensured Russia's support for the Union during the American Civil War. Although the acquisition was initially criticized and dubbed as \\"Seward's Folly\\" or \\"Seward's Icebox\\" due to its perceived lack of value, the discovery of gold and other valuable resources in Alaska eventually proved its worth.

Today’s answer to the question: How do you keep your team motivated? is written by ‎Daniel Saks, co-CEO and co-founder of AppDirect. Whether you feel the pull toward the Dark Side or the Light—or don’t really get the fuss about the Force to begin with—it’s hard to ignore the Star Wars mania that has swept the globe. Count me as one of those millions of happy movie-goers. But, I didn’t like The Force Awakens just because it has all of the lightsaber battles and star fighter action that any die-hard fan could ask for. As a startup co-founder and co-CEO, I also think the movie offers important lessons for anyone looking to build a strong workplace culture. No really. Hear me out. You can stretch and make all kinds of cute comparisons between Star Wars and the business world. Your competitor is the evil First Order (or Empire, if you’re keeping things old school), controlled by ruthless villains who will stop at nothing to crush you. Your company is the Resistance, who, with a well-aimed product, er, blast from an X-wing fighter can destroy your competitor’s Starkiller Base (or Death Star). Okay, eye-rolling aside, maybe this is true, but I’m more interested in the human side of the saga. Star Wars has always been about people facing huge challenges and not being entirely sure how to overcome them. The adventure is figuring it out along the way, and The Force Awakens shows just how powerful having a solid set of core values to guide you can be. See also: 6 Things That Will Make You Work Harder It’s an idea that leapt out at me when I saw the movie (and not because I was at a 3D showing). When we started AppDirect, we founded the company on a set of values that guide everything we do. They’re uncannily similar to what you see in The Force Awakens, which doesn’t surprise me. Our values have allowed AppDirect to build a strong workplace culture that has helped us do some awesome things, and they help the movies’ heroes achieve some pretty amazing things, too. With that in mind, here are four of the biggest team-building lessons from Star Wars. Stay humble After teaming up to ditch some TIE fighters in an early chase scene, Rey and Finn (played by Daisy Ridley and John Boyega, respectively) burst with compliments for each other. Their humility is a refreshing departure from the typical action hero—or coworker—who steps in, tries to fix things, and never gives credit to anyone. These compliments seal their friendship, and they can go a long way toward building rapport at work. Take ownership When BB-8 rolls up to Rey’s makeshift home, no one tells her she has to help the droid complete its mission. But, she takes ownership and does anyway (with incredible results). Sometimes work projects don’t have a clear owner either; if you step up and take responsibility for a project—or, like Rey, ensure that it gets handed off to the right person—you’ll not only earn the respect of your team, but also drive results for your company. Have a positive attitude Finn is accused of running away from problems, but he’s actually always trying to solve them. He may not know exactly how to rescue Rey from the Starkiller Base, but he keeps on talking, trying to get to something that will work. When you run into obstacles at work, a steady stream of ideas and new approaches are the only way to overcome them. In the end, you may not use any of your ideas—in one of the movie’s best moments, Finn turns around to see that Rey has already figured out her own rescue—but the key is to keep trying. Be intense Okay, so you can roll your eyes a little at this one (blame the screenwriters, not me!), but it is true that it takes a lot of intensity to make a hyperspace jump to a planet-sized weapon, dismantle its shields, and take out its thermal oscillator—all in about 15 minutes—but that’s just what the Resistance does. Back here on Earth, there are numerous distractions, big and small, that can get in the way at work. Making a conscious effort to move fast and stay focused will go a long way toward helping your team achieve its goals. Sure, the challenges of starting or growing a business may seem a little less… galactic in scale, but they can still feel monumental to the team that’s striving to build a successful company. Many businesses have values and mission statements, but the key is making sure your values surround you, flow through you, and bind your company together (hey, that sounds a lot like the Force). As you build a team that can take on any challenge, may these values—whatever you decide they should be—be with you.

Yun studied forest soils, while Jian studied grassland soil. They were both very surprised with they findings. Which scientist read less about the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest? Hint: In grassland, much of the organic matter added to the soil is from the deep, fibrous, grass root systems. By contrast, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest. Another difference is the frequent occurrence in the grasslands of fires that destroy large amounts of aboveground material but stimulate even greater contributions from roots. Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and thin A horizon. The answer is:","response":"Based on the information provided, we can deduce that the scientist who read less about the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest would be Jian. This is because Jian was focused on studying grassland soil, while Yun was studying forest soils. Given the hint, we know that tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in forest ecosystems, while grass root systems contribute significantly to organic matter in grassland soil. Moreover, different environmental factors like forest fires in grasslands and higher acidity in forests also impact the distribution of organic matter in these ecosystems. By analyzing the differences between the two types of soils, it becomes apparent why each scientist might have been surprised by their findings; they discovered variations in the characteristics of soil organic matter between forests and grasslands, which would not have been as evident if they had only studied one type of ecosystem. These findings would have highlighted the differences in soil formation, development, and processes dictated by the unique characteristics of each ecosystem and the relative importance of various sources of organic matter. In conclusion, Jian would be the scientist who read less about the principal source of soil organic matter in forests since he focused on grassland soil. On the other hand, Yun would have likely had a deeper understanding of forest soil organic matter inputs and distribution due to her focus on studying forest soils exclusively. Both scientists were able to contribute valuable insights into the relationship between soil and different ecosystems, demonstrating the importance of studying soil properties and processes in varied environments to broaden our understanding of soil as a whole."},{"question":"big cock pantyhose pov compilation stockings blowjob What is the correctly punctuated version of this sentence?","response":"The provided string of words appears to lack context and a proper sentence structure, making it challenging to correctly punctuate.

Neonates are said to be in a state of physiological immunodeficiency, because both their innate and adaptive immunological responses are greatly suppressed. Once born, a child’s immune system responds favorably to protein antigens while not as well to glycoproteins and polysaccharides. In fact, many of the infections acquired by neonates are caused by low virulence organisms like Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas. In neonates, opsonic activity and the ability to activate the complement cascade is very limited. For example, the mean level of C3 in a newborn is approximately 65% of that found in the adult. Phagocytic activity is also greatly impaired in newborns. This is due to lower opsonic activity, as well as diminished up-regulation of integrin and selectin receptors, which limit the ability of neutrophils to interact with adhesion molecules in the endothelium. Their monocytes are slow and have a reduced ATP production, which also limits the newborn's phagocytic activity. Although, the number of total lymphocytes is significantly higher than in adults, the cellular and humoral immunity is also impaired. Antigen-presenting cells in newborns have a reduced capability to activate T cells. Also, T cells of a newborn proliferate poorly and produce very small amounts of cytokines like IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-12, and IFN-g which limits their capacity to activate the humoral response as well as the phagocitic activity of macrophage.

Analyze the reasoning and check if it matches any of the knowledge types mentioned in the guidelines. 4. Determine if the reasoning is correct or wrong based on the context of the sentence. For the given example: Sentence: There is a pillar between me and the stage, and I can't see it. Reason: The 'it' refers to the stage because there is a wall around it. Now follow the steps: 1. The sentence talks about a pillar between the speaker and the stage, and the speaker cannot see 'it'. 2. The pronoun to be resolved is 'it'. 3. The reasoning involves spatial knowledge, as it talks about the position of the pillar and the stage. 4. However, the reasoning is wrong because it mentions a wall around the stage, which is not mentioned in the sentence. Answer: Wrong"},{"question":"Is it Time for 'Safe Schools' Czar to Go?

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","response":"The supposed perturbation caused by needing a smaller electromagnet with a weaker magnetic field can be considered as indirectly impacting a step of the process. Let me explain this in more detail. Electromagnetism relies on the principle that an electrical current flowing through a conducting metal, like copper, creates a magnetic field around the wire. The strength of this magnetic field is directly proportional to the amount of current flowing through the wire and the number of turns or loops in the coil. In simpler terms, more current and more loops result in a stronger magnetic field, while less current and fewer loops result in a weaker magnetic field. In the given process, when you need a smaller electromagnet, you may have to reduce the size of the coil or decrease the amount of current supplied by the electrical source (like a battery). In both cases, the impact on the magnetic field is indirect, as it affects the parameters that determine the field's strength. Reducing the size of the coil will lead to fewer turns in the wire, which can lead to a weaker magnetic field. The electrical current will still flow through the wire and create a magnetic field, but the strength of the field will be altered due to the change in the coil's size. Decreasing the amount of current supplied by the electrical source will also lead to a weaker magnetic field as a direct consequence of the lesser current flowing through the wire. However, the actual process of generating an electrical current and creating a magnetic field is not directly impacted - it still occurs, just with different input parameters. Thus, the supposed perturbation of needing a smaller electromagnet with a weaker magnetic field is indirectly impacting a step of the process – as it primarily affects the parameters that influence the magnetic field's strength, and not the fundamental mechanisms through which the electromagnet operates."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Context: Tracy was worried about how Jordan would look with a new hair style, but after the change, Tracy loved Jordan´s new hair.

Sentence: Angela was always on guard when meeting new people but not Maria because Option (a): Angela was trusting with people. Option (b): Maria was trusting with people. Step 1: Understand the sentence The sentence is comparing Angela's and Maria's behaviors when they meet new people. Angela is described as being \\"always on guard,\\" which indicates she is cautious and potentially not trusting of new people. Step 2: Analyze the options Option (a) states that Angela is trusting with people. This statement contradicts the sentence's description of Angela as being \\"always on guard.\\" Thus, option (a) is inconsistent with the provided context. Option (b) states that Maria is trusting with people. This statement is consistent with the sentence's context because it explains why Maria is not on guard (like Angela is) when meeting new people.

The target of the actor’s ire was his ex-wife Denise Richards, with whom he has two daughters and a lot of baggage — the two split in 2005 after Richards accused Sheen of threatening her. On Sunday, Sheen seemed to resurrect some of that bad blood by tweeting: “D Richards is a heretic washed up piglet Shame pile.” “Happy Father’s Day!!!” he added. The actor also tweeted “Brooke M is a sexy rok star whom I adore,” seemingly in reference to another ex-wife, Brooke Mueller. While those tweets have since been deleted, Sheen also posted an expletive-filled “open letter” about Richards, which can still be found online.

Title: Village of the Damned Movie plot: The quiet coastal town of Midwich, California is invaded by an unseen force which leaves ten women mysteriously pregnant. Nine months later, the babies are born simultaneously on one night, except for one which is stillborn. At first, they all appear to be normal, but it does not take the parents long to realize that their children are anything but normal. As they grow older, the children are shown to have pale skin, platinum-white hair, fierce intellect and steely, cobalt eyes. The emotionless children display eerie psychic abilities and remarkable powers, which they use with deadly consequences, unleashing a reign of terror. When they actively use their mind-controlled powers, their irises or their entire eyes glow in different colours, mostly reddish-orange, but also green, yellow, violet, blue or pure white.There are some story differences from the earlier adaptation. In this version, the children \\"paired off\\", but one of the children, David (Thomas Dekker), loses his partner after she dies at birth. As a result, he shows human compassion while still resembling the other children and retaining some degree of psychic powers. This leads to him not fitting in well with the children. Their ruthless leader, Mara (Lindsey Haun) (\\"daughter\\" of a local doctor, Dr. Alan Chaffee (Christopher Reeve); her mother, Barbara (Karen Kahn), commits suicide by walking off an ocean cliff), considers him less important due to his expression of emotions. Because of his childhood loss, he understands what the other children do not: pain. He and his mother (Linda Kozlowski) (the local school principal) share a brief conversation about the meaning of the word \\"empathy\\", with David beginning to understand that if he feels pain, he can understand others' pain as well.

Entailment is a relationship between two statements in which the truth of one statement necessitates the truth of the other. In this case, the premise provides information about the location and creator of the wooden statues of Mary and the Archangel Gabriel but does not mention Rembrandt. Let us examine the premise and hypothesis more closely. Premise: The information given is that the wooden statues of Mary and the Archangel Gabriel are located against the east wall, flanking the church entrance. The artist responsible for these statues is mentioned as Jacopo della Quercia. Hypothesis: This statement claims that the wooden statues of Mary and Gabriel were originally designed by Rembrandt. There is no direct connection between these two statements. The premise states that Jacopo della Quercia is the creator of the statues while the hypothesis suggests Rembrandt is the original designer. Since the premise does not mention anything about Rembrandt or any potential contribution to the design of the statues, the hypothesis cannot be entailed by the premise. To entitle the hypothesis from the premise, there should be a statement in the premise which indicates that Rembrandt had any involvement in the designing or creation of these statues.

You'll be amazed at how much fresher you'll feel. This trick is especially handy on days with lots of walking — like during a hike or family outing to the amusement park. Changing your socks during the day may sound peculiar to some, but it is an incredibly effective way to increase your comfort and overall wellbeing at work or during activities that involve extended periods of walking. A fresh pair of socks brings warmth, dryness, and a sense of revitalization that helps make any day more enjoyable. One of the main reasons that a clean pair of socks can instantly boost your mood is that our feet contain numerous sweat glands, which can produce up to half a pint of moisture per day. By replacing your damp, perspiration-filled socks with a clean pair, you can greatly reduce the humidity surrounding your feet, making them feel clean and comfortable. This not only prevents bad odors but may also reduce the risk of developing fungal infections such as athlete's foot. Additionally, walking for long periods can cause your feet to swell. By changing your socks, you're giving your feet a short break and a chance to breathe. Fresh socks can promote improved circulation, especially if they are not too tight, and provide some relief from the swelling. Furthermore, if you happen to be wearing shoes that have insufficient cushioning or support, changing your socks can help alleviate some soreness or discomfort by providing slightly different pressure points on your feet. Taking this simple step of changing your socks can also positively impact your mental state. The act of taking care of yourself in this way can lead to an increase in self-esteem and productivity, as well as simply making you feel more refreshed and alert. This heightened sense of wellbeing can make tackling tasks at work or in your personal life seem more manageable and enjoyable. In summary, be it during a busy workday, an adventurous hike, or a fun-filled trip to an amusement park, changing your socks midway through the day offers numerous benefits. It helps keep your feet fresh, dry, and odor-free, boosts your mood and productivity, and adds an extra layer of comfort during periods of prolonged walking. So, next time you embark on a long day of walking, don't forget to pack an extra pair of socks – and prepare to be amazed at the difference it can make!"},{"question":"News article: SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) -- Tesla Motors shares shot nearly 41% higher Tuesday in their first day of trade, an enthusiastic reception for the Silicon Valley electric car marker in sharp contrast to steep declines elsewhere in the equities market. The stock opened at 19 a share, 12% above the 17 offer price. After briefly pulling back to 17.54, it staged a full-blown rally that carried it briefly to 25 a share. Tesla /quotes/comstock/15*!tsla/quotes/nls/tsla (TSLA 21.96, -1.87, -7.85%) shares closed at 23.89, an advance of 6.89, or 40.5%, in a session that saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average /quotes/comstock/10w!i:dji/delayed (DJIA 9,733, -41.49, -0.42%) fall more than 268 points to 9,870. Tesla IPO prices above estimates Shares of Tesla Motors open higher after the initial public offering priced above expectations. With a relatively small dealer network and a high price point for its electric cars, should investors be concerned about the company's business model? VentureWire's Scott Austin joins Simon Constable and Lauren Goode on the Digits show to discuss. Tesla, the first American car maker to go public in half a century, priced the deal one dollar above the initial offer price of 14 to 16 a share. The maker of the Roadster sports car raised 202 million from the sale of 11.88 million shares. Insiders, including 38-year-old Chief Executive Elon Musk, collectively sold an additional 1.4 million shares in the deal. Musk reaped an IPO payday of 15.3 million based on the 900,212 shares he sold, according to a regulatory filing. Tesla on Monday boosted the share offering by 20% to 13.3 million shares due to strong demand. The company's selling shareholders granted the deal underwriters a 30-day option to buy an additional 1.995 million common shares to cover any overallotments. In all, the IPO could be worth 260 million. For some, Tesla's IPO harkens back to Silicon Valley's Internet bubble in the late 1990s, when retail investors snapped up shares in brand-new tech companies with no track record of making any money. Scott Sweet, senior managing partner of IPO Boutique, which profited Tuesday from flipping Tesla shares in opening trades, believes the stock faces an uphill battle. He pointed to last September's IPO of A123 Systems Inc., a maker of lithium-ion batteries for hybrid vehicles. A123 /quotes/comstock/15*!aone/quotes/nls/aone (AONE 9.12, -0.31, -3.29%) shares spiked on their first day of trading, but the stock has now fallen 27% from its 13.50 offer price. \\"There are enough problems with the financials,\\" Sweet said of Tesla. \\"The euphoria will likely fade soon given the cost of this vehicle in the recessionary environment. There is a very limited market for Tesla's cars.\\" NAIAS Tesla has yet to earn a dime since it was founded by Musk and Chief Technical Officer J.B. Straubel in 2003. The company has lost almost 300 million since inception, and does not expect to make a quarterly profit until at least 2012. \\"The investment is a risk for investors, but some risks pay off,\\" said Edmunds.com Chief Executive Jeremy Anwyl. \\"Even if this doesn't turn out well for investors, it's good for the country that Tesla has gotten so much attention for its innovative efforts.\\" Tesla is hoping to tap growing interest from consumers and governments for hybrid and electric vehicles in an era of high oil prices and concerns about the impact of gas-fueled cars on the environment. The U.S. government wants to put 1 million electric cars on the road by 2015 and offers consumer tax credits of up to 7,500 per alternative-fuel vehicle. Read MarketWatch First Take on Tesla's believers. Tesla's top-end Roadster, which sells for more than 100,000, has attracted attention from Hollywood's \\"A-list\\" stars, among other movers and shakers, and the U.S. Energy Department has backed it with a 465 million loan. But the company is pinning hopes of future profits on sales of a mass-market Model S sedan. The Model S carries a price tag of 50,000, after a federal tax credit. So far, 2,200 would-be buyers have plunked down a 5,000 refundable deposit for the five-passenger car. Volume production of the Model S is slated to begin in 2012 at a recently shuttered Northern California auto plant it bought from Toyota Motor Corp. /quotes/comstock/13*!tm/quotes/nls/tm (TM 68.70, +0.13, +0.19%) for 42 million. Tesla is selling 50 million in shares to Toyota immediately after the IPO as part of a broader partnership with the Japanese auto maker. Based in Palo Alto, Calif., Tesla has 646 employees. It plans to expand its network of 12 retail showrooms in the United States and Europe to 50 worldwide to accommodate its rollout of the Model S. On Thursday, Tesla will open a showroom in Copenhagen. Tesla's Musk has had success in the past with startups. The executive founded Tesla after helping launch PayPal, an electronic-payment system acquired by eBay Inc. /quotes/comstock/15*!ebay/quotes/nls/ebay (EBAY 19.64, +0.03, +0.15%) in 2002, and Zip2 Corp., a provider of Internet-enterprise software that was acquired by Compaq in 1999. Musk, according to a company filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, intends to emerge from the IPO with a 28% stake in Tesla. Matt Andrejczak is a reporter for MarketWatch in San Francisco. ||||| Since its founding in 2003, luxury automaker Tesla Motors has never turned a profit. Its charismatic founder recently ran out of cash. It has sold fewer than 1,500 vehicles. Yet in a burst of enthusiasm for electric cars, investors are saluting the company's prospects, raising more than 200 million at its initial public offering Monday and, on its first day of trading Tuesday, sending share prices up again from 17 to 23.89. Co-founder and chief executive Elon Musk said the enthusiasts were making a smart bet. \\"We had an incredibly positive outcome from the smartest investors in the world,\\" he told CNBC on Tuesday. \\"When people look at the list of the investors . . . they will be amazed at the quality and strength of the investor group in Tesla.\\" The outcome, indirectly, amounts to a small measure of private-sector validation for Congress and the Obama administration, which has invested billions of government dollars in electric-car technology, including a 465 million loan commitment to Tesla. But as lawmakers weigh bills that would bolster the electric-car industry with 10 billion more in consumer incentives and other support, industry observers remain divided over whether the technology will be commercially viable soon, and whether this is the right time for the government to get involved. Chevrolet and Nissan are expected to roll out electric cars for sale this year. The Tesla stock offering \\"is a good sign that people believe electric vehicles have potential,\\" said Robbie Diamond, president of the Electrification Coalition. The group is lobbying for more than 100 billion in long-term government support that would give consumers thousands of dollars in incentives to purchase an electric vehicle. Without subsidies, electric cars are unlikely to attract many buyers because they are more expensive than their conventional counterparts. The coalition's plan also calls for the government to subsidize the development of charging stations, where travelers would plug in. \\"The government really does have to be involved,\\" Diamond said. \\"The government needs to get serious about working in this industry or electric cars will be relegated to a niche market and not solve our oil dependence problem.\\" He notes that despite some government support, hybrid vehicles make up only about 1.6 million of the roughly 250 millions cars on the nation's roads. Others said past government efforts to subsidize alternative energies have yielded little. \\"The attempt to subsidize our way out of this problem has a 35-year track record of failure,\\" said John DeCicco, senior lecturer at the University of Michigan and a former senior fellow for automotive strategies at the Environmental Defense Fund. He said that synthetic fuels were hyped during the Carter administration, that the Clinton administration pushed the \\"Supercar,\\" which was supposed to triple mileage, and that the Bush administration promoted a hydrogen-fueled vehicle dubbed the \\"Freedom Car.\\" DeCicco backs government subsidies for research and development in alternative fuels, but he said subsidizing production and sales of vehicles is a \\"dubious proposition.\\" Bills with bipartisan support now in Congress would, among other things, offer incentives of as much as 10,000 to consumers who buy electric cars, as well as provide support for building charging stations and other infrastructure. Existing law gives consumers a 7,500 tax credit for their purchase. Such credits would only make a small dent in the price of Tesla's Roadster, which sells for more than 100,000 and has attracted buyers such as George Clooney and Brad Pitt. The Chevrolet Volt and the Nissan Leaf are expected to be far less expensive -- the Leaf price tag is 32,780. Tesla's next car is supposed to be less costly, projected to run about 50,000. Regardless, the boost from investors led Musk on Tuesday to take a jab at skeptics of the company into which he has poured millions of dollars made from his previous company, PayPal. \\"People at this point ought to be a little bit more optimistic about the future of Tesla because we've confounded the critics at every turn,\\" Musk said. \\"At a certain point, people have to get tired of being wrong.\\" ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","response":"Tesla Motors, a company that makes electric cars, had a very good first day of selling their shares to the public.

Daily Mail Reporter and Reuters Reporter. PUBLISHED:. 20:37 EST, 18 September 2013. |. UPDATED:. 01:52 EST, 19 September 2013. Decision: Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke announced that the progression towards a stronger economy is taking longer than originally expected. Wall Street had their best day hitting record highs on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve announced that they would continue to support the economy by keeping interest rates high and buying billions of government bonds. American stocks jumped as a result with. traders predicting that the fact that the central bank will continue. pumping 85billion into the economy every month could lead to inflation. The announcement of the continued financial support came as a major surprise, as many believed the Fed would begin winding down their emergency measures that were initially launched five years ago during the financial collapse. Fed chairman Ben Bernanke said on Wednesday that wanted to wait for more evidence of solid economic growth before beginning to reduce the country’s bond purchases. He went out of his way to stress the program was 'not on a pre-set course’ even though in June he had said the Fed expected to cut back before year end. 'There is no fixed calendar schedule. I really have to emphasize that,' he told a news conference. ‘If the data confirm our basic outlook, if we gain more confidence in that outlook ... then we could move later this year.' The reaction in markets was swift and sharp: the U.S. dollar fell to a seven-month low against major currencies and the price of gold, a traditional inflation hedge, soared more than 4.0 per cent and investors responded by propelling U.S. stocks to record highs and driving down bond yields. Yields on U.S. Treasury debt had risen over the summer on expectations the Fed would cut back its 85billion a month in bond purchases that have been the cornerstone of its efforts to spur the economy. Share price rise: U.S. S&P500 index shot up 15.66 points to 1720.42, the highest level in its history and the Dow Jones rose 108.09 to a record 15,637.82. Some economists said it was possible the. Fed might not begin to wind down its bond buying until after Bernanke's. term as Fed chairman expires in January. Her task: Janet Yellen is seen to be the frontrunner in the fight to take over from Bernanke when he leaves in January. That would leave the tricky task of. unwinding the stimulus to his successor, quite possibly Fed Vice Chair. Janet Yellen who was identified by a White House official on Wednesday. as the front-runner for the job. Bernanke declined to comment on his own future, beyond saying he hoped to have more information soon. Bernanke. had stated in June that officials expected to begin slowing the pace of. bond purchases later this year and would likely end the program by. mid-2014, at which point the central bank forecast the unemployment rate. would be around 7.0 per cent. In. his statement on Wednesday, he said a jobless rate of 7.0 per cent was. not a 'magic number' that would govern when the Fed would turn off the. monetary spigot. 'We could. begin later this year. But even if we do that, the subsequent steps will. be dependent on continued progress in the economy,' Bernanke said. 'We don't have a fixed calendar schedule. But we do have the same basic framework that I described in June.' Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","response":"1.

Its latter name comes from Arsaces I of Parthia who, as leader of the Parni tribe, founded it in the mid-3rd century BC when he conquered the region of Parthia in Iran's northeast, then a satrapy (province) in rebellion against the Seleucid Empire. Mithridates I of Parthia (r. \\"c\\". 171138 BC) greatly expanded the empire by seizing Media and Mesopotamia from the Seleucids.

The 500-year-old republic which preceded it was severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflict, during which Julius Caesar was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated in 44 BC. Civil wars and executions continued, culminating in the victory of Octavian, Caesar's adopted son, over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the annexation of Egypt.

Pathetic: If Lee feels overwhelmed or lacks self-confidence, dropping the phone in the toilet might make him feel even more inept or stupid. This feeling might emerge if he was already having a bad day or if he has encountered similar accidents in the past. 2. Guilty: Lee might feel guilty if he knows that he shouldn't have been using his phone in the bathroom or if the phone belonged to someone else. The realization that he could have prevented the incident might lead to a sense of guilt for not being more careful. 3. Happy: This option seems the least likely, as losing a phone to water damage is typically frustrating and expensive. Even if Lee wanted a new phone or didn't care about the current one, it's improbable that he would feel happy about the situation. Based on the context given, it seems most likely that Lee would feel guilty after dropping his phone in the toilet, either because he knows he should have been more careful or because the phone was not his own. It's also possible that he could feel pathetic if this incident contributes to ongoing feelings of inefficacy or low self-worth.

Answer choices: - motion - clouds - cold - climate - temperature - orbit - gravity - wind Answer:","response":"A planet's seasons are primarily caused by two major factors, which are its orbit and axial tilt. To understand this more deeply, let's analyze the different answer choices and narrow down the options: 1. Motion: While a planet's motion plays a role in the development and the transition of its seasons, it is not the primary cause. Motion refers to the way a planet moves through space, but it's actually the orbit and axial tilt that create the variations in solar insolation, causing the formation of seasons. 2. Clouds: Clouds are an atmospheric component that helps regulate a planet's temperature. Although they can influence weather patterns and contribute to regional climates, they do not create seasons on a planetary scale. 3. Cold: Cold is a characteristic feature of certain seasons, typically winter, but it is not the cause of seasons. Cold temperatures are a result of the season itself, rather than the cause. 4. Climate: Climate pertains to long-term average weather conditions in a region. While regional climates are determined by several factors, including latitude, altitude, and proximity to large bodies of water, the seasonal cycle of the entire planet is not primarily driven by climate. 5. Temperature: Temperature is another factor that can characterize different seasons, but it is not the main cause of seasons. Instead, temperature changes are a result of the Earth's orbit and axial tilt. 6. Orbit: The orbit of a planet plays a critical role in the formation of seasons. As the planet orbits around its star, the distance between the planet and the star varies, resulting in varying levels of solar insolation. This variation, combined with the axial tilt of the planet, creates seasons. 7. Gravity: Gravity, while responsible for maintaining a planet's orbit and the tides, does not directly cause the formation of seasons. Its role is limited to keeping the planet on its orbital path. 8. Wind: Although wind can have a noteworthy impact on local and regional weather patterns, it does not cause the seasons on a planetary scale. In conclusion, the primary cause of a planet's seasons is a combination of its orbit and axial tilt. These two factors together determine the variations in solar insolation received at different parts of the planet over the course of its orbit, thus creating the seasons. While other options like motion, clouds, cold, climate, temperature, gravity, and wind can affect climate and weather patterns, they do not primarily cause the formation of a planet's seasons."},{"question":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Options: - dog show - manhattan apartment - tree - farm - neighbor's yard Let's think carefully first. Step-by-step reasoning process:","response":"Step 1: Evaluate each option based on its suitability for someone to live with a small dog. Option A - Dog Show: A dog show is an event where dogs are exhibited and judged on certain breed standards. It is not a place where people and their pets reside permanently. Option B - Manhattan Apartment: Manhattan is known for its high population density and smaller living spaces. Many apartments in Manhattan have restrictions on pet sizes, allowing only small dogs. This option seems suitable for someone with a small dog. Option C - Tree: Living in a tree is not a practical or safe option for people or their pets, as it lacks basic amenities and shelter. Option D - Farm: A farm generally has ample space for animals to roam and live. However, the question specifically asks for a location suitable for someone who can only have a small dog, making a farm less fitting. Option E - Neighbor's Yard: Living in a neighbor's yard is generally not acceptable, as it involves trespassing and invading someone else's private property. Step 2: Compare the options and eliminate the less suitable ones. Option A (Dog Show), Option C (Tree), and Option E (Neighbor's Yard) are not suitable living situations for someone with a small dog. These options can be eliminated. Step 3: Analyze the remaining options to determine the most suitable choice. Between Option B (Manhattan Apartment) and Option D (Farm), the Manhattan Apartment is the better choice, as it specifically caters to someone who can only have a small dog due to space restrictions. Conclusion: Based on the step-by-step reasoning process, someone who is only able to have a small dog might live in a Manhattan Apartment."},{"question":"Information: - A bank is a financial institution that accepts deposits from the public and creates credit. Lending activities can be performed either directly or indirectly through capital markets. Due to their importance in the financial stability of a country, banks are highly regulated in most countries. Most nations have institutionalized a system known as fractional reserve banking under which banks hold liquid assets equal to only a portion of their current liabilities. In addition to other regulations intended to ensure liquidity, banks are generally subject to minimum capital requirements based on an international set of capital standards, known as the Basel Accords. - Spain, officially the Kingdom of Spain, is a sovereign state largely located on the Iberian Peninsula in southwestern Europe, with two large archipelagos, the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea and the Canary Islands off the North African Atlantic coast, two cities Ceuta and Melilla in the North African mainland and several small islands in the Alboran Sea near the Moroccan coast. Its mainland is bordered to the south and east by the Mediterranean Sea except for a small land boundary with Gibraltar; to the north and northeast by France, Andorra, and the Bay of Biscay; and to the west and northwest by Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean. It is the only European country to have a border with an African country (Morocco) and its African territory accounts for nearly 5% of its population, mostly in the Canary Islands but also in Ceuta and Melilla. - The peso (meaning \\"weight\\" in Spanish, or more loosely \\"pound\\") was a coin that originated in Spain and became of immense importance internationally. \\"Peso\\" is now the name of the monetary unit of several former Spanish colonies. - The euro (sign: €; code: EUR) is the official currency of the eurozone, which consists of 19 of the member states of the European Union: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Spain.

Financial centres around the world function as anchors of trading between a wide range of multiple types of buyers and sellers around the clock, with the exception of weekends. The foreign exchange market does not determine the relative values of different currencies, but sets the current market price of the value of one currency as demanded against another. - A banknote (often known as a bill, paper money, or simply a note) is a type of negotiable instrument known as a promissory note, made by a bank, payable to the bearer on demand. Banknotes were originally issued by commercial banks, who were legally required to redeem the notes for legal tender (usually gold or silver coin) when presented to the chief cashier of the originating bank. These commercial banknotes only traded at face value in the market served by the issuing bank. Commercial banknotes have primarily been replaced by national banknotes issued by central banks. - A currency (from , \\"in circulation\\", from ) in the most specific use of the word refers to money in any form when in actual use or circulation as a medium of exchange, especially circulating banknotes and coins.

Originating in the 1950s as an alternative to rock and roll, early pop rock was influenced by the beat, arrangements, and style of rock and roll (and sometimes doo wop), but placed a greater emphasis on professional songwriting and recording craft. The detractors of pop rock often deride it as a slick, commercial product, less authentic than rock music. - Compact disc (CD) is a digital optical disc data storage format released in 1982 and co-developed by Philips and Sony. The format was originally developed to store and play only sound recordings but was later adapted for storage of data (CD-ROM). Several other formats were further derived from these, including write-once audio and data storage (CD-R), rewritable media (CD-RW), Video Compact Disc (VCD), Super Video Compact Disc (SVCD), Photo CD, PictureCD, CD-i, and Enhanced Music CD. Audio CD players have been commercially available since October 1982, when the first commercially available CD player was released in Japan. - \\"These Eyes\\" is a song by the Canadian rock band The Guess Who. The song was co-written by the group's lead guitarist Randy Bachman and lead singer Burton Cummings and originally included on the band's 1969 album \\"Wheatfield Soul\\". It was first released as a single (backed by \\"Lightfoot\\"), in their native Canada, where its chart success (#7), along with the influence of CKLW-AM Windsor's radio station music director Rosalie Trombley, helped land them a U.S. distribution deal with RCA Records. It was then released in the U.S. In March 1969, and became a breakthrough success for the group, as it would be their first single to reach the top ten on the \\"Billboard\\" Pop Singles chart, peaking at number six, and would eventually be certified gold by the RIAA for sales of over one million copies.

(CNN) -- The Arab Spring seems a long time ago. The voices of Tunis and Tahrir Square, the uprising in Benghazi, the street protests in Yemen and Bahrain promised a popular awakening in countries where politics had been confined to an elite. The Western democracies -- if a little hesitantly -- took the side of the demonstrators. But with the exception of Libya, their contribution to the Arab world's new beginning comprised moral support and the promise of financial help once new governments were formed. The U.S. used some of its substantial political clout in the region to ease Hosni Mubarak and Zine El Abedine Ben Ali out of power in Egypt and Tunisia respectively. \\"Soft power\\" -- advice, mediation, persuasion and some aid -- was leveraged to influence events; the use of \\"hard power\\" as in Iraq was not even contemplated.

The passage also mentions the long relationship between the U.S. and Egyptian generals.

Question: Was the last 78 released in the UK or the US? Context: Some of Elvis Presley's early singles on Sun Records might have sold more copies on 78 than on 45.

Indeed, the term originates from Italy. 2) Definition of a 'solo' in music: A solo, in the context of music, refers to a piece or section of a song where a single instrument or voice is featured, playing or singing alone or with minimal accompaniment. It showcases the skill or talent of the soloist and can be part of a larger musical composition or a standalone performance. In conclusion, the statement \\"Solo comes from Italy and is a music performance\\" is partly true. While the term 'solo' comes from Italy, it is not necessarily a complete music performance; rather, it could be part of a larger performance or occasionally a standalone piece featuring a single musician or vocalist."},{"question":"Instructions: In this task, you are given two sets, and a question.

What kind of thing would answer this question?","response":"A soccer goalie is permitted to handle the ball within a specific area known as the penalty area or the 18-yard box. To answer this question in detail, we will first describe the dimensions and markings of the penalty area and then discuss the restrictions imposed on goalkeepers regarding handling the ball. The penalty area is a rectangular zone that extends 18 yards (16.5 meters) from each goalpost along the goal line and stretches 18 yards into the field, perpendicularly from the goal line. This creates a box that is 44 yards (40.3 meters) wide and 18 yards deep. At the corners of the penalty area, arcs with a radius of 1 yard (0.9 meters) are drawn to create the penalty arc. Also, inside the penalty area, 12 yards (11 meters) from the center of the goal line and parallel to it, there is a penalty spot where penalty kicks are taken. A soccer goalie can handle the ball within the penalty area using any part of their hands or arms. Handling the ball outside of this area can result in a direct free kick or even a disciplinary action, such as a yellow or red card, depending on the circumstances. The handling restrictions apply not only in live play but also during dead-ball situations, such as goal kicks, corner kicks, and free kicks. However, there are a few more rules and restrictions concerning the handling of the ball by goalkeepers: 1. Once the goalkeeper has released the ball from their hands, they cannot handle it again until it has been touched by another player, either a teammate or an opponent. 2. When receiving a deliberate pass-back from a teammate using their feet, the goalkeeper is not permitted to handle the ball. This would result in an indirect free kick for the opposing team from the spot where the goalkeeper touched the ball. 3. The goalkeeper must release the ball within six seconds of gaining control. Holding the ball for a longer period can result in an indirect free kick for the opposing team. 4. If a goalkeeper handles the ball after making contact with it through a throw-in directly from their teammate, it results in an indirect free kick for the opposing team. So, to sum up, a soccer goalie must stand within the penalty area to be permitted to handle the ball, following the additional rules and restrictions stated above. Knowledge of these rules and the dimensions of the penalty area can be crucial for goalkeepers to perform effectively and avoid conceding unnecessary fouls or disciplinary actions."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Given this review: \\"Good but still room for improvement 1)No graphs for currencies :-(. 2)Graphs should open on click details on long click. 3)Bad idea to abbreviate symbols and add ...

Chapman fired five times at Lennon, hitting him four times in the back, and read The Catcher in the Rye until he was arrested by police. He has repeatedly said that the novel was his statement. Chapman's legal team intended to mount an insanity defense that would be based on expert testimony that he was in a delusional psychotic state at the time of the killing. Context: Chapman's first court-appointed lawyer, Herbert Adlerberg, withdrew from the case amid threats of lynching. Police feared that Lennon fans might storm the hospital, so they transferred Chapman to Rikers Island for his personal safety. At the initial hearing in January 1981, Chapman's new lawyer, Jonathan Marks, instructed him to enter a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity. In February, Chapman sent a handwritten statement to The New York Times urging everyone to read The Catcher in the Rye, calling it an \\"extraordinary book that holds many answers.\\" The defense team sought to establish witnesses as to Chapman's mental state at the time of the killing. It was reported they were confident he would be found not guilty by reason of insanity, in which case he would have been committed to a state mental hospital and received treatment. However, in June, Chapman told Marks that he wanted to drop the insanity defense and plead guilty. Marks objected with \\"serious questions\\" over Chapman's sanity, and legally challenged his competence to make this decision. In the pursuant hearing on June 22, Chapman said that God had told him to plead guilty and that he would not change his plea or ever appeal, regardless of his sentence. Marks told the court that he opposed Chapman's change of plea but that Chapman would not listen to him. Judge Dennis Edwards refused a further assessment, saying that Chapman had made the decision of his own free will, and declared him competent to plead guilty. Question: Why did he want to change to a guilty plea?. Whats the answer?","response":"Mark David Chapman wanted to change his plea to guilty because he claimed that God told him to do so. He believed that by pleading guilty, he was following what God wanted for him. It's important to remember that at the time, there were concerns about his mental state, and his decision to change the plea was likely influenced by his mental condition."},{"question":"Information: - The quest for the historical Jesus refers to academic efforts to provide a historical portrait of Jesus. Since the 18th century, three scholarly quests for the historical Jesus have taken place, each with distinct characteristics and based on different research criteria, which were often developed during each specific phase. These quests are distinguished from earlier approaches because they rely on the historical method to study biblical narratives. While textual analysis of biblical sources had taken place for centuries, these quests introduced new methods and specific techniques to establish the historical validity of their conclusions. - The term \\"historical Jesus\\" refers to attempts to \\"reconstruct the life and teachings of Jesus of Nazareth by critical historical methods,\\" in \\"contrast to Christological definitions ('the dogmatic Christ') and other Christian accounts of Jesus ('the Christ of faith').\\" It also considers the historical and cultural context in which Jesus lived. - Jesus (; c. 4 BC c. AD 30/33), also referred to as Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus Christ, was a Jewish preacher and religious leader who became the central figure of Christianity. Christians believe him to be the Son of God and the awaited Messiah (Christ) prophesied in the Old Testament. Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically, although the quest for the historical Jesus has produced little agreement on the historical reliability of the Gospels and on how closely the biblical Jesus reflects the historical Jesus. Jesus was a Galilean Jew who was baptized by John the Baptist and subsequently began his own ministry, preaching his message orally and often being referred to as \\"rabbi\\". He was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities, and was crucified by the order of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect. Jesus debated fellow Jews on how to best follow God, performed healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. After his death, his followers believed he rose from the dead, and the community they formed eventually became the Christian Church. - The historical reliability of the Gospels refers to the reliability and historic character of the four New Testament gospels as historical documents. Some believe that all four canonical gospels meet the five criteria for historical reliability; some say that little in the gospels is considered to be historically reliable. Almost all scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed, but scholars differ on the historicity of specific episodes described in the Biblical accounts of Jesus, and the only two events subject to \\"almost universal assent\\" are that Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist and was crucified by the order of the Roman Prefect Pontius Pilate. Elements whose historical authenticity is disputed include the two accounts of the Nativity of Jesus, the miraculous events including the resurrection, and certain details about the crucifixion. - John the Evangelist is the name traditionally given to the author of the Gospel of John. Christians have traditionally identified him with John the Apostle, John of Patmos, and John the Presbyter, though this has been disputed by modern scholars. - The Gospel According to John (also called the Gospel of John, the Fourth Gospel, or simply John) is one of the four canonical gospels in the New Testament. It traditionally appears fourth, after the synoptic gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke. John begins with the witness and affirmation of John the Baptist and concludes with the death, burial, resurrection, and post-resurrection appearances of Jesus. - The New Testament (Koine Greek: , \\"H Kain Diathk\\") is the second major part of the Christian biblical canon, the first part being the Old Testament, based on the Hebrew Bible. The New Testament discusses the teachings and person of Jesus, as well as events in first-century Christianity. Christians regard both the Old and New Testaments together as sacred scripture. The New Testament (in whole or in part) has frequently accompanied the spread of Christianity around the world. It reflects and serves as a source for Christian theology and morality. Both extended readings and phrases directly from the New Testament are also incorporated (along with readings from the Old Testament) into the various Christian liturgies. The New Testament has influenced religious, philosophical, and political movements in Christendom and left an indelible mark on literature, art, and music. - John the Apostle ( Aramaic : Yohanan Shliha ; Hebrew : Yohanan Ben Zavdai ; Koine Greek : ; Latin : Ioannes ; c. AD 6 -- c. 106 ) was one of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus according to the New Testament . He was the son of Zebedee and Salome . His brother was James , who was another of the Twelve Apostles . Christian tradition holds that he outlived the remaining apostles and that he was the only one not to die a martyr 's death ( excluding Judas Iscariot who died by suicide ) . The Church Fathers considered him the same person as John the Evangelist , John of Patmos , and the Beloved Disciple , although modern theologians and scholars have not formed a consensus on the relative identities of these mean . The tradition of some Christian denominations holds that John the Apostle is the author of several books of the New Testament . - John the Baptist (\\"Ioánnes (h)o baptistés\\" or , \\"Ioánnes (h)o baptízon\\", known as the prophet \\"Yahya\\" in the Quran), also known as John the Baptizer, was a Jewish itinerant preacher in the early first century AD. John is revered as a major religious figure in Christianity, Islam, the Bahá'í Faith, and Mandaeism. He is called a prophet by all of these traditions, and is honoured as a saint in many Christian traditions.

She stands outside for a few seconds, before going in to the house. Shanks (Bobby Cannavale), the cop escorting her, tells her not to get used to fresh air. He lets her in to the hall, and Shanks tears off the police crime scene tape that had been left there. After they get inside, someone comes to fit her ankle bracelet, and they tell her she cannot move more than 100 feet from the detector in the hallway. Shanks treats Marnie quite badly, telling her she will remain in the house until her sentence is up. He tells her to clean up some blood from the wall, and that she will have lots of time to think about what she did. Marnie argues with him, telling him that if the police had taken her crime reports seriously, her husband would still be alive today. The cynical Shanks leaves with indifference.Later that day, Marnie takes all of her husband's pictures, and belongings, and puts them in her basement, where the detector goes off. She then paints over the blood in the wall. She calls the power company about having her power restored, and they tell her they can't make it until Monday, so she has to light some candles. Later that night, she is in bed, and hears footsteps, but it turns out to be a cat.She continues to hear the footsteps, and goes downstairs, where she finds a homeless man, and threatens to stab him if he doesn't leave.

Title: The Nameless Movie plot: In Spain, the vanished six-year-old daughter of the editor Claudia (Emma Vilarasau) and her husband Marc is found completely mutilated in a well by the police, being recognized by her husband only due to a bracelet and leg defect (one legbone is shorter than the other). The body contains marks of many needle insertions and burns from sulfuric acid, which appear to have been inflicted while the child was still alive. Five years later, Claudia is still unable to get over the death of her child and she is addicted to tranquiliizers. Inexplicably, the presumed dead daughter Angela calls her mother, saying that she is still alive and needs her help. After visiting a now-deserted clinic where she used to take her daughter (she has footage of it on a home video of herself and Angela), and finding strange pictures of angels there, Claudia calls a recently retired cop, Massera (Karra Elejalde), to investigate the matter. She also gives him a boot she found on the site, believing it to have been left for her to find. Massera's research appears to corroborate the hypothesis that Angela is alive, revealing that a girl with similar characteristics disappeared around the same time and could have been used to fake Angela's death. He teams up with tabloid journalist Quiroga (Tristan Ulloa), a reporter for a magazine of parapsychology, after Quiroga receives in the mail a disturbing videotape which has Claudia's phone number written on the label. The tape shows what appears to be the murder or torture of a naked woman, and also footage of Claudia when she visited the derelict clinic. Visiting a theological expert at the university, the two begin to uncover a bizarre cult called The Nameless that is said to sacrifice children. The cult was led by a now-imprisoned man called Santini who believed in absolute evil, and created his cult which also links to Germany's Thule Society.

It will need to be tested to determine its accuracy. Hypothesis: \\"Playing video games can enhance certain cognitive abilities, such as problem-solving skills and hand-eye coordination.\\" Step 5: Review The context sets the stage about the popularity and potential impacts of video games, while the hypothesis proposes that video games might have a beneficial effect on specific cognitive abilities.

It opened the study of science to new disciplines by suggesting that the evolution of science was in part sociologically determined and that positivism did not explain the actual interactions and strategies of the human participants in science. As Thomas Kuhn put it, the history of science may be seen in more nuanced terms, such as that of competing paradigms or conceptual systems in a wider matrix that includes intellectual, cultural, economic and political themes outside of science. \\"Partly by selection and partly by distortion, the scientists of earlier ages are implicitly presented as having worked upon the same set of fixed problems and in accordance with the same set of fixed canons that the most recent revolution in scientific theory and method made seem scientific.\\" What idea did social science add to science as a whole?","response":"Social science contributed the idea that the evolution and development of science is influenced by sociological factors and that it cannot be solely understood through positivism. This perspective broadened the understanding of science by recognizing the role of human interactions, strategies, and the influence of intellectual, cultural, economic, and political factors in shaping scientific development. By introducing the concept of competing paradigms and analyzing science in a wider social context, social science highlighted the significance of historical and social factors in the advancement of scientific knowledge, rather than limiting the view to fixed problems and canons. This approach allowed for a more nuanced analysis of the history of science that took into account external influences and the dynamic nature of scientific progress."},{"question":"Given the question: The Earth being tilted on its axis causes ones side of the Earth to receive less energy from the Sun than the other side, and solar energy is power.

Here is a hypothesis: Click here if you missed a link. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","response":"Let's analyze the premise and the hypothesis step by step. Step 1: Understanding the premise The premise states: \\"If you missed our link earlier, click here.\\" This means that if a person didn't see the link before, they should click on the provided link to access the content. Step 2: Understanding the hypothesis The hypothesis states: \\"Click here if you missed a link.\\" This statement implies that if a person missed any link, they should click on the provided link. Step 3: Comparing the premise and the hypothesis Both the premise and hypothesis involve clicking on a link if the user has missed it. The main difference is that the premise specifically mentions \\"our link,\\" meaning a particular link, while the hypothesis refers to \\"a link,\\" which could mean any link. Step 4: Evaluating the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis To determine if the premise being true also makes the hypothesis true, we must consider the logical connection between them. If a person missed the specific link mentioned in the premise (i.e., the premise is true), they would indeed click on the provided link. This action aligns with the hypothesis's broader condition of clicking a link if a user missed one. Therefore, if the premise is true (a person missed the specific link), it also holds true for the hypothesis (clicking the link if they missed one in general). However, it's essential to highlight that the hypothesis encompasses a broader range of situations where the user may have missed other links, not just the specific one mentioned in the premise."},{"question":"Read the following article and answer the question.

If your pilot is forced to turn back only for his lack of passing a certain test, you will be certainly shocked. This very thing happened to the passengers on Flight BE1431 on Thursday. Just minutes before landing on Charles de Gaulle Airport , Paris, the pilot, a very experienced one, told his passengers, \\"Unfortunately I'm not qualified to land in Paris for the poor visibility. To do so a level II qualification is required, which I have not gained. We'll have to fly back.\\" Then, you may guess how the passengers felt about their flight back to the starting airport.

During Tool's post-Ænima hiatus to deal with their legal issues, Keenan began working with Billy Howerdel, Tool's guitar tech through the Ænima tour, on a different project. The supergroup they formed, A Perfect Circle, began performing in 1999 and released its first album Mer de Noms in 2000. They released a successful follow-up in 2003 titled Thirteenth Step, a reference to twelve-step programs (many of the songs were written from the perspective of recovery). Both albums were eventually certified platinum. Their subsequent 2004 album, eMOTIVe, was primarily composed of covers, except for the singles \\"Counting Bodies Like Sheep to the Rhythm of the War Drums\\"—a song inspired by \\"Pet\\" that was originally released on Thirteenth Step—and \\"Passive\\". Keenan later characterized the record as a political album with which he \\"tested the waters\\" and was subsequently \\"crucified\\" for it because of the content. It was certified gold the month after its release. That same year they released the DVD and CD set entitled aMOTION, which was certified platinum within a month of its release. Howerdel reported in a May 2006 interview with MTV that the supergroup's work was concluded for the time being. After more than two years since the band's last release, Keenan was asked about the status of A Perfect Circle during an interview with Revolver. He stated: The real problem with running Tool and A Perfect Circle at the same time was they both operate the same way. They're both live touring bands with a label, still working under the old contract mentality. So I thought it was time to let A Perfect Circle go for now and let Billy explore himself. It's tough for a guy who went from being a guitar tech [for Tool] to being in a band with a pretentious, famous singer and having to live in that shadow. It was important for Billy to go and do his own thing and really explore his own sound and let people hear what he has to say and how he would do it on his own, and then we'll get back and do some A Perfect Circle stuff.

Given the context: Why did Addison do this? A:","response":"To have a few hours of fun."},{"question":"Is the following sentence linguistically acceptable? Which book are you reading?","response":"Yes, the sentence \\"Which book are you reading?\\" is linguistically acceptable, and it effectively communicates a query regarding the text that the respondent is currently engaging with. The grammatical structure of the question adheres to the standard rules of English while also conforming to several linguistic criteria, which I will detail below. 1. Syntax: The sentence follows the subject-verb-object (SVO) word order, which is typical in English interrogative sentence structures. The subject is implied within the word \\"you,\\" the verb is \\"are reading,\\" and the object is \\"which book.\\" In a question format, an auxiliary verb (\\"are\\") is utilized as an accompaniment to the main verb (\\"reading\\") and appears before the subject to illustrate a proper interrogative structure. 2. Morphology: The components of the sentence comprise appropriate morphemes - the smallest units of meaning in language. Each word is composed of morphemes that appropriately contribute to the overall sense of their respective terms. For instance, \\"reading\\" is an action and consists of the morpheme \\"read\\" (to interpret text) plus the suffix \\"-ing,\\" which reflects the continuity or progression of the action. 3. Semantics: The semantics of the sentence relate to the meaning derived from its words and the relationships between them. The query aims to uncover the particular book that the person addressed is reading. Each word has a specific meaning, and the combined meanings create a coherent and meaningful question. 4. Pragmatics: Pragmatics refers to the context-dependent interpretation of linguistic messages. This query's meaning can be clearly understood within a social setting where speakers use language to exchange questions and information. It is appropriate for a speaker to ask this question to gather further information about another person's current reading activity. 5. Phonology: Phonology is the study of the pattern of sounds in languages. The sentence demonstrates acceptable phonetic structures and sound patterns that can be articulated by native English speakers. It contains a variety of consonants and vowels which follow well established phonotactic rules. In conclusion, the sentence \\"Which book are you reading?\\" is a linguistically acceptable inquiry in the English language. It satisfies the syntactic, morphological, semantic, pragmatic, and phonological criteria necessary for effective communication."},{"question":"Summarize this article: President Obama, clearly angry, let loose on House Republicans in what was, for him, an extraordinary fit of pique Friday night after talks with Speaker John Boehner broke down. President Obama at the White House press room Friday afternoon. \\"One of the questions that the Republican Party's going to have to ask itself is, can they say 'yes' to anything?” Obama said. It was President Obama’s Howard Beale moment: He was mad as hell, and not going to take it anymore. The president had just been informed late Friday afternoon that Republican House Speaker John Boehner was breaking off talks over a deal to enact major deficit reduction and raise the federal debt ceiling. And there is only a week and a half to go until Aug. 2, at which points the US risks a potentially catastrophic default without new borrowing authority. The White House hastily called reporters to the briefing room, and Mr. Obama let 'er rip. “I've been left at the altar now a couple of times,” the steely-eyed president said. “And I think that, you know, one of the questions that the Republican Party's going to have to ask itself is, can they say 'yes' to anything?” “Can they say yes to anything?” he repeated. “I mean, keep in mind it's the Republican Party that has said that the single most important thing facing our country is deficits and debts.” Obama said that he had put forward a package that would significantly cut deficits and debt in a way that does not raise individual tax rates. It is compatible, an exasperated Obama said, with the no-tax pledge that “a whole bunch of these folks signed on to, because we were mindful that they had boxed themselves in.” The challenge, he said, “has to do with the seeming inability, particularly in the House of Representatives, to arrive at any kind of position that compromises any of their ideological preferences – none.” The Democrats had done their part and agreed to compromises that were difficult to swallow, he said. Now it’s the Republicans’ turn. “If you want to be a leader, then you got to lead,” he concluded, then turned and walked briskly from the room. Those are mere highlights from a 30-minute primal scream, the likes of which Washington has not seen from a president known for his near-preternatural calm, both as a candidate and since assuming office. Obama was clearly fed up. And his emotion was authentic. Obama seemed to be demanding the respect due a president of the United States. The Boehner walkout – not his first since debt negotiations began – in fact will be short-lived. Obama called on both parties’ congressional leaders to meet with him at the White House at 11 a.m. Saturday. Mr. Boehner said he would attend. Obama also faces pressure from his own political base, which has expressed frustration that he seems to be doing all the compromising – see cuts to entitlement programs – while the Republicans insist on sticking to their “no new taxes” mantra. A CNN/ORC International Poll released Friday showed Obama’s job approval rating down to 45 percent, in part a result of a decline in liberal support. The president’s approval rating among liberals dropped to 71 percent, a low for his presidency, the poll found. Another data point: 1 in 4 Americans who disapprove of his job performance say he has not been liberal enough. So the president’s show of pique may have been as much aimed at Democrats as at congressional Republicans, whom he needs to believe that he means business. Obama also needs to win back independent voters if he is to win reelection next year. Polls show that independents strongly favor compromise in the debt and deficit talks. ||||| After rarely courting over the previous two years, the pair had an intense summer bromance they’ll never forget: a big outing, frequent dates (albeit with an occasional third wheel), shared secrets, big dreams, their friends cheering them on. But it was promises, promises – all the time promises. Then President Barack Obama began to complain that Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) never wants to talk about problems – he just leaves. Boehner stewed that Obama doesn’t know what he really wants, and keeps changing his mind. There were breakups and reconciliations.

To make sure their side of the story got out, both of them went on live TV to spill all the gory details: the betrayals, the dalliances, an ignored phone call, an unhealthy obsession with the base, the failure to deliver at climactic moments. In a 12-paragraph “Dear Colleague” letter to House Republicans after the markets closed, Boehner wrote: “A deal was never reached, and was never really close. In the end, we couldn’t connect. Not because of different personalities, but because of different visions for our country.” Obama was left alone at the altar – scorned, fuming. “Up until sometime early today when I couldn’t get a phone call returned, my expectation was that Speaker Boehner was going to be willing to go to his caucus and ask them to do the tough thing but the right thing,” the president seethed during an epic dinnertime appearance in the White House briefing room. Pressed for details on the phone slight, he rubbed it in: “I’m less concerned about me having to wait for my phone call returned, than I am the message that I received when I actually got the phone call.” The conspiracy theory among some reporters and staffers was that the president and the speaker each knew what they were going to have to cave on at the last moment, and may have even told each other: “Look, this is what I have to say to get my people on board. It’ll help if we look mad at each other. It’ll turn out fine.” If that’s the deal, they should both get Academy Awards. Going before cameras in a yellow tie, just over half an hour after the president, a placid Boehner declared: “The discussions we’ve had with the White House have broken down … [T]he White House moved the goalpost.” Looking down at notes, he continued: “I take the same oath of office as the president of the United States. I’ve got the same responsibilities as the president of the United States. And I think that’s for both of us to do what’s in the best interests of our country. And I can tell you that it’s not in the best interests of our country to raise taxes during this difficult economy.” Concluding his opening statement, he zinged: “I’m confident that the bipartisan leaders here in the Congress can act. If the White House won’t get serious, we will.” In response to the first question, Boehner took a shot by saying that he wasn’t going to take a shot: “Dealing with the White House is like dealing with a bowl of Jell-O. I’m not going to get into the partisan sniping that we heard earlier.” There’s been plenty of theater and posturing, but last evening’s blowup sure looked like the real thing. Republicans don’t like the term “grand bargain,” which has negative connotations with their people. They prefer “big deal.” Whatever you call it, it looks more distant than ever. ||||| The pair had an intense summer bromance and breakup they’ll never forget. | AP Photo The Obama-Boehner breakup After rarely courting over the previous two years, the pair had an intense summer bromance they’ll never forget: a big outing, frequent dates (albeit with an occasional third wheel), shared secrets, big dreams, their friends cheering them on.

Travelers might want to learn the language of the country they're visiting, or perhaps someone has a friend who speaks another language, and they want to be able to engage in conversations together. With language learning apps, courses, and immersion programs, it seems like there are many opportunities for people to learn various languages.

In China, I had English classes five times a week since fifth grade. However, I didn't know how different textbook English could be from everyday English until I came to Hotchkiss School, Connecticut. When I first studied English, I was told to say,\\"I am fine\\" when people say \\"How are you?\\" But in the US, I found that people say, \\"I am good\\" or \\"I'm tired\\". One day, someone greeted me with \\"What's up?\\" It made me _ . I thought for a moment and then smiled because I didn't know what to say. Since then, I have discovered more and more differences between Chinese and US cultures. To my surprise, US girls spend a lot of time in the burning sun to get a tan . However, in China, girls try every possible way to get their skin paler, or \\"whiter\\". I was also surprised by how hardworking US students are .

Answer: As the author of two highly influential pamphlets at the start of the American Revolution , he inspired the Patriots in 1776 to declare independence from Britain. Question: what kind of person was thomas paine The answer to this question is:","response":"Yes, Thomas Paine was an influential figure who played a crucial role in the American Revolution by inspiring the Patriots in 1776 to declare independence from Britain through his writing of two notable pamphlets. Thomas Paine was a complex and multifaceted person who defies easy characterization. However, one can try to understand his personality and character based on his writings, actions, and beliefs. Some aspects of Paine's personality that stand out include the following: 1. Idealistic: Throughout his life, Paine held and advocated for a set of core beliefs centered around individual rights, freedom, democracy, and equality. He believed in the ideal of a just society and dedicated himself to promoting those ideas through his writings and activism. 2. Revolutionary: Paine was a true revolutionary, both in the sense of being a key figure in the American Revolution and in the broader context of challenging established norms and institutions. He was not only committed to the American cause but also played a vital role in the French Revolution through his writings. 3. Persuasive Communicator: Paine had a unique ability to convey complex ideas and arguments in an accessible and persuasive manner. His pamphlets, like \\"Common Sense\\" and \\"The American Crisis,\\" were instrumental in rallying support for the revolutionary cause. He was able to express his ideas clearly and passionately, which resonated with the masses. 4. Fearless and Resilient: Paine did not shy away from challenging authority and expressing controversial ideas, even when it put him in danger. He faced significant backlash and criticism from both his political enemies and sometimes even his allies. Despite numerous setbacks, including imprisonment in France during the French Revolution, Paine remained committed to his principles and continued to write and campaign for his ideas. 5. Visionary: Paine was not just concerned with the immediate issues at hand, but he also sought to develop and promote innovative ideas for a better future. For example, in his work \\"Agrarian Justice,\\" he argued for a social security system to provide for the poor, elderly, and disabled—a concept far ahead of its time. 6. Humanist: Paine's writings were deeply influenced by his humanist beliefs, which emphasized the importance of reason and science in the pursuit of knowledge and human progress. He firmly believed in the capacity of individuals to change their circumstances and thought that progress could be achieved through rationality and cooperation. In summary, Thomas Paine was an idealistic, revolutionary, persuasive communicator, fearless, resilient, visionary, and humanist. Through his influential pamphlets and relentless activism, he played a pivotal role in shaping the course of the American Revolution and inspiring patriots to fight for independence. His writings and ideas continue to resonate today as symbols of freedom and democracy."},{"question":"Paul's Plate<br>Paul was hungry and made a sandwich. He put the sandwich on his favorite plate.

Screengrabs: Sky Sports The Decision Review System was again under the spotlight after the opening morning of the third Ashes Test at Emirates Old Trafford. Australia reached lunch at 92 for two but were left aggrieved after Usman Khawaja was given out by the third umpire, Kumar Dharmasena, caught behind off Graeme Swann. Khawaja almost immediately reviewed the decision by Tony Hill, the on-field umpire, to give him out and the Hot Spot technology appeared to back him up with no mark on the bat. Dharmasena saw differently though, upholding the on-field call after a lengthy delay, in a decision branded \\"shocking and ridiculous\\" by Shane Warne in the Sky commentary. \\"There was daylight between bat and ball, there was no Hot Spot and no noise,\\" the former Australia leg-spinner said. \\"The only noise was when the bat hit his pad. That's a shocker, that's an absolute shocking decision. You can see the bat hitting the pad, the ball goes past, no noise. There was clear evidence there as well. That is a ridiculous decision.\\" I've just sat down to watch the test. That was one of the worst cricket umpiring decisions I have ever seen. KRudd Kevin Rudd, the Australian prime minister, tweeted his reaction: \\"I've just sat down to watch the test. That was one of the worst cricket umpiring decisions I have ever seen.\\" The incident overshadowed Chris Rogers' progress to a career-best unbeaten 67, during which time the 35-year-old opener also passed 20,000 first-class runs. England were unable to make a breakthrough in the opening hour as Australia made chanceless progress to 47 without loss. After Michael Clarke elected to bat after winning the toss the England bowlers did find some early movement. Stuart Broad snaked the ball past Shane Watson's defences from consecutive deliveries while Rogers squirted a couple of boundaries away backward of point. Rogers was surprisingly the more fluid of the openers and produced the shot of the first hour when he pushed James Anderson through a vacant mid-off for four. England attempted to coerce an uncharacteristically circumspect Watson out of his shell with the opener loosely driving at a wide-ish Broad ball just short of point. As the opening stand passed 50 England skipper Alastair Cook swung Anderson around to the Statham End, but Rogers greeted the move with three fours from the over to reach his half-century from 49 balls. England got the breakthrough in the 17th over when Tim Bresnan found just enough seam movement to find Watson's edge as he pressed forward. Alastair Cook pouched the simple chance at first slip but the controversy of the morning soon followed. And people say you should Walk .... No chance when you get decisions like that.... #Ashes Khawaja played his part in his downfall, thrashing needlessly at a wide ball that turned further from Swann, but he appeared to have reason to feel aggrieved after the Hot Spot replay appeared to show he did not hit the ball. Dharmasena watched over the visual images more intently, however, before sending the batsmen on his way to prompt condemnation from not only Warne but also former England skipper Michael Vaughan, who tweeted: \\"And people say you should Walk … No chance when you get decisions like that … #Ashes\\".

The series is set in the world of Corona, principally in the kingdoms of Honce-the-Bear and Behren, and amongst the nomadic To-gai-ru. The Saga is separated into two trilogies bridged by a single book, \\"Mortalis\\". The saga has an accompanying roleplaying game, entitled \\"Demon Wars\\". - Earth, otherwise known as the world, is the third planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life. It is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets. - A fantasy world is a fictional universe created in fiction media, such as literature, film or games. Typical fantasy worlds involve magic or magical abilities, nonexistent technology and sometimes, either an historical or futuristic theme. Some worlds may be a parallel world tenuously connected to Earth via magical portals or items; a fictional Earth set in the remote past or future; or an entirely independent world set in another universe. - A fictional universe is a self-consistent imaginary setting with events, and often other elements, that differ from the real world. It may also be called an imagined, constructed or fictional realm (or world). Fictional universes may appear in novels, comics, films, television shows, video games and other creative works. - Corona is the name of the fantasy world in which R.A.

When people cut down trees, animals living there might have trouble finding things they need to be happy and healthy. Now, let's look at the options: 1) Air is all around us, so even if trees are cut down, animals can still breathe, so it's not air. 2) Water is important, and sometimes animals depend on trees to get to water sources. When trees are gone, they might have to be more careful about how much water they use. So, water is a good option. 3) Legs are a part of an animal's body, so they can't really conserve them because of logging. So, it's not legs. 4) Food is what animals eat, and many animals depend on trees and plants for food. When there are fewer trees, there's less food for them to eat. So, they have to be more careful about how much they eat. So, food is also a good option. So, the best answer is: animals have to conserve their water (option 2) and food (option 4) because of human logging activities."},{"question":"Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: I’m sitting at the airport on a Sunday morning waiting for my flight to Las Vegas for the now-annual pilgrimage to the NamesCon conference. A few years ago, Vegas was one of my “bucket list” places – one of those iconic cities that one should visit at least once in their life. For me, once was enough. This is now my 4th (I think?) trip to Vegas, and while the city has a lot to offer, it’s just not my cup of tea. For one thing, I’m not a gambler, like at all. I don’t have anything against it, I just don’t enjoy it. It either feels pointless or stressful to me. The city itself makes me a little sad – in some cases, it reeks of desperation. Last time I was there, my cab driver entertained me with stories of how she was working 3 jobs to save up enough to join some mega-massive bingo game. She won a small jackpot a few years back and that allowed her to work only one job for a few months. She was hoping to win again so she could cut back to 1 or 2 jobs. I wondered how many people do similar things – gambling their money away, in big or small chunks, in the hopes of that big score and in the process, putting themselves in a not-great financial situation. I suppose as long it makes them happy, then it’s all OK, but I can’t help but think someone like my cab driver might be happier overall if she only worked 1 job instead of 3, instead of working extra jobs to save up money to gamble her way to financial freedom. But that’s for her to decide, not me. The juxtaposition of extreme and in-your-face wealth and the homeless people on the Strip also makes me sad. It’s difficult to see people begging for food and sleeping on the street while all around you, millions of dollars are poured into creating a massive playground with every type of indulgence possible. But I’m the first to say that I’ve enjoyed staying in some of the nicer hotel properties there and eating several excellent meals at some of the finer restaurants in the area, so I’m not exactly helping to solve the problem.

It shows a scene from the Histories by Herodotus, in which Candaules, king of Lydia, invites his bodyguard Gyges to hide in the couple's bedroom and watch his wife Nyssia undress, to prove to him her beauty. Nyssia notices Gyges spying and challenges him to either accept his own execution or to kill Candaules as a punishment. Gyges chooses to kill Candaules and take his place as king. The painting shows the moment at which Nyssia, still unaware that she is being watched by anyone other than her husband, removes the last of her clothes. Etty hoped that his audience would take from the painting the moral lesson that women are not chattels and that men infringing on their rights should justly be punished, but he made little effort to explain this to audiences. The painting was immediately controversial and perceived as a cynical combination of a pornographic image and a violent and unpleasant narrative, and it was condemned as an immoral piece of the type one would expect from a foreign, not a British, artist. It was bought by Robert Vernon on its exhibition, and in 1847 was one of a number of paintings given by Vernon to the nation. The work retained its controversial reputation in later years, and when The Art Journal bought the reproduction rights to Vernon's former collection in 1849 they did not distribute reproductions of Candaules.

And the answer is?","response":"The island you are referring to, home to a monastery and lying off the coast of South Wales opposite the picturesque town of Tenby, is Caldey Island. Caldey Island, a small island spanning about 1.5 miles long and 1 mile wide, is situated approximately 2.5 miles off the Pembrokeshire coast in South Wales, UK. The island is well-known for its monastic history and religious significance dating back to the 6th century. Visitors to the island are often drawn by its natural beauty, idyllic sandy beaches, and the tranquility it offers, in addition to its religious sites. The religious community on Caldey Island was first established by Celtic monks in the 6th century. Owing to the Viking invasions, the monastery was abandoned for a short period in the late 10th century. With the Norman Conquest in the 11th century, the island’s monastery was reoccupied, and the foundation of an Augustinian priory was laid. However, the best-known religious community on Caldey Island is the Cistercian Order, which arrived there in the early 20th century. The Cistercian monks constructed an impressive Italian-inspired monastery, known as the Caldey Abbey, in 1910.

Answer choices: - photosynthesis - kinetic energy - genetic diversity - activation energy - stamina - bloom time - nutrients - gene flow Answer:","response":"Answer: photosynthesis Step 1: Understand the question The question states that when a plant grows, photosynthesis may increase. It then asks what else may increase when a plant grows, providing a list of options. Step 2: Eliminate irrelevant options - Kinetic energy: This is energy of motion and is not directly related to plant growth. - Genetic diversity: This refers to the variety of genes within a population, not an individual plant growth process. - Activation energy: This is the energy required for a chemical reaction to occur, not specifically related to plant growth. - Stamina: This term is related to the endurance of animals, not plants. - Bloom time: While this may be affected by plant growth, the question specifically linked photosynthesis to growth, making it a stronger answer. - Nutrients: Although important for plant growth, the question specifically links photosynthesis to growth. - Gene flow: This is the transfer of genetic information from one population to another, not specifically related to an individual plant's growth. Step 3: Justify the chosen answer Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into sugars, which provide energy for growth. As a plant grows, the surface area of its leaves may increase, allowing it to capture more sunlight and carry out more photosynthesis. Therefore, the most relevant answer is photosynthesis, as it is directly stated to increase when a plant grows."},{"question":"Given the below context: Further recognition came with the hanging of one of Fuller's paintings, Summer Breezes, at the Royal Academy in 1904.

Learn more ||||| President Donald Trump walks with first lady Melania Trump to Marine One on the South Lawn of the White House on Aug. 29. | Jacquelyn Martin/AP Melania's stiletto sideshow As the first lady departed to see storm fallout in Texas, Twitter erupted with critiques of her shoe choice. Melania Trump, the former model and reluctant first lady, often lets her fashion choices do the talking for her. Since her belated move into the White House in June, Melania Trump hasn’t yet announced an issue, or even an area of interest, for which she plans to advocate from her powerful platform. She has made few public speeches or statements, beyond introductions at campaign rallies she attends with her husband. But she’s dutifully stepped into the silent role of enhancing her husband by appearing impeccably and appropriately dressed by his side. Story Continued Below “Classy and conservative,” were the reviews from the local Saudi Arabian press after the first lady landed in Riyadh last spring dressed in a black, belted jumpsuit. The deep red Christian Dior “bar suit” she wore to visit Paris for Bastille Day in July was deemed to be a culturally appropriate choice highlighting an icon of French fashion. But on Tuesday, she appeared to put the wrong foot forward when she boarded Marine One, en route to visit emergency responders in hurricane-ravaged Texas, wearing towering black snakeskin stilettos. The emblematic first image of the first lady heading off to visit a hurricane in heels — a moment that the president has seized on as an opportunity to project strength and show off decisive leadership — instead became another symbol of a White House that can often seem out of touch.

Lisa Kline, who worked as a stylist to vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin during the 2008 election, said in an interview she thought “it was a mistake in the message it relays. A lot of eyes were on them. They’re going to a devastated area. She should be dressed accordingly.” The heels at least temporarily stole the spotlight from a gloomy president who aides said has been buoyed by what he sees, so far, as an effective coordinated response to a record-breaking storm. “Tan suit looks pretty good today, doesn’t it?” Valerie Jarrett, a former top adviser to President Barack Obama, tweeted, referring to the Republican outcry over Obama’s summer look to discuss serious national security issues at a news conference in 2014. Former first lady Michelle Obama also created her own fashion scandal in 2009, when she wore a pair of 540 Lanvin sneakers to volunteer at a food bank in Washington. “Small gestures send big messages,” journalist Jamil Smith wrote on Twitter, regarding the first lady’s shoe choice. “It isn’t that they keep getting it wrong. They don’t care about getting it right.” On board Air Force One to Corpus Christi, as the picture of the delicate heels ricocheted across the Internet, Melania Trump changed into a pair of bright, white sneakers, which looked fresh out of the box. She wasn’t the only female member of the Trump delegation wearing footwear that raised eyebrows — two other women were spotted on Air Force One wearing pumps and suede heels. The debate over the first lady’s shoes wasn’t an isolated fashion faux pas for the women who act as the face of the Trump administration. A week after her father’s inauguration in January, Ivanka Trump posted a picture of herself wearing a 5,000 silver Carolina Herrera gown — the same night protests erupted at airports across the country over Trump’s executive order banning refugees from majority-Muslim countries from entering the United States. People close to the first daughter said at the time she felt “terrible” about the dissonance between the image projected from her Kalorama mansion and the painful photographs of refugees being detained at international airports. But the picture still lives on her public Instagram account, where it has been applauded with more than 266,000 “likes.” Louise Linton, the wife of Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, seemed to relish her distance from the average, middle-class American woman when she posted a Jackie O.-inspired snap of herself on Instagram, while accompanying her husband on a “day trip” to Kentucky earlier this month aboard a government plane. In the photo, Linton tagged all of the designer labels she was sporting, including her Hermes scarf and her Valentino rockstud heels. She then lashed out with snide vitriol at a mother of three from Oregon who expressed distaste at her public post. An apology came later, via a crisis-managing publicist, in which Linton called the post and her comments “highly insensitive.” There was no acknowledgment from the White House that the first lady’s storm attire was at all off-key. Instead, her staff blamed the media for creating a “sad” side circus to an otherwise somber day. “It’s sad that we have an active and ongoing natural disaster in Texas,” said Stephanie Grisham, a spokeswoman for the first lady, “and people are worried about her shoes.” Later Tuesday, the first lady’s office released a statement on the storm. “I want to be able to offer my help and support in the most productive way possible, not through just words, but also action,” the first lady said. “What I found to be the most profound during the visit was not only the strength and resilience of the people of Texas, but the compassion and sense of community that has taken over the state. My thoughts and prayers continue to be with the people of Texas and Louisiana.” ||||| Vanessa Friedman ON THE RUNWAY When is a shoe not just a shoe? When it is a pair of very high, needle-thin heels worn by the first lady of the United States on her way to the site of a natural disaster. Then it becomes a symbol for what many see as the disconnect between the Trump administration and reality; another example of the way in which this president and his family continue to define “appropriate” their own way; and an excuse for partisan name-calling. Or so became apparent Tuesday morning when President Trump and his wife left the White House to fly to Texas for a briefing on the devastation caused by Hurricane Harvey, and Mrs. Trump appeared on the lawn in black pegged trousers, black shades, an olive green bomber jacket — and her stilettos, now a trademark. Very much the same kind of shoes, in other words, she has been wearing since long before she joined her husband on the campaign trail. Though by the time the plane had landed Mrs. Trump looked altogether more grounded, in white sneakers and crisp white shirt, with a ponytail pulled through a black baseball cap emblazoned with the word “FLOTUS,” during her time in the air the original shoes went from being mere footwear to objects of vilification thanks to social media’s specific kind of alchemy. Nothing says I'm in touch with the people like... https://t.co/ZD6cEfG0LS — Todd Stashwick (@ToddStashwick) August 29, 2017 In response to the critical reaction, Stephanie Grisham, Mrs. Trump’s communications director, emailed the following statement: “It’s sad that we have an active and ongoing natural disaster in Texas, and people are worried about her shoes.” The president and Mrs. Trump arriving in Corpus Christi, Tex., on Tuesday. Doug Mills / The New York Times That’s a fair point, to a certain extent. Certainly there was a backlash to the backlash, with Chelsea Handler, for example, being attacked in turn for her tweet attacking Mrs. Trump’s spikes. Not to mention some partisan crowing about the sneakers. Look at that - Melania in Jeans/Sneakers - Fake News Strikes Out again. Thank you POTUS & FLOTUS for showing support to the people of TX! pic.twitter.com/vqLw727ISy — DARSAVMO (@darsavmo) August 29, 2017 But to dismiss all this as merely much ado about heels, or an example of the pettiness of our divided electorate, is to ignore the reality of the current conversation around the president — to pretend not to notice how sensitized everyone has become to his unpredictable reactions to major events, and to deny the power of the telling detail to invite applause, condemnation or misinterpretation. It is precisely the superficial nature of clothing, the fact that garments are immediately accessible to all, that makes them the go-to stand-in for more nuanced, complicated emotions and issues. Mrs. Trump’s heels, after all — they appear to be classic Manolo Blahniks — are redolent of a certain clichéd kind of femininity: decorative, impractical, expensive, elitist (all adjectives often associated with the brand “Trump”). That they also are part of the identity the first lady brought to Washington — that her comfort level and ability to walk in exactly the kind of shoes that cause other women, wearing more solid shoes, to wince and crunch their toes in imaginary pain was part of her narrative and image from the start — does not obviate the fact that they have also come to represent her remove, for both good and ill. Women in the capital are generally more associated with sensible pumps than teetering patent leather numbers. This Mrs. Trump understands, which is why she changed into a more suitable costume (I use that word deliberately) for her arrival in Corpus Christi, Tex. The problem is that, as first lady, in an environment as fraught as the current one, there is no such thing as offstage. Even boarding a plane becomes a quasi-official moment in which all messaging, spoken or assumed, is mined for meaning. Mrs. Trump clearly knows this to a certain extent and has accepted it as an exigency of her job; how else to interpret the Dolce & Gabbana black lace coat and veil she wore to visit the pope on the president’s first foreign tour, or the classic red Dior suit she chose for her arrival in France for Bastille Day? Or the fact that, while hosting Akie Abe, the first lady of Japan, on Mrs. Abe’s visit to Mar-a-Lago, she wore flat sandals for their tour of the Morikami Museum and Japanese Gardens? (When in Florida. ...) The sharp point of the stilettos is that this kind of proactive analysis needs to be applied as consistently as possible across all public appearances (which, when you are in the White House, is all appearances). In Mrs. Trump’s job, as in her husband’s, details matter. Even shoes. Put your best foot forward, and all that. ||||| What is a summary?","response":"First Lady Melania Trump has faced criticism for her choice of footwear while departing for hurricane-hit Texas.

Some hid beneath the huge black seed-pods, some scuttled in the shadows of the nearby mountain. Patch knew from their smells there were at least a dozen of them. There was another smell too, mixed with that of the rats. The very same unsavory squirrel-smell he had detected in Silver's abandoned drey. \\"What do you want?\\" Patch asked, from his perch atop the mound of seed-pods. He was concerned but not yet frightened. Rats and squirrels were neither friends nor enemies. Squirrels were bigger and stronger, but rats were far more numerous. There were legends of long-ago wars between the two species, but no squirrel Patch knew had ever been attacked by rats. Squirrels lived aboveground, in the sun; rats frequented the night and the dark underworld. Of course, squirrels found rats disgusting and disagreeable -- but so did all other animals. An unusually large rat climbed up to the top of a seed-pod. It was almost as big as Patch himself. Rats usually avoided light, but this one stood unafraid beneath the sun, and demanded: \\"Who are you?\\" \\"I am Patch son of Silver, of the Seeker clan, of the Treetops tribe, of the Center Kingdom,\\" Patch said. \\"Who are you that asks?\\" \\"I am Snout,\\" the rat replied. \\"Why are you here?\\" \\"I came to look for food.\\" \\"This is our food. These mountains are ours.\\" \\"Your food?\\" Patch asked, bewildered. There was no ownership of food in the Center Kingdom, not until it had actually been eaten. \\"That's ridiculous. It's food.

Discover the source of the unsavory smell Patch, growing increasingly concerned as he realized the gravity of the situation, knew he had to act smartly to avoid further confrontation with the rats. Rather than engaging in any violence or submitting to the rats' claims to the food, he decided to focus on understanding the mysterious unsavory squirrel-smell he had detected among the rats. His senses sharpened by his survival instincts, Patch slowly and carefully scanned his surroundings, looking for any clues that could lead him to the source of this strange odor. He remembered smelling it in Silver's abandoned drey and realized there must be a connection between the two occurrences. He considered that something or someone could be mixing with both the rats and the squirrels, causing a potential threat not only to him but also to his clan and the entire Center Kingdom. As Patch quietly navigated the terrain of seed-pods and observed the rats, he found himself gradually piecing together the puzzle of this odd interaction between rats and squirrels. He discovered traces of fur and remnants of nuts that seemed out of place among the rat-occupied area, adding more weight to his initial suspicions. Following the scent and the observable clues, he soon came across an inconspicuous tunnel hidden behind a pile of seed-pods, emanating the same unsavory squirrel-smell. Patch's curiosity got the better of him, and he courageously entered the tunnel, cautiously navigating its twists and turns. With every step, the strange smell intensified, until he eventually found himself in a hidden chamber, right at the heart of the unsavory scent. The chamber was dimly lit and packed with stolen food, and to his shock, it was inhabited by a group of squirrels that had gone rogue, betraying their own kind by forming an alliance with the rats. These traitorous squirrels and the rats were working together in a sinister scheme to exploit and hog the food resources for themselves, disregarding the natural balance of life in the Center Kingdom and causing the rift between the rats and squirrels to widen. Patch knew he needed to act decisively and immediately to warn his clan and put an end to the alliance between these rogue squirrels and the rats, preventing further conflicts and ensuring the survival of his fellow squirrels in the face of such an unprecedented threat."},{"question":"What is the solution?

The dispute spilled into public view in extraordinary fashion on Tuesday when the first lady's office released a statement calling for deputy national security adviser Mira Ricardel's ouster as reports surfaced that President Donald Trump would fire the official. \\"It is the position of the Office of the First Lady that (Ricardel) no longer deserves the honor of serving in this White House,\\" the first lady's communications director Stephanie Grisham said in a statement on Tuesday. The White House announced Wednesday that Ricardel would be leaving her role as deputy national security adviser and would take a different role in the administration. The statement Tuesday from Melania Trump's office amounted to a stunning public rebuke by a first lady of a senior official serving in her husband's administration. It came after reports surfaced earlier Tuesday indicating Ricardel would be pushed out of her post after less than seven months on the job. Neither Ricardel nor spokespeople for the National Security Council responded to CNN requests for comment. Reflecting the fast-moving nature of the events, soon after a Wall Street Journal report surfaced Tuesday afternoon alleging Ricardel was fired and escorted off the White House grounds, a senior White House official denied the story to reporters. The official said Ricardel was still in her office Tuesday afternoon. Her departure leaves national security adviser John Bolton without one of his key allies in the White House, a deputy who has also shared his penchant for bureaucratic infighting. It was those sharp elbows that sources said led to the first lady's stinging statement, with Ricardel most recently feuding with members of the first lady's staff over her trip to Africa. One person familiar with the matter said Ricardel quarreled with the first lady's staff over seating on the plane and use of National Security Council resources. A White House official accused Ricardel of being dishonest about the feud and subsequently leaking stories to try to cover her behavior. And before her spat with the East Wing, Ricardel butted heads repeatedly with Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, a rivalry that was well-known within the Trump administration. Her disputes with Mattis preceded her time as deputy national security adviser, going back to the presidential transition when Ricardel sought to block Mattis from hiring certain people who had been critical of Trump or were viewed as insufficiently loyal to Trump. Tensions had also been rising between Ricardel and chief of staff John Kelly and his deputy Zach Fuentes in recent weeks, according to people familiar with the matter. Kelly and Fuentes believe Ricardel was leaking negative stories about them to the press, the people said. The dispute made it difficult for Ricardel to land in a top post in the Trump administration, though she was ultimately tapped for the position of undersecretary of commerce for export administration. Ricardel then joined the National Security Council as Bolton's deputy in April after he was named national security adviser. Ricardel has been key to Bolton's efforts to restructure the National Security Council and to help Bolton secure his place as an influential adviser to the President on all foreign policy matters. The drama surrounding Ricardel's ouster surfaced while Bolton was half a world away in Singapore, where he is attending the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit. West Wing caught off guard West Wing officials were caught off guard on Tuesday by the statement from the first lady's spokeswoman targeting Ricardel, two sources familiar with the matter said. White House officials were generally aware of the tensions between Ricardel and the first lady's office stemming from the Africa trip, but were stunned to see the first lady take such a public stance against a senior staffer through her spokeswoman. Sources said officials in the White House press shop were particularly annoyed that they didn't get a heads-up from the East Wing. West Wing and NSC officials are more upset at the way the East Wing handled the matter than the substance of the effort to push Ricardel out. One person said neither Trump, Kelly nor press secretary Sarah Sanders knew the statement was coming. Ricardel made few friends since she came on board in April, clashing with officials across the administration. Two administration sources said she was generally not well liked, though others pushed back, saying she was a respected member of the team and one of the highest ranking women in the West Wing. Even one NSC official who said they liked Ricardel said she \\"liked to pick fights with a lot of different folks\\" and suspected her latest feud with the first lady's office was \\"the last straw.\\" Another official was more forgiving: \\"She'd run through a brick wall for you but her personality isn't for everyone.\\" This story has been updated. ||||| Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. / Updated By Carol E. Lee, Kristen Welker, Hallie Jackson and Courtney Kube ­ WASHINGTON — John Kelly, mired in conflicts with a widening array of officials from the National Security Council to the office of the first lady, may soon depart the Trump administration, according to seven people familiar with the discussions. Nick Ayers, Vice President Mike Pence’s chief of staff, is among those being considered for the job, three of the people said, though President Donald Trump has mused about other possible candidates. Melania Trump has ensured the departure of one White House official, deputy national security adviser Mira Ricardel, after she had a series of run-ins with the first lady’s office. Stephanie Grisham, the first lady’s communications director, issued a pointed statement on Tuesday saying as much. “It is the position of the Office of the First Lady that she no longer deserves the honor of serving in this White House,” Grisham said. It’s an extraordinary, if not unprecedented, move for the first lady’s office to publicly call for the firing of a NSC official. Ricardel was seen at an official White House event with the president as Grisham's statement was was issued. Kelly’s time as chief of staff for most of the past year has been clouded by controversy and disagreements with Trump and various West Wing staff. But questions about his future in the White House recently became more serious after his repeated clashes with national security adviser John Bolton and his deputy, Ricardel. Kelly has also gotten on the wrong side of Melania Trump over staffing issues and travel requests. Some of the disputes with the East Wing have escalated to the president, the seven people familiar with the clashes said. SIGN UP FOR NBC BREAKING NEWS EMAILS \\"There have been instances where the East Wing staff were not treated as equals to the male-dominated decision makers in Chief Kelly’s office,\\" one White House official said. \\"Promotions were denied then finally granted after months of requests,\\" the official said. Melania Trump raised concerns with her husband earlier this year, amid the height of the controversy over his alleged affair with porn actress Stormy Daniels, that Kelly had repeatedly denied her requests to promote some of her aides, two White House officials told NBC News. The requests languished for months as Kelly insisted there weren’t enough available positions for the first lady’s aides to have senior titles, these people said. During this same period however, West Wing officials working for Kelly received promotions, the White House officials said. Having learned of the dispute, the president was furious and told Kelly to give the first lady, who has a smaller East Wing staff than her recent predecessors, what she wanted, these people said. \\"I don't need this shit,\\" Trump told Kelly, according to one person familiar with the conversation. Kelly wouldn’t be the first chief-of-staff to upset a first lady but history has shown that such disputes are tough to overcome. Nancy Reagan was at odds with President Ronald Reagan’s chief of staff, Donald Regan, which ultimately helped orchestrate his departure. And Hillary Clinton was at odds with President Bill Clinton’s chief of staff over her large role in policy decisions. Trump was especially annoyed, according to people familiar with his thinking, that he had to get involved in disputes involving his wife. His message to Kelly, according to one of them, repeatedly has been: \\"Deal with it.\\" The promotions of the first lady’s communications director, Grisham, and White House social secretary, Rickie Niceta, from special assistants to the president to deputy assistants to the president were ultimately cleared and announced in June. Kelly has also sparred with the East Wing over travel arrangements for the first lady’s staff, people familiar with the issue said. He often wouldn’t reserve space for Melania Trump’s two aides on Air Force One or on helicopters. They would find themselves without hotel rooms and not listed for motorcade movements. The omissions have caused last-minute logistical issues that the first lady viewed as a slight, these people said. The White House declined to comment for this story. \\"The East Wing is very focused on the First Lady’s initiatives and works independently,\\" Grisham said in a statement to NBC news. \\"However, we do collaborate on a variety of projects and work alongside many departments within the west wing. We have a very positive working relationship,\\" she said. The first lady also took issue with Kelly over the ousting in March of her director of operations, Justin Caporale, and of John McEntee, the president’s personal aide who had become close with the Trump family since working for him during the 2016 campaign, people familiar with the matter said. The first lady liked and trusted both of them, according to current and former White House officials, and viewed forcing them out \\"as personal affronts.\\" Some people close to the president believe Kelly’s handling of the East Wing at times is a significant threat to him maintaining his job. \\"There’s one problem John Kelly has that’ll do him in, and that’s the first lady,\\" one of them said. A White House official said the first lady has not pushed for his departure, noting that she likes Kelly personally and gets along with him. But tensions with her office, on top of his intensifying power struggle with Bolton, have reignited speculation that Trump will replace him before the end of the year. Last month, Kelly got into a heated argument with Bolton on immigration, ultimately storming out of the White House on Oct. 18, NBC News reported last month after learning that Bolton had criticized Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen as doing a terrible job on border security,­ an issue of top concern to the president. Nielsen is a close Kelly confidante, and Kelly viewed Bolton’s move as the latest example of the national security adviser circumventing his authority as chief of staff. Trump has been unhappy with Nielsen for months and she has not denied reports that the president has yelled at her in private settings. The Washington Post reported Tuesday that she may also be asked to depart the administration soon. Kelly and Bolton also have clashed over Ricardel, the deputy national security adviser, four people familiar with the issue said. Bolton recently learned that Kelly has quietly mounted an effort to oust Ricardel, these people said, and was furious. Ricardel was among Bolton’s first hires when he became national security adviser in March. She previously worked for him during the administration of former president George W. Bush. But at the NSC, Ricardel has gotten into several disputes with the East Wing, also over the First Lady’s trip to Africa in October. One White House official said that in that instance, Kelly intervened on behalf of the East Wing to smooth over the issues. Some current and former White House officials and other people close to the president said it’s the accumulation of incidents in recent months, on top of Kelly’s tensions with first daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner, that has led to a desire by the president to seek out a new chief of staff. Kelly is Trump’s second chief of staff, having replaced Reince Priebus just seven months into the presidency. Kelly left his position as Secretary for Homeland Security in August, 2017 and joined the White House to bring structure to a freewheeling West Wing. He curtailed access to the president and he cut back on the number of staff allowed in meetings. The efforts quickly won him enemies among the president’s confidants.

Tasos Katopodis / AFP - Getty Images A retired Marine general, Kelly maintained his job despite a steady flow of reports that he’s lost the confidence of much of the White House staff and has disparaged the president behind his back, NBC has reported. As conflicts have arisen, Trump has for months mused on and off about possible replacements for Kelly and vented his frustrations with his handling of the job. The president also arranged for some of his new hires this past spring, including Bolton, to report directly to him rather than his chief of staff. The White House has tried to quell speculation about Kelly’s exit, even issuing a statement in July that he would remain in the job through 2020. But few expressed confidence that would be the case. Ayers, who has worked to develop a relationship with Trump as the vice president’s chief of staff, is not the only candidate under consideration in what the three people familiar with the outreach describe as active discussions in the White House about replacing Kelly, possibly by the end of the year. The vice president’s office had no comment on the possibility of the appointment. One White House official, speaking on the condition of anonymity said \\"personnel decisions don’t mean anything until formally announced by the,\\" president. \\"Regardless, Nick and those close to him have never lobbied for this.\\" Melania Trump has kept a low profile as first lady and has surrounded herself with a smaller group of aides compared to her predecessors. In a rare, wide-ranging interview with ABC News during her Africa trip, she signaled, however, that she doesn’t hold back in private about her views on her husband’s aides. There currently are members of her husband’s staff she does not trust, she said, which makes it \\"harder to govern.\\" \\"You always need to watch your back,\\" she said. ||||| WASHINGTON—President Trump is considering new high-level staff changes in his administration—including discussing a potential successor for White House Chief of Staff John Kelly—as the West Wing makes preparations for the start of the final two years of Mr. Trump’s current term.

Options: - slaughterhouse - cow palace - dairy farm - cow pasture - barnyard Explain why a human would choose \\"cow pasture\\" to answer the question above: The answer to this question is:","response":"\\"cow pasture\\" A human might choose \\"cow pasture\\" as the answer to this question for the following reasons: Step 1: Understanding the context The question specifies that the heifer (a young cow that has not yet borne a calf) wants to join her herd. This implies that the location should be a place where multiple cows can live together in a social environment. Step 2: Eliminating inappropriate options - Slaughterhouse: A slaughterhouse is a place where animals are killed for meat. It is not a place where a heifer would go to join her herd, as it is not a living environment for animals. - Cow palace: While the name may reference cows, a cow palace is actually a large venue for events and exhibitions, not a place where cows live. - Dairy farm: A dairy farm is a possibility; however, it is primarily a facility where cows are raised for milk production. While there may be a herd of cows on a dairy farm, the question does not specify that the heifer and her herd are used for milk production. Step 3: Considering the remaining options - Cow pasture: A cow pasture refers to an open area, typically covered with grass, where cows are allowed to graze and roam freely. This would be an appropriate environment for a heifer to join her herd, as it provides the necessary space and resources for a group of cows to live together. - Barnyard: A barnyard may also contain a herd of cows, but it usually refers to an enclosed area where livestock is kept and doesn't necessarily emphasize grazing and free-roaming. Step 4: Choosing the best option Given the context and the elimination of other options, a human would choose \\"cow pasture\\" as the answer because it is the most suitable place for a heifer to join her herd due to the space, resources, and environment it provides for a group of cows to live together, with ample opportunity for grazing and social interaction."},{"question":"Title: deaf customers beware Review: I like the series, however it does not have subtitles. A severely hearing impairedindividual, I was very disappointed. It says that it has subtitles, but does not. I wil give the DVD to a friend. Is this product review negative? Answer:","response":"Yes, this product review can be considered negative, but it is specifically targeted towards a certain group of individuals, namely those who are deaf or severely hearing impaired. The reason for its negativity stems from the unmet expectation of subtitles being available for individuals who rely on them for accessibility or comprehension purposes. The reviewer starts by mentioning that they like the series, highlighting their interest and potential enjoyment of the content. However, the lack of subtitles quickly shifts the tone of the review to disappointment. It is important to note that the product claims to have subtitles, but fails to deliver on that promise. Consequently, the reviewer deems the product unsuitable for their needs due to their severe hearing impairment – a clear indicator of dissatisfaction for those seeking a product catering to deaf individuals or those with hearing difficulties. Adding to the negative sentiment, the reviewer decides to give the DVD to a friend as it doesn't suit their needs. This further emphasizes their own inability to benefit from the product and suggests that it is not valuable to them. In conclusion, while the product review is not entirely negative as it acknowledges the content's potential appeal, the absence of promised subtitles mars it with an overall negative tone. The review strongly cautions deaf customers or those with hearing impairments to be wary of the product, thus it can be deemed negative for its target readership."},{"question":"If something is very hard but you just manage to be able to do it, it can be called what? Options: - controvertible - interesting - easy - agreeable - bearable Let's think now! Step-by-step reasoning:","response":"Let's analyze each option step-by-step to determine which term best describes the situation where something is very hard but you just manage to be able to do it: 1. Controvertible: This term means \\"capable of being disputed or argued against\\". It doesn't directly relate to the difficulty of a task or your ability to do it. 2. Interesting: This term means \\"engaging someone's interest or attention\\". While an interesting task might be hard, the term itself doesn't specifically describe the difficulty or your ability to do it. 3. Easy: This term describes a task that doesn't require much effort or skill. Since the situation involves something very hard, \\"easy\\" is not the right choice. 4. Agreeable: This term means \\"pleasant or likable\\", and it doesn't directly describe the difficulty of a task or your ability to do it. 5. Bearable: This term means \\"able to be endured or tolerated\\". If something is very hard but you just manage to be able to do it, this term indicates that it was difficult enough to challenge you, but not so difficult that you couldn't handle it. Based on this reasoning, the best option for describing the situation is \\"bearable\\"."},{"question":"If \\"A man prepares a kite for flight.\\", can we conclude \\"There is a man.\\"?","response":"Yes, we can conclude that \\"There is a man.\\" Let's break it down step by step: Step 1: Understand the given statement The statement is: \\"A man prepares a kite for flight.\\" This statement talks about a man who is preparing a kite for flying. Step 2: Identify the subject in the statement The subject in the given statement is \\"A man.\\" This signifies the presence of a man in the scenario. Step 3: Derive the conclusion Since the statement talks about a man preparing a kite for flight, it implies that there is a man involved in the situation. Justification: The very mention of \\"A man\\" in the statement is an explicit declaration of the existence of a man. By stating that a man is doing an action (preparing a kite for flight), it can be logically concluded that \\"There is a man.\\""},{"question":"The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who is trapped? , can you please find it? En route to California to prospect for gold, ex-sheriff Hooker, professional gambler Fiske, and bounty hunter Luke Daly are forced to stop over in a tiny Mexican village by engine trouble on the ship they are taking. A desperate Leah Fuller hires the three men and local Vicente Madariaga, to rescue her husband, John, who is pinned under debris from a gold mine cave-in in hostile Apache territory. During the harrowing journey, Luke tries to force himself on Leah late one night, forcing Hooker to intervene. Leah tells Hooker that where her husband is trapped, once was a boom town, but a volcano eruption wiped it out, leaving only a church steeple and the mine uncovered by lava. The resident priest called it the \\"garden of evil\\". The Indians now consider the volcano sacred. The group then arrives at the mine. They find John unconscious, and they free him. Before John wakes up, Hooker sets the man's broken leg. When John regains consciousness, he accuses Leah of using him to get gold. Hooker talks to Leah later, about what her husband said; after he tells her that he has spotted signs of Apaches nearby, she offers him and the others all the gold they have dug up to take her husband away that night, while she remains behind to make it look like they are all still there.
