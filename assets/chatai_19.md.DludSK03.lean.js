Richard Hell was an innovator of punk music and fashion. He was one of the first to spike his hair and wear torn, cut and drawn-on shirts, often held together with safety pins. Malcolm McLaren, manager of the Sex Pistols, credited Hell as a source of inspiration for the Sex Pistols' look and attitude, as well as the safety-pin and graphics accessorized clothing that McLaren sold in his London shop, Sex. Context: Richard Lester Meyers grew up in Lexington, Kentucky in 1949. His father, a secular Jew, was an experimental psychologist, researching animal behavior. He died when Hell was 7 years old. Hell was then raised by his mother, who came from Methodists of Welsh and English ancestry. After her husband's death, she returned to school and became a professor. Hell attended the Sanford School in Delaware for one year, where he became friends with Tom Miller, who later changed his name to Tom Verlaine. They ran away from school together and a short time later were arrested in Alabama for arson and vandalism. Hell never finished high school, instead moving to New York City to make his way as a poet. In New York he met fellow young poet David Giannini, and moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico for several months, where Giannini and Meyers co-founded Genesis:Grasp. They used an AM VariTyper with changeable fonts to publish the magazine. They began publishing books and magazines, but decided to go their separate ways in 1971, after which Hell created and published Dot Books. Before he was 21, his own poems were published in numerous periodicals, ranging from Rolling Stone to the New Directions Annuals. In 1971, along with Verlaine, Hell also published under the pseudonym Theresa Stern, a fictional poet whose photo was actually a combination of both his and Verlaine's faces in drag, superimposed over one another to create a new identity. A book of poems credited to \\"Stern\\", Wanna Go Out?, was released by Dot in 1973. Question: Was his mother in his life?. Whats the answer?","response":"Yes, after Richard Hell's father passed away when he was 7 years old, his mother raised him. She even returned to school and became a professor following her husband's death. Thus, his mother was indeed an active part of his life."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Fact 1: Dilation occurs when cell walls relax.

Every hour of every day about three Americans on average are killed by drunken drivers, adding up to an incredible 250,000 over the past ten years. A drunken driver is usually defined as one with a 0.10 blood alcohol content or roughly three beers, glasses of wine or several glasses of whisky drunk within two hours. Heavy drinking used to be an acceptable part of the American manly image and judges were serious in most courts, but the drunken slaughter has recently caused so many well-publicized tragedies, especially involving young children, that public opinion is no longer so tolerant. Twenty states have raised the legal drinking age to 21, reversing a trend in the 1960s to reduce it to 18. After New Jersey lowered it to 18, the number of people killed by 18-20-year-old drivers more than doubled, so the state recently upped it back to 21. Reformers, however, fear raising the drinking age will have little effect unless accompanied by educational programs to help young people to develop \\"responsible attitudes\\" about drinking and teach them to resist peer pressure to drink. Though new laws have led to increased arrests and tests and, in many areas already, to a marked decline in accidents, some states are also punishing bars for serving customers too many drinks. A bar in Massachusetts was fined for serving six or more double brandies to a customer who \\"obviously drunk\\" and later drove off the road, killing a nine-year-old boy. As the accidents continue to occur daily in every state, some Americans are even beginning to speak well of the 13 years of national prohibition of alcohol that began in 1919, what President Hoover called the \\"noble experiment\\". They forgot that legal prohibition didn't stop drinking, but encouraged political corruption and organized crime. As with the booming drug trade generally, there is no easy solution. In America, public opinion about drunken driving has changed because _ . A) judges are no longer serious B) new laws are introduced in some states C) the problem has attracted public attention D) drivers do not appreciate their manly image A:","response":"C) the problem has attracted public attention"},{"question":"Select the correct answer: Which is an appropriate title for this article?

In five years Sam will be 3 times as old as Drew. If Drew is currently 12 years old, how old is Sam?","response":"Step 1: Determine Drew's age in five years. Since Drew is currently 12 years old, in five years, he will be 12 + 5 = 17 years old. Step 2: Set up an equation to express Sam's age in five years. We are given that in five years, Sam will be 3 times as old as Drew. We can express this as: Sam's age in 5 years = 3 * Drew's age in 5 years Step 3: Substitute Drew's age in five years into the equation. Sam's age in 5 years = 3 * 17 Step 4: Solve the equation to find Sam's age in five years. Sam's age in 5 years = 3 * 17 = 51 years Step 5: Find Sam's current age by subtracting 5 years.

Article: Our Community One Tuesday evening in the beginning of the fall 1996 semester at Shippensburg University, sirens sounded. These sirens were not in celebration; they were a cry to the university that something was wrong. A house, only one block away, was on fire. Nine of the university's students lived there. From the minute the word got out that help was needed, it seemed like everyone showed up. The victims of the fire were offered endless invitations for housing for the night. The very next day, everyone got into gear to do their part in helping them. Flyers were posted with items that were immediately needed, just to get these students through this next couple of days. Boxes for donations and money jars were placed in every residence hall . As a residence director, I went before the students in my hall to ask them to do what they could. I knew that college students don't have much, but I asked them to do their best: \\"Every little bit will help.\\" I really didn't think they could do much. I was proved wrong. At the hall council meeting the night after the fire, my residents decided to have a wing competition, where each wing of the building would team up to see who could bring in the most donations. I announced that the wing who won would receive a free pizza party. Thursday evening we announced over the PA system that we were beginning the wing competition. Within minutes, the place exploded. The single large box that I had placed in the lobby was overflowing. We quickly grabbed more boxes, and we watched as they, too, filled to the brim(;). Members of the resident assistant staff and I began to count the items. I was astonished by what I saw, and I was inspired by these kids. When we came to the final tally , the winners turned to me and announced that they would like to donate their winnings as well. They wanted the victims of the fire to have their pizza party.

In a similar manner, there are analogous carrier systems that move hydrophobic molecules through water. Channel molecules sit within a membrane and contain an aqueous channel that spans the membrane’s hydrophobic region. Hydrophilic molecules of particular sizes and shapes can pass through this aqueous channel and their movement involves a significantly lower activation energy than would be associated with moving through the lipid part of the membrane in the absence of the channel. Channels are generally highly selective in terms of which particles will pass through them. For example, there are channels in which 10,000 potassium ions will pass through for every one sodium ion. Often the properties of these channels can be regulated; they can exist in two or more distinct structural states. For example, in one state the channel can be open and allow particles to pass through or it can be closed, that is the channel can be turned on and off. Channels cannot, however, determine in which direction an ion will move - that is determined by the ion gradient across the membrane. The transition between open and closed states can be regulated through a number of processes, including the reversible binding of small molecules to the protein and various other molecular changes (which we will consider when we talk about proteins). Another method of channel control depends on the fact that channel proteins are i) embedded within a membrane and ii) contain charged groups. As we will see cells can (and generally do) generate ion gradients, that, is a separation of charged species across their membranes. For example if the concentration of K+ ions is higher on one side of the membrane, there will be an ion gradient where the natural tendency is for the ions to move to the region of lower K+ concentration.222 The ion gradient in turn can produce an electrical field across the plasma membrane. As these fields change, they can produce (induce) changes... Q: What type of molecules sit within a membrane and contain an aqueous channel that spans the membrane’s hydrophobic region?

Here's a breakdown of why that rating has been assigned: 1. Both sentences refer to a two-wheeled vehicle. The first sentence mentions a \\"red moped,\\" while the second sentence refers to a \\"red scooter.\\" While mopeds and scooters are not exactly the same thing, they share some similarities in design and function. Mopeds typically have bicycle-type pedals and a small engine, while scooters are engine-powered and do not have pedals. Nevertheless, both are modes of transportation that are smaller than motorcycles, making them somewhat similar. 2. Both sentences mention the color \\"red\\" in describing the vehicle. This specific detail links the two sentences since they are both describing a red-colored vehicle. 3. The third similarity is the location of the vehicles. In the first sentence, the moped is parked on a \\"sidewalk.\\" The second sentence says the scooter is \\"sitting on the street.\\" Although \\"sidewalk\\" and \\"street\\" are not the same, they are both outdoor, urban locations. Additionally, they tend to be close to each other, suggesting that the vehicle is parked near pedestrians and buildings. 4. Both sentences describe something happening in the background, but the details are different. In the first sentence, there is graffiti behind the moped, while the second sentence mentions a building behind the scooter. Both of these elements indicate an urban setting; however, the difference in the background details leads to the lack of a perfect score.

When kite surfer Cameron Dietrich and Colin Sutton spotted the distressed sea turtle they quickly dived in the ocean to try to rescue it. Scroll down for video. Touching: A sea turtle swims nose-to-nose with Cameron Dietrich after he freed it from tangled fishing nets. Rescue: Dietrich uses a dive knife to cut away the tangled mess of nets that had wrapped around the turtle. 'When I saw the turtle tangled up I jumped in the water and began to cut it free,' Dietrich told MailOnline. 'It was totally worn out from fighting for its life for last probably 12 to 20 hours.' Using a dive knife, Dietrich carefully cut away the tangle of rope and netting that had wrapped itself around a front fin, while Sutton helped the turtle to float. Once it had been freed, Dietrich described how he stayed beneath the turtle to make sure it had the strength to swim after its traumatic experience. Reassured that the turtle was going to be fine, Dietrich swam away from it, stopping a short distance away to watch the creature. But in an unexpected move, the turtle slowly circled back and returned to the surfer, stopping inches from his face and letting him gently hold it, as if to say thanks. Dietrich and his friends spotted the turtle in distress while they were spear fishing off the Mexico coast. Colin Sutton films on a GoPro camera as Dietrich dives in to help the turtle. Professional kite surfer Dietrich said sadly it has become common to see turtles and other wildlife injured by debris dumped in the oceans. 'It returned back to me on top of my chest and came right up to my face and. let me touch its under shell,' he said. 'It got right up to my mask then swam off.' 'For me, it was an unusual and wonderful moment,' he added. 'After it came up to my face it swam off into the blue straight.' Dietrich told MaiOnline that as a professional watersports athlete he has seen many animals trapped by the debris dumped in the oceans. 'We are being poor stewards of our ocean. It bothers me to both see the disregard for our planet but also the endangering of animals,' he said. Since the video of the touching rescue was uploaded on YouTube earlier this month it has been viewed more than 1.9 million times. The friends work quickly to free the sea turtle, which calmly allowed Dietrich to get close. The freed sea turtle started to swim away before suddenly turning back towards Dietrich.

Answer: Since the second half of the 20th century the associations of race with the ideologies and theories that grew out of the work of 19th-century anthropologists and physiologists has led to the use of the word race itself becoming problematic. Question: when did classification of races begin A:","response":"The classification of human races has a long and complex history, with its roots stretching back to antiquity. It is important to note that the concept of race has evolved over time and has been influenced by various factors such as culture, politics, and scientific advancements. The earliest classifications of human groups can be traced back to ancient civilizations like the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans, who categorized people based on factors such as geography and physical appearance. However, these classifications were primarily concerned with cultural, linguistic, and regional differences rather than rigid ideas about race and ethnicity. The modern concept of race began to emerge during the Age of Exploration and the subsequent period of European colonial expansion in the 15th and 16th centuries. European explorers and colonizers encountered diverse indigenous populations in the Americas, Africa, and Asia, which spurred their interest in understanding and classifying these groups. The European scholars of this period often relied on superficial physical characteristics such as skin color, facial features, and hair type to categorize indigenous people, which led to the development of early racial classifications. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the study of human variation and the classification of races became more systematic due to the rise of scientific racism and the influence of prominent thinkers such as Carl Linnaeus, Johann Friedrich Blumenbach, and Samuel George Morton. Linnaeus, the father of modern taxonomy, introduced a hierarchical classification system for humans in his 1758 work, \\"Systema Naturae.\\" He divided humans into four races: Homo sapiens europaeus (white Europeans), Homo sapiens asiaticus (Asians), Homo sapiens americanus (Native Americans), and Homo sapiens afer (Africans). Blumenbach, another influential naturalist, classified humans into five races in his 1775 work, \\"On the Natural Variety of Mankind.\\" He broadened Linnaeus's racial categories by adding the Malay race. Blumenbach's classification is considered more nuanced than Linnaeus's and formed the foundation for subsequent race classification systems. In the 19th century, the classification of human races became problematic due to the growing belief in racial hierarchy and the idea that certain races were inferior to others. Scientists like Samuel George Morton sought to justify this belief by measuring the skulls of various races in an attempt to prove that white Europeans were superior. Such pseudoscientific research fueled racist ideologies and provided a basis for eugenics and other exclusionary practices in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the second half of the 20th century, the advances in genetics, anthropology, and the understanding of human evolution have led to a reevaluation of racial classifications. Researchers now recognize that there is more genetic diversity within racial groups than between them, and no single genetic marker can distinguish one race from another. This has led to the understanding that the concept of race is a social construct that does not accurately reflect the complex pattern of human genetic variation. In conclusion, while the classification of human races has a long history, its foundations have been influenced by changing social, political, and scientific contexts. The modern understanding of race as a social construct rather than a scientifically robust concept has led to a shift in the way race is studied, with a greater focus on the complex interplay of genetics, culture, and environment in shaping human diversity."},{"question":"My son has been wanting to open up a manicure kit I have in my bedroom because he thinks the gloves are like boxing gloves .

Ledyba is a Flying-type bug with three abilities (Early Bird, Rattled, and Swarm), and one hidden ability. You will encounter this bug from red berry trees. Swarm - When HP is below 1/3rd, the bug's power increases to 1.5 times. Early Bird - Sleep conditions will last for half as long, rounding down. For example, half of three turns is 1.5, which rounds down to one turn. When the number of turns to sleep is one, half of this rounded down is zero, and the Pokémon wakes up instantly. Rattled - Its speed is raised by one stage when the Pokémon is hit by a Bug-type, Ghost-type, or Dark-type move. This bug will target your blueberry trees. It has Illuminate, Swarm, and Prankster ability, and also has one hidden ability, which will be unlocked when it reaches a certain level. Swarm - The same as Ledyba, this skill increases the bug's power to 1.5 times when HP is below 1/3. Illuminate - Raises the likelihood of meeting wild Pokémon. Prankster - Speed priority of category “Status moves” is increased by 1. This is a bug-type Pokémon known for its speed. This Pokémon has Oblivious, Tinted Lens, and Prankster ability, with one hidden ability. This Pokémon is classified as Firefly. Oblivious - The Pokémon cannot be under Attract condition or be taunted while having this ability. Tinted Lens - The power of “Not very effective” moves is doubled. Prankster - Just like Volbeat, Prankster causes the speed priority of category “Status moves” increase by 1. Burmy is classified as a bagworm; this Pokémon can be found in green berry trees and possesses two abilities (Shed Skin and Overcoat) and one hidden ability (available through transfer). Shed Skin - Every turn, it has 1 in 3 chances of healing from a status condition, such as Burn, Paralyze, Sleep, Poison, and Freeze.

Answer the above question based on the context below: After the Great War, Moore received an ex-serviceman's grant to continue his education and in 1919 he became a student at the Leeds School of Art (now Leeds College of Art), which set up a sculpture studio especially for him. At the college, he met Barbara Hepworth, a fellow student who would also become a well-known British sculptor, and began a friendship and gentle professional rivalry that lasted for many years. In Leeds, Moore also had access to the modernist works in the collection of Sir Michael Sadler, the University Vice-Chancellor, which had a pronounced effect on his development. In 1921, Moore won a scholarship to study at the Royal College of Art in London, along with Hepworth and other Yorkshire contemporaries. While in London, Moore extended his knowledge of primitive art and sculpture, studying the ethnographic collections at the Victoria and Albert Museum and the British Museum. The student sculptures of both Moore and Hepworth followed the standard romantic Victorian style, and included natural forms, landscapes and figurative modelling of animals. Moore later became uncomfortable with classically derived ideals; his later familiarity with primitivism and the influence of sculptors such as Constantin Brâncuși, Jacob Epstein, Henri Gaudier-Brzeska and Frank Dobson led him to the method of direct carving, in which imperfections in the material and marks left by tools became part of the finished sculpture. Having adopted this technique, Moore was in conflict with academic tutors who did not appreciate such a modern approach. During one exercise set by Derwent Wood (the professor of sculpture at the Royal College), Moore was asked to reproduce a marble relief of Domenico Rosselli's The Virgin and Child by first modelling the relief in plaster, then reproducing it in marble using the mechanical aid known as a \\"pointing machine\\", a technique called \\"pointing\\". Instead, he carved the relief directly, even marking the surface to simulate the prick marks that would have been left by the pointing... Answer:","response":"Instead of using a machine, Moore carved the relief of The Virgin and Child directly, marking the surface to simulate the prick marks that would have been left by the pointing machine."},{"question":"Rob likes to visit high mountainous locations. Last year he visited the the Alps mountains in Austria. There he saw an unique type of glacier called valley glacier. This year he went further east to visit the Ural mountains in Russia. There he didn't see any valley glacier. In which year Rob would not observe quarrying effect, this year or last year? Hint: Plucking, also referred to as quarrying, is a glacial phenomenon that is responsible for the erosion and transportation of individual pieces of bedrock, especially large \\"joint blocks\\". This occurs in a type of glacier called a \\"valley glacier\\". As a glacier moves down a valley, friction causes the basal ice of the glacier to melt and infiltrate joints (cracks) in the bedrock. The freezing and thawing action of the ice enlarges, widens, or causes further cracks in the bedrock as it changes volume across the ice/water phase transition (a form of hydraulic wedging), gradually loosening the rock between the joints. This produces large pieces of rock called joint blocks. Eventually these joint blocks come loose and become trapped in the glacier.","response":"From the given information, it seems that Rob would not observe the quarrying effect, also known as plucking, this year when he visited the Ural Mountains in Russia. This is because the description indicates that this specific type of glacial erosion is particularly associated with valley glaciers, which Rob saw last year in the Alps but did not encounter during his visit to the Ural Mountains. Quarrying, or plucking, happens when a glacier, specifically a valley glacier, moves along a valley. The basal ice at the lower part of the glacier melts as a result of friction, soaking into cracks and crevices in the bedrock. Upon refreezing, the ice can cause these cracks to expand through a process known as hydraulic wedging - a phenomenon that takes place due to volume changes related to the transition between ice and water. This process eventually dislodges large pieces of rock called joint blocks, which then become embedded within the moving glacier. Over time, these joint blocks contribute to the sculpting and reshaping of the valley through which the glacier is moving, leading to the erosion seen in many glaciated landscapes. Since the Ural Mountains did not have any valley glaciers during Rob's visit this year as per the provided information, it means that there were no suitable conditions for the quarrying process to occur. Hence, Rob would not have observed the effects of quarrying during this particular trip. On the other hand, during his trip to the Alps last year, Rob encountered a valley glacier, so it is likely that he would have observed signs of the quarrying effect. To witness this phenomenon, he may have spotted the joint blocks that had been dislodged from the bedrock and embedded in the ice or recognized patterns of erosion in the mountainous landscape. It's important to note though, that while valley glaciers are known for their quarrying effect, it doesn't necessarily mean that every valley glacier Rob comes across will showcase signs of quarrying. A lot depends on the specific environmental conditions, the glacier’s rate of movement, the characteristics of the bedrock, and the temperature - factors that can mean the difference between observable erosion activity and a seemingly static block of mountain ice. However, in general terms and based on the information provided, Rob would likely not have noticed the quarrying effect during his trip to the Urals this year."},{"question":"I got a question for you: After completing tryouts in Houston, Beauty and the Beast premiered on Broadway on April 18, 1994, starring Susan Egan and Terrence Mann as the eponymous Belle and Beast, respectively.

IT starts with a well-worn fiddle, held in equally well-worn hands above a tapping black cowboy boot. Then in comes the banjo, plucked with steel finger picks, followed by the autoharp, the mandolin, the percussive beat of an upright bass. Another banjo grabs the melody, and suddenly the room is bursting with knee-slapping, country-porch music. A man in a crisp checked shirt gets up and starts to dance, bouncing out a complicated bumbumBAM bumbumBAM with his feet, moving as smoothly as a Martha Graham dancer, hitting the floor on the downbeat. Wade Petty plays the fiddle at the Fries Theater. It is Thursday night in Fries (pronounced freeze), Va., population 600, on the wide New River. In the century-old Fries Theater, the silk wallpaper, once a glorious aquamarine embossed with gold ferns, is faded. A sign promises movies for 10 cents, 25 cents on weekends, but there hasn’t been a film here in years. The Fries high school closed in 1989 after the cotton mill that gave birth to this hamlet in 1902 shut down. But where the economy has faltered, the local music culture is thriving. Take a drive through the dozens of one-stoplight towns that are planted along highways that twist through this region’s blue hills and green valleys, and you’ll find that music is the manna of the community. Fries was my first stop on the music trail known as the Crooked Road — an official designation of the state of Virginia since 2004. The heritage of the path can be found in this dance, in that tune, learned by ear from house to house and passed down through generations. The Road isn’t one single highway — it’s a roughly 300-mile series of interconnected two-lane byways and long stretches of Route 58, which skims Virginia’s North Carolina and Tennessee borders all the way to Kentucky. The sound here is Appalachian: mountain music. Joe Wilson, who wrote a book on the Crooked Road, calls the area the “pickle barrel” of American music. “You know you can’t make a good pickle by squirting vinegar on a cucumber,” he said. “You have to let it sit.” Over five days in April, I rambled along part of the Crooked Road and towns around it, from Fries up to Ferrum and Floyd, back to Galax and out to Marion, dipping down toward Abington, and back to Galax again. With my partner, Ian, his parents and my 2-year-old daughter, Orli, I drove down roads that curve so dramatically that locals joke that you can see your own taillights as you round the bends. The drive cuts through pastures dotted with cows and horses and weather-beaten barns, some abandoned and left to splinter. Many see the land they sold in recent decades now covered in Christmas trees, a boom industry that has changed the landscape. Churches rise up one after the other: Baptist, Pentecostal, Methodist. “Google Doesn’t Satisfy All Searches,” reads one church sign. “Can’t Sleep? Try Counting Your Blessings,” says another. We traveled 370 miles in all, what with switchbacks and retracing our steps to hear just one more tune. We were following the songs that had blown this way and that like so many dandelion seeds across the Blue Ridge Mountains and through the foothills of Appalachia. Our lodgings included everything from a Hampton Inn to an eco-minded auberge decorated by local artists, to a Ragtime-era hotel, recently restored to its former glory. ALONG the way we stuffed ourselves with buttery biscuits, farm eggs and smokehouse Southern flavors that somehow taste different south of the Mason-Dixon line. Orli loved every minute of it; her affinity for the music was immediate. When she ran onto the dance floor at the Floyd Friday Night Jamboree, the man next to me caught my arm. “Let her be,” he said. “We’re mountain people — we’ll take care of her as our own.” She woke each morning singing the twang of the banjo. If there ever was a place where musical authenticity was born and nurtured, “raised up” as the people around here say, the Crooked Road is it. From the Carter Family Fold in Hiltons (the site of Johnny Cash’s last concert) and Clintwood, deep in coal country, to the farms near Floyd, music is still being made on fiddles and banjos, mandolins and guitars, dulcimers and autoharps. Every night you’ll find pick-up jams on front porches, performances in theaters and quartets that pack storefronts, an old courthouse and even a Dairy Queen. In summer the area is awash in festivals, from Dr. Ralph Stanley’s Memorial Day bluegrass festival in the mountains of Coeburn, Va., to the venerable Old Fiddlers Convention held every August in Galax. This region is where old-time and bluegrass was born. Old-time is dance music, simpler and older than bluegrass. Bluegrass is filled with vocal harmonies, many made famous by (relative) newbies like Alison Krauss and Gillian Welch. It is suited more for seated audiences than the foot-stomping dance I saw in Fries, which is known as flatfoot. Both genres evolved from tunes brought by Scotch-Irish and German settlers who traveled down the wagon trails from Pennsylvania. They brought dulcimers and fiddles and later picked up the banjo from former slaves. “It wasn’t real practical to bring a piano or an organ till there was a train,” said David Arnold, a Fries native whose wild white beard reached mid-sternum. I met him at a jam. It turned out he was the chairman of the Music Heritage Committee at the Grayson County Heritage Foundation in nearby Independence.

Imagine a road, all twisty and bendy, through green hills and blue valleys. This road is in a place called Virginia, and they call it the 'Crooked Road'. On this road, and in the small towns around it, you will find lots of people playing music. They play old instruments like the fiddle and banjo, and they play a kind of music that makes you want to dance and stomp your feet. In one of these small towns, there's an old theater where people get together to play their music. Even though the town and the theater are old, and some things aren't as busy as they once were, the people there love their music and play it with joy. The music they play is like a special secret passed down from generation to generation. This music has been carried around with them as they moved across the mountains and valleys. This is the same music that comes from the old country, carried by the original settlers who came from across the sea. They've been playing it ever since, and it's very important to them. This music has given shape to other kinds of music like bluegrass, that you may find familiar from some songs on the radio. It's special because it's still played in the way it was originally intended, for people to listen, dance, and be happy. The Crooked Road is a treasure trove for this unique and lively music.

For a number of years it was a subsidiary of the American Locomotive Company. MLW's headquarters and manufacturing facilities were located in Montreal, Quebec. - A locomotive or engine is a rail transport vehicle that provides the motive power for a train. The word originates from the Latin \\"loco\\" \\"from a place\\", ablative of \\"locus\\", \\"place\\" + Medieval Latin \\"motivus\\", \\"causing motion\\", and is a shortened form of the term \\"locomotive engine\\", first used in the early 19th century to distinguish between mobile and stationary steam engines. - A train is a form of rail transport consisting of a series of vehicles that usually runs along a rail track to transport cargo or passengers. Motive power is provided by a separate locomotive or individual motors in self-propelled multiple units. Although historically steam propulsion dominated, the most common modern forms are diesel and electric locomotives, the latter supplied by overhead wires or additional rails. Other energy sources include horses, engine or water-driven rope or wire winch, gravity, pneumatics, batteries, and gas turbines. Train tracks usually consist of two running rails, sometimes supplemented by additional rails such as electric conducting rails and rack rails, with a limited number of monorails and maglev guideways in the mix. The word 'train' comes from the Old French \\"trahiner\\", from the Latin \\"trahere\\" 'pull, draw'. - A classification yard (American and Canadian English) or marshalling yard (British, Hong Kong, Indian, Australian and Canadian English) is a railway yard found at some freight train stations, used to separate railway cars on to one of several tracks. First the cars are taken to a track, sometimes called a \\"lead\\" or a \\"drill\\". From there the cars are sent through a series of switches called a \\"ladder\\" onto the classification tracks. Larger yards tend to put the lead on an artificially built hill called a \\"hump\\" to use the force of gravity to propel the cars through the ladder. - A switcher or shunter (Great Britain: \\"shunter\\"; Australia: \\"shunter\\" or yard pilot; United States: \\"switcher\\", switch engine, or yard goat, except Pennsylvania Railroad: shifter) is a small railroad locomotive intended not for moving trains over long distances but rather for assembling trains ready for a road locomotive to take over, disassembling a train that has been brought in, and generally moving railroad cars around a process usually known as \\"switching\\" (USA) or \\"shunting\\" (UK). They do this in classification yards (Great Britain: \\"marshalling yards\\"). Switchers may also make short transfer runs and even be the only motive power on branch lines and switching and terminal railroads. The term can also be used to describe the workers operating these engines or engaged in directing shunting operations. - The Pennsylvania Railroad was an American Class I railroad, founded in 1846. Commonly referred to as the \\"Pennsy,\\" the PRR was headquartered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. - A railroad car or railcar (American and Canadian English), railway wagon or railway carriage (UK and IUR), also called a train car or train wagon, is a vehicle used for the carrying of cargo or passengers on a rail transport system (a railroad/railway). Such cars, when coupled together and hauled by one or more locomotives, form a train. Alternatively, some passenger cars are self-propelled in which case they may be either single railcars or make up multiple units. - The ALCO S2 and S4 were 1,000 horsepower ( 746 kW ) diesel electric switchers produced by ALCO and Canadian licensee Montreal Locomotive Works ( MLW ) . Basically , the two locomotives differed only in trucks , with the S - 2 using ALCO 's own \`\` Blunt '' trucks , and the S - 4 riding on standard AAR type A switcher trucks . Both were powered by ALCO 539 turbocharged , 6 - cylinder diesels . The S - 2 was built between August 1940 and June 1950 , with a total of 1502 completed , while the S - 4 was constructed between June 1949 and August 1957 ( MLW until 1957 ) with total sales of 797 . Canadian production of the S - 4 started more than a year before U S production of the S - 4 . ALCO did not start building the S - 4 until August 1950 . A modified version , the S - 7 , was built by MLW only ; 29 were built between June and August 1957 . - The American Locomotive Company, often shortened to ALCO, ALCo or Alco, designed, built and sold steam locomotives, diesel-electric locomotives, diesel engines and generators, specialized forgings, high quality steel, armed tanks and automobiles and produced nuclear energy. The American Locomotive Company was formed in 1901 by the merger of Schenectady Locomotive Engine Manufactory of Schenectady, New York with seven smaller locomotive manufacturers.

Answer the above question based on the context below: The Monadnock was commissioned by Boston real estate developers Peter and Shepherd Brooks in the building boom following the Depression of 1873–79. The Brooks family, which had amassed a fortune in the shipping insurance business and had been investing in Chicago real estate since 1863, had retained Chicago property manager Owen F. Aldis to manage the construction of the seven-story Grannis Block on Dearborn Street in 1880. It was Aldis, one of two men Louis Sullivan credited with being \\"responsible for the modern office building\\", who convinced investors such as the Brooks brothers to build new skyscrapers in Chicago. By the end of the century, Aldis would create over 1,000,000 square feet (93,000 m2) of new office space and manage nearly one fifth of the office space in the Loop.Daniel Burnham and John Wellborn Root met as young draftsmen in the Chicago firm of Carter, Drake, and Wight in 1872 and left to form Burnham & Root the following year. At Aldis's urging, the Brooks brothers had retained the then-fledgling firm to design the Grannis Block, which was their first major commission. Burnham and Root would become the architects of choice for the Brooks family, for whom they would complete the first high-rise building in Chicago, the 10-story Montauk Building, in 1883, and the 11-story Rookery Building in 1888. The Great Chicago Fire of 1871 had destroyed a 4-mile (6.4 km) by 0.5-mile (0.80 km) swath of the city between the Chicago River and Lake Michigan, and subsequent commercial development expanded into the area far south of the main business district along the river that would come to be known as \\"the Loop\\". Between 1881 and 1885, Aldis bought a series of lots in the area on Peter Brooks' behalf, including a 70-by-200-foot (21 by 61 m) site on the corner of Jackson and Dearborn streets. The location was remote, yet attractive for several reasons. The construction of the Chicago Board of Trade Building in 1885 had made nearby LaSalle Street the city's prime financial district, driving up property...

Wave pools are often a major feature of water parks. Siam Park City Water Park in Thailand is home to the world's largest wave pool certified by Guinness World Records, and Siam Park (Tenerife) in Spain is home to the biggest man made waves (about 3 meters (9.8 ft)) in the world. - A museum is an institution that cares for (conserves) a collection of artifacts and other objects of artistic, cultural, historical, or scientific importance and some public museums make them available for public viewing through exhibits that may be permanent or temporary. Most large museums are located in major cities throughout the world and more local ones exist in smaller cities, towns and even the countryside. Museums have varying aims, ranging from serving researchers and specialists to serving the general public. The goal of serving researchers is increasingly shifting to serving the general public. - The American Museum of Natural History (abbreviated as AMNH), located on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, New York City, is one of the largest museums in the world. Located in park-like grounds across the street from Central Park, the museum complex comprises 28 interconnected buildings housing 45 permanent exhibition halls, in addition to a planetarium and a library. The museum collections contain over 33 million specimens of plants, animals, fossils, minerals, rocks, meteorites, human remains, and human cultural artifacts, of which only a small fraction can be displayed at any given time, and occupies more than . The museum has a full-time scientific staff of 225, sponsors over 120 special field expeditions each year, and averages about five million visits annually. - The Upper West Side, sometimes abbreviated UWS, is a neighborhood in the borough of Manhattan, New York City, that lies between Central Park and the Hudson River and between West 59th Street and West 110th Street. The Upper West Side is sometimes also considered by the real estate industry to include the neighborhood of Morningside Heights. - In physics, a standing wave also known as a stationary wave is a wave in a medium in which each point on the axis of the wave has an associated constant amplitude. The locations at which the amplitude is minimum are called nodes, and the locations where the amplitude is maximum are called antinodes. - An ocean (the sea of classical antiquity) is a body of saline water that composes much of a planet's hydrosphere. On Earth, an ocean is one of the major conventional divisions of the World Ocean, which covers almost 71% of its surface. These are, in descending order by area, the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic Oceans. The word \\"sea\\" is often used interchangeably with \\"ocean\\" in American English but, strictly speaking, a sea is a body of saline water (generally a division of the world ocean) partly or fully enclosed by land. - The lion (\\"Panthera leo\\") is one of the big cats in the genus \\"Panthera\\" and a member of the family Felidae. The commonly used term African lion collectively denotes the several subspecies in Africa. With some males exceeding in weight, it is the second-largest living cat after the tiger. Wild lions currently exist in sub-Saharan Africa and in India (where an endangered remnant population resides in Gir Forest National Park). In ancient historic times, their range was in most of Africa, including North Africa, and across Eurasia from Greece and southeastern Europe to India. In the late Pleistocene, about 10,000 years ago, the lion was the most widespread large land mammal after humans: \\"Panthera leo spelaea\\" lived in northern and western Europe and \\"Panthera leo atrox\\" lived in the Americas from the Yukon to Peru. The lion is classified as a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), having seen a major population decline in its African range of 3050% over two decades during the second half of the twentieth century. Lion populations are untenable outside designated reserves and national parks. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes of concern. Within Africa, the West African lion population is particularly endangered. - The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just , New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States.

Some hid beneath the huge black seed-pods, some scuttled in the shadows of the nearby mountain. Patch knew from their smells there were at least a dozen of them. There was another smell too, mixed with that of the rats. The very same unsavory squirrel-smell he had detected in Silver's abandoned drey. \\"What do you want?\\" Patch asked, from his perch atop the mound of seed-pods. He was concerned but not yet frightened. Rats and squirrels were neither friends nor enemies. Squirrels were bigger and stronger, but rats were far more numerous. There were legends of long-ago wars between the two species, but no squirrel Patch knew had ever been attacked by rats. Squirrels lived aboveground, in the sun; rats frequented the night and the dark underworld. Of course, squirrels found rats disgusting and disagreeable -- but so did all other animals. An unusually large rat climbed up to the top of a seed-pod. It was almost as big as Patch himself.

Question: suppose less deforestation around happens, how will it affect a SMALLER amount of oxygen being delivered to the blood stream. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","response":"In this scenario, the process of oxygen delivery to the blood stream is as follows: 1. Air, containing oxygen, is brought in through the mouth. 2. It passes through the lung's bronchial tissue, where oxygen diffuses into the bloodstream. 3. Carbon dioxide is removed from the blood and exhaled. 4. The lungs bring the oxygen-rich blood to the rest of the body. Now, let's analyze the given question and each step of the process. Scenario: Less deforestation occurs, leading to the assumption that a larger amount of trees would be present in the environment. Since trees produce oxygen through photosynthesis, it is generally thought that this would result in more oxygen being available in the atmosphere. The question asks how this perturbation affects a smaller amount of oxygen being delivered to the bloodstream and focuses on the second effect mentioned (oxygen diffusing into the bloodstream). Step-by-step analysis: 1. Air, containing oxygen, is brought in through the mouth - More oxygen in the atmosphere is likely to have no effect on this step, as the process of inhaling air remains the same. 2. Oxygen passes through the lung's bronchial tissue and diffuses into the bloodstream - This is the step in question. If there is a higher concentration of oxygen in the inhaled air, diffusion might naturally occur at a slightly faster rate, potentially delivering more oxygen to the bloodstream. 3. Carbon dioxide is removed from the blood and exhaled - This step is not directly affected by the increased oxygen levels. 4. The lungs bring oxygen-rich blood to the rest of the body - This step might be slightly influenced because increased oxygen in the blood could provide more oxygen for the body's cells, but it's not directly related to the main question. Therefore, taking into account the step-by-step analysis, the supposed perturbation may result in a slightly higher oxygen delivery to the bloodstream. However, this effect is likely to be small and still subject to various individual factors, such as lung capacity and overall health of the person. Answer: Slightly more effect."},{"question":"Answer a question about this article: Estonia produces about 75% of its consumed electricity.

In the 20th century, some critics said that it was no longer possible to become prosperous through determination and hard work. Unfair education for students from poor families and racial discrimination almost made the American Dream a nightmare. Then, in the 1990s, California saw a new wave of dreamers in Silicon Valley. People poured their energy into the Internet. This new chapter of the American Dream attracted many business people and young talents from China and India to form start-ups and seek fortunes in America. Better pay, a nice house, and a rising standard of living will always be attractive. However, the new American Dream is no longer just about money. It encourages Americans to consume wisely to protect the environment, improve the quality of life, and promote social justice. The Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, has become the model of the new American Dream. After years of hard work, he grew from a poor young man from Austria into a movie superstar and then governor. Many people hope his story can save the American Dream and give California a brighter future. Question: Why did most of the early immigrants work as railroad laborers? - Because they could earn more money as railroad laborers. - Because they had to make a living by working as railroad laborers. - Because they thought railroad was the first step to find gold. - Because railroad laborers were greatly honored at that time. Answer:","response":"Most of the early immigrants worked as railroad laborers because they had to make a living by working as railroad laborers. The arrival of people from Europe and a large number of Chinese immigrants in the 19th century were driven by the \\"American Dream\\" hoping to find gold in the U.S., but instead, many ended up working as railroad laborers. The text does not mention that they chose this job because it paid more, was the first step to finding gold, or because it was a greatly honored position.

Could you help me answer this question? If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\". Plot title: The Tingler Movie plot: A pathologist, Dr. Warren Chapin (Price), discovers that the tingling of the spine in states of extreme fear is due to the growth of a creature that every human being seems to have, called a \\"Tingler\\", a parasite attached to the human spine. It curls up, feeds and grows stronger when its host is afraid, effectively crushing the person's spine if curled up long enough. The host can weaken the creature and stop its curling by screaming. Movie theater owner Oliver Higgins (Coolidge), who shows exclusively silent films, is an acquaintance of Dr. Chapin. Higgins's wife Martha (Evelyn), who is deaf and mute, dies of fright after weird, apparently supernatural events have occurred in her room. During her autopsy, Chapin removes the Tingler from her spine. After they have contained the Tingler and return to Higgins' house, it is revealed that Higgins is the murderer; he frightened his wife to death knowing that she could not scream because she was mute. The centipede-like creature eventually breaks free from the container that held it in and is released into the theater where the deaf mute woman ran before she died. Chapin wishes not to tell anyone, knowing it would start a panic. The Tingler latches onto a woman's leg, and she screams until it releases its grip. Chapin controls the situation by shutting off the lights and telling everyone in the theater to scream. When the Tingler has left the showing room, they resume the movie and go to the projection room where they find the Tingler and capture it. Guessing that the only way to neutralize the Tingler is to reinsert it inside Martha's body, Chapin does so. After he leaves, Higgins, who has admitted his guilt to Chapin, is alone in the room. As if by supernatural forces, the door slams shut and locks itself and the window closes, echoing what happened just before Martha was frightened to death.

(Alex Ogle/AFP/Getty Images) Mohammad Akhlaq was in bed when the mob arrived. The commotion began in the distance, but crept closer and closer like encroaching thunder. Suddenly, there was a pounding at the door. Then the door broke inwards and men dragged the 50-year-old farmer from his sheets and into the street, according to the Indian Express. They beat him with bricks found underneath his own bed; beat him until the bricks broke in their hands; beat him until Mohammad was dead. Akhlaq’s alleged crime? Eating beef. The attack on Monday night in the northern Indian city of Dadri has shocked the country, but it wasn’t exactly a surprise. For the past six months, meat has been a matter of major debate in India. Eighty percent of the country’s of 1.3 billion inhabitants are Hindu — many of whom avoid beef for religious reasons. Roughly 250 million Indians are not. That tally includes almost 25 million Christians and up to 140 million Muslims, like Akhlaq. The issue has raged in India for years. Since Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power last May, however, incidents have increased, as they tend to do whenever a conservative government has been in power. Cows are seen at the Shree Gopala Goshala cow shelter on Sept. 7 in Bhiwandi, India. (Allison Joyce/Getty Images) Modi is a Hindu nationalist who, as chief minister of Gujarat state, presided during religious riots in 2002 in which more than 1,000 people — most of them Muslims — were killed. For years afterwards, Modi was blocked from visiting the United States because of his role in the riots. [New Indian leader draws cheers, criticism from diaspora as he arrives in the U.S.] All that changed last year, however, when Modi and his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) swept to power. Modi campaigned on a vision of India finally fulfilling its economic potential — a promise highlighted by his recent tour of Silicon Valley. Yet, critics claim Modi’s tenure also has been marked by a concerted cultural shift that undermines secularism and threatens to drag India back into sectarian bloodshed. In the past, Modi has complained about India’s “pink revolution” of rising meat exports and backed the idea of a national ban on cow slaughter, according to the BBC. Since Modi’s election, Muslims have grown worried about a string of inflammatory statements and actions by Hindu nationalist leaders. Accused Islamist terrorists have been executed ahead of non-Muslims, stirring anger. Meanwhile, BJP lawmakers have openly called for Hindus to out breed Muslims to “protect Hindu religion.” That same politician, Sakshi Maharaj, invited outrage when he called Mahatma Gandhi’s assassin a “patriot.” (Nathuram Godse was a militant Hindu activist who killed Gandhi for “appeasing” Muslims.) Finally, India’s foreign minister has called for the Bhagavad Gita, a Hindu scripture, to be declared a “national scripture.” Bharatiya Janata Party leader and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. (Saurabh Das/AP) Hindu leaders have also launched efforts to convert Muslims and Christians to Hinduism and warned against romantic relationships with members of other religions. It is beef that has drawn the most blood, however. India’s 36 states and territories have long been a patchwork quilt when it comes to their laws regarding beef. Some said that only old cows could be killed. Others allowed only bulls or bullocks to be sent to the butcher. In the past 15 months, however, many states have tightened their laws — with encouragement from Modi’s political party. The most prominent example is the western state of Maharashtra, home to the bustling metropolis of Mumbai and many of the country’s Muslims. Under BJP leadership, the state passed the Maharashtra Animal Preservation Bill back in 1996 but it was blocked from becoming law because president Shankar Dayal Sharma of the Opposition Congress Party refused to approve it. With Modi’s election last year, however, times have changed. And in March of this year, BJP members in Maharashtra convinced the current president to approve the law. The move effectively banned beef overnight, putting thousands of predominantly Muslim butchers out of a job and putting anyone eating beef in the state at risk of arrest. A woman packages toothpaste made from cow waste at the Keshav Srushti cow shelter on Sept. 7 in Thane, India. (Allison Joyce/Getty Images) Despite legal challenges to the ban, the new law immediately brought results. Just days after the law’s implementation, two people were arrested for allegedly slaughtering two calves, the BBC reported. Last month, four more people were accused of smuggling beef into Mumbai, according to the Indian Express. The crackdown on cow-eating is driven by a desire for religious/national purity, but critics point out that it’s already creating political and practical problems. “Some Hindu hard-liners insist the idea of eating beef was introduced by Muslim invaders, despite references to its consumption in ancient texts like the Vedas, written more than a millennium before the time of Muhammad. By eradicating this ‘alien’ practice, they hope to return the country to values they hold dear as Hindus,” wrote novelist Manil Suri in a New York Times op-ed. Suri said it was part and parcel of a broader conservative cultural shift under Modi and the BJP. “With the recent re-criminalization of gay sex, bans on controversial books and films and even an injunction against the use of the colonial-era name ‘Bombay’ instead of ‘Mumbai’ in a Bollywood song, the new laws join a growing list of restrictions on personal freedom in India,” he warned. Since his election, Modi has said he is committed to secularism at the same time members of his party openly push to outlaw beef, the BBC’s Justin Rowlatt pointed out in April. “That’s why while the idea of cow mug shots may be amusing, the beef ban is deadly serious,” he said. “India’s triumph has been forging a nation in which Hindus and Muslims can live happily together. The fear is that the beef ban is part of a process that is gradually undermining the compromises that made that possible.” Kashmiri Muslim protesters and Indian police and paramilitary soldiers during protests after the Eid al-Adha prayers in Srinagar, India on Sept. 25. (Farooq Khan/EPA) Rowlatt’s words proved prescient when protests erupted earlier this month in India-administered Kashmir, where the Supreme Court suddenly enforced a 83-year-old beef ban on the Muslim-majority state. Beef again became a pretext for violence during Monday’s mob attack in Dadri, a city of roughly 60,000 near New Delhi in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, where a near-total ban on beef is in effect. The attack allegedly came moments after an announcement at a nearby Hindu temple that Mohammad Akhlaq had slaughtered a calf. The calf had gone missing several weeks earlier, according to the Indian Express. Rumors quickly spread around the neighborhood that Akhlaq was the culprit. Incited by the announcement, the mob broke down Akhlaq’s door and dragged him into the street, where 100 men beat him to death with bricks, his family members told the Express. The invaders also dragged Akhlaq’s 22-year-old son, Danish, outside, beating him until he was close to death as well. “They accused us of keeping cow meat, broke down our doors and started beating my father and brother,” Akhlaq’s daughter, Sajida, told the Express. “My father was taken outside the house and beaten to death. My brother was dragged to the courtyard downstairs and they used bricks to hit him on the head and chest, leaving him unconscious. They also tried to molest me and hit my grandmother on her face. They threatened to kill me if I said a word to the police.” A cow looks on with colored dyes and paste on its forehead after being blessed by Indian women during a Hindu Bach Baras ritual in the city of Udaipur on Sept. 9. (Alex Ogle/AFP/Getty Images) Sajida said her family had never suffered from Islamophobia in the past. “Every time there was a feast in this house, Hindu residents of the village would attend such functions,” she said, standing in a ransacked house littered with bricks and blood splatter. “Even on [Muslim holiday] Bakr-Id, we had guests. But suddenly they started doubting us.” Police appeared to confirm the account. “Preliminary investigations revealed that an announcement was made from the temple” about the family consuming beef, senior superintendent of police Kiran S told the Express. “We have been told that a group of people entered the temple and used a microphone to make the announcement. However, investigations are still underway. We do not know if any of the accused are associated with the temple.” When police detained six people, including the temple’s priest, on Tuesday, protesters set fire to two police cars. One person suffered a gunshot in the riot, although the priest was released after questioning, according to the Express. In a cruel irony, Akhlaq’s family insists that the meat in question wasn’t even beef. “There was some mutton in the fridge which was taken away yesterday,” Sajida told the Express. “They thought it was beef.” “The police have taken it for examination,” she said. “If the results prove that it was not beef, will they bring back my dead father?” ||||| Photograph of 50-year-old Mohammad Akhlaq, who was beaten to death in UP’s Dadri, allegedly by residents of Bisara village, after rumours spread in the area about the family storing and consuming beef (Express photo by Gajendra Yadav) A 50-year-old man, Mohammad Akhlaq, was beaten to death and his 22-year-old son severely injured on Monday night in UP’s Dadri, allegedly by residents of Bisara village, after rumours spread in the area about the family storing and consuming beef, police said.

Following the rumours, tension ignited and some locals attacked his home in Bisara village,” Singh said. While a shopkeeper near the temple and Bisara village sarpanch Sanjeev Kumar Rana claimed that those arrested included the temple priest and an aide, police said the priest — identifed only as “babaji” — was released after questioning. Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP), Gautam Buddh Nagar, Kiran S, said “preliminary investigations revealed that an announcement was made from the temple” about the family consuming beef. “The priest was picked for questioning as we need to investigate the involvement of others in the case,” said Kiran. According to Sajida, Akhlaq’s 18-year-old daughter who was in the house when the attack took place, “a group of more than 100 people from the village” reached the house that night. “They accused us of keeping cow meat, broke down our doors and started beating my father and brother. My father was dragged outside the house and beaten with bricks. We came to know later that an announcement had been made from the temple about us eating beef,” said Sajida. According to the SSP, a case of rioting and murder has been registered against 10 people. “Six of them have been arrested — Rupendra, Vivek, Sri Om, Sandeep, Saurav and Gaurav — all residents of Bisara village,” the police officer said. “We have been told that a group of people entered the temple and used a microphone to make the announcement. However, investigations are still underway. We do not know if any of the accused are associated with the temple. We have collected meat samples from Akhlaq’s house and sent it to the forensics department for examination,” said Kiran. However, as news of the arrests spread, residents from Bisara and neighbouring villages held demonstrations and clashed with police near the NTPC facility, damaging vehicles, including a police van, and burning a motorcycle. When police resorting to firing, Rahul Yadav, who works as a welder at NTPC, received a bullet injury near his abdomen. Yadav’s brother Narendra said they “got caught in the clash” and alleged that his brother was injured by a bullet fired by a policeman. “Around 500 protesters from nearby villages had assembled there.

Senior officers, however, contested Narendra’s version that his brother was hit by a police bullet. “Rahul Yadav received a bullet injury on his lower hip. We are yet to ascertain the type of the bullet and the weapon from which it was fired,” SSP Kiran said.

(Associated Press) BISARA, India (AP) — Indian police arrested eight people and were searching for two more Wednesday after villagers allegedly beat a Muslim farmer to death and severely injured his son upon hearing rumors that the family was eating beef — a taboo for many among India's majority Hindu population. The mob of about 60 Hindus became incensed when a temple announced that the family had been slaughtering cows and storing the beef in their house in Bisara, a village about 45 kilometers (25 miles) southeast of the Indian capital of New Delhi, said District Magistrate Nagendra Pratap Singh. He said the mob dragged 52-year-old Mohammad Akhlaq and his son from their home Monday night and beat them with sticks and bricks. Akhlaq was declared dead at a nearby hospital, while his son was being treated for serious injuries. Since Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a Hindu nationalist, took office last year, hard-line Hindus have been demanding that India ban beef sales — a key industry for many within India's poor, minority Muslim community. In many Indian states, the slaughtering of cows and selling of beef are either restricted or banned. For Hindus, cows are worshipped as sacred, and many of the animals are often seen wandering unchecked around big-city neighborhoods and on highways during rush hour. Opposition lawmaker Shashi Tharoor said in a Twitter message that the \\"horrific killing shows this meat bigotry has gone out of control,\\" and that Indians should be \\"free to eat what they want.\\" Tensions had been building in the village, where nearly 40 percent of the 1,500 residents are Muslim, after some Hindus complained that their cows and buffaloes were going missing, Singh said. On Wednesday, police were patrolling the village, where most residents were sitting quietly outside their homes. When police arrested the suspects on Tuesday, a group of protesters attacked the officers and their vehicles, forcing police to open fire, according to local newspapers including The Indian Express. One 20-year-old man was reportedly injured, the paper said, without elaborating. The eight suspects in custody were charged with murder and rioting, Singh said. Police are searching for two more suspects in the area. Akhlaq's 46-year-old brother, Jan Mohammad Saifi, said the family was baffled by the attack. \\"My brother was singled out. Why were we targeted? We don't eat beef,\\" he said, blaming a local hard-line Hindu organization for inciting the violence. \\"They announced our family had slaughtered a cow in the village, and that provoked people to attack our home.\\" Akhlaq's daughter, Sajida, said the family had mutton in the refrigerator, and not beef, according to The Indian Express. Police said they have sent samples of meat taken from Akhlaq's home to a laboratory to determine whether the meat is from a goat or a cow.

Since Hindu nationalist Prime Minister Narendra Modi took office last year, hard-line Hindus have been demanding that India ban beef sales - a key industry for many within India's poor, minority Muslim community. In many Indian states, the slaughtering of cows and selling of beef are either restricted or banned. For Hindus, cows are worshipped as sacred. The growing list of restrictions on personal freedom in India under Modi's government is causing increasing concern that it is creating a cultural shift that threatens secularism, undermining India's secular democracy and could lead the nation back into sectarian bloodshed."},{"question":"FINAL EXAM Question 1.

Ted Cruz slammed the White House on Tuesday for a \\"failure of leadership\\" as President Barack Obama prepares to nominate his administration's fourth defense secretary. The Texas Republican, who is considering a 2016 run in hopes of heading his own White House administration, called the unusually high turnover at the helm of the Defense Department emblematic of a White House that puts politics above U.S. national security. \\"It seems what the administration is looking for is a defense secretary who will follow the orders of a political White House rather than focus on defending the national security interests of this country,\\" Cruz said. \\"At a time when the threats are this grave, we shouldn't see turnover at the Defense Department than one has at a typical Burger King.\\" Cruz said he did not know Ashton Carter, the former No. 2 man at the Pentagon who is expected to be Obama's nominee to succeed Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, but Cruz said he looks forward to learning more about Carter and his \\"good reputation.\\" But Cruz emphasized he was unsettled to see several potential picks pull their names out of the running to head the department, including former Pentagon official Michele Flournoy and Sen. Jack Reed. \\"It says something that so many people are saying, 'No, thank you, I don't want to serve in an administration that overrides the Defense Department, that treats the defense secretary as subservient to political lackeys in the White House,\\" Cruz said.

Note:"},{"question":"Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Seward was born in on May 16, 1801, in the small community of Florida, New York, in Orange County. He was the fourth son of Samuel Sweezy Seward and his wife Mary (Jennings) Seward. Samuel Seward was a wealthy landowner and slaveholder in New York State; slavery was not fully abolished in the state until 1827. Florida was located some 60 miles (97 km) north of New York City, west of the Hudson River, and was a small rural village of perhaps a dozen homes. Despite his public nonchalance, Seward was devastated by his convention loss, as were many of his supporters. The New Yorker was the best-known and most popular Republican, and his defeat shocked many in the North, who felt that Lincoln had been nominated through chicanery. Although Seward sent a letter stating Weed was not to blame, Seward's political manager took the defeat hard. Seward was initially inclined to retire from public life, but received many letters from supporters: distrustful of Lincoln, they urged Seward to remain involved in politics. On his way to Washington to return to Senate duties, he stopped in Albany to confer with Weed, who had gone to Lincoln's home in Springfield, Illinois to meet with the candidate, and had been very impressed at Lincoln's political understanding. At the Capitol, Seward received sympathy even from sectional foes such as Jefferson Davis. Lincoln faced three major opponents. A split in the Democratic Party had led northerners to nominate Senator Douglas, while southerners chose Vice President John C. Breckinridge. The Constitutional Union Party, a new party consisting mostly of former Southern Whigs, selected former Tennessee senator John Bell. As Lincoln would not even be on the ballot in ten southern states, he needed to win almost every northern state to take the presidency. Douglas was said to be strong in Illinois and Indiana, and if he took those, the election might be thrown into the House of Representatives. Seward was urged to undertake a campaign tour of the Midwest in support of Lincoln and did so for five weeks in September and October, attracting huge crowds. He journeyed by rail and boat as far north as Saint Paul, Minnesota, into the border state of Missouri at St. Louis, and even to Kansas Territory, though it had no electoral votes to cast in the election. When the train passed through Springfield, Seward and Lincoln were introduced, with Lincoln appearing \\"embarrassed\\" and Seward \\"constrained\\". In his oratory, Seward spoke of the U.S. as a \\"tower of freedom\\", a Union that might even include Canada, Latin America, and Russian America. New York was key to the election; a Lincoln loss there would deadlock the Electoral College. Soon after his return from his Midwest tour, Seward embarked on another, speaking to large crowds across the state of New York. At Weed's urging he went to New York City and gave a patriotic speech before a large crowd on November 3, only three days before the election. On Election Day, Lincoln carried most Northern states, while Breckinridge took the Deep South, Bell three border states, and Douglas won Missouri--the only state Seward campaigned in that Lincoln did not win. Lincoln was elected. did it get thrown into the house of representatives?","response":"No, the election did not get thrown into the House of Representatives.

Answer the above question based on the context below: The one-act opera genre had become increasingly popular in Italy following the 1890 competition sponsored by publisher Edoardo Sonzogno for the best such work, which was won by the young Pietro Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana. With Tosca essentially completed by November 1899, Puccini sought a new project. Among sources he considered, before proceeding with Madama Butterfly, were three works by French dramatist Alphonse Daudet that Puccini thought might be made into a trilogy of one-act operas.After Butterfly premiered in 1904, Puccini again had difficulty finding a new subject. He further considered the idea of composing three one-act operas to be performed together, but found his publisher, Giulio Ricordi, firmly opposed to such a project, convinced that it would be expensive to cast and produce. The composer then planned to work with his longtime librettist, Giuseppe Giacosa, on an opera about Marie Antoinette, a project frustrated by the librettist's illness. Puccini wrote in November 1905, \\"Will we go back to it? [Maria Antonietta] If I find three one-act works that suit me, I'll put off M.A.\\" Puccini pursued neither project, as Giacosa's illness led to his death in September 1906.In March 1907, Puccini wrote to Carlo Clausetti, Ricordi's representative in Naples, proposing three one-act operas based on scenes from stories by Russian novelist Maxim Gorky. By May the composer had set aside this proposal to concentrate on the project which became La fanciulla del West, although he did not wholly abandon the idea of a multiple-opera evening. His next idea in this vein, some years later, was for a two-opera bill, one tragic and one comic; he later expanded this to include a third opera with a mystic or religious tone. By November 1916 Puccini had completed the \\"tragic\\" element, which became Il tabarro, but he still lacked ideas for the other two works. He considered staging Il tabarro in combination with his own early work Le Villi, or with other two-act operas which might be used to round out the evening's...

Answer:","response":"The Vasco da Gama Bridge, the longest bridge in Europe, spans the Tagus River in Portugal. This remarkable and impressive engineering feat provides a crucial transportation link between the northern and southern parts of the country, particularly around the Lisbon Metropolitan Area. Named after the famous Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama, the bridge was inaugurated on March 29, 1998, coinciding with the 500th anniversary celebrations of da Gama's discovery of the sea route from Europe to India. Designed to alleviate traffic congestion in the Lisbon area, the bridge was a significant infrastructural development for Portugal, and it has boosted the region's economic growth and tourism potential. The total length of the bridge is approximately 12.3 kilometers (7.6 miles), with a main cable-stayed section spanning 420 meters (1,378 feet) over the river, and other viaducts and approach structures adding to the total distance. The Tagus River, which originates in Spain and flows into the Atlantic Ocean near the Portuguese capital of Lisbon, is the longest river on the Iberian Peninsula, with a total length of around 1,007 kilometers (626 miles). The Vasco da Gama Bridge was designed and built to withstand earthquakes and other natural disasters, as it is situated in a seismically active region. The innovative design of the bridge is such that it can accommodate future expansions and modifications, if necessary. The construction involved multiple partners, including several Portuguese companies, as well as international engineering firms from the United States, the United Kingdom, and France. The bridge is not only significant for being the longest in Europe, but it has also been hailed as an outstanding example of modern engineering and design. The slender, symmetrical structure rises gracefully from the banks of the Tagus River, with its sleek lines accentuating the natural beauty of the surrounding landscape. The bridge has become an iconic symbol of progress and innovation in Portugal and serves as an important connector between the various regions of the country. In conclusion, the Vasco da Gama Bridge spans the Tagus River in Portugal, representing a significant engineering achievement and a vital transportation link that has bolstered economic growth and connectivity within the Lisbon Metropolitan Area and beyond. The bridge's elegant design, state-of-the-art construction, and historical significance make it a must-see landmark for visitors and an enduring symbol of national pride for the people of Portugal."},{"question":"Je voudrais aborder rapidement un autre point.

But farther we go inland, the soil lacks necessary iodine. As a result, inland population do not get enough iodine naturally. But I can use this background: Before iodized salt was developed, some people experienced a number of developmental difficulties, including problems with thyroid gland function and mental retardation. In the 1920s, we learned that these conditions could usually be treated easily with the addition of iodide anion to the diet. One easy way to increase iodide intake was to add the anion to table salt. This simple step greatly enhanced health and development. Large amounts of iodide ion are also found in seaweed such as kelp (see picture above) and saltwater fish. What is an answer for this question: Where people are more at risk of mental retardation, coastal area or inland?

Rede Globo is the largest television network in Brazil, and their broadcasts mainly occur in the Portuguese language, as it is the official language of the country. The anchor would typically greet the viewers in Portuguese, with a phrase like \\"Boa tarde\\" (meaning \\"Good afternoon\\") or \\"Boa noite\\" (meaning \\"Good evening\\"), depending on the time of day. \\"Konnichiwa\\" (こんにちは) is a Japanese greeting, typically used to say \\"Good afternoon\\" or \\"Hello\\" in general. Although Brazil has a significant Japanese-Brazilian community, the use of the Japanese language is not common in mainstream media.

The bulk of the larger states, and some groups of small states, were integrated through a different, four-step process. The first step in this process was to convince groups of large states to combine to form a \\"princely union\\" through the execution by their rulers of Covenants of Merger. Under the Covenants of Merger, all rulers lost their ruling powers, save one who became the Rajpramukh of the new union. The other rulers were associated with two bodies—the council of rulers, whose members were the rulers of salute states, and a presidium, one or more of whose members were elected by the rulers of non-salute states, with the rest elected by the council. The Rajpramukh and his deputy Uprajpramukh were chosen by the council from among the members of the presidium. The Covenants made provision for the creation of a constituent assembly for the new union which would be charged with framing its constitution. In return for agreeing to the extinction of their states as discrete entities, the rulers were given a privy purse and guarantees similar to those provided under the Merger Agreements.Through this process, Patel obtained the unification of 222 states in the Kathiawar peninsula of his native Gujarat into the princely union of Saurashtra in January 1948, with six more states joining the union the following year. Madhya Bharat emerged on 28 May 1948 from a union of Gwalior, Indore and eighteen smaller states. In Punjab, the Patiala and East Punjab States Union was formed on 15 July 1948 from Patiala, Kapurthala, Jind, Nabha, Faridkot, Malerkotla, Nalargarh, and Kalsia. The United State of Rajasthan was formed as the result of a series of mergers, the last of which was completed on 15 May 1949. Travancore and Cochin were merged in the middle of 1949 to form the princely union of Travancore-Cochin. The only princely states which signed neither Covenants of Merger nor Merger Agreements were Kashmir, Mysore and Hyderabad.

The Generation of '98 emerged as a response to Spain's crisis and its loss of identity following the country's defeat against the United States in the Spanish-American War. Ganivet was born in Granada, Spain, and studied at the University of Granada and the Central University of Madrid. He eventually worked as a diplomat in various European cities, such as Antwerp, Riga, and Helsinki. In his literary career, Ganivet was primarily known for his influential essays on social and political topics that reflected his concerns about Spanish society and identity. One of his most famous works, \\"Idearium español\\" (Spanish Idearium), is a collection of essays that critique and analyze the nature and problems of Spanish society during that time. The essays touch on topics such as faith, individualism, and international relations, and propose a revision of Spain's cultural and intellectual life to usher in a new era of progress and modernity. Another noteworthy work by Ganivet is \\"La conquista del reino de Maya\\" (The Conquest of the Mayan Kingdom), a novel that satirizes the colonial mentality of Europe. The novel follows a fictional story of a group of Europeans seeking to conquer an imaginary Central American kingdom. Through this narrative, Ganivet sheds light on the absurdity and greed of the colonizers while highlighting the moral and intellectual decline of Europe in the late 19th century. Ganivet's literary output was limited, considering his early death at the age of 33. Nevertheless, his works significantly contributed to shaping the discourse on Spanish identity and the need for profound change. His intellectual insight and reflections on Spain's society continue to be regarded as important contributions to the broader movement that sought to revitalize Spanish culture and pride during a time of crisis."},{"question":"Please answer the following question by reasoning step-by-step.

Make a list of advantages and disadvantages to spending time alone. Remember to consider the cost of this fear on your relationships, your own passions, and your self-development. For instance, you may decide that you will spend fifteen minutes alone without calling, texting, or messaging anyone, and as long as you need to process those fifteen minutes. This process might take place four times a week. Make exposure gradual and take into consideration how bad your fear is. This process takes time and should not be rushed. Plan to be alone for short spurts. Little by little, you will want to plan increased amounts of time alone until you don’t feel overcome with panic. Try making an exposure hierarchy in which you rank feared situations on a scale of 0-100 according to how afraid you anticipate being when exposed to it. For example, you may rank spending an hour alone at home at 100, but going to a movie alone a 70. By ranking you can work up to overcoming gradually greater fears only once fear subsides for the less threatening fears. Try exposing yourself to a lower-ranked fear. At first you’ll feel incredibly nervous and anxious, and this is normal. In time, your body will relax. After a few highly uncomfortable attempts, this will be a way to signal to yourself that you are capable of spending time alone. Exposing yourself to your fear will also help you think more deeply about the fears behind the initial panic. Don't become overly preoccupied with how panicked you feel and how stressed your body becomes. Because you are purposely exposing yourself to something you fear, shallow breathing, increased heart rate, and other physical symptoms of anxiety are normal. The longer the alone time, the greater the anxiety you will feel. But, with exposure, anxiety is expected and will dissipate with time. Gently push your limits until you are happy with how much alone time you can handle. Imagine you are going swimming--dipping your toes in the water can be exciting, but it won't adjust you to the temperature of the water. Another option is FearFighter, a computerized program of self-help methods that treat phobias.It is endorsed by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and proven effective. Because exposure can be so stressful, you may want a reliable way to distract yourself in the moment. Try reciting a few lines of a poem to yourself, doing arithmetic in your head, or whispering encouraging phrases to yourself, like \\"this feeling will pass, I have handled it before\\". Remember, the less often you use your crutch, the more intensive the exposure sessions will be. During and after your exposure sessions, record your level of fear on a scale from 0 to 10. 0 is fully relaxed and 10 is as fearful as you can imagine being. Doing this will show you how desensitized you have become to being alone and how much fear you were safely able to handle. Note trends in the sessions when anxiety seems especially high or low. Do you see any other factors that affect your fear, like the weather, or who you spent time with earlier in the day? You can also use the journal to write encouraging thoughts, difficulties, and anything else that \\"comes up\\" related to the fear. This will help you know yourself and your underlying patterns better. Summary:","response":"The article highlights the importance of overcoming the fear of spending time alone and provides a detailed approach to tackling this fear. Creating a list of advantages and disadvantages of spending time alone can be helpful in understanding its impact on relationships, passions, and self-development. The key is to start with gradual exposure to alone time, planning and increasing the duration incrementally until the fear subsides. An exposure hierarchy can be utilized, where one ranks different situations on a scale of 0-100 based on the anticipated level of fear. Starting with lower-ranked fears and progressively moving to higher-ranked ones allows individuals to slowly adapt and feel more comfortable in such situations. Physical symptoms of anxiety, such as shallow breathing or increased heart rate, are normal when purposely exposing oneself to fear. With time, anxiety is expected to decrease as the exposure increases. Some people may need distraction techniques, like reciting a poem or doing arithmetic, to help cope with the stress. It is essential to record and track one's progress using a fear scale ranging from 0 (fully relaxed) to 10 (highest fear). This helps in understanding the level of desensitization achieved and any specific trends that affect the anxiety. Other options, such as the FearFighter program, can also be helpful in overcoming the fear of spending time alone. The ultimate goal is to understand oneself better, recognize the underlying patterns and thoughts, and ultimately develop the confidence to comfortably spend time alone without fear."},{"question":"Alternation of generations allows for both asexual and sexual reproduction, and reproduction Organisms create young of their species by reproduction.

Ideally, the daytime temperature while the cauliflower is maturing will be around 60ºF (15.5ºC). This means that the proper planting time depends on your climate: Cool climates: If your late summer temperatures are below 80ºF (27ºC), you can plant cauliflower for a fall harvest. Start the seeds 8 to 12 weeks before the first fall frost. Warm climates: If you have frost-free winters, you can plant cauliflower seeds later in autumn, once temperatures have dropped below 80ºF (27ºC). Harvest in winter or early spring. Temperate climates: Spring-planted cauliflower is difficult to grow in most climates. The coastal valleys of California are the only major exception, and can support year-round crops. Cauliflower is one of the most temperature-sensitive vegetables around. If the temperature requirements above seem difficult to achieve in your area, you can make the job easier with one or more of these tactics: Look for \\"summer\\" or \\"tropical\\" varieties that can handle warmer temperatures than most. Wait about a month after the recommended seed-starting date and buy a transplant from a garden store. Plant a new batch every week for 4–6 weeks to see which works best. Though they require cool weather, paradoxically, cauliflower also require a fair amount of full sun during the day. Choose a spot for planting in your garden that receives full sun and isn't shaded by trees, tall grass, or other crops. You'll also want to make sure that your growing site has ample room for your cauliflower crop. Generally, cauliflower plants will need to be spaced about 18-24 inches apart. For a good cauliflower crop, the plant's growth must be completely uninterrupted. This means that the plant must receive consistent moisture and have access to sufficient nutrients as it matures. A good soil makes meeting both of these requirements much easier. Ideally, your cauliflower's soil should have the following qualities: High organic matter content. This enhances the soil's ability to hold moisture. High potassium and nitrogen content. Potassium and nitrogen are nutrients vital for the cauliflower's development. If these are not present in the soil, it may be necessary to use fertilizer. A pH of between 6.5 and 7. This \\"sweet\\" pH range minimizes the danger of a cauliflower disease called clubroot and maximizes nutrient availability. Cauliflower has a reputation for being somewhat fragile. Many people start with seedlings from a local garden store to transplant into their garden. If you have seeds instead, plant them indoors to protect the young plants from weather: Plant each seed in its own peat or paper cup. The biodegradable container lets you \\"plant\\" the whole pot in your garden later without damaging the cauliflower's roots. Press the seed about 1/4–1/2 inch (0.6–1.25 cm) deep and cover it with dirt. Water regularly so the soil is moist but not waterlogged. In cold weather, keep the soil at 70º F (21º C) with bottom heat from a warming plate. If you must plant your seeds directly in the garden, plant them in rows 3 to 6 inches (7.5 to 15 cm) apart. Whether you grew the plants from seed or bought them from a garden nursery, you'll need to move them outdoors once they have three or four true leaves: Before transplanting, move the seedlings outside for one hour a day. Gradually increase this time over the course of a week to \\"harden off\\" the seedlings, adapting them to outdoor conditions. If you used a biodegradable container, bury the container in the ground so the soil level is even with the rest of the garden. If you used a non-biodegradable container, remove the seedling carefully to avoid breaking its roots. Make a small hole in the ground and bury the seedling up to its stem. You may want to make a shallow, saucer-like depression around the seedling to help the surrounding soil retain water. Firm the soil and water the seedling.","response":"Cauliflower needs cool weather and lots of sunlight to grow properly.

Does the answer correctly answer the question Choose your answer from: (a). yes; (b). no;","response":"A: The term \\"Advaita\\" refers to a non-dualistic philosophy in Hinduism, which is most prominently associated with the Advaita Vedanta system of philosophy. The word itself is derived from the Sanskrit \\"a\\" (not) and \\"dvaita\\" (dual or two), and it is often translated as \\"not two, sole, unity.\\" This philosophical system maintains that the ultimate reality of existence, or Brahman, is singular and undifferentiated. The core belief of Advaita philosophy is that the individual self, or Atman, is not distinct from the absolute reality, Brahman. The division between Atman and Brahman is seen as an illusion, created due to ignorance or Avidya. Once this ignorance is dispelled, one can attain self-realization and become aware of the true unity of the self with the absolute reality, resulting in a state of profound peace and spiritual liberation called moksha. Advaita Vedanta is one of the most influential branches of Hindu philosophy, and its origins can be traced back to the Upanishads, which are ancient texts containing the philosophical concepts and principles that form the basis of Indian religion and spirituality. The most well-known proponent of Advaita Vedanta is the Hindu philosopher Adi Shankaracharya, who consolidated the teachings of this philosophical system in the 8th century CE. In conclusion, the term Advaita means \\"not two, sole, unity\\" and refers to a non-dualistic philosophical system in Hinduism, specifically the Advaita Vedanta tradition, which emphasizes the ultimate oneness of the individual self and the absolute reality, or Brahman. In this system, the perception of the separation between Atman and Brahman is seen as an illusion that can be overcome through spiritual practice and self-realization.

What a way to say goodbye. Liverpool’s captain did at least on this occasion keep his footing. Unfortunately this was at the expense of Ander Herrera’s shin, on which Steven Gerrard’s foot rested briefly, 38 seconds into what was a final appearance against the dominant domestic force of Gerrard’s almost-but-not-quite Premier League career. It wasn’t a vicious stamp, but it was enough to ensure he was sent off in the opening minute of the second half at Anfield, a horrendous moment for Liverpool’s departing captain in what was by the end a narrow 2-1 defeat by Manchester United. No doubt a great deal of cod‑psychology will be devoted to Gerrard’s split-second motives, the theatre of departure, a Lear-ish sense of fading powers and crumbling fiefdoms. But the fact is his red card for an over-zealous attempt to reverse the momentum of the game also seemed to fit with the tactical drift of two contrasting systems as, once again in the spring sunshine, Brendan Rodgers suffered a bruising day at the office against A-list managerial opposition. Related: Liverpool 1-2 Manchester United | Premier League match report At the final whistle Louis van Gaal took the unusual step, as José Mourinho did last year, of striding across to celebrate with the visiting fans. Van Gaal will have relished this victory as much as any of his players, as United’s targeted direct football, combined with some swift-breaking transitions and two sublime goals from Juan Mata made the difference against a Liverpool team that only showed in glimpses their finely‑grooved attacking football of the last few weeks. Last season against Chelsea Rodgers was accused of abandoning his team’s fluid passing principles in the face of Mourinho’s blue-shirted double bolt. Here it was United who played the more rugged football, bullying Liverpool’s midfield at times and providing a genuinely painful one-man horror show as Emre Can was for 60 minutes repeatedly pummelled in the air by Marouane Fellaini. With this in mind it is hard not find a little synergy between Gerrard’s red card and United’s muscular command of midfield. Gerrard had been introduced in place of Adam Lallana with a clear detail in mind judging by his first act, a thrilling but slightly wild tackle on Mata. Seconds later Liverpool’s captain clashed with Herrera and was left trooping off in a daze, looking like a wrestler who’s just been tagged into the ring to rescue his pigeon-chested partner only to abruptly knock himself out with a forearm smash to the jaw. The suspicion had always been that the physical battle between Can and Fellaini would be key, with Fellaini’s bruising, aerial take on the inside-left position always likely to pick at Can’s weak spot as a central defender. The first “rapid aerial transition” towards Fellaini’s head duly arrived in the opening seconds and Liverpool were for a while bypassed in midfield. The Fellaini chest remains one of the mini-marvels of the modern game, an adhesive, velvety-soft cradle, like an ancient baseball catcher’s mitt, into which the ball just seems to nestle from any angle. Arsenal had countered Fellaini’s influence at Old Trafford by putting Francis Coquelin in his pocket of space, a defensive midfielder with the discipline to do little more than hoover up the fruits of his knockdowns. Here at times it was almost painful to see Fellaini drift malevolently towards Can, who must have found himself wondering if, all things considered, this was really what he signed up for; a player schooled in pass and move and engineered to German academy standards being battered under the high ball by an angular Belgian repeatedly snaffling the ball into that marsupial pouch he appears to keep somewhere below his chin. And yet for all the aerial softening up it was a beautifully swift piece of incision that made the first goal, conceived and finished by United’s mix and match midfield. Fellaini took the ball in the centre circle and laid it right to Herrera via Daley Blind. Herrera’s pass into the space between the centre‑backs and Alberto Moreno was fizzed but perfectly weighted for Mata’s run, and the ball was zinged unerringly into the corner. Related: Liverpool v Manchester United – in pictures Fellaini and Mata have both been criticised for a lack of pace, while Herrera is hardly a flying machine and yet the three of them produced a passing move here that was too thrillingly swift for Liverpool’s cover, with nobody moving more than five yards in possession. As at least one Dutch footballing intellectual has pointed out, nothing moves faster than the ball. The second goal was similar, a moment of fine, triangular passing, topped with a breathtaking finish. Ángel Di María returned the ball to Mata at chest height and the Spaniard produced a moment of sublime improvisation, hurling himself into a gymnastic scissors volley and caressing the ball into the corner. Liverpool responded with great heart and with 21 minutes left it was 2-1, the goal finished by Daniel Sturridge, who flashed a shot across David De Gea and into something that wasn’t quite the corner. By then, though, not only were they behind and down to 10 men but it had become clear almost from the start Rodgers had spiked his own guns by playing Sterling in a withdrawn right wing-back position. From there Liverpool’s most direct attacking threat was reduced to a scuttling irrelevance, taking throw-ins and tackling by the corner flag. The change at half-time seemed the right one, with Gerrard on to add steel in the middle and Sterling pushed further forward. Then came Gerrard’s departure: a moment of witlessness, but symptomatic of a team that looked physically outgunned from the start. Summary:","response":"In a closely contested match between Manchester United and Liverpool, United's midfield strength played a significant role in their 2-1 victory. The match saw Liverpool's captain, Steven Gerrard, being sent off for a stamp on Ander Herrera's shin in the opening minute of the second half. Manchester United's targeted direct football, combined with swift transitions and two impressive goals from Juan Mata, overcame a Liverpool team that showed their attacking prowess only in glimpses during the match. The physical battle between Emre Can and Marouane Fellaini in the midfield was key, with Fellaini's bruising and aerial style testing Can's ability as a central defender."},{"question":"The Carnegie Foundation (Dutch: \\"Carnegie Stichting\\" ) is an organization based in The Hague, Netherlands.

Article: Centuries ago, man discovered that removing moisture from food helps to store it, and that the easiest way to do this is to expose the food to sun and wind. In this way the North American Indians produce pemmican(dried meat ground into powder and made into cakes), the Scandinavians make stockfish and the Arabs dried dates. All foods include water--cabbage and other leaf vegetables contains as much as 93% water, potatoes and other root vegetables 80%, lean meat 75% and fish, anything from 80% to 60%, depending on how fatty it is. If this water is removed, the activity of the bacteria which cause food to go bad is checked. Fruit is sun-dried in Asia Minor, Greece, Spain and other Mediterranean countries, and also in California, South Africa and Australia. Various methods are used, but in general, the fruit is spread out on trays in drying yards in the hot sun. Nowadays most foods are dried mechanically. The method of such dehydration is to put food in chambers through which hot air is blown at temperatures of about 110degC at entry to about 43degC at exit. This is the usual method for drying such things as vegetables, minced meat, and fish. Dried foods take up less room and weigh less than the same food packed in cans or frozen, and they do not need to be stored in special conditions. For these reasons they are invaluable to the climbers, explorers and soldiers in battle, who have little storage space. They are also popular with housewives because it takes so little time to cook them. Usually it is just a case of replacing the dried-out moisture with boiling water. Question: Bacteria which cause food to go bad _ . Answer: A:","response":"Bacteria which cause food to go bad have their activity checked when the water content in the food is removed. This is because bacteria rely on moisture to thrive and reproduce. Dehydrating food through various methods, such as sun-drying or mechanical drying, reduces the amount of water present, inhibiting bacterial growth and extending the shelf life of the food."},{"question":"Sentence 1: Recently, LSC examined its competitive grants process, through a series of discussions, and surveys and interviews with consultants, LSC grantees and staff, to determine its effectiveness in measuring an applicant's capacity to provide high quality, client-centered legal services.

Johnson signed the legislation into law. This landmark piece of civil rights legislation aimed to overcome legal barriers at the state and local levels that prevented African Americans from exercising their right to vote, as guaranteed by the 15th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The struggle for voting rights for African Americans in the United States had been ongoing since the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Despite the 15th Amendment, which was ratified in 1870, states used discriminatory means—such as poll taxes, literacy tests, and intimidation tactics—to disenfranchise millions of African American voters. These measures effectively excluded them from the democratic process. The Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s brought the issue of voting rights to the forefront of American society, through events such as the Montgomery Bus Boycott, the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, and the brutal Bloody Sunday incident in Selma, Alabama. These events, along with continued efforts of civil rights activists, led to growing public support for change. President Johnson, following the impact of Selma and the political pressure it generated, urged Congress to pass new voting rights legislation in March 1965. In June 1965, the Voting Rights Act was proposed by the U.S. Department of Justice and was passed by both the Senate and House of Representatives in July. Ultimately, it was signed into law by President Johnson on August 6, 1965. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 marked a significant shift in American politics, as it explicitly outlawed the discriminatory practices employed by the states and provided for federal oversight of voter registration in areas that had a history of racial discrimination. It led to the enfranchisement of millions of African American voters and played a crucial role in ensuring that every eligible citizen had a fair opportunity to participate in the democratic process. Over the years, several amendments and extensions have been made to the Voting Rights Act to provide further protections for minority groups and improve its effectiveness. The Act has been hailed as a cornerstone of civil rights legislation in the United States, but legal challenges and Supreme Court decisions in recent years have raised concerns about its future effectiveness. Nonetheless, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 remains a vital instrument in efforts to guarantee equal access to the electoral process for all Americans."},{"question":"Teacher:In this task, you need to count the number of words in a sentence that start with the given letter.

Fifteen were successful, each designed as either an orbiter or lander, and accomplished many firsts in space exploration. They also performed many experiments, studying the Moon's chemical composition, gravity, temperature, and radiation. - A spacecraft is a vehicle, or machine designed to fly in outer space. Spacecraft are used for a variety of purposes, including communications, earth observation, meteorology, navigation, space colonization, planetary exploration, and transportation of humans and cargo. - The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system comprising the Sun and the objects that orbit it, either directly or indirectly. Of those objects that orbit the Sun directly, the largest eight are the planets, with the remainder being significantly smaller objects, such as dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies. Of the objects that orbit the Sun indirectly, the moons, two are larger than the smallest planet, Mercury. - In physics, an orbit is the gravitationally curved path of an object around a point in space, for example the orbit of a planet about a star or a natural satellite around a planet. Normally, orbit refers to a regularly repeating path around a body, although it may occasionally be used for a non recurring trajectory or a path around a point in space. To a close approximation, planets and satellites follow elliptical orbits, with the central mass being orbited at a focal point of the ellipse, as described by Kepler's laws of planetary motion. - Luna 3, or E-2A No.1 was a Soviet spacecraft launched in 1959 as part of the Luna programme. It was the first-ever mission to photograph the far side of the Moon. It was also the third space probe to be sent to the neighborhood of the Moon. Though it returned rather poor pictures by later standards, the historic, never-before-seen views of the far side of the Moon caused excitement and interest when they were published around the world, and a tentative \\"Atlas of the Far Side of the Moon\\" was created after image processing improved the pictures. - A circumlunar trajectory, trans-lunar trajectory or lunar free return is a type of free return trajectory which takes a spacecraft from Earth, around the far side of the Moon, and back to Earth using only gravity once the initial trajectory is set. - The Moon is an astronomical body that orbits planet Earth, being Earth's only permanent natural satellite. It is the fifth-largest natural satellite in the Solar System, and the largest among planetary satellites relative to the size of the planet that it orbits (its primary). Following Jupiter's satellite Io, the Moon is second-densest satellite among those whose densities are known. - Luna E- 3 No.1 , sometimes identified by NASA as Luna 1960A , was a Soviet spacecraft which was lost in a launch failure in 1960 . It was a 279 - kilogram ( 615 lb ) Luna E- 3 spacecraft , the first of two to be launched , both of which were lost in launch failures . It was intended to fly around the Moon on a circumlunar trajectory in order to image the surface of the Moon , including the far side . The E- 3 spacecraft were similar in design to the E- 2A which had been used for the earlier Luna 3 mission . However , they carried higher resolution cameras , and were intended to make closer flybys . - The far side of the Moon is the hemisphere of the Moon that always faces away from Earth. The far side's terrain is rugged, with a multitude of impact craters and relatively few flat lunar maria. It has one of the largest craters in the Solar System, the South PoleAitken basin. Although both sides of the moon experience two weeks of sunlight followed by two weeks of night, the far side is also referred to as the dark side of the Moon, originally in the sense of \\"unknown\\" rather than lack of light. - A planet is an astronomical body orbiting a star or stellar remnant that The term \\"planet\\" is ancient, with ties to history, astrology, science, mythology, and religion. Several planets in the Solar System can be seen with the naked eye. These were regarded by many early cultures as divine, or as emissaries of deities. As scientific knowledge advanced, human perception of the planets changed, incorporating a number of disparate objects. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially adopted a resolution defining planets within the Solar System. This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit. Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before 1950 remain \\"planets\\" under the modern definition, some celestial bodies, such as Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta (each an object in the solar asteroid belt), and Pluto (the first trans-Neptunian object discovered), that were once considered planets by the scientific community, are no longer viewed as such. - A free-return trajectory is a trajectory of a spacecraft traveling away from a primary body (for example, the Earth) where gravity due to a secondary body (for example, the Moon) causes the spacecraft to return to the primary body without propulsion (hence the term \\"free\\"). - Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a giant planet with a mass one-thousandth that of the Sun, but two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined. Jupiter is a gas giant, along with Saturn, with the other two giant planets, Uranus and Neptune, being ice giants. Jupiter was known to astronomers of ancient times. The Romans named it after their god Jupiter. When viewed from Earth, Jupiter can reach an apparent magnitude of 2.94, bright enough for its reflected light to cast shadows, and making it on average the third-brightest object in the night sky after the Moon and Venus.

How can a virus affect the update on an HP computer? Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","response":"I will provide information on the mentioned KMS-R@1n.exe, its effect on your computer, and how a virus can affect updates on an HP computer. Step 1: Research KMS-R@1n.exe KMS-R@1n.exe is a potentially harmful executable file associated with a number of illegal software activations. It is related to Key Management System (KMS) activators which are meant to bypass activation of Microsoft Windows or Microsoft Office software products. Step 2: Assess KMS-R@1n.exe effects on a computer While KMS-R@1n.exe might be intended for product activation, it is known to have potentially unwanted side effects like modifying system files, registry changes, and potentially opening a backdoor for other malware. This can lead to instability, reduced performance, and increased vulnerability of your computer. Step 3: Understand how a virus can affect updates on an HP computer Any computer, including HP computers, can be affected by viruses. When a virus infiltrates a computer, it can interfere with system processes, such as software updates. A virus can prevent your computer from receiving crucial security patches and OS updates, leaving your device more susceptible to other malware. Step 4: Compare the two questions Question 1 asks about KMS-R@1n.exe and its potential effects on a computer, while question 2 is about how a virus can affect updates on an HP computer. Conclusion: Although both questions are related to malicious software or unwanted programs affecting computers, they are not inquiring about the same information. The first question is specifically about KMS-R@1n.exe and its potential effects, while the second question focuses on the impact of a virus on computer updates more broadly."},{"question":"Premise: \\"Young students demonstrate their swordsmanship in front of onlookers.\\" Hypothesis: \\"Young swordsman show off for onlookers on a game show.\\" Do we know that the hypothesis entailed by the premise? Let's solve step-by-step:","response":"Step 1: Analyze the Premise The premise states that \\"Young students demonstrate their swordsmanship in front of onlookers.\\" From this, we can gather that: - The individuals involved are young students. - They are demonstrating their swordsmanship skills. - There are onlookers present, observing the demonstration. Step 2: Analyze the Hypothesis The hypothesis states that \\"Young swordsman show off for onlookers on a game show.\\" From this, we can gather that: - The individuals involved are young swordsmen. - They are showing off, which can be interpreted as demonstrating their skills. - There are onlookers present, observing the demonstration. - The event takes place on a game show. Step 3: Compare the Premise and Hypothesis We can see that there are similarities between the premise and the hypothesis, such as the presence of onlookers and the demonstration of swordsmanship skills. However, there are also some differences: - The premise refers to young students, while the hypothesis refers to young swordsmen. Although these terms could represent the same group of people, the terminology used is different. - The hypothesis introduces additional information: that the event takes place on a game show. This information is not mentioned or implied in the premise. Conclusion: Based on the step-by-step analysis, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise because there are differences in the terms used to describe the individuals involved, and the addition of the game show context in the hypothesis is not present in the premise."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Question: The shark was sick of the confines of its tank, what was it looking for? Choices: - sea world - tomales bay - great oceans - the key - tropical waters The rationale to choose \\"great oceans\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","response":"Great oceans. Step 1: Analyze the question The question asks us to determine what the shark was looking for when it was tired of being confined to its tank. Step 2: Evaluate each choice - Sea World: A theme park, it would not provide the open waters that this shark is seemingly searching for. - Tomales Bay: A specific bay in California, a potentially limited space compared to the vastness of the oceans. - Great oceans: Large, open bodies of water, which would allow the shark to roam freely and escape its confinement. - The key: It is unclear what this refers to, and it does not imply any connection to the shark's freedom. - Tropical waters: Specific type of water temperature but does not necessarily provide the open space the shark desires. Step 3: Select the most likely choice In this context, \\"great oceans\\" appears to be the most reasonable choice.

Can you help me answer a few questions? If you can't, please say \\"No I can't\\". Question: What does Matthew attach to his penis in order to increase its size? Movie title: 100 Girls Movie plot: After leaving a party at a women's dormitory (aka the \\"virgin vault\\"), Matthew (Jonathan Tucker) is trapped in an elevator with an unknown, and unseen, woman when the power goes out. Matthew and this unknown woman have sex in the dark. When Matthew wakes up in the morning still in the elevator he finds himself alone with a pair of her panties.On a mission to find his mystery maiden by finding a matching bra for the panties, Matthew becomes the maintenance boy of the virgin vault. He releases mice and goes room to room setting traps. He convinces the panicked women to leave the room and then starts to look for a match. This does not prove successful, and he continues to break things (such as the air conditioning) in an effort to find his woman. He also fixes the television set, which is greatly received by women he refers to as \\"Jane-ites,\\" as they have a great interest in movies adapted from books by Jane Austen. He doesn't get much help from his roommate Rod (James DeBello), who keeps telling him to give up, and together they philosophize about men and women. Rod tells him that he doesn't need a girlfriend and that it's futile to try to find the \\"matching bra the panties,\\" and Matthew accuses him of being too machismo. Rod introduces Matthew to his adopted idea of \\"penile power\\" that he uses to try to increase the size of his penis. We later find out that he does this, as well as the dissing of women entirely, as a ploy to try to make himself feel better about the problem he has with his manhood.Early on, he watches as a woman named Patty (Emmanuelle Chriqui) and her boyfriend Crick fight. Crick is the epitome of the macho man stereotype, with his big pectorals, conceited attitude, and abusiveness. He wears a pony-tail, a manicured goatee, \\"male make-up,\\" and chews nicotine gum, much to Matthew's dismay. Matthew tries to save Patty, but is hurt by Crick. Crick leaves and Patty tries to help Matthew, but Matthew can't help but think of how Patty's reputation has been.While searching one room, Matthew finds... Answer:","response":"In the movie \\"100 Girls,\\" Matthew does not attach anything to his penis to increase its size. Instead, his roommate Rod introduces him to the concept of \\"penile power,\\" which Rod uses to try and make himself feel better about his own insecurities related to his manhood. It seems that Rod believes in certain practices or exercises aimed at improving his penis size, although the exact methods are not explicitly described or shown in the movie. The film primarily revolves around Matthew's quest to find the unknown woman he shared an intimate moment with in an elevator. He becomes the maintenance boy for the women's dormitory, looking for a matching bra to the panties left behind by the mystery woman. Along the way, he has various interactions, including one with Patty and her boyfriend Crick, who embodies the macho man stereotype. Matthew gets caught up in their confrontation, which leads him to introspect on Patty's reputation. Nonetheless, the central focus of the plot is on Matthew's search for his mystery maiden and his exploration of relationships between men and women. Rod's embrace of \\"penile power\\" and his attempts to increase his penis size is a subplot that adds some humor and commentary on the issues of masculinity and self-worth. However, it is not a significant or defining element of the story."},{"question":"Answer the following question: I know that the answer to the question \\"Which of the following is not a grammatical mood: conditional, second-person or imperative?\\" is in \\"The infinitive form ends in t (archaically, ti). It is the form found in dictionaries and the form that follows auxiliary verbs (for example, můžu tě slyšet—\\"I can hear you\\"). Czech verbs have three grammatical moods: indicative, imperative and conditional. The imperative mood adds specific endings for each of three person (or number) categories: -Ø/-i/-ej for second-person singular, -te/-ete/-ejte for second-person plural and -me/-eme/-ejme for first-person plural. The conditional mood is formed with a particle after the past-tense verb. This mood indicates possible events, expressed in English as \\"I would\\" or \\"I wish\\".\\". Can you tell me what it is? Answer:","response":"Based on the information you provided, the answer to the question \\"Which of the following is not a grammatical mood: conditional, second-person or imperative?\\" is \\"second-person.\\" The second-person is not a grammatical mood but rather a grammatical person. In the context of grammar, a person refers to the distinction in the verb form due to the identity of the person performing or represented by its argument, and it includes first person, second person and third person. On the other hand, grammatical moods, like conditional and imperative, refer to the mode or manner in which the action of a verb is represented. As mentioned in the text you provided, Czech verbs have three grammatical moods: indicative, imperative, and conditional. The imperative mood is used for issuing commands, while the conditional mood expresses possible events or hypothetical or imagined situations.

It juts hundreds of kilometers into the Arabian Sea and lies along the southern side of the Gulf of Aden. The area is the easternmost projection of the African continent. The Horn of Africa denotes the region containing the countries of Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Somalia. - Zokors are Asiatic burrowing rodents resembling mole-rats. They include two genera, \\"Myospalax\\" and \\"Eospalax\\". Zokors are native to much of China, Kazakhstan, and Siberian Russia. - Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people. - Rodents (from Latin \\"rodere\\", \\"to gnaw\\") are mammals of the order Rodentia, which are characterized by a single pair of continuously growing incisors in each of the upper and lower jaws. About 40% of all mammal species are rodents; they are found in vast numbers on all continents except Antarctica. They are the most diversified mammalian order and live in a variety of terrestrial habitats, including human-made environments. - The Muridae, or murids, are the largest family of rodents and of mammals, containing over 700 species found naturally throughout Eurasia, Africa, and Australia. - The Muroidea are a large superfamily of rodents, including mice, rats, voles, hamsters, gerbils, and many other relatives. They occupy a vast variety of habitats on every continent except Antarctica. Some authorities have placed all members of this group into a single family, Muridae, due to difficulties in determining how the subfamilies are related to one another. The following taxonomy is based on recent well-supported molecular phylogenies. - Rats are various medium-sized, long-tailed rodents of the superfamily Muroidea. \\"True rats\\" are members of the genus \\"Rattus\\", the most important of which to humans are the black rat, \\"Rattus rattus\\", and the brown rat, \\"Rattus norvegicus\\". Many members of other rodent genera and families are also referred to as rats, and share many characteristics with true rats. - The bamboo rats are four species of rodents of the subfamily Rhizomyinae. They are the sole living representatives of the tribe Rhizomyini. All are found in the eastern half of Asia. - The Spalacidae, or spalacids, are a family of rodents in the large and complex superfamily Muroidea. They are native to eastern Asia, the Horn of Africa, the Middle East, and southeastern Europe. It includes the blind mole-rats, bamboo rats, mole-rats, and zokors. This family represents the oldest split (excluding perhaps the Platacanthomyinae) in the muroid superfamily, and comprises animals adapted to a subterranean way of life. These rodents were thought to have evolved adaptations to living underground independently until recent genetic studies demonstrated they form a monophyletic group.

They share many morphological features with the scorpionfish of the family Scorpaenidae. - Cirrhitichthys is a genus of hawkfishes found on tropical reefs in the Indian and western Pacific oceans . - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus. What is the relationship between 'cirrhitichthys' and 'cirrhitidae'? The answer is:","response":"Cirrhitichthys is a genus of hawkfishes within the family Cirrhitidae.

Erosion is a significant natural process that involves the removal and transportation of soil and rock material due to various factors, such as water, wind, and ice. The process can lead to changes in landscapes and habitats and can impact the plants and organisms living in these environments. Leaves and other organic materials like twigs, branches, and grass help stabilize soil and reduce erosion by forming a protective layer on the soil surface. This layer improves the soil's structure and reduces its vulnerability to erosive forces, such as water and wind. Moreover, vegetation and organic matter also help to absorb and slow down runoff, allowing more time for the water to infiltrate the soil rather than carrying it away. If fewer leaves are added to a nest, this could imply a reduction of organic material on the soil surface. A likely outcome of this scenario includes an increased potential for more erosion. The following points explain why this could occur: 1. Reduced protection: With fewer leaves and organic materials, the soil's surface will have less protection against the impact of raindrops and water flow. This can lead to the breakdown of soil aggregates and the formation of surface crusts, which will impede water infiltration and increase runoff and erosion. 2. Decreased soil stability: The absence of leaves can weaken the soil structure because the organic matter acts as a binding agent for soil particles. Weaker soil structures are more vulnerable to erosion caused by water or wind. 3. Altered microclimate: Leaves and plant material help to create a microclimate by providing shade and reducing evaporation. With fewer leaves, increased evaporation rates lead to drier soil, which is more susceptible to erosion, especially wind erosion. 4. Reduced water retention: Leaves and organic material on the soil surface help retain water in the soil. Reduced organic material can limit the soil’s capacity to hold water, making it more vulnerable to erosion as water flows over the surface rather than being absorbed and contained within the soil. Based on the given options: - A: More erosion occurs - This is the most likely outcome because the lack of leaves and organic material on the soil surface can result in reduced overall soil stability and protection. Consequently, this can lead to the deterioration of the soil structure and an increased vulnerability to erosion. - B: Less erosion occurs - This scenario would be unlikely since decreased leaf and organic content would generally lead to more erosion due to the factors mentioned above. - C: No effect - Again, this option is improbable since changes in the amount of organic material available on the soil surface will directly impact the soil’s characteristics and its susceptibility to erosion. In conclusion, the reduction of leaves added to the nest will most likely result in more erosion due to the subsequent increase in soil vulnerability and susceptibility to erosive forces. By understanding how the lack of organic material impacts soil structure and stability, we can better predict and manage any changes in the ecosystem associated with erosion."},{"question":"Translate \\"PATTON: Colonel!\\" to Czech?","response":"In Czech, the translation of \\"PATTON: Colonel!\\" would be \\"PATTON: Plukovník!\\" Here, \\"Patton\\" is the proper name of an individual, which doesn't need to be translated and remains the same in Czech. \\"Colonel\\" is translated to \\"Plukovník\\" in Czech, which is a military rank similar to the original English word.

In many places, the summers are warm and humid enough to provide the perfect environment for a Boston fern. They do best in environments with humidity levels of at least 50 percent. If your daytime temperatures are between 65 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit (18 to 24 degrees Celsius), and your nighttime temperatures are between 55 and 65 degrees Fahrenheit (13 to 18 degrees Celsius), your Boston ferns will thrive outdoors. You can place them on your porch or patio, and they should do well. The cooler temperatures at night will help to prevent fungus from developing. If you are keeping your Boston fern indoors, whether permanently or just for the winter months, you will need to be careful about making sure it has adequate humidity. The very best thing to do is to place it in a room with a humidifier. Keep your house between 65 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit (18 to 24 degrees Celsius), and put it in a cooler room at night. If you don’t want to invest in a humidifier, there are other options. You can place your fern in a saucer filled with small stones and water. The water will create humidity as it evaporates. Boston ferns do best when receiving indirect, filtered sunlight. If they’re outdoors, place them somewhere where they will get sunlight through tree branches, or cracks in a porch roof. If they’re indoors, place them near a window. You don’t want your fern to be in shade, but you don’t want them to be in direct sunlight. It’s a delicate balance.

They contend that there were two, connected causes to the crisis: the relaxation of underwriting standards in 1995 and the ultra-low interest rates initiated by the Federal Reserve after the terrorist attack on September 11, 2001. Both causes had to be in place before the crisis could take place. Critics also point out that publicly announced CRA loan commitments were massive, totaling 4.5 trillion in the years between 1994 and 2007.

This is called the adolescent growth spurt. In boys, it is controlled by testosterone. The rate of growth usually starts to increase relatively early in puberty. At its peak rate, growth in height is about 10 centimeters (almost 4 inches) per year in the average male. Growth generally remains rapid for several years. Growth and development of muscles occur toward the end of the growth spurt in height. Muscles may continue to develop and gain strength after growth in height is finished. Paragraph: Jimothy and Dwight are two brothers living in the same house. Jimothy is a freshman in high school and Dwight is a junior in high school. Their mother takes them to see a doctor and to have their testosterone tested. The tests reveal that Dwight has significantly more testosterone than Jimothy, but that is to be expected given their age difference. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which boy will start developing muscles later? The answer to this question is:","response":"Jimothy will start developing muscles later. Since Jimothy is a freshman in high school, he is younger than Dwight, who is a junior. The age difference between the two brothers indicates that Dwight has already undergone more of the puberty process than Jimothy, including experiencing the adolescent growth spurt. This is further confirmed by the testosterone test results that show Dwight has significantly more testosterone than Jimothy. Testosterone plays a crucial role in boys' development during puberty, controlling not only their growth spurt but also the growth and development of muscles. As mentioned in the background information, the development of muscles occurs towards the end of the growth spurt in height. Since Dwight has reached an advanced stage in puberty as indicated by his higher testosterone levels, he is also expected to be further along in his muscle development. In comparison, Jimothy, being younger and at an earlier state of puberty, will start developing muscles later than Dwight. As his body continues to grow in height and his testosterone levels rise throughout puberty, he will eventually undergo muscle development towards the end of his adolescent growth spurt. However, this process of muscle growth and development is expected to occur after Dwight, due to the age difference and the different stages of puberty the two brothers are in."},{"question":"- branch is australian army - caption is brigadier wilkie in afghanistan , august 2012 - battles is cambodia iraq war war in afghanistan - allegiance is australia - commands is australian staff cadets , royal military college duntroon defence college army recruit training centre corps of - awards is member service bronze star -lrb- united states -rrb- of the order of australia commendation for distinguished - serviceyears is 1983 -- present - image size is 280px - image is simone wilkie - cropped.jpg - birth place is ballarat , victoria - rank is major general Given the details above, guess who could this information be about.

Which project would register higher CPU load, project A or project C? Bob works for a data storage company. He has now three projects, project A, project B, and project C, simultaneously going on. All of them involves storing XML data. Project A has small volume of data, but project B and project C has large volume of data. He applied Fast Infoset format for project B, but didn't apply that format for project C. Hint: Storing large volumes of data – When storing XML to either file or database, the volume of data a system produces can often exceed reasonable limits, with a number of detriments: the access times go up as more data is read, CPU load goes up as XML data takes more power to process, and storage costs go up. By storing XML data in Fast Infoset format, data volume may be reduced by as much as 80 percent. Answer:","response":"Project C would register a higher CPU load. Both Project B and Project C involve storing large volumes of data, which we know can often exceed reasonable limits and increase CPU load as the system must put more power into processing the XML data. However, the crucial difference between the two is the format in which the data is stored. For Project B, Bob applied the Fast Infoset format. This format is beneficial because it can reduce the data volume by as much as 80 percent, thereby lessening the burden on the CPU. A decreased data volume implies lesser data for the system to read and process, so less power is required. This directly impacts the CPU load, causing it to be lower with the use of Fast Infoset format. On the other hand, for Project C, Bob did not apply the Fast Infoset format. This means that the large volume of XML data is not being reduced, and the system is tasked with managing the full volume of data. The CPU load would go up due to the increased power needed to process this large volume of XML data. Comparing this to Project A, which has a small volume of data, regardless of the non-use of Fast Infoset format, the CPU load would still be less because the amount of data that needs processing is much smaller. Therefore, in the context of these three projects, since Project C has a large volume of XML data without the reduction benefits of the Fast Infoset format, it would register a higher CPU load compared to Projects A and B."},{"question":"Give the rationale and then the answer.

To determine the accuracy of this statement, we need to look into the habitats of Perch fish and the necessity of accessing these habitats with a chartered boat. Answer: The statement is not accurate. Perch are freshwater fish and can be found in rivers, lakes, and reservoirs, rather than the Atlantic Ocean. They are commonly found in North America and Europe, especially in regions with clean water and moderate temperatures.

Title: Charlotte's Web Movie plot: With the birth of a new litter of 11 piglets, the farmer must eliminate one so the mother can feed them. The farmer gets his ax and selects the runt of the litter when he is stopped by his daughter, Fern (Dakota Fanning). Fern begins to feed her new piglet and names him Wilbur (voice of Dominic Scott Kay). After Wilbur gets strong enough to be on his own, he is put into the barn across the road. In the new barn, he meets many different animals: cows, sheep, geese, a rat, a horse, and of course a spider named Charlotte (voice of Julia Roberts). Wilbur's friendship with all the animals in the barn brings them all together, and they become one big happy family. There is only one problem that Wilbur doesn't know, he is a spring pig, and they don't usually get to see winter. Charlotte promises Wilbur that she will do something to save his life. Charlotte spins the words \\"some pig\\" in her web to show the farmer a miracle that may save Wilbur's life. Douglas Young (the-movie-guy) The answer is:","response":"The farmer must eliminate one piglet because the mother can only feed a limited number of piglets, and eliminating one will help ensure that the remaining piglets receive adequate nutrition."},{"question":"Who is the current UN Secretary General ?

In Spanish, we keep the same idea by saying \\"He trabajado.\\" - con: This word means \\"with\\" in both Italian and Spanish, so we can leave it as it is. - le piante: In Italian, this means \\"the plants.\\" In Spanish, we use \\"las plantas\\" to express the same idea. - i batteri: This means \\"the bacteria\\" in Italian. In Spanish, the translation is \\"las bacterias.\\" - le seppie: This translates to \\"the cuttlefish\\" in Italian, but since \\"cuttlefish\\" and \\"squid\\" share similarities, we can use \\"los calamares\\" in Spanish for a more familiar term. - le mosche della frutta: This phrase means \\"the fruit flies\\" in Italian.

Last week, it was Trump's firing of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and an apparent Democratic victory in a special congressional election in Pennsylvania — a sign of a possible wave in the November midterm elections. This week, it was a series of presidential tweets criticizing the Russia probe, followed by a controversial Trump statement of congratulations for newly re-elected Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump also added former U.S. attorney Joseph diGenova to his legal team. DiGenova has alleged that elements of the FBI and the Department of Justice have been out to frame Trump in connection with the Russia probe. Trump ignored shouted questions Tuesday from reporters at the White House who asked whether he wanted to fire special counsel Robert Mueller, who is leading the Russia probe. Earlier, House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, told reporters at the Capitol that he had received \\"assurances\\" that firing Mueller was \\"not even under consideration.\\" The latest back and forth over the Mueller investigation came after several days of presidential tweets complaining about the probe, including one blasting it as a \\"total WITCH HUNT with massive conflicts of interest.\\" The tweets sparked new fears that Trump might try to have Mueller fired. Some Republicans warned that an attempt to fire Mueller could put Trump's presidency in jeopardy. \\"I think anything directed at firing Mr. Mueller blows up the whole town, and that becomes the end of governing and the presidency as we know it,\\" cautioned Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. The renewed focus on the Russia probe came in the wake of last week's firing of Tillerson. That, in turn, raised the prospect of more administration changes. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: After the end of the this story, how does Putin feel toward Trump? Options: - supportive - not enough information - angry - disgusted A:","response":"- not enough information"},{"question":"How might one describe the sentiment of this review?

Nick Williams, Blaine Scully, Sion Bennett, Kris Dacey, Willis Halaholo and man-of-the-match Matthew Morgan scored the other home tries. Meanwhile, Ian McKinley and Angelo Esposito both crossed for Treviso. It was a much-needed return to form for the Welsh side who had not won in the Pro12 since Boxing Day. There was little sign of them cutting loose in the first half, however, despite an early 25-metre charge from Williams and a late close-range corner effort from Scully. McKinley, Treviso's Irish fly-half, danced over for a try while half-back partner and former Osprey Tito Tebaldi added the conversion to his two penalties. The second half was virtual one-way traffic as the Blues came out firing on all cylinders, running the ball from their own 22. Shingler, Bennett and Dacey all crossed inside ten minutes, Dacey finishing off after a spectacular solo run from Morgan, and Shingler converted them all to seal the result. Esposito pulled a try back with Tebaldi converting, but it was only a temporary hold-up to a dominant Cardiff Blues second-half performance. Cuthbert's blistering break-out from defence put Halaholo over, Morgan strolled over unopposed and Cuthbert got on the scoresheet himself with a 35-metre run in the final move, to rousing applause from the Cardiff faithful.

Students and faculty raced out of harm's way, ducked under furniture, barricaded doors and hid in interior rooms, bathrooms and labs. The short-lived nightmare on the campus of the University of California, Los Angeles came one day before Wear Orange: National Gun Violence Awareness Day. Wear Orange was inspired by friends of Hadiya Pendleton, a 15-year-old Chicago high school student killed by gunfire in 2013. The group decided to honor her life by wearing orange — the color worn by hunters in the woods to protect themselves and others. While the idea has been embraced by civic organizations, politicians and celebrities, it has been rejected by gun rights advocates. The National Rifle Association has attacked the campaign as \\"pointless,\\" and said \\"participating is an easy way of scoring points for being 'socially conscious.'\\" Here is a look at the unique relationship between Americans and their guns. Any law-abiding citizen in the United States is allowed to own or carry a gun. That right comes from the U.S. Bill of Rights and the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. It says: \\"A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\\" The Second Amendment was based partially on English common law, which describes an auxiliary right, supporting the natural rights of self-defense, resistance to oppression, and the civic duty to act in concert in defense of the state. To purchase a gun in the majority of states, a person needs to be of age, pass the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check and fill out a firearms transaction record. However, background checks are not currently required for private sales, including those conducted at gun shows. Certain people are banned from owning weapons, including convicted criminals, people with mental health illnesses or non-U.S. citizens. But the system has major holes in it. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: Why did the group pick the color orange?

The answer to this question is:","response":"The nation of Greece is located in southeastern Europe at the southernmost tip of the Balkan Peninsula. It is strategically positioned at the crossroads of Europe, Asia, and Africa. Geographically, Greece shares land borders with Albania to the northwest, the Republic of North Macedonia to the north, Bulgaria to the north and northeast, and Turkey to the northeast. It is bordered by the Ionian Sea to the west, the Mediterranean Sea to the south, and the Aegean Sea to the east. The country's total land area is approximately 131,957 square kilometers (50,949 square miles), and it includes numerous islands scattered across the Aegean and Ionian seas. The larger and more well-known Greek islands include Crete, Rhodes, Lesbos, and Corfu. There are around 6,000 islands and islets in total, of which only around 227 are inhabited. Greece's terrain is primarily mountainous, with about 80% of the country being covered by mountains or hills. Numerous mountain ranges extend across the mainland, such as the Pindus Mountains, which stretch from north to south, and form the country's natural backbone. The highest mountain in Greece, Mount Olympus, stands at 2,918 meters (9,573 feet) and is considered the mythical home of the ancient Greek gods. The climate in Greece is predominantly Mediterranean, characterized by hot and dry summers, as well as mild and wet winters. The coastal areas and islands experience a more moderate climate due to the influence of the seas, while the mountainous regions experience colder temperatures and occasionally heavy snowfall during winter months. Greece has a rich and diverse cultural history that dates back thousands of years. The country is often regarded as the cradle of Western civilization, owing to its profound impact on language, politics, philosophy, art, science, and sports, among other aspects of human endeavor. Ancient Greece was home to prominent figures such as Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, whose ideas and works have significantly influenced Western thought. The nation's capital and largest city is Athens, which is also considered one of the world's oldest cities. It is home to several iconic landmarks, such as the Parthenon and the Acropolis. Other major cities in Greece include Thessaloniki, Patras, and Heraklion.

Administration of Nuffield's donation was the responsibility of the University, as the college did not become an independent body until after the Second World War. A sub-committee, consisting of three heads of Oxford colleges (Sir William Beveridge from University College; Alfred Emden from St Edmund Hall; and Linda Grier from Lady Margaret Hall), was appointed to choose the architect; Emden appears to have played the major part in the group's work. Eight architects were initially asked to compete, including Louis de Soissons, Vincent Harris, Austen Harrison, Charles Holden, Edward Maufe, and Hubert Worthington. All but Holden and Maufe submitted photographs of their work, and the sub-committee then recommended Harrison, a decision confirmed after he was interviewed on 17 June 1938. At that time, Harrison had never worked in Britain: although he had qualified there, he had practised in Greece and Palestine. Indeed, the college seems to have been his only project in the country, and remains his best known work, along with his later University of Ghana. Harrison was not given any restrictions or limitations on style; Nuffield agreed to Harrison's appointment, but was not consulted on the architectural style of the college before Harrison started work. When Nuffield's donation was announced, it was reported that the \\"general idea\\" was that the college buildings should be sited behind gardens, similar to the memorial gardens at Christ Church, Oxford, so that those entering Oxford from the west would be faced with a \\"beautiful vista of well-planned gardens seen through railings\\"; this idea did not form part of Harrison's designs. After Harrison's preliminary studies, it became clear that the proposed site could not contain a college and an institute for social science research as planned; Nuffield agreed to provide an additional plot of land on the opposite side of Worcester Street. Harrison proposed to build the college on the main site, with the institute on the second site. The hall was to be at the east end...

Sir Henry Joseph Wood (3 March 1869 – 19 August 1944) was an English conductor best known for his association with London's annual series of promenade concerts, known as the Proms. He conducted them for nearly half a century, introducing hundreds of new works to British audiences. After his death, the concerts were officially renamed in his honour as the \\"Henry Wood Promenade Concerts\\", although they continued to be generally referred to as \\"the Proms\\". Born in modest circumstances to parents who encouraged his musical talent, Wood started his career as an organist. During his studies at the Royal Academy of Music, he came under the influence of the voice teacher Manuel Garcia and became his accompanist. After similar work for Richard D'Oyly Carte's opera companies on the works of Arthur Sullivan and others, Wood became the conductor of a small operatic touring company. He was soon engaged by the larger Carl Rosa Opera Company. One notable event in his operatic career was conducting the British premiere of Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin in 1892. From the mid-1890s until his death, Wood focused on concert conducting. He was engaged by the impresario Robert Newman to conduct a series of promenade concerts at the Queen's Hall, offering a mixture of classical and popular music at low prices. The series was successful, and Wood conducted annual promenade series until his death in 1944. By the 1920s, Wood had steered the repertoire entirely to classical music. When the Queen's Hall was destroyed by bombing in 1941, the Proms moved to the Royal Albert Hall. Wood declined the chief conductorships of the New York Philharmonic and Boston Symphony Orchestras, believing it his duty to serve music in the United Kingdom. In addition to the Proms, he conducted concerts and festivals throughout the country and also trained the student orchestra at the Royal Academy of Music. He had an enormous influence on the musical life of Britain over his long career: he and Newman greatly improved access to classical music, and Wood...

Article: Elizabeth Freeman was born about 1742 to African American parents who were slaves. At the age of six months she was acquired, along with her sister, by John Ashley, a wealthy Massachusetts slaveholders. She became known as \\"Mumbet\\" or \\"Mum Bett.\\" For nearly 30 years Mumbet served the Ashley family. One day, Ashley's wife tried to strike Mumbet's sister with a spade. Mumbet protected her sister and took the blow instead. Furious, she left the house and refused to come back. When the Ashleys tried to make her return, Mumbet consulted a lawyer, Theodore Sedgewick. With his help, Mumbet sued for her freedom. While serving the Ashleys, Mumbet had listened to many discussions of the new Massachusetts constitution. If the constitution said that all people were free and equal, then she thought it should apply to her. Eventually, Mumbet won her freedom---- the first slave in Massachusetts to do so under the new constitution. Strangely enough, after the trial, the Ashleys asked Mumbet to come back and work for them as a paid employee. She declined and instead went to work for Segdewick. Mumbet died in 1829, but her legacy lived on in her many descendants . One of her great-grandchildren was W.E.B. Du Bois, one of the founder of the NAACP, and an important writer and spokesperson for African American civil rights. Mumbet's tombstone still stands in the Massachusetts cemetery where she was buried. It reads, in part: \\"She was born a slave and remained a slave and remained a slave for nearly thirty years. She could neither read nor write, yet in her own sphere she had no superior or equal.\\" Question: Why did Mumbet run away from the Ashleys? Options: A: She found an employer B: She wanted to be a lawyer C: She was hit and got angry D: She had to take care of her sister A:","response":"C: She was hit and got angry"},{"question":"The six episodes were written by Gareth Carrivick ( \`\` Gim me Gim me Gim '' ) and directed by Jonathan Harvey . The six sequels were written by Jonathan Harvey ( \`\` Gim me Gim me Gim me '' ) and directed by Gareth Carrivick . Are these two sentences paraphrases of each other? OPT: [A]. no [B]. yes","response":"To determine if these two sentences are paraphrases of each other, let's analyze the information they provide. Sentence 1: - Six episodes - Written by Gareth Carrivick - Show title: \\"Gim me Gim me Gim\\" - Directed by Jonathan Harvey Sentence 2: - Six sequels - Written by Jonathan Harvey - Show title: \\"Gim me Gim me Gim me\\" - Directed by Gareth Carrivick Now we can compare the information in both sentences: 1. Sentence 1 mentions episodes while Sentence 2 mentions sequels. Episodes are parts of a television show, whereas sequels usually refer to subsequent installments of movies or books. This point suggests they are not paraphrases. 2. In Sentence 1, Gareth Carrivick is the writer, and Jonathan Harvey is the director, while in Sentence 2, the roles are switched (Jonathan Harvey is the writer, and Gareth Carrivick is the director). This also indicates that they are not paraphrases. 3. The show titles are slightly different, with Sentence 1 having \\"Gim me Gim me Gim\\" and Sentence 2 having \\"Gim me Gim me Gim me.\\" Based on these differences, the answer is: [A]. no These two sentences are not paraphrases of each other because they provide different information about the roles of the individuals and the type of content (episodes vs. sequels)."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Question: When people social at a bar, the bartender will often do what to the cocktails they serve? Choices: - meet people - have friends - mix - with people - see people The rationale to choose \\"mix\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","response":"The rationale to choose \\"mix\\" as the answer is that, as a bartender, their primary responsibility is to mix and serve alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages to customers at the bar. The other options - meet people, have friends, with people, and see people - are all social aspects related to the overall ambiance and experience at the bar, but they don't specifically describe the bartender's role in serving cocktails. A bartender's job is to create and serve drinks to customers. This includes selecting appropriate glassware, measuring and mixing ingredients accurately, garnishing cocktails, and ensuring that the drinks are visually appealing. The act of \\"mixing\\" is a crucial part of this process, as it involves combining different flavorful components to create a well-balanced and enjoyable cocktail. In summary, the choice \\"mix\\" is the most appropriate answer because it directly relates to the bartender's core responsibility of preparing and serving cocktails to customers at the bar. The other options may be associated with the social atmosphere of a bar but are not specific to the process of serving cocktails."},{"question":"Answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the name of Nanelia father? from the following article ? The farming world Akir is threatened by the tyrannical warlord Sador, who rules the sinister Malmori Empire and, his body parts deteriorating, is capturing and appropriating them from others. Sador's huge dreadnaught (nicknamed \\"Hammerhead\\") mounts a \\"Stellar Converter\\", a weapon that turns planets into small stars. He demands that the peaceful Akira submit to him when he returns in \\"seven risings of your red giant\\", or he'll turn his Stellar Converter on their planet. Zed, last of the famous Akira Corsairs, is old and nearly blind. He suggests they hire mercenaries to protect their world. Since Akir lacks valuable resources, its people can offer just food and shelter in payment. Unable to go in person, Zed offers his ship for the job if they can find a pilot. The ship is fast and well-armed, but, despite its AI navigation/tactical computer Nell, cannot defeat Sador alone. Shad, a young man who has piloted the ship and is well known to Nell, volunteers for the recruiting mission. Seeking weapons, Shad goes to the space station of Doctor Hephaestus (perhaps named after the weaponsmith of the Olympians Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades), an old friend of Zed. The station is populated mostly by androids, except for two humans — Hephaestus, whose numerous life support-systems have turned him into a cyborg; and his beautiful daughter Nanelia, who looks after him and the androids. The doctor wants Shad to mate with his daughter, by force if necessary. Shad can't bring himself to abandon his people; he convinces Nanelia to help him escape. She follows in her own ship; although she has no weapons, her highly advanced computer systems might be useful. The two split up to look for more mercenaries. Answer:","response":"The name of Nanelia's father is Doctor Hephaestus. He is an old friend of Zed and lives on a space station, where he has been turned into a cyborg due to numerous life support systems.

It is a work of social commentary, and condemns rural depopulation and the pursuit of excessive wealth. - Trinity College is the sole constituent college of the University of Dublin, a research university in Ireland. The college was founded in 1592 as the \\"mother\\" of a new university, modelled after the collegiate universities of Oxford and of Cambridge, but, unlike these, only one college was ever established; as such, the designations \\"Trinity College\\" and \\"University of Dublin\\" are usually synonymous for practical purposes. It is one of the seven ancient universities of Britain and Ireland, as well as Ireland's oldest university. - The Vicar of Wakefield subtitled A Tale, Supposed to be written by Himself is a novel by Irish writer Oliver Goldsmith (17281774). It was written from 1761 to 1762 and published in 1766. It was one of the most popular and widely read 18th-century novels among Victorians. - The Good-Natur'd Man is a play written by Oliver Goldsmith in 1768. The play was written in the form of a comedy and staged at the Covent Garden Theatre. It was a middling success for Goldsmith, and the printed version of the play became popular with the reading public. It was released at the same time as Hugh Kelly's \\"False Delicacy\\" was staged at Drury Lane Theatre and the two plays went head to head with Kelly's proving the more popular. Garrick rejected \\"The Good-Natur'd Man\\", possibly because the story is an antidote of \\"False Delicasy\\". - She Stoops to Conquer is a comedy by Anglo-Irish author Oliver Goldsmith that was first performed in London in 1773. The play is a favourite for study by English literature and theatre classes in the English-speaking world. It is one of the few plays from the 18th century to have an enduring appeal, and is still regularly performed today. It has been adapted into a film several times, including in 1914 and 1923. Initially the play was titled \\"Mistakes of a Night\\", and indeed, the events within the play take place in one long night. In 1778 John O'Keeffe wrote a loose sequel, \\"Tony Lumpkin in Town\\". - A university (\\"a whole\\", \\"a corporation\\") is an institution of higher (or tertiary) education and research which grants academic degrees in various subjects. Universities typically provide undergraduate education and postgraduate education. - The University of Dublin, corporately designated the Chancellor, Doctors and Masters of the University of Dublin, is a university located in Dublin, Ireland. It was founded in 1592 when Queen Elizabeth I issued a charter for Trinity College, as \\"the mother of a university\\", thereby making it Ireland's oldest operating university. It was modelled after the collegiate universities of Oxford and of Cambridge, but unlike these only one college was established; as such, the designations \\"Trinity College\\" and \\"University of Dublin\\" are usually synonymous for practical purposes. - Theaker Wilder ( 1717 -- 1778 ) DD , was the first Regius Professor of Greek , Senior Register and Senior Fellow at Trinity College , Dublin . He is remembered for being Oliver Goldsmith 's ' learned savage ' of a tutor . - Oliver Goldsmith (10 November 1728 4 April 1774) was an Irish novelist, playwright and poet, who is best known for his novel \\"The Vicar of Wakefield\\" (1766), his pastoral poem \\"The Deserted Village\\" (1770), and his plays \\"The Good-Natur'd Man\\" (1768) and \\"She Stoops to Conquer\\" (1771, first performed in 1773). He is thought to have written the classic children's tale \\"The History of Little Goody Two-Shoes\\" (1765). What entity does 'theaker wilder' has the relation 'occupation' with? Answer:","response":"The entity that 'Theaker Wilder' has the 'occupation' relation with is 'Trinity College, Dublin'. In this context, 'occupation' refers to the role, job, or profession that Theaker Wilder held. Theaker Wilder served as the first Regius Professor of Greek, Senior Register and Senior Fellow at Trinity College in Dublin. His responsibilities likely included teaching Greek, conducting scholarly research, and carrying out administrative duties within the college. His connection to Trinity College Dublin also extends to his mentoring role with Oliver Goldsmith, one of the notable figures in Irish literary history. Despite being perceived as a 'learned savage' by Goldsmith, Wilder's influence and teachings may likely have had an impact on Goldsmith's works and intellectual development. Therefore, it can be concluded that Theaker Wilder's occupation was closely tied to Trinity College in Dublin, and this role represented an essential facet of his professional life and identity."},{"question":"Article:The party's deputy leader Nigel Dodds said the trust's decision \\"defied belief\\".

They made rules to keep apart those people who wanted to fight. Bali was divided into seven small kingdoms. The land around each kingdom was kept empty, and no one lived there. Since the kingdoms did not share the same borders , the people could not fight about them. On Bali, even children were not allowed to fight. If two children started a fight over a toy, someone separated them. When two boys argued, they would agree not to speak to each other. Sometimes they did not talk together for months; this gave the boys a chance to forget their anger. Families who were angry with each other also promised not to speak.

I was further taken aback to discover that the place apparently doesn't have a liquor license...the only drink alternatives were bottled and cannned sodas from the cooler and a couple of fruity iced teas. Still, if the food had been good... I ordered something that isn't on the on-line menu. It was described as blackened faux chicken in a grilled pita with lettuce, tomato, and tahini. My husband ordered the Argentine Po'Boy with Thyme Fries. We also ordered some samosas to share. We both, reluctantly, grabbed bottled drinks from the cooler. Almost immediately after we'd sat down, my sandwich and the order of samosas came out of the kitchen. We waited for a bit, thinking that surely my husband's sandwich would be along shortly, but after several minutes of waiting, tucked into the samosas. They were OK...not bad; nothing to write home about. To be honest, they tasted as if they'd come out of a freezer box. Any Indian restaurant can do them better, and if you don't absolutely have to be dairy free, that's where I'd recommend you go, if samosas are what you're craving. The samosas consumed, we sat, and sat some more. My husband finally urged me to get started on my sandwich, which was rapidly cooling, and we both tried a bite of the faux chicken. It was, I have to say, really unpleasant. There was no sign of any blackening seasonings having been used...no sign of any seasoning at all, really. It had an oddly fishy taste to it (too much seaweed in the kombu, maybe?), and was much tougher than most chicken analogs. The pita (which was actually flatbread) didn't appear to have been grilled at all...it was dried out to the point of being crunchy, and there were no grill marks on it at all. The only real flavor in the sandwich (other than the odd, fishy, taste of the analog) came from the tahini. I finally gave up on the whole thing as not being worth the effort of chewing. My husband's sandwich finally came out, well after I'd given up on mine. I took a bite of the faux beef, and it was OK. It reminded me of the faux beef strips you can buy at Trader Joes. The fries that came with were nicely crispy (shoestring style), but there was not even a hint of thyme about them. They'd do best to just call them \\"French Fries\\" and have done with it. My take? If you're a vegetarian, you'd do better to eat at Lalibela. If you're a vegan...well, this place will keep you alive, but you'll pay more than it's worth and, if you're familiar with really good vegan cuisine, you won't be happy with it. If this is the best Scottsdale has to offer vegans, you're better off cooking at home....Select from: (A). negative. (B). positive. I think the answer is","response":"(A). negative. The sentiment of this review can be described as negative. There are several key factors that contribute to the overall negative tone and dissatisfaction expressed by the reviewer towards the Green restaurant experience. 1. Expectations were not met: The reviewer mentions that they have high expectations, having dined at some really good vegan establishments before. They were looking forward to trying this restaurant based on the website's portrayal but were disappointed by various aspects of their experience. 2. Ambiance and service: The reviewer was taken aback by the small size of the restaurant and its counter service, expecting a more upscale dining experience. Additionally, the absence of a liquor license contributed to their dissatisfaction. 3. Food quality: The reviewer found the food to be mostly disappointing. They criticized the samosas for tasting like they were from a freezer box, the sandwich for its unpleasant taste and lack of seasoning, and the fries for not having any trace of thyme. The fact that they had to wait for a long time for their order only added to their disappointment. 4. Value for money: The reviewer believes that the food provided is not worth the price and suggests that vegan customers might be better off cooking at home or visiting other establishments. Overall, the reviewer's negative sentiment stems from unmet expectations and dissatisfaction with the various aspects of their dining experience at Green restaurant, ultimately concluding that the restaurant failed to provide good vegan cuisine."},{"question":"Given the sentence \\"A person in an apron is selling many different sized fish on a stand.\\" is it true that \\"A person is selling fish.\\"?

Until its acceptance by the National Trust, Belton House was always in the ownership of the family of its builder, though the failure of three generations to produce a son and heir caused the ownership to pass sideways and sometimes through the female line. The owners of Belton are buried in the village of Belton's parish church close to the house. Their tombs are collectively one of the most complete sets of family memorials in England—continuous generation to generation for almost 350 years. The earliest Brownlow buried here is the founder of the family fortune the lawyer Richard Brownlow (1555–1638), and one of the most recent is the 6th Baron Brownlow (1899–1978).

Fishing season has begun and park ranger J. Audubon Woodlore goes out on the lake to check on the anglers. Humphrey the Bear is trying to catch some fish, but cannot seem to hold onto one once he catches it. Woodlore sees the fish disappearing before his eyes, so he decides to stock the lake some more. As he heads to the fish hatchery, he sees Humphrey with a few fishing nets and rods, and asks him what he is doing. When the bear tells him that he is going to catch some fish, Woodlore takes the rods and nets and tells him to \\"Go fish like a bear!\\" At the hatchery, Woodlore selects an envelope of fish eggs from a collection of eggs from such trout species as dolly vardens and rainbows. He fills a tub with water and inserts the eggs into it. In a matter of seconds, several fishes pop up out of the water like plants out of soil. When the ranger gets to the lake to dump the fish, he finds Humphrey in there, trying to eat one of the small fishes, which is then consumed by a much larger fish. Humphrey manages to remove the small fish from the mouth of the large fish, and then uses it to lure five other large fishes that jump out of the water, but then Woodlore appears to measure the fish, while at the same time punishing Humphrey by hitting him on the head, causing him to sink into the depths of the lake. When Humphrey grabs some more fish and emerges from the lake, he discovers a fish larger than any of the others; this turns out to be a fish balloon with which a young boy is playing. Humphrey pops the balloon, and both the boy and Woodlore kick the bear in the knee. Answer:","response":"The article does not provide explicit information about the largest fish in the lake.

This recent success underlines the determination and effectiveness of law enforcement specialists in fighting against the global drug trafficking industry. Background on the Drug Trafficking Operation The investigation into the suspected plot began months ago when authorities received information about a possible narcotics trafficking operation. Substantial resources were dedicated to monitoring and gathering intelligence on individuals believed to be involved with the smuggling, which ultimately paid off when law enforcement agencies successfully seized shipments of drugs and apprehended 24 suspects. Methods of Smuggling and Shipment Interceptions The suspected drug smugglers utilized an ingenious method of shipping drugs discreetly by hiding the contraband within legitimate shipments of various goods in order to evade detection. Agility and constant adaptation to law enforcement tactics have been consistent characteristics of drug smuggling operations, so it is no surprise that these individuals employed such devious tactics. Through meticulous work by investigators, multiple drug shipments were intercepted. Among them, valuable hauls of cocaine and heroin were recovered, preventing a substantial volume of drugs from reaching the streets of Liverpool. The success of these interceptions can be partly attributed to advances in technology and investigative techniques, such as tracking devices, x-ray scanning equipment, and advanced analytics used to identify high-risk shipments. Arrests and Future Implications With enough evidence gathered, law enforcement officers conducted a series of coordinated raids across multiple locations. Consequently, 24 people were arrested in connection with the smuggling operation. Charges against these individuals range from drug trafficking and criminal conspiracy to money laundering, demonstrating the vast scope of their illicit activities. The successful dismantling of this particular drug smuggling network will undoubtedly have a considerable impact on the drug trade between Spain and Liverpool. However, there is an unwavering need for continued vigilance and resource investment in this area, as numerous other criminal organizations persist in attempting similar operations. By working closely with international partners, both Spanish and British authorities can share intelligence and technological advancements, streamlining the process of identifying and neutralizing global drug trafficking organizations. This cross-agency cooperation, as demonstrated by this case, is key to disrupting and ultimately reducing the activities of these criminal enterprises. Conclusion The arrest of 24 individuals involved in a suspected plot to smuggle drugs from Spain to Liverpool represents a significant achievement for law enforcement agencies on both sides of the border. It underscores not only the relentless efforts of those committed to combating drug trafficking but also highlights the importance of international cooperation in this ongoing battle. Through continued investment in advanced technology and collaborative operations between agencies, successes such as this will undoubtedly become more frequent. While it is reasonable to expect persisting challenges, cases like this serve as a beacon of hope in the ongoing war against drug trafficking and a testament to the determined professionals who continue to keep the streets safe."},{"question":"The Simpsons/Family Guy crossover episode gets new five-minute trailer When news of the Family Guy/Simpsons crossover was first announced, the Guardian's Stuart Heritage – a die-hard Simpsons fan – was not happy. \\"It's impossible to work out why The Simpsons would debase itself by allowing this to happen,\\" he wrote, asserting that Family Guy \\"is, at heart, a crap Simpsons\\".

If the same mass of wood were added to the fire in the form of small twigs, they would burn much more quickly. This is because the twigs provide a greater surface area than the log does. An increase in the surface area of a reactant increases the rate of a reaction. Surface area is larger when a given amount of a solid is present as smaller particles. A powdered reactant has a greater surface area than the same reactant as a solid chunk. In order to increase the surface area of a substance, it may be ground into smaller particles or dissolved into a liquid. In solution, the dissolved particles are separated from each other and will react more quickly with other reactants. Now, I have a new situation: Danny went camping and made a fire in the woods. he used large logs he fell a few months back. Bob was camping 300 yards away and he made a fire using small sticks, kindlings and sawdust he had left over. Bob's fire burned fast and bright. Answer this question please: Which person made a fire that burned less bright? The answer to this question is:","response":"Danny made a fire that burned less bright. His large logs, although they burned for a longer period of time, did not burn as quickly or as brightly as Bob's kindling and sawdust, which had more surface area exposed to the heat and therefore burned faster and brighter."},{"question":"W: Pubs in England are friendly and warm places where you can have a drink and usually a simple meal.

As he explains: They held a tryout for 5-year-old boys and my father took me there. I didn't even have real skates. I had those blades that you screwed onto the soles of your shoes, but I was tall, and the 9-year-olds didn't have a goalie, so they put me in with them and thats where I fell in love with the game of hockey. Hasek's most memorable international performance came in the 1998 Winter Olympics, where he led the Czech national team to the gold medal. He allowed six goals in total, with only two of them coming in the medal round. Against Team Canada in the semifinals, Hasek stopped Theoren Fleury, Ray Bourque, Joe Nieuwendyk, Eric Lindros and Brendan Shanahan in a dramatic shootout win. He then shut out the Russian team 1-0 in the final game, stopping 20 shots. He was later announced as the best goaltender in the Olympics. After he won the gold, he was quoted as saying: \\"When the game ended, I just threw my stick. I was so happy. When I saw the flag go up, I saw my whole career flash before my eyes from the first time my parents took me to a game until now.\\" His play made him one of the most popular figures in the Czech Republic, so much so that residents chanted \\"Hasek to the castle!\\" in the streets, referring to the Prague Castle, the seat of the President of the Czech Republic. In response to this, Hasek called the president Vaclav Havel and jokingly told him that his job was not in jeopardy. He also helped to inspire an opera (titled Nagano) about the Czech team's gold medal victory, and in 2003, Petr Pravec and Lenka Sarounova named an asteroid (8217 Dominikhasek) in his honour. In the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy, Hasek played for just nine minutes and twenty-five seconds, until he injured his right adductor muscle. Despite his absence, the Czechs managed to earn the bronze medal with backup goaltender Tomas Vokoun, which Hasek received as well.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Was the 1998 Olympic games the only games he played in?","response":"No, the 1998 Olympic games were not the only games he played in. The text states, \\"In the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy, Hasek played for just nine minutes and twenty-five seconds, until he injured his right adductor muscle.\\" This shows that Hasek also played in the 2006 Winter Olympics, although his playtime was limited due to an injury."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

English actor Robert Donat was a heartthrob of the period: he portrays barrister (English version of our litigator or trial lawyer) Sir Robert Morton, an expensive, what-we'd-call corporate attorney; after several false starts, including a debate in the House of Commons (over what in English law was basically a lawsuit against the Crown), Sir Robert accepts the case.The centerpiece here is Sir Robert's interrogation of young Ronnie, the defendant, in the boy's home, in front of his rapidly deteriorating father & antagonistic, suffragette sister. Sir Robert's battery of questions quickly turns into an 18-K cross-examination, the kind he knows the boy can expect in court, over vehement objections from his family. Meanwhile, the case & the Winslow family become objects of public ridicule & derision.Also interesting are the ways family members change: in the beginning, Pop Winslow (played with Cedric Hardwicke's usual aplomb) seems the most value-rigid & proper fish in a sea of rebels (Lindy Hops, cigarets); gradually, it's pop that must convince even feminist daugher Katy to stay the course.

Consequently, I will present an analysis of what constitutes a brief sentence and demonstrate an example to ensure a comprehensive explanation of the concept. A brief sentence is a concise and easily digestible collection of words that conveys a clear and simple idea or thought. It is often achieved by employing essential information supported with proper grammar and sentence structure. The purpose of a brief sentence is to communicate a message or meaning effectively and quickly, which can be particularly useful when relaying time-sensitive information or in situations where a more extensive explanation may not be warranted or desired. In striving for brevity, it is crucial to maintain clarity, as any ambiguity can render the brief sentence ineffective. To accomplish this, one must carefully select words that are accurate, specific, and relevant to the message, avoiding redundant expressions, jargon, or complex terminology. Moreover, active voice and strong verbs can contribute to the conciseness and life of the sentence. Let us consider this example of a brief sentence: \\"She won the marathon.\\" The sentence effectively communicates the essential idea without including any extra or unnecessary information. We understand that an individual identified as \\"she\\" was victorious in a marathon race. By employing a simple subject, verb, and object, the sentence remains concise and easily understandable. In summary, a brief sentence is a short, unambiguous statement that efficiently conveys a specific idea or event. It is imperative to employ brevity while maintaining clarity and meaning, which can be achieved by using precise words, active voice, and suitable sentence construction."},{"question":"http://twitpic.com/2yf0y - Me and my boyfriend, Tom, on my birthday night out Describe the sentiment embodied by this tweet. 1). negative. 2). positive.

It came as something of a surprise when Diana, Princess of Wales, made a trip to Angola in 1997, to support the Red Cross's campaign for a total ban on all anti-personnel landmines.

But, back in London, her views were not shared by some members of the British government, which refused to support a ban on these weapons. Angry politicians launched an attack on the Princess in the press. They described her as very \\"ill-informed\\"and \\" a loose cannon .\\" The Princess responded by brushing aside the criticisms,\\" This is a distraction we do not need. All I'm trying to do is help.\\" Opposition parties, the media and the public immediately voiced their support for the Princess. To make matters worse for the government, it soon emerged that the Princess's trip had been approved by the Foreign Office, and that she was in fact very well-informed about both the situation in Angola and the British government's policy regarding landmines. The result was a severe embarrassment for the government. To try and limit the damage, the Foreign Secretary, Malcolm Rifkidnd, claimed that the Princess's views on landmines were not very different from government policy, and that it was working towards a worldwide ban. The Defence Secretary, Michael Portillo, claimed the matter was a misinterpretation or misunderstanding. For the Princess, the trip to this war-torn country was an excellent opportunity to use her popularity to show the world how much destruction and suffering landmines can cause.

This specialism of 19th-century academic art was among the special interests of this academic who taught at which University? Answer:","response":"To answer this complex question, we need to break it down into several parts: identifying the specialism of 19th-century academic art, pinpointing the academic particularly interested in this specialism, and determining the university at which they taught. 1. Identifying the specialism of 19th-century academic art: During the 19th century, academic art was characterized by its adherence to traditional artistic principles and techniques, with an emphasis on drawing, strict color palettes, and a flair for the dramatic. A notable specialism within this period was Neoclassicism, which focused on the revival of classical art from ancient Greece and Rome, and its ideals of beauty and harmony. Other specialisms, such as Romanticism, Historicism, and Orientalism, also held interest among 19th-century academic artists. 2. Pinpointing the academic particularly interested in this specialism: Several renowned academics were influential in shaping 19th-century academic art, including French painter and professor Jean-Léon Gérôme, who was particularly interested in Neoclassicism, Historicism, and Orientalism. Gérôme's works exemplified these specialisms, and he became a significant figure in the 19th-century art world, teaching and inspiring numerous artists throughout his career. 3. Determining the university at which they taught: Jean-Léon Gérôme taught at the prestigious École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, France. As a professor of painting, he educated students at this esteemed institution in the principles of academic art influenced heavily by Neoclassicism, Historicism, and Orientalism. Under his tutelage, many young artists developed their skills and went on to become successful painters following in the footsteps of their mentor. In conclusion, the specialism of 19th-century academic art under discussion is likely to be Neoclassicism, Historicism or Orientalism, with the notable academic being Jean-Léon Gérôme, who taught at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris. The university in question here is the École des Beaux-Arts, an institution famous for its influence in shaping European art during the 19th century."},{"question":"Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Do you have the experience of taking music lessons against your wishes?

Literally, \\"professor\\" derives from Latin as a \\"person who professes\\" being usually an expert in arts or sciences, a teacher of the highest rank. - The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) is a private research university in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Founded in 1861 in response to the increasing industrialization of the United States, MIT adopted a European polytechnic university model and stressed laboratory instruction in applied science and engineering. Researchers worked on computers, radar, and inertial guidance during World War II and the Cold War. Post-war defense research contributed to the rapid expansion of the faculty and campus under James Killian. The current campus opened in 1916 and extends over along the northern bank of the Charles River basin. - MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) is a research institute at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology formed by the 2003 merger of the Laboratory for Computer Science and the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. Housed within the Stata Center, CSAIL is the largest on-campus laboratory as measured by research scope and membership. - Electrical engineering is a field of engineering that generally deals with the study and application of electricity, electronics, and electromagnetism. This field first became an identifiable occupation in the later half of the 19th century after commercialization of the electric telegraph, the telephone, and electric power distribution and use. Subsequently, broadcasting and recording media made electronics part of daily life. The invention of the transistor, and later the integrated circuit, brought down the cost of electronics to the point they can be used in almost any household object. - Silvio Micali ( born October 13 , 1954 ) is an Italian - born computer scientist at MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and a professor of computer science in MIT 's Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science since 1983 . His research centers on the theory of cryptography and information security . - Data integrity is the maintenance of, and the assurance of the accuracy and consistency of, data over its entire life-cycle, and is a critical aspect to the design, implementation and usage of any system which stores, processes, or retrieves data. The term \\"data integrity\\" is broad in scope and may have widely different meanings depending on the specific context even under the same general umbrella of computing. This article provides only a broad overview of some of the different types and concerns of data integrity. - Cryptography or cryptology (from Greek \\"kryptós\\", \\"hidden, secret\\"; and \\"graphein\\", \\"writing\\", or \\"-logia\\", \\"study\\", respectively) is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties called adversaries. More generally, cryptography is about constructing and analyzing protocols that prevent third parties or the public from reading private messages; various aspects in information security such as data confidentiality, data integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation are central to modern cryptography. Modern cryptography exists at the intersection of the disciplines of mathematics, computer science, and electrical engineering. Applications of cryptography include ATM cards, computer passwords, and electronic commerce. - Massachusetts ; officially the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, is the most populous state in the New England region of the northeastern United States. It is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the east, the states of Connecticut and Rhode Island to the south, New Hampshire and Vermont to the north, and New York to the west. The state is named for the Massachusett tribe, which once inhabited the area. The capital of Massachusetts and the most populous city in New England is Boston. Over 80% of Massachusetts' population lives in the Greater Boston metropolitan area, a region influential upon American history, academia, and industry. Originally dependent on agriculture, fishing and trade, Massachusetts was transformed into a manufacturing center during the Industrial Revolution.

However, from Europe's perspective, they were dividing an unknown continent. European countries established a few coastal colonies in Africa by the mid-nineteenth century, which included Cape Colony (Great Britain), Angola (Portugal), and Algeria (France), but until the late nineteenth century Europe largely traded with free African states without feeling the need for territorial possession. Until the 1880s most of Africa remained unchartered, with western maps from the period generally showing blank spaces for the continent’s interior.

If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\". According to Y chromosome studies by Sanchez et al. (2005), Cruciani et al. (2004, 2007), the Somalis are paternally closely related to other Afro-Asiatic-speaking groups in Northeast Africa. Besides comprising the majority of the Y-DNA in Somalis, the E1b1b1a (formerly E3b1a) haplogroup also makes up a significant proportion of the paternal DNA of Ethiopians, Sudanese, Egyptians, Berbers, North African Arabs, as well as many Mediterranean populations. Sanchez et al. (2005) observed the M78 subclade of E1b1b in about 77% of their Somali male samples. According to Cruciani et al. (2007), the presence of this subhaplogroup in the Horn region may represent the traces of an ancient migration from Egypt/Libya. After haplogroup E1b1b, the second most frequently occurring Y-DNA haplogroup among Somalis is the West Asian haplogroup T (M70). It is observed in slightly more than 10% of Somali males.

A:","response":"Yes, the statement \\"Role-playing games also include single-player offline role-playing video games in which players control a character or team who undertake quests, and may include capabilities that advance using statistical mechanics.\\" would be a reasonable answer to the question, \\"What is a roll play game?\\" However, it's important to note that the term should be corrected to \\"role-play game\\" instead of \\"roll play game.\\" With that adjustment, here's a more detailed and long answer: Role-playing games, or RPGs, are a diverse and rich genre of games that involve players taking on the roles of fictional characters and partaking in a variety of adventures, quests, and stories. This genre includes both tabletop games, like Dungeons & Dragons, and video games, such as The Elder Scrolls, Final Fantasy, and The Witcher series. In a role-playing game, players typically control a character or a team of characters with distinct abilities, personalities, and backgrounds. The primary focus of these games is character development and storytelling, with the players making choices that impact the direction of the narrative along the way. This makes RPGs different from other genres, such as action or strategy games, where the primary emphasis is on gameplay, mechanics, or tactics. As mentioned in the given statement, single-player offline role-playing video games are part of this genre too. These games offer an immersive, interactive experience by allowing the player to explore a vast, detailed world, facing various challenges, solving puzzles, and interacting with countless non-playable characters (NPCs) to complete quests or tasks. Character progression is a significant aspect of role-playing games. As the player's character(s) complete quests and gain experience, they become stronger and more skilled by leveling up and acquiring new abilities or improving existing ones. This is often achieved using statistical mechanics that govern the character's attributes, like strength, agility, and intelligence, as well as their combat skills and other abilities. Role-playing games can differ in their settings and stories, ranging from high fantasy worlds filled with magic and mythical creatures, to post-apocalyptic settings where survival is the primary goal, to futuristic galactic adventures that span planets and star systems. Regardless of the setting, the key elements of character development, storytelling, and player choices remain central to the role-playing genre. In conclusion, a role-playing game is an interactive and engaging experience that combines character development, storytelling, and decision-making to create a deeply immersive world for players to explore and enjoy. This genre spans across both traditional tabletop games and digital video games, providing a vast array of options for players to experience a multitude of stories, settings, and adventures."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot. Could you help me answer this question? If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\". Plot title: Newsies Movie plot: The film takes place in New York City in the year 1899, focusing on a group of newsboys. Of this group, the focus is on Jack Kelley (Christian Bale),who one day dreams of heading out west to the wide-open spaces of Santa Fe.One day, Jack meets Les Jacobs (Luke Edwards) and David Jacobs (David Moscow), two brothers who've turned to selling newspapers to support their family, after their father was fired when a machine accident left him unable to work. Jack soon teaches Les and Jacobs some interesting lessons about how to sell papers (such as sensationalizing headlines).Shortly afterwards, the boys are challenged when the 'World' newspaper's owner, Joseph Pulitzer (Robert Duvall), raises their purchase rate by 1/10 of a cent. Though seemingly a drop in the bucket for Pulitzer (who hopes to use the added funds to keep competing with his closest competitor, William Randolph Hearst), the increase is a significant price gouge for the Newsies. With David supplying input and ideas, Jack becomes the leader of the group. The boys then go to other parts of New York to rally other newsboy groups, with Jack and David going to Brooklyn to recruit Spot Conlon (Gabriel Damon) and his group. Even with David's enthusiasm, Spot is still doubtul about joining them.At the same time, the boys catch the eye of Bryan Denton (Bill Pullman), a reporter for the 'New York Sun.' Denton soon becomes the boy's champion, making the 'Sun' the only newspaper in New York covering the newsboy strike.In one incident that gets Pulitzer's attention, the boys cause havoc at a newspaper distribution center, that calls the police to the scene. One of the newsboys, Crutchy (Marty Belafsky), is captured and taken to a place called 'The Refuge,' which is operated by Warden Snyder (Kevin Tighe). While told to be a place to rehabilitate young boys, it is actually a place where its keepers take advantage of the system, pocketing extra money for every boy they bring in, as well as not allowing the boys to partake in more nourishing food. David is informed... My question: The riot story was suppressed by whom? Answer:","response":"The riot story was suppressed by Joseph Pulitzer and other newspaper owners, as they did not want the news of the newsboy strike to be known to the public. However, Bryan Denton from the 'New York Sun' supports the boys and makes their newspaper the only one in New York to cover the newsboy strike."},{"question":"Read this and answer the question.

A number of countries forbid members of the legislature from accepting an office of profit under the executive as a means to secure the independence of the legislature and preserve the separation of powers. Is this statement correct \\"is office of profit mentioned in the constitution\\"?","response":"Yes, the statement is correct to some extent. The concept of the \\"office of profit\\" is indeed mentioned in various national constitutions across the globe, including those of India, the United States, and the United Kingdom. It is important to note that the specific language and provisions surrounding the office of profit can vary between different jurisdictions and constitutional frameworks. In India, for example, the term \\"office of profit\\" is not explicitly mentioned in the Indian Constitution. However, the concept is still recognized and addressed in the Constitution under Articles 102(1)(a) and 191(1)(a). These provisions disqualify a member of Parliament or a State Legislature from holding an office of profit under the Government of India or the government of any state. In the United States, the concept of an \\"office of profit\\" is addressed within the Constitution under the Incompatibility Clause, which states in Article I, Section 6, Clause 2: \\"No Senator or Representative shall, during the Time for which he was elected, be appointed to any civil office under the Authority of the United States, which shall have been created, or the emoluments whereof shall have been increased during such time; and no person holding any office under the United States, shall be a member of either House during his continuance in office.\\" This clause aims to prevent conflicts of interest and maintain the separation of powers between the executive and legislative branches of the United States government. It also bars members of the U.S. Congress from simultaneously holding an office under the executive branch. In the United Kingdom, the concept of an \\"office of profit\\" is addressed within the constitutional laws and parliamentary conventions. The British constitution specifically disqualifies members of Parliament from holding a range of executive offices, such as Her Majesty's ministers or civil servants. One key example can be found in the House of Commons Disqualification Act 1975, which lists a series of offices considered to be \\"offices of profit\\" and that holders of such offices are thereby disqualified from serving as members of Parliament. While the term \\"office of profit\\" may not necessarily be mentioned explicitly in every national constitution, the concept is still present and relevant in the constitutions of several countries. The fundamental goal behind addressing the \\"office of profit\\" issue is to prevent conflicts of interest, protect the independence of the legislature, and preserve the separation of powers between different branches of government."},{"question":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

I was called to speak with her. ”Why do you have such a stupid Draconian policy?” She insisted. “The Emergency Room is no place for a child ma’am.

Water flowing over a steeper slope moves faster and causes more erosion. How water transports particles depends on their size. When water slows down, it starts depositing sediment. This process starts with the largest particles first. Runoff erodes the land after a heavy rain. It picks up sediment. Runoff carries most of the sediment to bodies of water. Mountain streams erode narrow, V-shaped valleys and waterfalls. Erosion and deposition by slow-flowing rivers create broad floodplains and meanders. Deposition by streams and rivers may form alluvial fans and deltas. Floodwaters may deposit natural levees. Erosion and deposition by groundwater can form caves and sinkholes. Stalactites and stalagmites are mineral deposits. They build up in caves as water continues to drip. Choose your answer: According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"What is picked up by the water?\\" is \\"Underground\\"? OPT: 1). no. 2). yes.","response":"1). no. The correct answer is \\"no.\\" According to the above paragraph, it is not the underground itself that is picked up by the water, but rather sediment. Specifically, the text states, \\"Runoff erodes the land after a heavy rain. It picks up sediment.\\" This means that water picks up sediment from the Earth's surface, not the underground itself."},{"question":"Premise: \\"A man in a red jacket is standing in front of a tall white building.\\" Hypothesis: \\"A man is hailing a cab.\\" Do we know that the hypothesis entailed by the premise?

The premise describes a scene with a man in a red jacket, standing in front of a tall white building. The hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests that a man is hailing a cab. Step 4: Determine if the premise entails the hypothesis. In this situation, the premise does not provide any information about the man trying to hail a cab. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. Conclusion: Based on the premise provided, we do not know if the hypothesis \\"A man is hailing a cab\\" is true.

They both made great progress. Which person learned less about air expansion as it rises? Hint: Alpine climate is the average weather (climate) for the alpine tundra. The climate becomes colder at high elevations—this characteristic is described by the lapse rate of air: air tends to get colder as it rises, since it expands. The dry adiabatic lapse rate is 10 °C per km (5.5 °F per 1000 ft) of elevation or altitude. Therefore, moving up 100 metres (330 ft) on a mountain is roughly equivalent to moving 80 kilometers (45 miles or 0.75° of latitude) towards the pole. This relationship is only approximate, however, since local factors such as proximity to oceans can drastically modify the climate.","response":"Based on the information provided, Jerry, who studies alpine climate, would likely have learned less about air expansion as it rises compared to James, who studies tropical climates. The reasoning behind this is that in alpine climates, the primary focus is on the impact of elevation and altitude on temperature and weather patterns. While understanding the lapse rate of air is crucial to studying alpine climates, air expansion is only one aspect of this phenomenon. Jerry would certainly have some understanding of air expansion, but it may not be the central focus of his studies. On the other hand, James, who studies tropical climates, would be more concerned with larger-scale atmospheric patterns and circulations. These play a significant role in determining the climate of tropical regions. This would likely involve a deeper understanding of air expansion as it rises because vertical air motions and the development of large-scale weather systems are particularly important in tropical regions. Tropical meteorologists often focus on phenomena such as convection, thunderstorms, and tropical cyclones, which involve strong vertical air movement and significant air expansion. In conclusion, Jerry, the meteorologist studying alpine climate, likely learned less about air expansion as it rises than James, who studies tropical climates."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: High school outcast Eddie Weinbauer (Marc Price) is writing a letter to his hero, heavy metal musician Sammi Curr (Tony Fields).

Watching the news at the same time, following a report on Sammi's being banned from returning to Lakeridge High to perform at the Halloween dance, Eddie is shocked to hear the worst words to ever reach his ears: Sammi Curr has died in a mysterious hotel fire.

But one of the regents was Ieyasu Tokugawa, who had been biding his time at Edo for 12 years, nurturing dynastic ambitions of his own. Of the cunning, ruthless triumvirate that came out on top at the end of the country's century of civil war, Tokugawa was without doubt the most patient, the most prudent — and most treacherous. He moved quickly to eliminate his strongest rivals, crushing them in 1600 at the great Battle of Sekigahara (near modern Nagoya). During its subsequent two and a half centuries of rule from the new capital established at Edo, the Tokugawa organized a tightly controlled coalition of some 260 daimyo in strategic strongholds throughout the country. The allegiance of this highly privileged and prestigious group was ensured by cementing their ethical principles in the code of bushido, \\"The way of the warrior\\": loyalty to one's master, defense of one's status and honor, and fulfillment of all obligations. Loyalty was further enforced by holding the vassals' wives and children hostage in Edo. All roads into Edo, the most famous being the Tokaido Highway, had checkpoints for guns coming in and for wives going out. One of the most effective ways of keeping a tight rein on the country was to cut it off from the outside world, to keep Japan Japanese. At first, Ieyasu Tokugawa was eager to promote foreign trade. He wanted silk and encouraged the Dutch and British as good, nonproselytizing Protestants just interested in trade. But he didn't like the Portuguese and Spanish Catholic missionaries, who he felt were undermining traditional Japanese values. He banned their activities in 1612 and two years later ordered the expulsion of all missionaries and unrepentant Japanese converts. Executions and torture followed. Converts were forced to renounce their faith by trampling crucifixes and effigies of Jesus and Mary. The Catholic Church has counted 3,125 martyrs in Japan from 1597 (beginning under Hideyoshi) to 1660. In 1635 the Japanese were forbidden, on pain of death, to attempt to travel abroad, and Japanese citizens already overseas were prevented from returning, in case they brought back subversive Christian doctrines. Western books were banned, as were Chinese books that mentioned Christianity.

Britten reversed the pattern for his Spring Symphony—the four sections of the symphony represent, in its composer's words, \\"the progress of Winter to Spring and the reawakening of the earth and life which that means.... It is in the traditional four movement shape of a symphony, but with the movements divided into shorter sections bound together by a similar mood or point of view.\\"The gestation of Shostakovich's Thirteenth Symphony, Babi Yar, was only slightly less straightforward. He set the poem Babi Yar by Yevgeny Yevtushenko almost immediately upon reading it, initially considering it a single-movement composition. Discovering three other Yevtushenko poems in the poet's collection Vzmakh ruki (A Wave of the Hand) prompted him to proceed to a full-length choral symphony, with \\"A Career\\" as the closing movement. Musicologist Francis Maes comments that Shostakovich did so by complementing Babi Yar's theme of Jewish suffering with Yevtushenko's verses about other Soviet abuses: \\"'At the Store' is a tribute to the women who have to stand in line for hours to buy the most basic foods,... 'Fears' evokes the terror under Stalin. 'A Career' is an attack on bureaucrats and a tribute to genuine creativity\\". Music historian Boris Schwarz adds that the poems, in the order Shostakovich places them, form a strongly dramatic opening movement, a scherzo, two slow movements and a finale.In other cases, the choice of text has led the composer to different symphonic structures. Havergal Brian allowed the form of his Fourth Symphony, subtitled \\"Das Siegeslied\\" (Psalm of Victory), to be dictated by the three-part structure of his text, Psalm 68; the setting of Verses 13–18 for soprano solo and orchestra forms a quiet interlude between two wilder, highly chromatic martial ones set for massive choral and orchestral forces.

N also frequently posts about her “animation internship with Disney” and how awesome it is, We have a lot of mutual contacts, including old mentors, teachers, friends... and they all post supportive comments quite frequently. A couple years ago, I did a little digging and reverse image searched her stuff and found that almost all of it was not original. She just blatantly ripped it off the web. When I discovered this, I made a burner account and messaged her my proof and told her to stop lying to everyone. I stopped short of threatening her but I told her the truth may come out eventually if she keeps this up. N proceeded to block the account and post that someone has been stealing HER work and she is looking into legal options. After this, I just dropped it and left it alone.

In Greek mythology, what is the name of the mortal woman who challenged the goddess Athena to a weaving contest and was turned into a spider by Athena?","response":"In Greek mythology, the mortal woman who challenged the goddess Athena to a weaving contest and was subsequently turned into a spider is named Arachne. Arachne was an exceptionally skilled and talented weaver, so much so that her abilities became widely known and celebrated throughout the ancient world. As her fame spread, tales of her extraordinary skills attracted the attention of the goddess Athena, who is not only the goddess of wisdom, but also held domain over crafts such as weaving. According to the myth, Arachne's pride and ego grew as her reputation spread, and she eventually proclaimed herself to be a better weaver than Athena. This proclamation understandably infuriated the goddess, who decided to disguise herself as an old woman and appeared before Arachne to caution her against this act of hubris. However, the headstrong Arachne dismissed the advice and persisted in her claims of superiority. Seeing no other recourse, Athena revealed her true divine form and decided to challenge the mortal woman to a weaving contest. The competition was held, and both Athena and Arachne showcased their immeasurable talent. Athena wove a grand tapestry depicting the gods in all their divine glory, illustrating her own esteemed role among them. Arachne, on the other hand, wove a tapestry that mocked the gods and their follies, displaying their imperfections and the many times they had wronged mortals. Despite her anger toward Arachne, Athena could not deny the sheer skill and perfection in the young woman's work. This only served to further infuriate the goddess. Driven by her anger, Athena destroyed Arachne's tapestry and struck her on the forehead, which led to Arachne's despair and subsequent attempt to hang herself. As a final act of both punishment and pity, Athena decided to turn the mortal woman into a spider, cursing her and her descendants to weave ceaselessly for all eternity. The story of Arachne became a cautionary tale in Greek mythology, warning others about the dangers of hubris and the consequences of challenging the gods. Moreover, this myth serves as the origin of the word \\"arachnid,\\" which is used to describe spiders and other eight-legged creatures in modern taxonomy."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you're given a context, a sentence, and a character.

Sentence: If you suffer from a genetic illness it is not possible to carry a gene for that illness in your hands and give it to scientists.","response":"The sentence \\"If you suffer from a genetic illness it is not possible to carry a gene for that illness in your hands and give it to scientists\\" appears to be a misunderstanding of genetic screening and testing methods. The original text explains that scientists can analyze cells to determine if an individual has or carries a genetic illness. This process ensures that only healthy embryos are transferred during assisted reproductive procedures. Genetic illnesses are caused by abnormalities in an individual's DNA, which is found in nearly every cell in the body. When discussing \\"carrying a gene,\\" it refers to the presence of this gene within a person's DNA, not physically carrying the gene in one's hands. Scientists can analyze a person's DNA by using a sample from their saliva, blood, or tissue. In the context of embryo screening, researchers typically analyze cells from the embryo—either through pre-implantation genetic testing (PGT) or other similar methods. These procedures allow healthcare professionals to identify embryos that carry genetic abnormalities linked to specific diseases, ensuring that only healthy embryos are utilized during fertility treatments. In summary, the sentence is highlighting a misconception that one can physically carry a gene in their hands and give it to scientists. The truth is that genes are present within an individual's DNA, and scientists use specific techniques to analyze and screen for genetic abnormalities in embryos during fertility treatments."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given a text from a social media post.

If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\". What drove circadian rhythms to evolve has been an enigmatic question. Previous hypotheses emphasized that photosensitive proteins and circadian rhythms may have originated together in the earliest cells, with the purpose of protecting replicating DNA from high levels of damaging ultraviolet radiation during the daytime. As a result, replication was relegated to the dark. However, evidence for this is lacking, since the simplest organisms with a circadian rhythm, the cyanobacteria, do the opposite of this - they divide more in the daytime. Recent studies instead highlight the importance of co-evolution of redox proteins with circadian oscillators in all three kingdoms of life following the Great Oxidation Event approximately 2.3 billion years ago. The current view is that circadian changes in environmental oxygen levels and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the presence of daylight are likely to have driven a need to evolve circadian rhythms to preempt, and therefore counteract, damaging redox reactions on a daily basis. What type of proteins developed as a result of circadian rhythms?","response":"Circadian rhythms helped in the development of redox proteins. These proteins work together with circadian oscillators in living things. They help protect cells from harmful reactions that can happen when oxygen levels change during the day and night."},{"question":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output. Given a passage classify if the passage has a definite objective/aim/goal or not. Output '1' if the passage has a defininte objective/aim/goal and output '0' if the passage does not have a definite objective/aim/goal. The striated muscle costamere, a multiprotein complex at the boundary between the sarcomere and the sarcolemma, plays an integral role in maintaining striated muscle structure and function. Multiple costamere-associated proteins, such as integrins and integrin-interacting proteins, have been identified and shown to play an increasingly important role in the pathogenesis of human cardiomyopathy. Kindlin-2 is an adaptor protein that binds to the integrin β cytoplasmic tail to promote integrin activation. Genetic deficiency of Kindlin-2 results in embryonic lethality, and knockdown of the Kindlin-2 homolog in Caenorhabditis elegans and Danio rerio suggests that it has an essential role in integrin function and normal muscle structure and function. The precise role of Kindlin-2 in the mammalian cardiac myocyte remains to be determined.', 'The current studies were designed to investigate the role of Kindlin-2 in the mammalian heart. We generated a series of cardiac myocyte-specific Kindlin-2 knockout mice with excision of the Kindlin-2 gene in either developing or adult cardiac myocytes. We found that mice lacking Kindlin-2 in the early developing heart are embryonic lethal. We demonstrate that deletion of Kindlin-2 at late gestation or in adult cardiac myocytes resulted in heart failure and premature death, which were associated with enlargement of the heart and extensive fibrosis. In addition, integrin β1D protein expression was significantly downregulated in the adult heart.","response":"To perform the given task, I will first carefully read and understand the given passage.

Article: We are much happier in our new house because it has a large garden, and you know how enthusiastic we both are about gardening. When we moved in a month ago, Mary wanted to get a dog to keep out burglars. However, we finally decided that it would be cheaper to put an iron grille in front of the door and get a burglar alarm. Last week, I went to a shop and bought an alarm for just over PS200. It consists of a control unit with three smaller units. I put the control unit in the lounge and put the other units in place by the front door, back door and lounge windows. That night I soon fell asleep because I was confident that no one could get into our house undetected. At about 1:50 a.m. I woke up suddenly and heard the siren. It was like an ambulance driving right through our bedroom. I couldn't leave the siren on all night. I went downstairs in the dark. When I reached the bottom of the stairs, I switched on the light and looked around. Oh my gosh. The back door was unlocked. I rushed to lock it and it was just at that exact moment that the 'burglar' disappeared behind a curtain. Guess what? It was an ordinary house lizard .Apparently the alarm system had been made for American or European homes in which lizards are never seen. I switched the alarm off and sat down to watch. A few moments later, a lizard ran across a wall, right in front of one of the alarm units. I won't bother to finish this story but if you'd like a burglar alarm system free of charge, just let us know.

But this Saturday, for the first time, 10 of the brave mariners--including a journalist, whose progress will be available online--will compete in the world's toughest small boat race, called the Ultimate Florida Challenge. Instead of finishing at Key Largo, the 10 boaters will continue around the state, heading north past Miami, the Kennedy Space Center, and Jacksonville, then down the Suwannee River, eventually passing most of Florida before arriving back at the beach near St. Petersburg. It will be 1,200 miles of head winds and burning sun. But it will also take the challengers through some of the most impressive scenery in North America.

Choices: - cystine and cell wall - endoderm and epidermis - cell membrane and nucleus - cytoplasm and cell wall A:","response":"cell differentiation involves changes in the cell membrane and nucleus. Cell differentiation is the process by which a less specialized cell undergoes changes to become a more specialized cell type. This process is essential for the growth, development, and maintenance of multicellular organisms, as it allows for different cell types to carry out diverse functions throughout the organism. Two key parts of the cell where changes occur during cell differentiation are the cell membrane and the nucleus. 1. Cell membrane: The cell membrane is a thin, flexible barrier made up of lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates that surround a cell and act as its first line of defense against external cues. During cell differentiation, the composition and structure of the cell membrane undergo changes, leading to altered cell signaling pathways, cell adhesion properties, and transport mechanisms. These modifications allow the differentiated cell to interact selectively with its environment and adopt specific functions. For example, as a red blood cell differentiates from a precursor cell, its cell membrane develops a unique biconcave shape and flexibility that enables it to easily travel through the body and deliver oxygen more efficiently. Additionally, the membrane of a neuron undergoes changes that enable it to conduct nerve impulses and communicate with neighboring cells through synapses. 2. Nucleus: The nucleus houses a cell's genetic material (DNA) and plays a central role in controlling and regulating its activities. Cell differentiation involves alterations in the gene expression profile of cells to facilitate the expression of specific genes that determine a cell's specialized functions and morphology. This process relies on a network of transcription factors, epigenetic modifications, and non-coding RNAs to ensure that the genetic instructions for differentiation are executed correctly and in a timely manner. For instance, during the differentiation of a muscle cell, specific transcription factors and regulatory elements become active, turning on genes that code for essential muscle proteins, such as myosin and actin. Simultaneously, genes that are not necessary for muscle function become silenced through epigenetic modifications like DNA methylation and histone modifications. These coordinated changes in gene expression ultimately guide the cell towards its specialized form and function. In summary, cell differentiation is an intricate process that involves significant changes to the cell membrane and nucleus. The cell membrane undergoes modifications in its composition and structure, leading to functional adaptations that allow the cell to interact selectively with their environment and execute specialized tasks. Meanwhile, the nucleus drives the alterations to the gene expression profile essential for the cell's specific role and morphology. Together, these changes culminate in the generation of diverse cell types with unique functions, critical for the overall function and survival of multicellular organisms."},{"question":"Question: Process: - Air is taken into the body via the nose or mouth - The air travels into the windpipe - The windpipe divides the air to the two lungs via the bronchial tubes - The lungs oxygenate the blood in the body - Carbon dioxide is filtered out by every cell in the body - The carbon dioxide is carried back to the lungs via the bloodstream - The carbon dioxide is exhaled.

Answer:","response":"In 1 Corinthians 12, the Apostle Paul addresses the church in Corinth regarding the spiritual gifts that are given to believers through the Holy Spirit. He emphasizes the importance of unity and diversity within the body of Christ and encourages all believers to acknowledge that each individual, regardless of the particular gift they possess, is an essential part of the spiritual body. There are multiple spiritual gifts listed in 1 Corinthians 12, which include: 1. Word of Wisdom (verse 8a): The word of wisdom is a gift that enables a believer to have a deep understanding of God's truth and insight into how to apply that truth in practical situations. This is not simply a matter of human knowledge or wisdom but relies on the guidance of the Holy Spirit for divine insight. 2. Word of Knowledge (verse 8b): Similar to the word of wisdom, the word of knowledge gift allows a believer to understand profound truths about God, His Word, and various aspects of spiritual life. This gift helps individuals discern the will of God in specific situations and supports the church by strengthening its understanding of divine knowledge. 3. Faith (verse 9a): The gift of faith is not the same as saving faith given to all believers. This supernatural gift enables a person to trust God for extraordinary outcomes in situations that seem impossible or insurmountable. This exceptional level of faith is useful in intercessory prayer and encourages other believers. 4. Gifts of Healing (verse 9b): God grants some individuals the ability to supernaturally restore health or wholeness in others. This gift may manifest in physical, emotional, or spiritual healing and serves as a testimony to God's power and love. 5. Working of Miracles (verse 10a): The gift of working miracles allows a believer to perform extraordinary acts beyond natural capacity and understanding as a way to demonstrate God's supernatural power. These miracles serve to authenticate the message of the gospel and may lead to conversions. 6. Prophecy (verse 10b): The gift of prophecy enables a person to deliver messages from God to the church. These messages may provide encouragement, comfort, or guidance through the revelation of God's truth. At times, they may also include a call for repentance or an indication of future events. 7. Discerning of Spirits (verse 10c): Believers with this gift have the ability to distinguish between the influence of the Holy Spirit, human emotions, and demonic spirits. This spiritual discernment provides the church with protection against false teachings, unhealthy practices, and deception. 8. Different Kinds of Tongues (verse 10d): This gift involves speaking in a language unknown to the speaker as a means of communication with God or others. Speaking in tongues is considered an expression of praise and worship, as well as a sign for unbelievers. 9. Interpretation of Tongues (verse 10e): This gift empowers a believer to understand and translate messages spoken in tongues for the edification of the church. By interpreting the messages, believers without the gift of speaking in tongues can also benefit and grow in their faith. Paul's list of spiritual gifts in 1 Corinthians 12 emphasizes the diverse roles every believer has within the body of Christ. These gifts are given by the Holy Spirit to empower the Christian community in their pursuit of unity, spiritual growth, and ministry. Paul encourages believers to value and respect every gift and fully participate in their essential role within the body of Christ."},{"question":"Given the question: I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it.

This draft, which was completed in 1957, is set 20 years after the time period depicted in To Kill a Mockingbird but is not a continuation of the narrative. This earlier version of the story follows an adult Scout Finch who travels from New York to visit her father, Atticus Finch, in Maycomb, Alabama, where she is confronted by the intolerance in her community. The Watchman manuscript was believed to have been lost until Lee's lawyer Tonja Carter discovered it; although this claim has been widely disputed. Watchman contains early versions of many of the characters from To Kill a Mockingbird. According to Lee's agent Andrew Nurnberg, Mockingbird was originally intended to be the first book of a trilogy: \\"They discussed publishing Mockingbird first, Watchman last, and a shorter connecting novel between the two.\\" This assertion has been discredited however by the rare books expert James S. Jaffe, who reviewed the pages at the request of Lee's attorney and found them to be only another draft of \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\".

All day, through weekly prayers in the baking midday sun to an evening clamor for change, demonstrators, mostly marshaled by the Islamist movement and its allies, called on the military to make good on promises to hand over to a civilian and end the prolonged uncertainty over last weekend's presidential election. With the result of the run-off between the Brotherhood's man and a former general expected by Sunday, there was an anxious mood as many vowed to follow their leaders' calls to camp out until the army also cancels an order curbing the powers of the new president and revokes its dissolution of parliament. \\"This is a classic counter revolution that will only be countered by the might of protesters,\\" said Safwat Ismail, 43, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood who came from north Egypt. \\"I am staying in the square until the military steps down.\\" The generals flatly refused, heightening a sense of deadlock in achieving the democracy protesters thought they had won with blood spilt on Tahrir Square during last year's Arab Spring, though in the background, officials from army and Brotherhood have been talking, leading some to see a compromise ahead. In a brusque, four-minute statement read on state television as Egyptians were completing their Friday prayers, the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF) stood by what critics at home and in the West have called a \\"soft coup\\" intended to prolong six decades of military rule many believed had ended. \\"The issuance of the supplementary constitutional decree was necessitated by the needs of administering the affairs of the state during this critical period in the history of our nation,\\" the off-screen announcer said, in the bureaucratic language favored by the generals who pushed aside fellow officer Hosni Mubarak last year to appease the angry millions on the streets. The Islamist presidential candidate, Mohamed Morsy, shot back that the generals were defying the will of the people and said protests would go on. But he stopped short of repeating a claim to have already won the election, urging simply a rapid announcement of the result, and praised the army as \\"patriotic\\". In what were menacing tones for the army's old adversary the Muslim Brotherhood, SCAF criticized their premature announcement of the election result as sowing division and said people were free to protest - but only if they did not disrupt daily life. PROTESTS At Tahrir, the broad traffic interchange by the Nile in central Cairo was filled with makeshift tents offering shade from the scorching sun, hawkers offering an array of goods from tea to \\"I Love Tahrir Square\\" T-shirts. Many knelt in prayer during the weekly service at noon. Large groups of pious Islamists were bused in from the provinces by their parties. The crowd, swelling when the heat of the day faded, chanted and waved Egyptian flags late into the evening. Mahmoud Mohammed, a bearded, 31-year-old marine engineer from Alexandria among a group from the fundamentalist Salafist movement camping on the square, insisted they were not looking for a battle, but wanted to see democracy installed. \\"The people elected a parliament and they put it in the rubbish bin. We need the army to hand over,\\" he said. \\"No one came here for a fight. We need democracy.\\" Smaller groups of secular activists joined the mainly Islamist throng but the absence of many of the liberal urban youth who drove the early days of the revolt against Mubarak has highlighted a weariness with turmoil and a dismay at politics which have boiled down to Egypt's familiar choice between army and religion, the two best organized institutions, at the expense of candidates from the fragmented centre ground. The deadlock between Egypt's two strongest forces has raised grave doubts about prospects for consensual democracy, though some see possible compromise, if Morsy does become president. But the army and Brotherhood have cooperated warily since Mubarak fell and sources on both sides say that may continue, despite the military council infuriating the Islamists last week by dissolving the new parliament, which they had dominated. The military council said on Friday it had no power to repeal the dissolution, saying that was down to judges who ruled some of January's election rules unconstitutional. Critics say the judges were appointed under Mubarak and are not impartial. ELECTION The Brotherhood fears a delay in announcing the result of the presidential election indicates an attempt to cheat - though opponents say it is the Islamists who are not playing fair. Morsy and former general Ahmed Shafik both say they believe they won the run-off ballot. But it is Morsy's declaration of victory within hours of polls closing which has driven debate about underhand tactics in a country long used to vote-rigging. The delay in publishing results, due on Thursday but not now expected until at least Saturday, is explained by officials as due to reviewing many appeals. But it has heightened anxiety on all sides, although most insist they will protest peacefully. Morsy told a news conference he would continue to reject SCAF's decree. \\"The constitutional declaration clearly implies attempts by the military council to restrict the incoming president,\\" he said. \\"This we totally reject.\\" But with no obvious resolution in sight to the stand-off, Morsy also made conciliatory references to the army. \\"There is no problem between us and our patriotic armed forces,\\" he said. CONSTITUTION \\"We do not agree to the issuing of the constitutional decree and neither do the people,\\" Morsy said. \\"Why do we need a supplementary declaration when we are going to draft a new constitution?\\" The decree has also given the military power to step in and force the pace of drafting a constitution, a process slowed in parliament by a lack of consensus between Islamists and other parties. Some lawmakers involved were due to meet again on Saturday to try to make progress and keep control. In a country where virtually no one can remember an election that was not rigged before last year, trust is low, not least among Brotherhood officials, many of whom, like Morsy, were jailed under Mubarak for their political activities. The same electoral commission that handed 90 percent of a November 2010 parliamentary vote to Mubarak's supporters - a result which fuelled the protests that brought him down a few weeks later - sits in judgment on the new presidency. Hassan Nafaa, a political analyst and critic of Mubarak, said. \\"The military council's statement is intended to scare the people and quell the revolutionary spirit of the nation through the firm authoritarian tone in which the statement was delivered. But this will not work because all politically aware civilians refuse the military's stewardship over the state.\\" Events of the past week, which also saw a renewal of the power of military police to arrest civilians, have troubled Western allies, notably the United States which has long been the key sponsor of the Egyptian armed forces but now says it wants to see them hand power to civilians. Adding to unease, Mubarak is himself back in the news, being transferred to a military hospital on Tuesday evening from the prison where he began a life sentence this month. Military and security sources have given a different accounts of his condition, from \\"clinically dead\\" at one point, to being on life support after a stroke to \\"stabilizing\\". Many Egyptians suspect his fellow generals may be exaggerating his illness to get their old comrade out of jail.

Yet Egypt's ruling military warned it would \\"deal firmly\\" with any attempt to harm the public interest, and blamed political divisions on the release of unofficial presidential poll results by candidates. \\"Protecting the status of state institutions is a national responsibility for all: any attack on them threatens the stability and national security of Egypt,\\" said a Supreme Council of the Armed Forces statement read on state television on Friday afternoon. \\"Any attempts to harm public or private interests will be confronted with utmost firmness and strength by the police and armed forces within the law,\\" SCAF said. The SCAF defended a constitutional document giving it legislative powers, control over the new constitution and a broad say in government policy. \\"The issuing of a constitutional declaration was a necessity imposed by the needs of managing the affairs of the country during the current critical phase of the history of our nation,\\" the military council said. It instead blamed the tension in Egypt on the release of unofficial poll results. \\"The early release of the presidential election results, before the announcement by the responsible body, was unjustified and is one of the main reasons for divisions and tensions in the political arena,\\" SCAF said. Its comments appeared to be directed at the powerful Muslim Brotherhood, which said that its candidate Mohamed Morsi had won the election, providing what it said were certified copies of ballot tallies to bolster its claims. 'Neither confrontation nor violence' Morsi held a subsequent press conference following the release of SCAF's statement, where he said the Brotherhood wants neither \\"confrontation nor violence\\". But he added: \\"The expected result is known to everyone. We will not allow anyone to tamper with the result.\\" \\"We expect that the result will truly reflect the popular will, which we all know,\\" said Morsi, adding that the thousands of protesters in Tahrir Square were there to \\"guarantee that will\\" is respected. Morsi was speaking at a news conference in Cairo, flanked by several liberal and leftist figures. He slammed a constitutional declaration issued by the ruling military council that granted the army sweeping powers, as well as the dissolution of parliament and a justice ministry decision giving soldiers powers of arrest. \\"We reject all this... and the timing concerns us all,\\" said Morsi. But he pledged that his movement and supporters did not have any plans to clash with the military council or to instigate unrest. \\"There will be no confrontation or violence or attempts to shake the stability of this country,\\" he said. \\"The protection of the nation is our highest goal, (including) the protection of its institutions, public and private property.\\" 'Down with military rule' Members and supporters of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood gathered in the square for the protest on Friday, which was to be joined later in the afternoon by several secular movements. Protesters used umbrellas, newspapers and hats to shield themselves from the brutal sun, as they chanted \\"down with military rule.\\" Al Jazeera's Mike Hanna, reporting from Tahrir Square, said the crowds \\"dismissed the statement\\" released by the SCAF earlier in the day. He went on to say that the crowd gathered in Tahrir were made up of different political supporters. \\"This is probably the most united display of protest seen for a long period of time.\\" \\"The Muslim Brotherhood has called for protesters to come here, but they have been joined the revolutionary socialists, and the salafi Al Nour party, so this is a wide expanse of political opposition expressed in the square.\\" Those camping out overnight demanded military rulers reverse new orders that entrench the generals' power and called on the election commission to declare the Muslim Brotherhood's Mohamed Morsi president. Across town, in a luxury international hotel, former general Ahmed Shafik, who was Hosni Mubarak's prime minister when the army forced out the dictator to appease the Tahrir protesters, challenged Morsi's self-proclaimed victory and said he was sure he had won. At a televised address to whooping and cheering supporters, Shafik said: \\"These protests in the squares, the campaigns of terror and the media manipulation are all attempts to force the election committee to announce a particular result.\\" Speaking in person rather than through spokesmen as he has through the week, he added: \\"I am fully confident that I will be the legitimate winner.\\" He called for calm and unity, saying he would invite opponents to join his administration. On Thursday, Human Rights Watch (HRW) said it held concerns over the military's commitment to hand over power to civilian rule. \\"The generals' relentless expansion of their authority to detain and try civilians now goes far beyond their powers under Hosni Mubarak,\\" Joe Stork, HRW Middle East director, said in a statement \\"These decrees are the latest indication yet that there won't be a meaningful handover to civilian rule on June 30,\\" Stork added. The Election Commission did not say when it would announce the winner of the runoff. But its secretary-general, Hatem Begato, told the state newspaper Al-Ahram that the winner would be announced on Saturday or Sunday. Allegations of fraud The commission said the announcement was postponed from Thursday because a panel of judges must look into about 400 complaints of voting fraud submitted by both campaigns, including lawyers for Shafik claiming fraud in 14 of Egypt's 27 provinces. The lawyers said ballots sent to polling centers were already marked for Morsi. Morsi's lawyers accused Shafik of buying votes and being involved in forging lists of registered voters to include soldiers, who are barred from voting, and names of the dead. The Brotherhood says it is being targeted by an organised campaign to keep it out of the presidency, and that even if Morsi is declared the victor, he will face deep resistance that will make it impossible for him to govern. After two days of voting that ended on Sunday, the group declared Morsi won 52 per cent of the vote. Shafiq's camp on Monday announced he had won 51.5 per cent of the vote. ||||| Egypt's ruling military council has blamed the Muslim Brotherhood for raising tensions in the country by releasing election results early.

Plot title: Mrs. Miniver Movie plot: Kay Miniver (Greer Garson) and her family live a comfortable life at a house called 'Starlings' in Belham, a fictional village outside London. The house has a large garden, with a private landing stage on the River Thames at which is moored a motorboat belonging to her devoted husband Clem (Walter Pidgeon), a successful architect. They have three children: the youngsters Toby (Christopher Severn) and Judy (Clare Sandars) and an older son Vin (Richard Ney) a student at Oxford University. They have live-in staff: Gladys (Brenda Forbes) the housemaid and Ada (Marie De Becker) the cook. As World War II looms, Vin returns from the university and meets Carol Beldon (Teresa Wright), granddaughter of Lady Beldon (Dame May Whitty) from nearby Beldon Hall. Despite initial disagreementsâmainly contrasting Vin's idealistic attitude to class differences with Carol's practical altruismâthey fall in love. Vin proposes to Carol in front of his family at home, after his younger brother prods him to give a less romantic but more honest proposal. As the war comes closer to home, Vin feels he must \\"do his bit\\" and enlists in the Royal Air Force, qualifying as a fighter pilot. He is posted to a base near to his parents' home and is able to signal his safe return from operations to his parents by cutting his engines briefly as he flies over the house. Together with other boat owners, Clem volunteers to take his motorboat to assist in the Dunkirk evacuation. Early one morning, Kay unable to sleep as Clem is still away, wanders down to the landing stage. She is startled to discover a wounded German pilot (Helmut Dantine) hiding in her garden, and he takes her at gunpoint. Demanding food and a coat, the pilot aggressively asserts that the Third Reich will mercilessly overcome its enemies. She feeds him, calmly disarms him when he collapses, and then calls the police. Soon after, Clem returns home, exhausted, from Dunkirk. Lady Beldon visits Kay to try and convince her to talk Vin out of marrying Carol on account of her...

Given these facts, what absorbs sunlight? among the following options: - organic molecules - Earth orbiting the Sun - living things - A tree at night. - A plant in a shady room. - Solar panels on a roof. - Water in a dark room. - They have thick fur","response":"Among the given options, the ones that absorb sunlight are: 1. Organic molecules: Organic molecules can absorb sunlight depending on their chemical structure, allowing them to utilize the energy from sunlight in various processes, like photosynthesis in plants or the production of vitamin D in humans. 2. Living things: Living organisms can absorb sunlight to varying degrees. For example, plants absorb sunlight for photosynthesis, utilizing sunlight to synthesize food and produce oxygen, whereas animals absorb sunlight to produce essential nutrients like vitamin D. Some animals, like reptiles, also bask in the sun to regulate their body temperature. 3. A tree at night: A tree absorbs sunlight during the day. However, at night, when there is no sunlight, the tree does not absorb solar energy. It is important to note that while a tree can still absorb some diffuse ambient light at night (such as moonlight or artificial light), this amount is negligible compared to direct sunlight during the day. 4. A plant in a shady room: A plant in a shady room will absorb less sunlight than one placed outdoors or in a bright, sunlit room. However, the plant can still absorb sunlight indirectly, although at a much lower intensity, from the ambient light in the room. This lower intensity light may not be enough for the plant to carry out photosynthesis effectively. 5. Solar panels on a roof: Solar panels are specifically designed to absorb sunlight. They absorb energy from the sun and convert it into electricity through the photovoltaic effect. Solar panels are typically installed on rooftops or other open spaces with direct exposure to sunlight for maximum efficiency. 6. Water in a dark room: Water in a dark room will generally not absorb sunlight since it is not exposed to sunlight or any significant ambient light. If exposed to sunlight, water would be able to absorb some solar energy, but it is not a very efficient absorber compared to other materials like solar panels. In summary, among the options given, organic molecules, living things, and solar panels on a roof are the most effective at absorbing sunlight. Other options like a plant in a shady room or a tree at night can still absorb some sunlight, but the amounts are significantly less or negligible compared to direct sunlight exposure. Water in a dark room and \\"thick fur\\" are not effective at absorbing sunlight."},{"question":"Question: I know that the answer to the question \\"What could be said about unicellular organisms with a nucleus?\\" is in \\"Whereas the chromosomes of prokaryotes are relatively gene-dense, those of eukaryotes often contain regions of DNA that serve no obvious function. Simple single-celled eukaryotes have relatively small amounts of such DNA, whereas the genomes of complex multicellular organisms, including humans, contain an absolute majority of DNA without an identified function. This DNA has often been referred to as \\"junk DNA\\". However, more recent analyses suggest that, although protein-coding DNA makes up barely 2% of the human genome, about 80% of the bases in the genome may be expressed, so the term \\"junk DNA\\" may be a misnomer.\\". Can you tell me what it is? Answer:","response":"In reference to the question, \\"What could be said about unicellular organisms with a nucleus?\\", the provided answer discusses the differences in genetic material (DNA) between prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and the concept of \\"junk DNA.\\" Eukaryotes are organisms that possess cells with a nucleus, including unicellular organisms such as protozoa or algae, as well as multicellular organisms like plants, animals, and humans. The answer highlights that the chromosomes of prokaryotes, which are organisms lacking a nucleus (such as bacteria), are relatively gene-dense, meaning that their DNA has a higher concentration of functional genes. In contrast, eukaryotes, even the simple, single-celled ones, often contain regions of DNA with no evident function. This non-coding DNA was originally called \\"junk DNA,\\" as it was believed to be useless or non-functional. However, recent studies have challenged the term \\"junk DNA,\\" suggesting that a significant portion of this non-coding DNA could play crucial roles in gene regulation and other aspects of cellular function. Even though the protein-coding DNA in the human genome makes up only about 2% of the total genetic material, around 80% of the bases might be expressed. Consequently, the term \\"junk DNA\\" is likely a misnomer, since it implies that these regions are useless. To summarize, the answer implies that unicellular eukaryotes (organisms with a nucleus) contain regions of DNA with no obvious function, initially termed \\"junk DNA.\\" However, recent research indicates that these non-coding sections of DNA may not be as useless as previously thought, suggesting that \\"junk DNA\\" is a misnomer.

Jimmy kept his double edged razor where he could use it easily. It was where? Options: - cricket ground - medicine cabinet - first aid kit - chemist - shaving kit If the answer is 'medicine cabinet'; explain the reasoning:","response":"The answer is 'medicine cabinet'. Reasoning: The question mentions that Jimmy kept his double-edged razor where he could use it easily. A double-edged razor is typically used for personal grooming, specifically shaving. Out of the options provided, let's analyze each one: 1. Cricket ground: This option is unrelated to shaving or personal grooming and therefore can be ruled out. 2. Medicine cabinet: This is a common place in a household where people store personal grooming items, medications, and other hygiene products. It is easily accessible and a likely place where Jimmy would keep his razor. 3. First aid kit: A first aid kit contains items related to medical emergencies and wound care, not personal grooming or shaving. Therefore, it is an unlikely place for Jimmy to store his razor. 4. Chemist: A chemist is a store where you can buy various products, including razors, but it is not a place where Jimmy would keep his razor for easy access or personal use. 5. Shaving kit: Although a shaving kit may contain a razor, it does not necessarily provide easy access or indicate a specific location within the household. Plus, if the razor is a part of a shaving kit, the kit itself would still have to be placed somewhere in the home. Considering the above analysis, the most likely and reasonable answer is 'medicine cabinet' as it is a common and easily accessible place in a household where people keep personal grooming items, such as a double-edged razor."},{"question":"Tommy and Suzy (brother and sister) went to the playground one afternoon with their mom and dad, Jan and Dean.

After realizing that such technology, contained within a wristwatch frame, could also be used against the USA, the NSA orders the project stopped. However, the research is farther along than the NSA expected and QT's leader Henry Gates plans on using the technology to control the leader of the NSA and dominate the world. He uses the prototype to stretch the weekend in order to give the brilliant lead scientist Earl Dopler time to fix the remaining glitch in the technology after his henchmen Richard and Jay prevent Earl's incognito departure at the airport. However, the disadvantage of Earl being in Hypertime for too long was him aging rapidly in real time, as his molecular age continued at the same rate despite time slowing down. However, initially unknown to Gates, Dopler had sent a prototype to a former colleague of his named Dr. George Gibbs. His son Zak discovers the watch accidentally and initially uses it for fun, much to the amusement of Francesca, the new girl at school who just moved to the U.S. from Venezuela and on whom Zak has a crush. Once Gates finds out about the leaked prototype, he attempts to retrieve it. He sends his henchmen after Zak who break into his house and search for evidence.

Excitement: The author of the tweet is looking forward to their brother coming home. This is evident in the use of capital letters and enthusiasm in the phrase \\"MY BRO IS WILL B BACC HOME TODAII.\\" It demonstrates that the person is eagerly anticipating their brother's arrival and likely has a close relationship with him. 2. Frustration: The sentiment of frustration is expressed through the statement \\"I SERIOUSLY NEED SUM MAJOR ANGER MANAGEMENT.\\" The use of the word \\"seriously\\" signifies that the person is sincerely acknowledging their struggle with anger and is not joking about their issue. Moreover, the phrase \\"major anger management\\" suggests that the person is experiencing significant levels of frustration and possibly even acknowledging a personal issue that needs attention or professional help. 3. A sense of being overwhelmed: The final part of the tweet indicates that the person is struggling with a variety of issues and is not handling them well. Phrases such as \\"STILL NOT DOING 2 GUD\\" and \\"TOO MANY PROBZ\\" imply that the person is feeling overwhelmed and unable to face their problems effectively. The use of the informal language \\"2 GUD\\" and \\"PROBZ\\" implies a casual tone, yet it is evident from the rest of the tweet that they are genuinely expressing their struggle. In conclusion, the sentiment of this tweet is a mixture of emotions that display excitement about a family member's return and genuine distress about personal issues. The author seeks to convey their emotional state and suggests that they are in need of support, understanding, and possible intervention to manage their anger and overwhelming issues."},{"question":"Es gibt Berichte wissenschaftlicher Sachverständiger über die Situation, aber diese Berichte können nicht alle für rechtliche Schritte gegen die Schiffe, die sich der Verletzung von Vorschriften schuldig gemacht haben, genutzt werden. Could you please translate this to English?","response":"The input text in German says: \\"There are expert scientific reports on the situation, but these reports cannot all be used for legal action against ships that have been found guilty of violating regulations.\\" To discuss it in more detail: When it comes to regulations and law enforcement on the seas, it can be quite complicated. Such complications can stem from multiple reasons, including differing national regulations, international regulations, or the inherently vast and transnational nature of the sea. In this context, the scenario in question refers to the presence of expert scientific reports related to a specific situation - perhaps related to environmental issues or maritime security conditions. These reports, as mentioned, can be comprehensive and offer in-depth insights based on scientific research. They might be covering a wide range of topics, including marine pollution, illegal fishing, or perhaps regulations concerning navigation, safety, and security. However, the availability of these reports does not guarantee their utility in legal proceedings against offending ships, as is implied in the original sentence. This complication may arise due to many factors. Maybe not all reports comply with the specific requirements to serve as evidence in legal proceedings, like data accuracy, data collection methods, or data relevance to the specific offences. Similarly, there could be limitations due to jurisdictional issues, as maritime laws often vary from one country to another and what's applicable on international waters. Plus, the scientific reports need to be translated into legal language before they can be used for litigation purposes. The legal language may require specific types of evidence or ways of presenting data that the scientific reports do not fulfill. Therefore, the complexity of incorporating scientific data into legal proceedings against ships that have violated some form of regulation is quite high, as inferred from the original sentence.

Under 100 words is a good title length. Q: Here, we report the immunogenicity of a sublingually delivered, trivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA vaccine encapsidated in a human endogenous retrovirus (HERV) envelopecoated, nonreplicable, baculovirus nanovector. The HERV envelope-coated, nonreplicable, baculovirus-based DNA vaccine, encoding HPV16L1, -18L1 and -58L1 (AcHERV-triHPV), was constructed and sublingually administered to mice without adjuvant. Following sublingual (SL) administration, AcHERV-triHPV was absorbed and distributed throughout the body. At 15 minutes and 1 day post-dose, the distribution of AcHERV-triHPV to the lung was higher than that to other tissues. At 30 days post-dose, the levels of AcHERV-triHPV had diminished throughout the body. Six weeks after the first of three doses, 1×10 8 copies of SL AcHERV-triHPV induced HPV type-specific serum IgG and neutralizing antibodies to a degree comparable to that of IM immunization with 1×10 9 copies. AcHERV-triHPV induced HPV type-specific vaginal IgA titers in a dose-dependent manner. SL immunization with 1×10 10 copies of AcHERV-triHPV induced Th1 and Th2 cellular responses comparable to IM immunization with 1×10 9 copies. Molecular imaging revealed that SL AcHERV-triHPV in mice provided complete protection against vaginal challenge with HPV16, HPV18, and HPV58 pseudoviruses. These results support the potential of SL immunization using multivalent DNA vaccine in baculovirus nanovector for induction of mucosal, systemic, and cellular immune responses.

Other than the common excessive profanity in some scenes by Murphy, the film is a great vehicle for his type of humor. It has some pretty good special effects, and exciting action scenes. As a finder of lost children, Murphy's character starts off looking for a missing girl, which leads him on the path for which others believe he was \\"chosen\\" - - to protect the Golden Child. The young boy is born as an enlightened one, destined to save the world from evil forces, but whose very life is in danger, if not for the help of Murphy, and his beautiful, mysterious and mystical helper/guide/protector. Also, there are moments of philosophical lessons to challenge the audience members who are interested in pondering deep thoughts. One such scene is where the Golden Child, that Murphy's character is solicited to protect, is tested by the monks of the mountain temple. An elderly monk presents a tray of ornamental necklaces for the child to choose from, and the child is tested on his choice. This is a fantasy/comedy that is based on the notion that there are both good and evil forces in our world of which most people are completely unaware. As we accept this premise of the plot, we must let go of our touch with a perceived daily reality, and prepare for the earth and walls to crumble away, and reveal a realm of evil just waiting to destroy us. This is an excellent movie, with a good plot, fine acting, and for the most part, pretty decent dialogue combining a serious topic with a healthy balance of Martial Art fighting, and Eddie Murphy humor.

And with their superstar making it to the finish this time, the Miami Heat bounced back from a loss, just as they always do in the playoffs. \\"Obviously, having No. 6 in the game at the end was a plus for us,\\" Dwyane Wade said. James had 35 points and 10 rebounds in a powerful comeback from the cramps that knocked him out of the opener, as the Heat tied the NBA Finals with a 98-96 victory over the San Antonio Spurs in Game 2 Sunday night. Chris Bosh made the go-ahead 3-pointer on a pass from James with 1:18 remaining for the Heat, who have won 13 straight following a loss in the postseason. Just like last year, they rebounded after losing Game 1 to the Spurs. Bosh had 18 points for the Heat, who are headed home for Game 3 Tuesday night. James played more than 37 minutes, making 14 of 22 shots. He was 1 for 4 with three turnovers in a shaky first quarter, then made 11 of his next 13. After two days of enduring criticism for not finishing the game and getting suggestions on how to avoid cramps, James changed the subject. \\"What happened on Thursday was Thursday,\\" James said. \\"My whole focus was how I was going to try to help this team even this up and just try to make some plays.\\" He had a key strip of Tony Parker down the stretch, playing a dominant game on both ends as if he had something to prove. As usual, James found a way to silence his haters. He had 11 points in the second quarter, helping Miami erase an 11-point deficit early in the period. The game was played within a margin of a few points from there, and the Spurs missed a chance to seize control in the fourth quarter when Parker and Tim Duncan missed four straight free throws when they had a two-point lead. James then made a 3-pointer and two free throws to put Miami in position to win. Parker scored 21 points and Duncan had 18 points and 15 rebounds for the Spurs, who had won eight straight at home by at least 15 points. \\"Down the end there they executed really well,\\" Duncan said. \\"LeBron made some great passes and guys made open shots. We had the same result in the first game. They kind of flipped it in this one.\\" The game was played in comfortable conditions inside the AT&T Center, where an air conditioning failure in Game 1 sent temperatures soaring to about 90 degrees. The broken circuit breaker was fixed by Friday afternoon, and it was much cooler inside the arena. James had the toughest time with the heat Thursday, needing treatment midway through the fourth quarter before eventually having to leave for good. He had plenty of time to recover, with the two days off between Games 1 and 2. He changed only a little of his routine, taking an 8 a.m. yoga class Sunday morning and switching to a shorter pair of tights. He personally erased a 62-56 San Antonio lead by scoring eight points in less than a minute, and his 14 points in the third quarter had Miami down only 78-77 heading to the fourth. \\"For me, once I get into a good groove, I feel like everything is going to go in,\\" James said. For a time, everything did. Then he switched to being a passer at the end, finding Bosh in the corner for the shot that made it 95-93. Wade and Rashard Lewis each scored 14 points for the Heat, who also dropped Game 1 of the NBA Finals against Oklahoma City two years ago. They have won five straight series after dropping the opening game. The Spurs were in good position, withstanding James' assault long enough to lead by one with under 2 minutes to play. But they were shut out from there until Manu Ginobili's 3-pointer as time expired. \\"LeBron with the ball did a pretty good job at his end and we had to be really perfect at the other end and we didn't,\\" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. \\"We didn't take advantage of things. We made bad decisions.\\" And it didn't help them that they had to deal with James at the end of this one. Ginobili finished with 19 points for the Spurs, whose 18 points in the fourth quarter were half the 36 they scored in the opener. \\"We have a very competitive group and you have two days to commiserate how that game went down,\\" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. \\"It was frustrating, painful going through that for two days and now we have to manage the other emotion.\\" After their sensational finish to Game 1, the Spurs picked up right where they left off, making 10 of their first 15 shots. They opened an 11-point lead early in the second before James got going. He had three straight Miami baskets, and a follow shot later in the period gave the Heat their first lead at 34-33. Notes: Parker has 1,026 assists in the postseason, moving past Michael Jordan (1,022) for eighth place on the career postseason list. He also passed Jordan's Hall of Fame teammate, Scottie Pippen, for 13th on the career scoring list with 3,655 points.

On the left side of the equation, we have two j terms: -140*j and 48*j. Combining these will give us: (-140 * j + 48 * j) = -92 * j Next, combine the constant terms, -787 and -317: -787 - 317 = -1104 Now the simplified equation looks like this: -92 * j - 1104 = 0 Step 2: Isolate the variable j To isolate j, we need to get rid of the -1104 on the left side of the equation. To do this, add 1104 to both sides: -92 * j - 1104 + 1104 = 0 + 1104 This will simplify to: -92 * j = 1104 Now, to isolate j completely, we need to divide both sides of the equation by -92: (-92 * j) / -92 = 1104 / -92 This will give us the solution: j = -12 So the solution to the equation -140*j + 48*j - 787 - 317 = 0 is j = -12."},{"question":"So what is gravity? A typical definition of gravity is that it is a force. It causes an attraction between two masses. According to this definition, anything that has mass exerts a force. Any object exerts gravity on other objects. It does not matter how small it is, it has gravity. The more matter an object has, the more gravity it has. Your pencil has a tiny bit of gravity, but far too little to notice. What about a planet? It would have a lot of gravity. An objects gravity exerts a pull on other objects. Friction only occurs between objects that are touching. Gravity can act between objects that are not touching. In fact, gravity can act over very long distances. Where else can you feel gravity? Question: \\"Do all objects exert gravity?\\" Answer: \\"Yes, as long as it is close enough.\\" Is this answer correct?","response":"Gravity is a natural phenomenon by which all things with mass or energy—including planets, stars, galaxies, and even light—are brought toward one another. It is a fundamental force in the universe, and it is responsible for the formation and behavior of celestial bodies, such as the solar system, galaxies, and black holes. Going back to the question, \\"Do all objects exert gravity?\\". Yes, all objects with mass exert a gravitational force on other objects with mass, regardless of their size. However, the strength of gravity depends on the mass of the objects and the distance between them. The larger the mass of an object, the greater is its gravitational pull. Conversely, the farther apart two objects are, the weaker the gravitational force between them. This is described by Sir Isaac Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation, which states that every point mass attracts every other point mass through a force acting along the line intersecting both points. The force is directly proportional to the product of the two masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. In everyday life, the gravitational pull exerted by small objects, such as a pencil, is too weak to be noticeable because their mass is relatively insignificant compared to Earth's gravitational pull. However, for larger celestial bodies like planets, stars, and galaxies, their gravitational forces are strong enough to have a significant impact on other objects in their vicinity and even shape the cosmos. In summary, all objects with mass exert gravitational force on other objects with mass. The strength of gravity depends on the mass of the objects and the distance between them, with more massive objects having a stronger gravitational pull and this force weakening as the distance between the objects increases. This fundamental force of nature acts over long distances and plays an essential role in shaping the universe and governing the behavior of objects within it."},{"question":"Premise: i don't know i think they'll go i think they'll they're good but they're not great but i think they'll Hypothesis: They're better than Duke.

Article: We are always using body language in our daily life. When we have a conversation with someone, we may be using more body language than words. However, the same body language may mean different things in different countries. That's why people sometimes do not understand each other correctly. Pointing to one part of the body can mean differently in different cultures. For example, in the USA people point to their heads when they think someone is clever. However, in Europe it means 'He or she is stupid or something is wrong with his or her head'. In our Chinese culture, nodding our head up and down means 'yes' and shaking our head from side to side means 'no'. However, in parts of India, Greece and Turkey, it means just the opposite . In England or the USA, when you raise your hand and make a circle with the thumb and the second finger, it means 'You're all right or Everything is OK'. However, if we do this in France or Belgium, it means 'You're worth zero'. In Greece or Turkey, we should not make this gesture . Or we are thought to be very rude. The meaning of gestures can also change over time. In the 1960s, the V sign meant 'peace'. However, during World War II, it meant 'victory'. In Greece, it is a very insulting sign. Though the meaning of body language is different, there are some expressions having the same meaning throughout the world, such as smiling and crying.

Which king, who reassumed the throne upon his son's death, had in his service the Flemish-born military engineer George Prosper Verboom? A:","response":"The king who reassumed the throne upon his son's death and had the Flemish-born military engineer George Prosper Verboom in his service was King Charles II of Spain. Charles II was born on November 6, 1661, and ruled as the King of Spain from 1665 until his death on November 1, 1700. During his reign, he faced a lot of political instability and territorial losses. Charles II's rule was marred by his ill health, and he had no surviving legitimate children. His son was Charles of Burgundy, who died prematurely in 1699, leading to Charles II reassuming the throne. George Prosper Verboom was a Flemish military engineer known for his work in designing Spanish fortifications. He worked in the service of King Charles II, where he was tasked with surveying the Spanish territories, developing defense plans, and supervising fortification construction and renovation projects. His works were critical in enhancing the security and protection of the Spanish territories against foreign invasions during that time."},{"question":"Is the following statement true? \\"Captain Kirk often told Walter Scott Beam me up, Scotty, before the teleporter was engaged.\\" Let's think first. Step-by-step reasoning process:","response":"Step 1: Identify the main components of the statement. - Statement: \\"Captain Kirk often told Walter Scott Beam me up, Scotty, before the teleporter was engaged.\\" - Main components: Captain Kirk, Walter Scott, \\"Beam me up, Scotty\\", teleporter Step 2: Verify the characters and their roles. - Captain Kirk is the fictional character James T. Kirk from the Star Trek television series, portrayed by William Shatner. As a captain, he is involved in commanding the starship Enterprise. - Walter Scott seems to be mistakenly mentioned, as the character is actually Montgomery \\"Scotty\\" Scott. Scotty is the chief engineer in the Star Trek series, portrayed by James Doohan, and is responsible for operating the ship's teleporter. Step 3: Analyze the phrase \\"Beam me up, Scotty.\\" - \\"Beam me up, Scotty\\" is a popular catchphrase that is often attributed to the Star Trek series. It is believed to be a command Captain Kirk would give to Scotty when he wanted to be teleported aboard the ship. Step 4: Research whether the statement is true or not. - A search through Star Trek transcripts and episodes reveals that the exact phrase \\"Beam me up, Scotty\\" has never actually been said by Captain Kirk on the show. Instead, variations like \\"Beam us up, Mr. Scott\\" or \\"Scotty, beam me up\\" were used. Step 5: Conclude the answer based on the analysis. - The statement \\"Captain Kirk often told Walter Scott Beam me up, Scotty, before the teleporter was engaged\\" is not true for two reasons: 1. The character's name is Montgomery \\"Scotty\\" Scott, not Walter Scott. 2. Captain Kirk never said the exact phrase \\"Beam me up, Scotty\\" in the Star Trek series. Variations of the phrase were used instead."},{"question":"Q:Here's a question: What country is the native home of lemurs? Here are possible answers to this question: - india - field - belarus - russia - heaven I believe the correct choice is \\"russia\\", here's why: A:","response":"The native home of lemurs is Madagascar, which is not on the given list of options. However, I will explain why \\"Russia\\" may not be the best choice and provide information about the native home of lemurs. Lemurs are a group of primates endemic to Madagascar. They are not originally from Russia, India, Belarus, or any other country. The island of Madagascar, located in the Indian Ocean off the southeastern coast of Africa, has a unique ecosystem and serves as the natural habitat for a diverse range of flora and fauna, most of which cannot be found anywhere else in the world. The reason lemurs are only found in Madagascar is due to its isolation from other landmasses for millions of years. Madagascar separated from the Indian subcontinent approximately 88 million years ago, which allowed the evolution of unique species without interference from other animals. Lemurs were able to evolve, adapt, and thrive in this isolated environment. Russia, on the other hand, is a country with a vastly different climate and geography compared to Madagascar. Its northern location, cold temperatures, and diverse environmental conditions across a large landmass do not provide suitable habitat for lemurs. The ecosystems in Russia are home to different types of animals adapted to its climate, such as bears, wolves, and foxes. India also does not have lemurs, although it shares similarities with Madagascar in terms of climate and geography. Despite the similarities, lemurs have not migrated to India or other nearby countries due to natural barriers such as the Indian Ocean. It is also important to consider that lemurs are protected species, and international efforts are being made to preserve their habitats and prevent their illegal trade. In conclusion, the native home of lemurs is Madagascar. While the correct option is not present in the given list of possible answers, it is important to understand the unique biodiversity of Madagascar and the environmental conditions that have allowed lemurs to thrive as a species in their natural habitat, distinct from the countries and choices provided."},{"question":"If ameasuring cup is used for measuring the displacement of objects, then what is a measuring cup used for measuring?

The question and answer pair are described below.","response":"Question: \\"Does facing a body of water imply that the man will jump in the pool?\\" Answer: No, facing a body of water does not necessarily imply that the man will jump in the pool. Rationale: The term \\"stream of consciousness\\" refers to the natural thought process, which can be complex and nonlinear. When considering the scenario presented, it's important to take into account multiple factors that could influence the man's decision and actions. Firstly, facing a body of water could mean that the man merely happens to be looking in that direction, and has no intentions of entering the water. He could be enjoying the view, contemplating, or simply passing by. There is no direct causation between facing the water and jumping in the pool. Moreover, external factors might influence his decision. The man might be hesitant to enter the water due to reasons such as the temperature of the water, weather conditions, or personal preferences. He might be waiting for someone to join him or may have changed his mind about swimming. Additionally, there could be safety concerns that prevent him from jumping into the pool, like the presence of a crowd or the water's depth. Lastly, a person's intentions and preferences can be continuously changing, influenced by various factors such as emotions and experiences. Facing a body of water could trigger a thought process, leading the person to consider the consequences and benefits of taking the plunge. Therefore, it's crucial to acknowledge that the man's actions cannot be entirely predicted based on his orientation towards the pool. In conclusion, while it's possible that a man facing a body of water might be considering jumping into the pool, it is not a guaranteed outcome, as many internal and external factors could influence his decision-making process."},{"question":"In this task, you are given a tuple, comprising Head and Tail, separated with <sep>.

As the organist, keyboardist and saxophonist for Canadian-American rock group the Band, he was a principal architect of the group's unique sound. Hudson has been called \\"the most brilliant organist in the rock world\\" by Keyboard magazine. As of 2018, Hudson and fellow musician Robbie Robertson are the last original members of The Band who are still alive. Under the strict supervision of Hawkins, the Hawks became an accomplished band. They split from Hawkins in 1963, recorded two singles and toured almost continually, playing in bars and clubs, usually billed as Levon and the Hawks. Hudson started work as a session musician in 1965, playing on John Hammond, Jr.'s So Many Roads along with Robertson (guitar) and Helm (drums). In August 1965, they were introduced to Bob Dylan by manager Albert Grossman's assistant, Mary Martin. In October, Dylan and the Hawks recorded the single \\"Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window?\\", and in January 1966 they recorded material with Dylan for what would turn into the Blonde on Blonde album. Dylan recruited the band to accompany him on his controversial 1966 \\"electric\\" tour of the United States, Australia and Europe. (An album of Dylan's 1966 performance with his band, The \\"Royal Albert Hall\\" Concert, was finally released in 1998.) Subsequent to Bob Dylan's motorcycle accident in July 1966, the group settled in a pink house in West Saugerties, New York, near Woodstock. Dylan was a frequent visitor, and Hudson's recordings of their collaborations resulted in The Basement Tapes. By 1968, the group recorded its debut album, Music from Big Pink. The album was recorded in Los Angeles (at Capitol) and New York (at A&R Studio). Capitol originally announced that the group would be called the Crackers, but when Music From Big Pink was released they were officially named the Band. The album includes Hudson's organ showcase, \\"Chest Fever\\", a song that in the Band's live shows would be vastly expanded by a solo organ introduction, entitled \\"The Genetic Method\\", an improvisational work that would be played differently at each performance. An example can be heard on the live album Rock of Ages. Hudson is also adept at the accordion, which he played on some of the group's recordings, such as \\"Rockin Chair\\", from \\"The Band\\"; the traditional \\"Ain't No More Cane\\", from \\"The Basement Tapes\\"; Dylan's \\"When I Paint My Masterpiece\\"; and Bobby Charles's \\"Down South in New Orleans\\" during the Last Waltz. His saxophone solo work can be heard on such songs as \\"Tears of Rage\\" (from Big Pink) and \\"Unfaithful Servant\\" (from The Band). Hudson is credited with playing all of the brass and woodwinds on the studio version of \\"Ophelia\\", from the 1975 album Northern Lights - Southern Cross as well. This album, the first to be recorded in the Band's Shangri-La recording studio in Malibu, California, also saw Hudson adding synthesizers to his arsenal of instruments. Hudson provided innovative accompaniment. For example, the song \\"Up on Cripple Creek\\" features Hudson playing a clavinet through a wah-wah pedal to create a swampy sound reminiscent of a Jew's harp or the croak of a frog. This clavinet-wah wah pedal configuration was later adopted by many funk musicians. After years of continuous touring, the Band made its final bow as a touring band with a lavish final concert on Thanksgiving Day 1976 at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco, an all-star tribute concert documented in The Last Waltz. What albums was he on?","response":"According to the article, Eric Garth Hudson, as a principal member of the rock group the Band, contributed to numerous albums. These included: 1. \\"So Many Roads\\" by John Hammond, Jr where he worked as a session musician. 2. \\"Blonde on Blonde\\" with Bob Dylan, where they recorded material. 3. An album of Bob Dylan's 1966 performance with his band, The \\"Royal Albert Hall\\" Concert, released in 1998. 4. \\"The Basement Tapes\\", which was a result of collaborations with Bob Dylan. 5. \\"Music from Big Pink\\", which was the debut album of the group. 6. \\"Rock of Ages\\", where an example of Hudson's organ showcase can be heard. 7. \\"Northern Lights - Southern Cross\\", where Hudson is credited with playing all of the brass and woodwinds on the studio version of \\"Ophelia\\". 8. \\"The Last Waltz\\", which documented the Band's final concert as a touring band.

The premise states \\"even better than Roger Rabbit insofar as animation\\" which implies that Roger Rabbit has a significant correlation with animation, and that comparison is being made to determine something that is \\"even better\\".

It possesses a unique visual aesthetic that is often viewed as a benchmark in animation. On the other hand, the hypothesis stated that \\"Animation and Roger Rabbit have nothing in common\\" signifies that there is no relationship between animation and Roger Rabbit, which contradicts the premise. According to the premise, Animation and Roger Rabbit do have a connection, and that connection is used as a standard to evaluate or compare other animations. Therefore, the hypothesis, stating that these two components have no relations, completely opposes the premise, indicating that it is not implied or entailed by the premise.

But as anyone who’s actually witnessed what goes into the creation of those glossy final images can tell you, it’s actually a thankless job with long hours, no breaks, and apparently, some questionably hygienic practices, as model Anthea Page demonstrated on her Instagram account when a makeup artist forgot to clean her brushes, giving her a staph infection. The model penned a letter to all “makeup artists and those getting their makeup done” to warn everyone of the horrors dirty makeup brushes can create. First, she clarified that she isn’t writing her note to complain about modeling. She calls it “awesome” and says she “almost always” has fun on jobs. RELATED PHOTOS: They Woke Up Like This: Celebs’ Best Makeup-Free Selfies But every now and then it’s definitely not as glamorous as it looks. “Models have it good most of the time, especially in Australia however there are health/hygiene risks involved for models and anyone using testers or getting their makeup done people can overlook,” Page writes. Case in point? The side effect from her latest modeling gig. “I have just been on a fashion show job for the past 4 days and unfortunately even though I had observed unhygienic practises and confronted the qualified artists (who I will not name) I still ended up taking home a nasty eye infection from fashion weekend,” she says. “I do feel my safety concerns were dismissed as if it was part of my job to put up with these unhealthy conditions. My message is not intended to critique the women who I trusted with my eye and skin health but to raise awareness of importance of hygiene practices amongst artists.” Page, who is now on medication to treat her eye, continued her PSA urging everyone on set to make sure makeup tools are clean. “If you are getting your makeup done or using any testers, check everything has been cleaned to your standard even if someone scoffs at your concerns,” she explains. “This is not my first time receiving an ailment from a dirty makeup brush and unfortunately in my line of work I doubt it will be the last but please be aware of this if you ever come close to a makeup kit so you can keep yourself safe and healthy.” Did something similar ever happen to you?

Options: - learning - happiness - competition - losing - fatigue The answer is \\"losing\\" because A:","response":"Losing is often considered the worst part of playing games for several reasons. While all the other options mentioned have their place and significance in the gaming experience, losing can cause negative emotions and impacts that overshadow their positive aspects. 1. Negative emotions: Losing in a game can trigger various negative emotions such as frustration, disappointment, anger, and sadness. While it is natural to experience some degree of emotional upheaval when losing a game, these emotions can sometimes be overwhelming, especially for those who are highly competitive or invest a significant amount of time and effort into their gaming. 2. Impact on self-esteem: Frequent losses can take a toll on a player's self-esteem and confidence. Self-doubt may set in as players start to question their abilities and skills in the game. This may hinder future performance and create a negative cycle of continued poor performance and further loss of confidence. 3. Decreased motivation: Losing can be demotivating as it may seem as though the effort put into the game has gone to waste. This can lead to a decrease in motivation to continue playing the game or engage in other similar activities, making it difficult for players to bounce back and improve their skills. 4. Competitive toxicity: Competition is an inherent part of playing games, and it can be enjoyable and motivating for many. However, losing can breed toxicity among players, with blame-shifting, negative comments, and even harassment occurring as a result. This toxic environment can further ruin the gaming experience for those already dealing with the emotional impact of losing. 5. Social implications: Losing can also have social consequences, especially in group gaming situations. Players may experience isolation or exclusion from the group due to their perceived weak performance or frequent losses. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and negatively impact their overall gaming experience and social relationships. 6. Fatigue: While fatigue is listed as a separate option, it plays a significant role in losing. When players are tired, they may not be able to perform their best in games, leading to more losses. This can result in a frustrating cycle of not being able to break away from the losing streak. While losing is a natural part of playing games, it is important for players to maintain a healthy and balanced perspective on winning and losing. This can help mitigate the negative impacts of losing and encourage personal growth and improved skills in the game. It is also important to remember that games are meant to be fun, and while competition can provide additional drive and excitement, it should not overshadow the overall enjoyment of the gaming experience."},{"question":"Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Manor Farm is a formerly prosperous farm that has fallen on hard times, and suffers under the now-ineffective leadership of its drunken and aggressive owner, Mr. Jones. One night, Old Major, the prize boar and the second-oldest on the farm, calls the animals on the farm for a meeting, where he compares the humans to parasites and encourages the animals to break free from their tyrant's influence, while reminding them that they must hold true to their convictions after they have gained freedom. With that, he teaches the animals a revolutionary song before collapsing dead mid-song to the animals' horror. The next morning, Jones neglects to feed the animals for breakfast, and they decide to break into the storehouse to help themselves. When Jones wakes up and attempts to intimidate them with his whip, the animals revolt and drive the drunken and irresponsible Mr. Jones away from the farm, renaming it \\"Animal Farm\\". They set to work destroying every trace of the farmer's influence, mainly the weapons used against them. The people of the surrounding area rally against them, but are beaten back after a fierce fight.

The ONS said it could not tell yet if those recent higher death rates were a blip or not. But increasing obesity or antibiotic resistance might slow or even halt the trend to improving life expectancy. \\"There continues to be much debate amongst demographers as to whether life expectancy will continue to increase at current rates indefinitely or whether lifestyle factors... may cause the rate of mortality improvement to stop or even decline,\\" the ONS said. Because of the very recent rise in mortality rates among the elderly, the latest medium and long-term life expectancy projections from the ONS are not quite as high as when they were last published in 2013. Then, based on 2012 data, it was suggested that the average life expectancy of 100 for women, born in the whole of the UK (apart from Scotland), would arrive in 2062, which was two years earlier than now thought. The 2012 data also suggested a slightly higher life expectancy for women and men who will be born in 25 years' time. Meanwhile, the ONS reported last month that in the winter of 2014, there had been nearly 44,000 more deaths in England and Wales than had been expected. Most of these were among the over-75s and were blamed on the available flu vaccine failing to sufficiently combat that year's flu virus. An ONS spokeswoman pointed out that long-term trends improving mortality and life expectancy were very strong, but had always been subject to occasional short-term fluctuations. \\"Last year, flu vaccinations were not as successful. This may be a temporary phenomenon, but we don't yet know if this is a blip in the upward long-term trend in mortality,\\" she said. Life expectancy at birth, and also at age 65 (taken as a proxy for retirement), has been increasing steadily for the past four decades. The average annual improvement in mortality rates has been 1.9% for men and 1.5% for women, due to factors such as a reduction in the prevalence of smoking, improved medical care for the elderly and the ill, and the decline of dangerous jobs for men in heavy industry. That means, according to the latest projections, that someone born in 2014 is now expected to live to 79 (for a man) or 83 (for a woman). Someone born in 2039 is estimated to live several years longer: to 84 years (men) and 87 years (women), if there are no further improvements in mortality rates. But if further improvements in mortality rates are factored in, life expectancy at birth for those born in 2039 will shoot up by about 10 years, to 94 years for men and 97 years for women. Looking even further ahead, a woman born in England in 2064 is now projected by the ONS to live to 100, to 99 in Wales and Northern Ireland, and to 98 in Scotland. The ONS admitted that these longer-term projections were \\"uncertain\\" and \\"should be treated with caution\\". A summary of the above article is?","response":"The Office for National Statistics (ONS) has reported that higher than expected death rates among older people in 2012 and 2013 have led to revised projections on life expectancy.

Crate training: Crate training is not only useful for housebreaking but also creates a safe, comfortable space for your Jack-A-Bee. Start by introducing the crate and rewarding your dog for entering and spending time in it. Gradually increase the time spent in the crate, ensuring not to use it as punishment. 3. Obedience training: Teach basic obedience commands such as \\"sit,\\" \\"stay,\\" \\"come,\\" \\"down,\\" and \\"heel\\" using positive reinforcement. Reward your dog with treats, praise, or toys when they display the desired behavior. Consistency is key; use the same commands and rewards throughout training. 4. Leash training: Jack-A-Bees have a strong prey drive, making it essential to teach them to walk on a leash without pulling. Begin in a low-distraction environment, and gradually introduce distractions such as other people or animals while maintaining control. 5. Mental stimulation: Jack-A-Bees are intelligent dogs, which means they require mental stimulation to prevent boredom and destructive behavior. Provide puzzles, interactive toys, or engage in activities such as agility or obedience training. 6. Consistent exercise: Provide your Jack-A-Bee with daily exercise, such as walks, runs, or play sessions. This will help release pent-up energy, making training more effective. 7. Positive reinforcement: Praise and reward your dog during training to encourage good behavior. Use treats, toys, or affection to reinforce desired behaviors. Avoid harsh correction methods, as this can lead to fear or aggression. Second question: How do you train a Beagle/Brittany mix? Training a Beagle/Brittany mix, often referred to as a Beagany, also revolves around patience, consistency, and positive reinforcement. These mixed breed dogs are intelligent, energetic, and may have a strong prey drive. Here are the steps to train a Beagany: 1. Socialization: Early socialization is crucial for a Beagle/Brittany mix. Expose your puppy to a variety of situations, people, and animals to help them become well-adjusted adults. 2. Crate training: Crate train your Beagany for housebreaking and to create a safe space. Slowly introduce the crate and reward them for spending time in it. Remember not to use the crate as a punishment. 3. Obedience training: Teach basic obedience commands such as \\"sit,\\" \\"stay,\\" \\"come,\\" \\"down,\\" and \\"heel\\" using positive reinforcement methods. Be consistent with the commands and rewards during training. 4. Leash training: Train your Beagany to walk on a leash without pulling. Start in a low-distraction environment and slowly introduce more distractions while maintaining control. 5. Mental stimulation: Provide mental stimulation for your Beagany through puzzles, interactive toys, or activities such as agility or obedience training to prevent boredom and destructive behavior. 6. Regular exercise: Ensure your Beagle/Brittany mix receives consistent daily exercise, such as walks, runs, or play sessions, to help burn off energy and make training more effective. 7. Positive reinforcement: Use praise, treats, toys, or affection during training to encourage good behavior. Avoid harsh correction methods that can lead to fear or aggression. To answer your last question, although both questions pertain to training specific mixed breeds, they are not asking the same thing. One question focuses on training a Jack Russell/Beagle mix (Jack-A-Bee), while the other focuses on training a Beagle/Brittany mix (Beagany). However, the general principles and steps for training these dogs are similar, as both breeds share traits like intelligence and high energy levels."},{"question":"Bird city had may economic ties with Pine city. Pine city was located in the mountains, and was inhabited by nature lovers and people that protected the environment. Bird city was situated on the banks of a large river flowing into the sea. They relied mostly on conventional agriculture and used fertilizer for their crops. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which city released more human waste into the ocean? Hint: Marine pollution is a generic term for the entry into the ocean of potentially hazardous chemicals or particles. The biggest culprits are rivers and with them many agriculture fertilizer chemicals as well as livestock and human waste. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone.Marine debris, which is also known as marine litter, describes human-created waste floating in a body of water. Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter. The answer to this question is:","response":"Bird city released more human waste into the ocean."},{"question":"Concepts: cloud, come, fill, flare, sun Write a sentence that includes all these words.","response":"Step 1: Identify the subject of the sentence.

Reasoning: In Sentence A, \\"They are fighting,\\" the subject \\"they\\" refers to a group of people or beings that have the ability to fight or engage in a conflict. This is a logical statement, as it is reasonable to assume that people or animals could be fighting. In Sentence B, \\"The table is fighting,\\" the subject is an inanimate object - a table. Tables do not have the ability to fight, as they are not alive and cannot perform actions like living beings.

Here, I have provided a detailed explanation of how to hold and use a cup effectively. To properly hold and use a cup, follow these steps: 1. Choose the appropriate cup: First and foremost, select the right cup for the beverage you are planning to consume. If you're drinking hot coffee or tea, opt for a cup with a handle to protect your hands from heat. If you're sipping a cold drink, choose a glass, tumbler, or any other type of cup suitable for cold beverages. 2. Grasp the cup: Depending on the type of cup you are using, the grasping technique may vary. Here are some different ways to grasp various types of cups: a. Mug with a handle: Hold the handle with your thumb on the inside, and your remaining fingers on the outside. This provides maximum control and minimizes the risk of dropping the cup. b. Tumbler or glass without a handle: Wrap your fingers around the sides, while placing your thumb on the opposite end for support. Do not hold the cup too tightly, as this may cause discomfort and make it difficult to drink from the cup. c. Stemmed glass (e.g., wine glass): Grip the stem using your thumb and first two fingers. This method prevents your hand from warming the drink and keeps fingerprints off the glass bowl. 3. Know the etiquette: Before drinking from a cup, familiarize yourself with the appropriate etiquette. In some situations, such as tea parties or formal dinners, rules and guidelines may dictate how and when to use a cup. 4. Bring the cup to your lips: With the cup securely held in your hand, slowly lift it to your lips in a smooth motion. Ensure that the opening of the cup is positioned correctly to prevent spills. 5. Sip carefully: Begin by taking small sips, particularly if you're consuming a hot beverage. This will allow you to enjoy the drink without causing discomfort and reduce the risk of spills. For cold beverages, moderate sips are usually suitable, but be cautious not to drink too quickly and cause a brain freeze. 6. Set the cup down: After sipping from the cup, gently place it back on the surface, being mindful of the potential for spills. For stemmed glasses, pay particular attention to the fragility of the stem. 7. Maintain conversation: In social settings where cups are used, it's vital to maintain polite conversation with those around you. Be sure to engage with fellow guests while holding and using a cup, but avoid talking with a full mouth, which can lead to spills or discomfort. Throughout the process, always be mindful of your surroundings and the social etiquette involved in using a cup. By following these steps, you can ensure that you enjoy your beverage while demonstrating proper manners and skill in cup handling."},{"question":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

Question: Where does Anberber escape to?

The film reflects on the fall of Emperor Haile Selassie and on the effects of that regime change relative to Ethiopian history and society. Through a broader lens, the film Teza focuses on the ways in which political upheaval and social change have impacted cultures and nations across the larger African Diaspora.Told mainly through a series of flashbacks, Teza follows the personal narrative of Anberber, who, after leaving Ethiopia for Germany to become a doctor, is led to return to his home village by lingering spirits and haunting visions from his childhood. Using the power of memory as its primary device, Teza recounts the historical circumstances that have framed the context in which contemporary Ethiopia exists.The movie chronicles Anberber's internal struggle to stay true--both to himself and to his homeland--but above all, the film explores the possession of memory, a right that humanity mandates that each of us have--the right to own our pasts.

Answer the above question based on the context below: William Etty was born in 1787 in York, the son of a miller and baker. He showed artistic promise from an early age, but his family were financially insecure, and at the age of 12 he left school to become an apprentice printer in Hull. On completing his seven-year indenture he moved to London \\"with a few pieces of chalk-crayons in colours\\", with the aim of emulating the Old Masters and becoming a history painter. Etty gained acceptance to the Royal Academy Schools in early 1807. After a year spent studying under renowned portrait painter Thomas Lawrence, Etty returned to the Royal Academy, drawing at the life class and copying other paintings. In 1821 the Royal Academy exhibited one of Etty's works, The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia (also known as The Triumph of Cleopatra). The painting was extremely well received, and many of Etty's fellow artists greatly admired him. He was elected a full Royal Academician in 1828, ahead of John Constable. He became well respected for his ability to capture flesh tones accurately in painting and for his fascination with contrasts in skin tones. Following the exhibition of Cleopatra, Etty attempted to reproduce its success, concentrating on painting further history paintings containing nude figures. He exhibited 15 paintings at the Summer Exhibition in the 1820s (including Cleopatra), and all but one contained at least one nude figure. In so doing Etty became the first English artist to treat nude studies as a serious art form in their own right, capable of being aesthetically attractive and of delivering moral messages. Although some nudes by foreign artists were held in private English collections, Britain had no tradition of nude painting, and the display and distribution of nude material to the public had been suppressed since the 1787 Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice. The supposed prurient reaction of the lower classes to his nude paintings caused concern throughout the 19th century. Many critics condemned his repeated depictions of female nudity as...

If it is even, then it will have 2 as a factor and won't be prime. If it's not even, then I'll check for odd factors. If there are any, then again, it won't be prime. 3. 14744 is even (since it ends in a 4), which means it is divisible by 2. Therefore, it has at least three factors: 1, 2, and 14744.

Let's solve this problem step by step: First, we have the equation: 0 = -780*f - 17740 - 11900 We want to find f, so we need to get f by itself on one side of the equation. To do that, we're going to add 17740 and 11900 to both sides of the equation. Step 1: 0 + 17740 + 11900 = -780*f - 17740 + 17740 - 11900 + 11900 This simplifies to: 29640 = -780*f Now we want to get f by itself. To do that, we're going to divide both sides of the equation by -780.

The more information you have, the more likely you'll be able to stay calm when it happens. Your first period will probably be very light, and may not even look like blood. It may appear as bright red drops in your underwear, or it could be brownish and sticky. Don't worry that you will be gushing blood, either; during an average period, a woman will only lose about 1 oz. (30 ml) of blood. That's about the same amount of liquid as 2 bottles of nail polish. Talk to your mom or older sister. They may be able to give you an idea of when you will get your period. It's not always the same, but often girls begin their periods around the age as their mother or sisters did. If you can't talk to a mom or older sister, talk to a school nurse or trusted friend who has already gotten her period. When your period comes, you may notice a feeling of wetness in your underwear. You may even feel liquid flowing out of your vagina, or you may not notice anything at all. If you have a blood phobia and you're worried about how you'll react, try thinking of it this way: this isn't blood like from a wound or injury. The blood from your period is actually a sign that you're healthy. The drugstore or grocery store usually has an entire aisle dedicated to feminine hygiene products (pads, tampons, pantyliners). Don't be overwhelmed by all the choices; as you get to know your flow, you'll have a better idea of which product works best for you. To start out, look for pads that aren't too bulky or noticeable and has light or medium absorbency.. Pads are probably the easiest thing to start out with; you'll have enough to think about without worrying about how to insert a tampon. Practice putting a pad in your underwear before you have your period. If you notice discharge in your underwear, use that to figure out where the middle of the pad should be. Some websites offer coupons or even free samples or period \\"starter kits\\" for you to keep on-hand. If you'd rather use a tampon or a menstrual cup during your first period, that's completely fine. It's important that you are comfortable with whichever protection you choose. If you're embarrassed about buying pads, just go up to the register with a few other items, and busy yourself looking at candy while the cashier rings you up. Remember that the cashier really doesn't care what you are buying and it's nothing new or shocking to him or her. With all the time you spend at school, playing sports, going to friend's houses, and doing other activities, it's possible, even likely, you will get your period while you are away from home. It may give you peace of mind to know you always have a pad with you wherever you are, just in case. If you're worried about someone going through your book bag and finding your stash or things falling out, get a makeup bag or pencil case to store your period supplies. You may want to hide a pair of underwear and a resealable plastic bag in your locker in case you get your period at school and need to change your panties. You can rinse the soiled pair in cold water and put them in the bag to take home. You may also want to keep a little bottle of ibuprofen or other over-the-counter pain medication in your locker, just in case you get cramps. Just make sure your school policy allows this so you don't get in trouble. While there's no single indication that your period is arriving, you won't really know until it comes; your body may give you signs that it is preparing to menstruate. A stomach or backache, cramps in your abdomen, and sore breasts can all be signs that you are getting your period. Women can get their first periods as early as 8 and as old as 16. Most usually get theirs around the age of 11 or 12. Women usually get their periods about two years after they begin developing breasts. You may notice a thick, white discharge in your underpants up to 6 months before getting your first period. Your period usually comes after you have reached 100 pounds (7 stone). If you are underweight, this may delay your period. If you are overweight, you may begin your period sooner.

However, the most notable version is probably the recording made by the singer Merv Griffin. He released his version in the United States in 1950 and it was a massive success. His rendition sold more than three million copies worldwide and reached #1 on the Billboard charts. This version of the song also featured the Freddy Martin and His Orchestra, a popular Big Band ensemble of that era. It is worth mentioning that the unique style of the song, which blended elements of the British music hall tradition and some comedic aspects, made \\"I've Got A Lovely Bunch of Coconuts\\" a common selection for cover performances and reincarnations in various forms of media and entertainment.

Numerology is a way of using numbers to describe a person's character, and to make predictions about future life events. Numerologists use the numbers 1-9, 11 and 22 -- also known as the \\"master\\" numbers -- to help a person understand his or her personality, life goals, and destiny. Numerologists consider yourLife Path number to be the most significant because this number describes your character. To find this number, add together all the numbers in your date of birth. For example, a person born on April 25, 1985 would add the month (4), to the numbers of the date (2+5), plus the numbers of the birth year (1+9+8+5).

It can be dangerous for a kitten to be fed cold milk when it is already cold. Feel the pads of the kitten's feet and place your finger in the kitten's mouth. Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? kittens will die if they drink cold milk when they're warm Options: I. Yes; II. It's impossible to say; III. No;","response":"III. No; The statement \\"kittens will die if they drink cold milk when they're warm\\" does not directly follow from the given text. It is not accurate to conclude that kittens will die from drinking cold milk when they're warm. However, it can potentially cause digestive issues and possibly harm them if they are already cold. To elaborate further on how to feed newborn kittens commercial milk replacer, follow these detailed steps: 1. Prepare the milk replacer: Read the instructions on the commercial milk replacer package carefully and follow them to prepare the milk. This usually involves mixing the powder with warm water, and the proportions might vary according to different products. 2. Warm the milk replacer: The milk must be warmed to a suitable temperature (around 95-100°F (35-38°C)) before feeding it to the kittens, as cold milk can be harmful to them. You can use a bottle warmer or place the bottle in a bowl of warm water until the milk reaches the desired temperature. Shake the bottle gently to ensure even heat distribution. 3. Test the kitten's temperature: As mentioned earlier, make sure the kitten is not cold before feeding. If the kitten feels cold to touch, warm it up using a heating pad, warm water bottles, or by simply holding it close to your body. Keep in mind that a kitten's body temperature should be between 95-99°F (35-37°C) to ensure safe feeding. 4. Prepare the kitten for feeding: Place the kitten on its stomach on a towel or other soft surface. This will mimic the natural nursing position and help the kitten feed comfortably. 5. Use a suitable bottle and nipple: Use a bottle specifically designed for feeding kittens or a small pet nursing bottle, with a hole in the nipple that is just big enough for a steady drip when the bottle is inverted. 6. Feed the kitten: Gently insert the bottle nipple into the kitten's mouth and allow the kitten to latch on. Hold the bottle at a 45-degree angle to prevent air from entering the kitten's digestive system. Feed the kitten slowly and ensure that it is swallowing the milk. 7. Monitor the feeding amount and frequency: Newborn kittens typically need to be fed every 2-4 hours, depending on their age and size. Consult a veterinarian about the appropriate feeding schedule and amount. Maintain a feeding chart to keep track of the feedings. 8. Burp the kitten: After each feeding, gently burp the kitten by placing it against your shoulder and gently patting its back to release any trapped air in its stomach. 9. Clean the kitten: Newborn kittens require help to stimulate urination and defecation. Use a warm, wet cloth or cotton ball to gently rub the kitten's genital and anal area after each feeding. 10. Keep the kittens clean and warm: Make sure the kittens are in a clean, warm, and draft-free environment. Use a heating pad or warm water bottles to maintain a consistent temperature around the kittens. 11. Regularly visit a veterinarian: Schedule regular check-ups with a veterinarian to ensure the kittens are growing and developing properly. The veterinarian can also provide guidance for any adjustments needed in the feeding process. Remember that while feeding newborn kittens commercial milk replacer is a viable option, a mother cat's milk is always the best and most nutritious choice. Always seek professional guidance or advice from a veterinarian for the proper care of newborn kittens."},{"question":"We 're getting married~ He told my mum .

Anni Dewani, 28, from Sweden, was shot after being kidnapped while in a taxi with her husband Shrien last month. Western Cape High Court heard taxi driver Zola Tongo allege he was offered 15,000 rand (£1,400) by Mr Dewani, 31, from Bristol, to kill his wife. Mr Dewani's family described the allegations as \\"totally ludicrous\\". Tongo, 31, from Bothasig, has been jailed for 18 years after agreeing a plea bargain. He was charged with murder, kidnapping, robbery with aggravating circumstances and perverting the course of justice. Xolile Mnguni, 23, and Mziwamadoda Qwabe, 25, face charges of murder, aggravated robbery and kidnapping. Jewellery stolen The BBC's southern Africa correspondent Karen Allen said the claims were made by Tongo as part of the plea bargain agreement with the State. She said: \\"His allegations will have to be tested at trial where he's expected to appear as a state witness. \\"Meanwhile Zola Tongo has been sentenced to 18 years in prison with immediate effect. It's not yet clear if and when Shrien Dewani will be extradited to South Africa to face trial.\\" Mrs Dewani was kidnapped while the taxi was travelling through Gugulethu township near Cape Town on 13 November. The court heard Tongo drove the couple from Cape Town International Airport to the five-star Cape Grace hotel when they arrived in the city. In his formal admission, Tongo said: \\"After we arrived at the hotel, Shrien Dewani approached me alone and asked me if I knew anyone that could 'have a client of his taken off the scene'. \\"After some discussion with him, I understood that he wanted someone, a woman, killed. \\"Shrien Dewani said he had US dollars and could pay in US dollars.\\" Image caption Taxi driver Zola Tongo negotiated a plea bargain The court heard Tongo spoke to a friend about arranging a hitman later that day. He was put in touch with Mr Mnguni and Mr Qwabe, both from the Khayelitsha township, the court was told. \\"We agreed that Shrien Dewani and I would be ejected from the vehicle and that the female occupant had to be killed,\\" Tongo told the court. The court heard that Tongo sent a text message to Mr Dewani as they drove through Cape Town, reminding him not to forget about the money. A reply informed him it was stashed in an envelope behind the front passenger seat. 'Wholly innocent' Mrs Dewani's body was found inside the abandoned taxi on 14 November. Her wristwatch, a white-gold and diamond bracelet, her handbag and her mobile phone were stolen. The couple had been married for two weeks. Following his wife's death, Mr Dewani, from Westbury-on-Trym in Bristol, said that after dinner in a suburb and a walk on the beach, the couple had got into a taxi to head back to Cape Town. He said on the way Mrs Dewani said she would like to see some of the \\"real South Africa\\" and the taxi driver left the motorway and headed towards Gugulethu township. Two miles outside the township the vehicle was carjacked by armed men. Responding to Tongo's claims, Mr Dewani's family said: \\"Shrien is wholly innocent of any involvement in this heinous crime. Grief counselling \\"These allegations are totally ludicrous, extremely convenient for South Africa and very hurtful to a young man who is grieving the loss of the woman he loved, his chosen life partner. \\"The South African police have not even sought to speak to Mr Dewani regarding the allegations. Instead two weeks has been spent 'negotiating' this confession from the taxi driver whilst the others accused have complained of torture and forced confessions.\\" Media caption Mrs Dewani's father, Vinod Hindocha, expressed gratitude for the support he has received in South Africa and around the world Publicist Max Clifford, who has been acting on behalf of Mr Dewani, described Mr Tongo's claim as the latest in a string of false allegations against him. He said the Dewani family had tried to contact the South African police to find out why the accusations were happening despite a police statement saying Shrien Dewani was not a suspect. He said efforts by the family, the British High Commission and Mr Dewani's lawyers in South Africa to contact the police had failed. Mr Clifford said: \\"The South African police haven't contacted him, accused him of anything at all. There's been no contact from them or the South African prosecutors, even though we read in the papers that they've been questioning him daily.\\" On the possibility of Mr Dewani being extradited, he said: \\"We will be advised by the lawyers who are talking to the South African authorities or will be when they respond to their calls.\\" He said his client, who returned to the UK soon after his wife's death, had received trauma and grief counselling. Speaking outside the court, Mrs Dewani's father, Vinod Hindocha, said: \\"I would like to say thank you to the South African people for the support and thank you for the whole world for the condolence messages to our family.\\" A spokesman for South Africa's national prosecuting office said a bid to request Mr Dewani's extradition was \\"a matter that is likely to be considered\\" as part of continuing investigations. \\"Based on what happened in court today, obviously the investigations are going to intensify,\\" he said. Mr Mnguni and Mr Qwabe are due to appear before Wynberg Regional Court on 25 February before a full trial at Western Cape High Court at a later date. ||||| He surrendered himself at a Bristol police station and was arrested at 22.38 on Tuesday under a Provisional Arrest Warrant issued earlier on the same evening, on suspicion of conspiring to murder Mrs Dewani. He is accused of conspiring with others to murder Mrs Dewani on 13 November. He is due to appear in custody at City of Westminster Magistrates' Court this afternoon. The businessman faces being extradited to South Africa after prosecutors there claimed he had offered to pay to have his wife murdered on their honeymoon. Mr Dewani, 30, allegedly offered a taxi driver £1,400 to arrange for his new wife Anni, 28, to be shot dead in a staged carjacking in a township, according to claims outlined by a prosecutor. Mr Dewani, who owns a chain of care homes, dismissed the accusations as \\"ludicrous\\". Mr Dewani, from Bristol, and his Swedish-born bride were honeymooning in South Africa, following a \\"fairy tale\\" wedding in India, when the attack happened on November 13. They were travelling through Gugulethu, a township, when they were ambushed by two men who appeared to threaten their driver, Zola Tongo, and order him out of the car before also ejecting Mr Dewani. Mrs Dewani was found shot dead in the back of the car several hours later. On Tuesday, in a dramatic twist in the case, prosecutors publicly accepted a signed confession from Tongo that was agreed as part of a plea bargain deal in which he admitted murder, aggravated robbery and kidnapping. With Mrs Dewani's father, Vinod Hindocha, and other relatives who had flown in from Sweden, looking on, Rodney de Kock, the Western Cape director of public prosecutions, said Mr Dewani had orchestrated the murder. He told Judge President John Hlophe: \\"The alleged hijacking was in fact not a hijacking, but part of a plan of subterfuge which Shrien Dewani, the husband of the deceased, and the accused had designed to conceal the true facts, to wit: that the deceased was murdered at the instance of her husband.\\" Reading a lengthy confession signed by Tongo, who sat in the dock with his head buried in his hands throughout, he outlined how Mr Dewani allegedly offered the driver 15,000 rand (£1,379) to plan and carry out the \\"hit\\". \\"The hijacking would be simulated,\\" the confession claims. \\"The agreement was that after the 'hijacking' of the vehicle, both Shrien Dewani and I would be ejected from the vehicle unharmed, after which the deceased would be murdered. \\"The kidnapping and robbery were part of the plan to make it appear that this was a random criminal act, unconnected to Shrien Dewani.” Tongo claimed that Mr Dewani sent him a text message while he was driving saying that the fee was hidden behind a seat. But Mr de Kock offered no evidence for the allegations other than the signed confession and no suggestion of a possible motive. Tongo was jailed for 18 years for his role in the killing as part of the deal, avoiding a likely life sentence with little chance of parole for at least 25 years. He will give evidence at the trials of Xolile Mngeni, 23, and Mzwamadoda Qwabe, 25. Tongo alleges he helped recruit them to carry out the carjacking. They are accused of murder, kidnapping and aggravated robbery. Mr Dewani’s spokesman, Max Clifford, described the allegations as “outrageous” and said that, while he had been warned to expect the latest turn of events, he was “devastated”. He said South African police had ignored Mr Dewani’s requests for information about the claims against him. “At the moment there is no reason for him to go there. He can’t even contact the South African police,” he said. “Let the South African police contact him to explain and also reveal what evidence there is to substantiate these accusations from a man who had admitted his part in a murder.” Friends of Mr Dewani have said that he is being “stitched up” as a suspect. They claim that the South African authorities are trying to “muddy the water” by making the incident appear as more complex than a tourist hijacking. South Africa’s Congress of Trade Unions issued a statement that illustrated the relief many South Africans felt that the incident was allegedly planned by a foreigner. “Let us hope that the swift and efficient way in which this case has been dealt with, and the fact that it is now becoming clear that it was planned by a non-South African, will help to restore the country’s reputation,” it said. Last week, Mr Dewani’s South African lawyer, Billy Gundelfinger, withdrew from the case. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","response":"A South African taxi driver, Zola Tongo, has claimed that Shrien Dewani, the husband of Anni Dewani, who was murdered on her honeymoon in South Africa, plotted his wife's death.

What Murray does land for Bobby is a full week headlining the grand opening of the world's first Glatt Kosher hotel-casino, Mazel Hotel.

Without blood, organs will be deprived of essential resources and begin to die. - (C) brain cells: Brain cells, like all other cells in the body, need blood to function. Lack of blood flow to the brain can lead to cell death and severe neurological damage. - (E) humans: Humans rely on blood to transport nutrients, oxygen, and waste products throughout the body. Without blood, vital processes cannot occur, and human life would not be sustainable. - (G) critical organs: Critical organs such as the heart, lungs, and brain require a constant supply of blood to function. When blood supply is cut off, these organs can rapidly fail, causing death. Other options do not necessarily require the direct supply of blood as follows: - (A) plants: Plants do not have blood circulation systems like animals. They rely on the vascular transport system to transport nutrients, water, and carbohydrates. - (D) athletes: Although athletes are humans and need blood to survive, referring to them specifically in their athletic capacity could imply a focus on their performance. They may suffer reduced performance without proper blood supply but will not die merely because of being an athlete. - (F) species: This is a broad term that includes all living organisms, including plants and fungi. Some organisms within this category rely on blood for survival, while others do not. - (H) mushrooms: Mushrooms are fungi, not animals, and do not have a circulatory system containing blood.

The answer is:","response":"The actress who portrayed Lois Lane and starred in Quackser Fortune Has a Cousin in the Bronx is Margot Kidder. Margot Kidder, a talented and versatile actress, is best known for her iconic role as Lois Lane in the Superman film series, opposite Christopher Reeve. Born on October 17, 1948, in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, Canada, Margot Kidder began her career in the late 1960s with a few TV appearances before transitioning to film roles in the 1970s. Kidder rose to prominence in her role as Lois Lane, the tenacious and fearless reporter of the Daily Planet who captured the heart of the superhero, Superman. Her performance as Lois Lane began with the 1978 film Superman: The Movie, which was directed by Richard Donner and produced by Alexander and Ilya Salkind. She reprised her role in the film's three sequels, Superman II (1980), Superman III (1983), and Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987), delighting fans of the comic book character and establishing herself as a household name. Before her success as Lois Lane, Margot Kidder starred in the 1970 film Quackser Fortune Has a Cousin in the Bronx, which was directed by Waris Hussein and also featured Gene Wilder. In this film, Kidder played the role of Zazel Pierce, an American exchange student studying in Dublin who forms a relationship with the titular character, Quackser Fortune (played by Gene Wilder). This quirky, romantic comedy was one of Kidder's earliest film roles and showcased her ability to play diverse characters. Throughout her career, Margot Kidder appeared in numerous films and TV shows, including the suspenseful thriller Sisters (1972), directed by Brian De Palma, and the popular horror film The Amityville Horror (1979), based on the supposedly true events that took place in a haunted house. She also made guest appearances in various television series such as Law & Order: Special Victims Unit and The L Word. Moreover, Margot Kidder was an advocate for mental health issues, having experienced bipolar disorder herself. She spoke openly about her experiences, and after facing a highly-publicized mental health crisis in the 1990s, she used her celebrity status to become an outspoken advocate for mental health awareness and treatment. Sadly, Margot Kidder passed away on May 13, 2018, at the age of 69, leaving behind a legacy in the film industry and activism. Her contributions to the world of entertainment, as well as her staunch advocacy for mental health, continue to be remembered and celebrated today."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Pick one category for the following text.

The magic trick that the magician performed involved more ribbons than hats, because the","response":"magician believed that the visual and dynamic nature of ribbons created a more engaging and captivating experience for the audience, whereas the static and limited versatility of hats made for a less exciting and memorable spectacle. In the world of magic, performers are constantly searching for innovative ways to mesmerize their audience, and variety in their acts is essential to maintaining interest and curiosity. From the magician's perspective, ribbons offer a wide range of possibilities for creative expression and manipulation that hats may not. Firstly, ribbons are highly customizable – they can be found in a multitude of colors, patterns, and materials. This allows a magician to tailor their act to specific themes or moods, taking into account the preferences and expectations of their audience. For instance, vibrant, colorful ribbons might be used during a children's birthday party, while elegant and sophisticated patterns could be incorporated into a corporate event performance. Secondly, ribbons provide an excellent medium for visual storytelling. The magician can weave intricate stories and illusions by intertwining ribbons, making shapes, and employing various movements, such as stretching, twisting, and tying. The fluidity and flexible nature of ribbons enables them to be manipulated with dexterity and grace, which is incredibly stimulating to watch. Additionally, ribbons can be utilized in numerous types of magic tricks, from classic \\"pulling a ribbon out of the magician’s thumb\\" tricks, to more complicated and awe-inspiring illusions involving levitation or transformation. Ribbons can also be combined with other magic props, such as cards or wands, to craft even more powerful acts. This versatility means that incorporating ribbons in magic acts can add an extra layer of depth, making the performance more enthralling for spectators. On the other hand, hats, while traditional props in magic, are inherently limited by their fixed shape and size. Although they can still serve as integral components in famous tricks, such as \\"pulling a rabbit out of a hat\\" or \\"making coins appear from an empty top hat,\\" the range of tricks that can be performed with hats alone is markedly less extensive than that of ribbons. In conclusion, the magician chose to perform a trick involving more ribbons than hats because they recognized the enchanting appeal ribbons can bring to a performance: their customizability, storytelling potential, and versatility in various types of illusions. While hats have their own unique charm, in this particular case, the magician wanted to create a more memorable and engaging experience for the audience by focusing on the alluring qualities of ribbons."},{"question":"Which is this about?

No further progress was made until the 1970s. Pierre Fresnault-Deruelle then took a semiotics approach to the study of comics, analyzing text–image relations, page-level image relations, and image discontinuities, or what Scott McCloud later dubbed \\"closure\\". In 1987, Henri Vanlier introduced the term multicadre, or \\"multiframe\\", to refer to the comics a page as a semantic unit. By the 1990s, theorists such as Benoît Peeters and Thierry Groensteen turned attention to artists' poïetic creative choices. Thierry Smolderen and Harry Morgan have held relativistic views of the definition of comics, a medium that has taken various, equally valid forms over its history. Morgan sees comics as a subset of \\"les littératures dessinées\\" (or \\"drawn literatures\\"). French theory has come to give special attention to the page, in distinction from American theories such as McCloud's which focus on panel-to-panel transitions. Since the mid-2000s, Neil Cohn has begun analyzing how comics are understood using tools from cognitive science, extending beyond theory by using actual psychological and neuroscience experiments. This work has argued that sequential images and page layouts both use separate rule-bound \\"grammars\\" to be understood that extend beyond panel-to-panel transitions and categorical distinctions of types of layouts, and that the brain's comprehension of comics is similar to comprehending other domains, such as language and music.

The survey comes after it emerged that two pilots on an Airbus passenger plane were asleep at the same time, with the aircraft being flown on autopilot. Balpa is campaigning against changes to flight-time regulations, which are to be voted on by the European Parliament. On Monday, new rules which include allowing pilots to land an aircraft after being awake 22 hours, as well as being able to work seven early starts in a row rather than the current three, will be put to a vote. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) supports the proposals and said the incident on 13 August where both pilots were asleep was an isolated one. In that case, a report found the pair fell asleep after both had only five hours sleep in the previous two nights. But of the 500 commercial pilots surveyed by Balpa, 43% said they believed their abilities had been compromised at least once a month in the last six months by tiredness, with 84% saying it had been compromised at some stage during the past six months. And 49% said pilot tiredness was the biggest threat to flight safety - three times more than any other threat. The union said its members, who were the pilots that were surveyed, overwhelmingly worked for British-based airlines. Balpa wants MEPs to back a motion which would require the European Commission (EC) to withdraw the proposed changes and to have them scrutinised by scientific and medical experts. Its general secretary Jim McAuslan told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the EC was trying to get a level playing field across Europe but it had instead diluted UK standards. \\"This is deeply worrying for everyone concerned. \\"The CAA has been completely complacent about these rules (for pilots to report sleeping incidents). \\"It suggests to us that they are ignoring this problem.

The survey comes amid concerns regarding proposed changes to flight-time regulations, which Balpa is campaigning against. The new rules, which are to be voted on by the European Parliament, include allowing pilots to land after being awake for 22 hours and working seven early starts in a row. Balpa is calling for the proposed changes to be withdrawn and scrutinized by scientific and medical experts. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) supports the proposals and maintains that they will increase safety for UK passengers traveling on some other European airlines."},{"question":"Write highlights for this article: By.

Holly Durst and Michael Stagliano decided that the best chance for both of them to find love would be by joining forces and using their insider knowledge on \\"Bachelor\\" nation. Together, they began hosting events where past contestants from various seasons of the franchise could meet, mingle, and potentially find romance among fellow alums who understood their unique experiences. One such event was a charity function where DeAnna Pappas and Stephen Stagliano, Michael's twin brother, happened to be in attendance. As fate would have it, sparks flew between DeAnna and Stephen, with both feeling an instant connection that seemed to transcend their reality TV pasts. Over the following months, DeAnna and Stephen spent time getting to know each other away from the cameras that had brought them together in the first place. Their relationship flourished as they discovered shared values, goals, and a genuine love for one another. Finally, in 2010, the couple announced their engagement, much to the delight of their friends, families, and \\"Bachelor\\" fans worldwide. DeAnna and Stephen tied the knot in a beautiful, intimate ceremony in 2011, surrounded by their loved ones and free from the pressures of reality television. Today, DeAnna and Stephen Stagliano are proud parents of two children, Austin and Addison, and continue to be strong proponents of love and second chances. Since then, more \\"Bachelor\\" and \\"Bachelorette\\" contestants have found love through these connections made outside of their respective shows, some even attending Holly and Michael's match-making events. This heartwarming trend among reality TV alums demonstrates that true love can sometimes be found when the cameras stop rolling and the media frenzy dies down. While these contestants may have initially been searching for love on television, many have been fortunate enough to find it through the friendships and connections they formed during their time on the show. So, in the end, it seems that famous television franchises such as \\"The Bachelor\\" and \\"The Bachelorette\\" can still provide a chance for real love to blossom, even if it occurs outside the carefully staged rose ceremonies and epic fantasy dates. As more and more contestants step away from the limelight and into the real world, they're discovering that love can be found in the most unexpected places, and sometimes, the best matches aren't determined by a final rose but by the heart."},{"question":"This article: The film is set in the home of a mad scientist called Professor Noodle.

For now, just go and turn on the shower. Get the water nice and warm and think about how good it would feel to climb inside. You'll probably find it much easier to shower once you're actually in the bathroom and have everything all ready to go. The hardest part often lies in simply taking the first step. Remember, the only thing holding you back is lethargy. With that out of the way, nothing can stop you. At this point, it will probably feel silly to have gone to all that trouble just to shut off the water and put your clothes back on. Since you're already in position, and it requires just as much effort to get dressed again, you might as well go ahead and hop in the shower. When you're lounging comfortably on the couch, the list of things you need to do to successfully bathe can seem overwhelming. Instead of trying to focus on lots of details at once, move things along a little at a time. If you find that you lack the motivation to shower, it can be helpful to keep in mind what happens when you don't bathe regularly. Dirt, oil and dead cells can build up on your skin, making you feel grimy and uncomfortable. If you go too long, this can cause problems like itching, clogged pores and skin infections. After a while, you can start to smell, as well, which can be a source of social embarrassment. It can be bad for you to go too long without a bath or shower. Skin conditions like acne, dermatitis and chronic body odor can develop, making you look and feel unhealthy. There's no need to shower every day. In fact, dermatologists now believe that it's actually better for you to only shower a few times a week. This may make dealing with the task easier for you.

If Damien picks 3/5 of the fruits from the trees, calculate the total number of plums and apples remaining on the tree if there were 180 apples on the apple tree before Damien picked any of the fruits. Let's answer step by step:","response":"To find the answer step by step, we'll go through the following calculations: 1. Calculate the number of plums on the plum tree. 2. Calculate the total number of fruits before Damien picks any. 3. Calculate the number of fruits Damien picks. 4. Calculate the remaining number of apples and plums. Step 1: Calculate the number of plums on the plum tree. Given that an apple tree has three times as many apples as the number of plums on a plum tree, and there are 180 apples on the apple tree: Number of plums = (Number of apples) / 3 Number of plums = 180 / 3 Number of plums = 60 There are 60 plums on the plum tree. Step 2: Calculate the total number of fruits before Damien picks any. Total number of fruits = Number of apples + Number of plums Total number of fruits = 180 + 60 Total number of fruits = 240 There are 240 fruits in total before Damien picks any. Step 3: Calculate the number of fruits Damien picks. Given Damien picks 3/5 of the fruits, the number of fruits he picks is: Fruits picked = (3/5) * Total number of fruits Fruits picked = (3/5) * 240 Fruits picked = 144 Damien picked 144 fruits. Step 4: Calculate the remaining number of apples and plums. The remaining total fruits = Total number of fruits - Fruits picked The remaining total fruits = 240 - 144 The remaining total fruits = 96 Out of the remaining 96 fruits, we need to find how many are apples and how many are plums. Since the ratio of apples to plums is 3:1, we will divide the remaining fruits in this ratio. Fruits are divided into 4 parts (3 parts apples + 1 part plums): Each part = Total remaining fruits / 4 Each part = 96 / 4 Each part = 24 Now, let's calculate the remaining apples and plums. Remaining apples = 3 parts = 3 * 24 = 72 Remaining plums = 1 part = 1 * 24 = 24 After Damien picks 3/5 of the fruits, there are 72 apples and 24 plums remaining on the trees."},{"question":"Generate a 5-star review (1 being lowest and 5 being highest) about an app with package com.shahul3d.indiasatelliteweather.

Could you help me answer this question? If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\". Plot title: Perfume: The Story of a Murderer Movie plot: The film begins with the sentencing of Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (Ben Whishaw), a notorious murderer. Between the reading of the sentence and the execution, the story of his life is told in flashback, beginning with his abandonment at birth in a French fish market. Raised in an orphanage, Grenouille grows into a strangely detached boy with a superhuman sense of smell. After growing to maturity as a tanner's apprentice, he makes his first delivery to Paris, where he revels in the new odors. He focuses on the scent of a kindly girl selling plums (Karoline Herfurth) and startles her with his behavior. To prevent her from crying out, he covers the girl's mouth and unintentionally suffocates her. After realizing that she is dead, he strips her body naked and smells her until the scent fades.Afterwards, Grenouille becomes haunted by the desire to preserve the woman's scent forever. After making a delivery to a perfume shop, Grenouille amazes the Italian owner, Giuseppe Baldini (Dustin Hoffman), with his ability to create fragrances. He revitalizes the perfumer's career with new formulas, demanding only that Baldini teach him how to convert scents into perfume. Baldini explains that all perfumes are harmonies of twelve individual scents, and may contain a theoretical thirteenth scent. He also tells a story about a perfume discovered in an Egyptian tomb that was so perfect that it caused everyone in the entire world to briefly believe they were in paradise the moment the bottle was opened.When Grenouille discovers that Baldini's method of distillation will not capture the scents of all objects, such as iron chains and dead animals, he becomes depressed. After receiving a letter of presentation written by Baldini, Grenouille leaves to learn a different method in Grasse. En route to Grasse, Grenouille realises that he has no scent of his own, and is therefore a cipher.

Where is a stool likely to be found? Options: - internet cafe - blacksmith's shop - office - bar - building","response":"To determine where a stool is likely to be found, we can evaluate each option and consider the typical features and functions of each location. 1. Internet cafe: While some internet cafes might have stools as seating options, they often prioritize comfort for users who might spend extended periods in front of computers, suggesting that chairs might be more common. 2. Blacksmith's shop: Stools could be found in a blacksmith's shop, particularly if it has a space for a blacksmith to sit during breaks or while discussing projects with customers. However, blacksmiths generally need to stand and move around in their work, so stools might not be as common. 3. Office: Office spaces can vary in their design, and stools might be present in some areas such as at a high desk or as temporary seating for meetings. However, office chairs with proper back support are generally more common. 4. Bar: Bars typically have a counter or high tables where patrons sit to have drinks and socialize. Stools are a common type of seating in this setting due to their compact size and ability to accommodate a larger number of patrons. 5. Building: This option is too vague, as it could refer to any structure. Without more context, it's hard to determine the likelihood of finding a stool in a generic building. Based on this evaluation, it seems that a stool is most likely to be found in a bar due to the common presence of counter seating and high tables that accommodate this type of furniture."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Title: Practical Information on Shotgunning by an expert!

When Solti accepted the orchestra's second invitation it was agreed that Giulini should be appointed to share the conducting. Both conductors signed three-year contracts with the orchestra, effective from 1969.One of the members of the Chicago Symphony described it to Solti as \\"the best provincial orchestra in the world.\\" Many players remained from its celebrated decade under Reiner, but morale was low, and the orchestra was 5m in debt. Solti concluded that it was essential to raise the orchestra's international profile. He ensured that it was engaged for many of his Decca sessions, and he and Giulini led it in a European tour in 1971, playing in ten countries. It was the first time in its 80-year history that the orchestra had played outside of North America. The orchestra received plaudits from European critics, and was welcomed home at the end of the tour with a ticker-tape parade.The orchestra's principal flute player, Donald Peck, commented that the relationship between a conductor and an orchestra is difficult to explain: \\"some conductors get along with some orchestras and not others. We had a good match with Solti and he with us.\\" Peck's colleague, the violinist Victor Aitay said, \\"Usually conductors are relaxed at rehearsals and tense at the concerts. Solti is the reverse.

Answer the above question based on the context below: The Creed family—Louis, Rachel, and their children Ellie and Gage—move from Chicago to rural Ludlow, Maine, after Louis is offered a job as a doctor with the University of Maine. They befriend their elderly neighbor Jud Crandall, who takes them to an isolated pet cemetery (misspelled \\"sematary\\") in the forest behind the Creed's new home. On his first day at work, Louis encounters Victor Pascow, a jogger who has been mortally injured after being hit by a truck. He warns Louis about the pet cemetery before he dies, calling Louis by name despite the fact they have not previously met. That night, Pascow comes to Louis as a ghost and leads him to the Pet Sematary, warning him not to cross the barrier because the ground beyond is \\"sour\\". Louis awakens, assuming it was a dream, but notices his feet are covered in dirt. During Thanksgiving while the family is gone, Ellie's cat, Church, is run down on the highway. Realizing that Ellie will be devastated, Jud takes Louis beyond the cemetery and deep into the woods, where they reach an ancient Micmac burial ground. Jud instructs Louis to bury the cat and warns him not to tell anyone else about what they have done. The next day a reanimated Church returns to the house, a shell of what he was before; he stinks, moves sluggishly, and is vicious towards Louis. Jud explains that as a boy he himself revived his beloved pet dog in the Micmac ground, and that although the cat might be different, it will save Ellie the grief of losing her favorite pet. Sometime later, the young Gage is killed by a truck along the same highway. The family is devastated, and Jud anticipates that Louis is considering burying his son in the Micmac ground, although Louis denies it. Jud believes that introducing Louis to the ritual ground aroused the malevolent forces present there, which caused Gage's death. Answer:","response":"In the given context, it is Ellie's cat, Church, who is vicious towards Louis after being reanimated. Church becomes a shell of what he was before, stinking, moving sluggishly, and displaying vicious behavior towards Louis after being buried in the Micmac burial ground."},{"question":"What is a shorter version of this: after a tense four-hour meeting with president nicolas sarkozy of france , russia 's president , dmitri a. medvedev , announced monday that russia agreed to withdraw its troops by mid-october from its positions in georgia outside the breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia .

Today, we are going to talk about how much money Vick paid his agent between the years 2010 and 2012. First, let's understand who these people are. Vick is a famous sports player who makes a lot of money. Just like you have a favorite superhero, many people like to watch Vick play. Now, his agent is like a helper that takes care of important things for Vick, like talking to people who want Vick to play for their teams. To thank the agent for their help, Vick gives them some money. Now, to know the exact amount Vick paid between 2010 and 2012, we would need to find specific information about their agreements. This information is usually private, which means it's a secret between Vick and his agent. But don't worry! We can still learn something from this. You see, agents often get a portion of the money that sports players earn, and this portion is called a percentage. It's a way to show their share, just like how you share your toys with your friends. Usually, the agents get around 3% to 5% of the money the players get from their team. To find out how much Vick paid his agent during that time, we need two things: 1. Vick's earnings (or how much money he got from playing) between 2010 and 2012. 2. The agent's percentage that was agreed upon by Vick and his agent. Sadly, we don't have that specific information, but now you know how it works! It's always interesting to learn about how people work together and share their earnings. Maybe you can try finding more about your favorite sports players and their agents. Remember to always enjoy learning new things and share your knowledge with others, just like we shared this little explanation today!"},{"question":"Answer the following question: FINAL EXAM Question 1.

Article: Ice sculpting is a difficult process . First , ice must be carefully selected so that it is suitable for sculpting . Its ideal material is pure , clean water with high clarity . It should also have the minimum(=least) number of air bubbles. Perfectly clear ice blocks weighing 140 kg and measuring 100 cmx50 cmx25 cm are available from the Clinebell Company in Colorado . Much larger clear blocks are produced in Europe and Canada or harvested from a frozen river in Sweden . These large ice blocks are used for large ice sculpting events and for building ice hotels. Another difficulty in the process of ice sculpting is time control . The temperature of the environment affects how quickly the piece must be completed to avoid the effects of melting . If the sculpting does not take place in a cold environment , then the sculptor must work quickly to finish his piece . The tools used for sculpting also affect when the task can be finished . Some sculptures can be completed in as little as ten minutes if power tools are used . Ice sculptors also use sharp chisels that are specifically designed for cutting ice . The best ice chisels are made in Japan , a country that , along with China , has a long tradition of magnificent ice sculptures . Ice sculptures are used as decorations in some cuisines , especially in Asia . When holding a dinner party , some large restaurants or hotels will use an ice sculpture to decorate the table .

Understand the Component of the Input: The input seems to refer to a song titled 'Whatever You Like' by rapper T.I. However, judging sentiment on this phrase is complex, as it needs additional context provided by natural language or human interaction. As is, it appears neutral since it directly refers to song title and artist without additional context. 2. Apply Descriptive Sentiment Analysis: In descriptive sentiment analysis, a given text is evaluated based on its overall tone or mood. Here, the tone or mood is difficult to measure since the comment is neutral and devoid of any sentiment-related words. There are no particular words that express happiness, sadness, anger, etc. 3. Influence of Context: In absence of any contextual reference and assuming the entity 'T.I.- whatever you like' is being perceived positively by the user (considering the song was well-received and hit on the charts), the sentiment could be mildly positive. However, without specific context, it would be a guess rather than a certainty. Justification: It is quite challenging to accurately measure the sentiment of such input devoid of clear sentiment words or without additional context. The words themselves do not hold a positive or negative connotation, they simply name an artist and a song. Hence, in such cases, an assumption of neutrality is usually considered the safest until additional context can be provided."},{"question":"The museum consists of a main information room , a restoration hangar , the new hangar Texas Flying Legends and the Oswin H.

As it stands, the statement is unfinished, and the sentiment appears to be ambiguous. The term \\"modestly made\\" suggests that the movie has a modest budget, a limited scope, or a simplistic approach. This expression could hold either a positive or negative sentiment, depending on the movie's genre and the expectations of the reviewer. For instance, a viewer may appreciate a modestly made film due to its simplicity or focus on storytelling over visual effects. On the other hand, the same term could be used as a critique if the movie lacked a level of refinement or extravagance expected by the audience. However, the presence of the word \\"but\\" implies a contrast or contradiction in the reviewer's opinion. It suggests that the reviewer has more to say about the film, which may alter or clarify the sentiment expressed in the initial part of the sentence. This additional context is crucial in establishing a more accurate assessment of the reviewer's sentiment. To summarize, the sentiment of the given statement cannot be definitively classified as positive, negative, or neutral without complete context or a finished sentence. The phrase \\"a modestly made but\\" is inherently ambiguous, and further information is necessary for a proper evaluation of the reviewer's opinion."},{"question":"Denny asked: Given the sentence \\"A little girl grasps her hands while sitting on a green and white striped towel in a grassy field.\\" is it true that \\"A little girl doing her hair while looking in a mirror.\\"?.

Photograph: Paul Mcfegan/Sportsphoto Ltd/Allstar José Mourinho has won the Champions League, the Uefa Cup, the Premier League, the Primeira Liga, La Liga, Seria A, the FA Cup, the Copa del Rey, the Coppa Italia and the Taça de Portugal, so there can be no doubting that his methods win trophies. The man is an achiever. But, in light of the money he has spent and the players he has coached, should he not aim a little higher than to simply win at all costs? Should he not pick teams that try to dominate matches rather than encouraging his team to surrender possession and wait for the opposition to make mistakes? Mourinho described Chelsea's performance against Liverpool as \\"fantastic\\", taking satisfaction from the way his players made \\"no mistakes\\". Brendan Rodgers gave Chelsea some credit for their victory but was less gushing in his praise: \\"It is totally opposite to how we want to play. It is not difficult to coach, putting 10 players on the edge of the 18-yard box. They got booked for time-wasting in the 92nd minute but I think everyone could see from the first whistle that was their plan – to frustrate.\\" Perhaps Rodgers was a little naive. His team only needed a draw but he sent them out to attack and chase the match. The mistake that changed the match came when Steven Gerrard looked up to pick out an attacking pass. The Liverpool captain gazed over his offensive options and allowed the ball to slide below his studs and into the path of Demba Ba, who was able to pounce on the error, saunter towards the Liverpool goal and sweep the ball through Simon Mongolet's legs to give Chelsea the lead. Maybe Rodgers should have backed off Chelsea and let Mourinho's team have the ball. Perhaps he should have played for the nil-nil draw that would have taken his team beyond the reach of Manchester City. But that is not how he has build this wave of momentum and that is not how you carry a team from seventh to within touching distance of winning the league for the first time in a generation. Rodgers has over-achieved this season by believing that fortune favours the brave. The pragmatists may yet have the last laugh at his foolhardy approach. Maybe Rodgers will become the new Kevin Keegan – the managerial nearlyman whose gung-ho tactics were intoxicating but ultimately flawed – but at least he has given his players and fans something to love, rather than something to admire. Mourinho's approach to football has won him trophies (until this season), but his tactical plan for dealing with tough opponents is hard to love. Diego Torres, the El Pais journalist who followed Mourinho closely during his spell at Real Madrid, reports in his controversial biography The Special One that Mourinho's way of dealing with talented attacking teams was to play reactive football. He could call upon Cristiano Ronaldo, Karim Benzema, Mesut Özil and half a team of World Cup winners but, when the biggest matches came along, he reportedly asked his players to give up the ball, minimise their mistakes and take advantage of the opposition's errors. Torres reports that Mourinho had a seven-fold plan to deal with talented attacking teams: 1. The game is won by the team who commits fewer errors2. Football favours whoever provokes more errors in the opposition3. Away from home, instead of trying to be superior to the opposition, it's better to encourage their mnistakes4. Whoever has the ball is more likely to make a mistake5. Whoever renounces possession reduces the possibility of making a mistake6. Whoever has the ball has fear7. Whoever does not have it is therefore stronger. Mourinho, the man who lectured Sam Allardyce about West Ham's defensive tactics and chastised a ballboy for wasting time at Selhurst Park, prioritises defence over attack. His tactics will probably not win him the Premier League, but they were enough to beat Liverpool and they could help Chelsea see off Atlético Madrid. But should he aim higher? What are the most important parts of this text?","response":"The most important parts of this text discuss José Mourinho's tactics and achievements as a football coach, particularly focusing on whether he should adopt more adventurous tactics at Chelsea. The text highlights his numerous accomplishments and trophy wins, but also questions if his defensive and reactive style of play is enough to win the Premier League. The text also contrasts Mourinho's tactics with those of Brendan Rodgers, who is known for a more attacking style.

Can you help me answer a few questions? If you can't, please say \\"No I can't\\". Question: Where was Swagger's home located? Movie title: Shooter Movie plot: Bob Lee Swagger reluctantly leaves a self-imposed exile from his isolated mountain home in the Wind River Range at the request of Colonel Isaac Johnson, who appeals to him to help track down an assassin who is planning to shoot the president. Johnson gives him a list of three cities where the President is scheduled to visit and Swagger assesses a site in Philadelphia as the most likely. This turns out to be a set-up; while Swagger is working with Johnson's agents to find the rumored assassin, the Ethiopian archbishop is instead shot while standing next to the president. Swagger is then shot twice by a city police officer, but manages to escape. The agents tell the police that Swagger is the shooter and stage a manhunt for the injured sniper. However, he meets a rookie FBI special agent, Nick Memphis, disarms him, and steals his car. After his escape, Swagger takes refuge with Sarah Fenn, widow of his late spotter and close friend, killed years before in a mission in Africa. He later convinces her to help him contact Memphis with information on the conspiracy. Memphis is blamed for Swagger's escape and is informed that he will face disciplinary review, but argues that, given Swagger's training and experience, it is surprising that the president survived and the archbishop standing several feet away was killed. He independently learns that Swagger may have been framed for the assassination and is further made suspicious when he learns that the officer who shot Swagger was himself shot dead just hours later in a \\"mugging\\". When the agents realize their secret is compromised, they kidnap Memphis and attempt to stage his suicide. Swagger tails them and kills the captors. The two then join forces and visit a firearms expert who provides information on the FBI's ballistics report and a short list of people capable of taking a shot from a distance of one mile or more. Armed with this, they plot to capture the ex-sniper, whom they think is the real assassin. Once they find him, he commits suicide after revealing that...

Tweet:Can I skip the next 2 weeks and just go home now? plz?","response":"The sentiment of the given tweet can be interpreted as a mix of impatience, tiredness, and longing for comfort. It seems that the person tweeting wants to fast-forward the next two weeks to return home and seeks respite from whatever is causing them distress during this period. The impatience and tiredness sentiment is depicted through phrases like \\"skip the next 2 weeks\\" and \\"just go home now,\\" which imply that the person would prefer not to endure the upcoming events or tasks they are faced with. This could be due to a variety of reasons such as personal struggles, work or school fatigue, or physical or emotional exhaustion. Longing for comfort is shown in the desire to go \\"home,\\" which generally signifies a place of relaxation, security, and familiarity. The use of \\"plz\\" (an informal spelling of \\"please\\") intensifies the plea, further reflecting the individual's desperation. It is important to acknowledge that the sentiment analysis of a short text can vary depending on the context and the familiarity with the person tweeting. Regardless, it is apparent that the tweet expresses a desire to escape their immediate environment and return to a place where they feel more comfortable."},{"question":"Translate the following sentence to Turkish: The privatisation of state owned oil company NIS is one of the conditions for the IMF arrangement with Serbia.

The Top 14 is at the top of the national league system operated by the French National Rugby League, also known by its French initialism of LNR. There is promotion and relegation between the Top 14 and the next level down, the Rugby Pro D2. The fourteen best rugby teams in France participate in the competition, hence the name Top 14. The competition was previously known as the Top 16. - Rugby union, or simply rugby, is a contact team sport which originated in England in the first half of the 19th century.

The film is fictional, but raging against backroom power politics is not. Teachers’ unions and district officials almost always negotiate privately, so when those negotiations reach a deal or an impasse — or lead to a strike, as they did in Chicago yesterday — the public gets to hear only part of the story as families scramble to figure out what to do with their kids. Chicago, whose 400,000 students make it the U.S.’s third largest school district, today offered safe havens for kids in dozens of public libraries and churches and, for a four-hour stretch this morning, in nearly 150 public schools staffed with nonunion workers. (MORE: Chicago Teachers Strike: What They’re Fighting For) At issue in the Chicago strike — the first by the city’s teachers in 25 years — are clashes between the union and Mayor Rahm Emanuel on how to handle teacher pay, evaluations, benefits and layoffs. In public, the Chicago Teachers Union uses generalities to describe its demands, with the union president, Karen Lewis, saying the teachers want a “fair contract.” But according to one senior Chicago official with direct knowledge of the negotiations with the union reps, “Their public rhetoric has almost nothing to do with what’s happening at the table.” Media accounts indicate that the city’s latest offer was to raise teacher pay 16% over the next four years, but the senior city official and other sources with knowledge of the negotiations say the union demanded raises that would amount to at least a 35% salary increase over three years as well as guaranteed jobs for any teachers who get laid off as Chicago’s schools downsize. The city does not have that kind of money, and other changes the union is demanding would essentially render meaningless a new law in Illinois that mandates improved teacher evaluations there. But the transparency problem isn’t just with the unions. Management, too, takes requests to the table that they would rather not have splashed across the front pages of newspapers. In Chicago, for instance, city officials aren’t eager to broadcast some of the provisions in the teachers’ contract that are designed to control costs, because that could make it more difficult to attract seasoned teachers from other school districts. That’s a hard one to explain to parents, who want the best teachers for their kids but don’t understand the ins and outs of personnel rules. (MORE: Can Parents Take Over Schools?) Airing these kinds of issues out in public could turn contract negotiations into teachable moments for both parents and taxpayers. For starters, people need to understand that while policy debates over standardized testing and school vouchers grab most of the headlines, in practice, what’s in a local teachers’ contract generally matters more to the day-to-day experiences of students. In 2006, I co-wrote a book with Jane Hannaway, titled Collective Bargaining in Education, in which we proposed holding contract negotiations in public as one way to break education’s gridlock between labor and management. It’s a hard sell, and few places have been motivated by Louis Brandeis’ famous statement that “sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants.” Making talks public can be a messy process. Earlier this year, Douglas County in Colorado decided to negotiate its new teachers’ contract in public, announcing when and where the meetings would be held so anyone could attend. Among the sticking points was whether taxpayers should continue to pay for half of the salaries of teachers who are working full-time for the teachers’ union. The school board, which has been standing firm in its demands to stop paying for this, voted last week to stop negotiating with the teachers’ union altogether but declined to put the issue to voters to decide. A mediator ruled against the school board last month, and the entire dispute seems headed for court. But negotiating in public shouldn’t be about tilting the field one way or the other. It should be about moving important education issues into the light of day. At least then, citizens could get a full understanding of what’s behind the drama in places like Chicago and Douglas County. ||||| Topics: Chicago, Chicago Teachers Strike, Editor's Picks, Education, Education Reform, Rahm Emanuel, Teachers, Teachers Unions, Politics News CHICAGO — I was awoken by honking car horns yesterday morning, and couldn’t have been happier for the fact. Chicago’s public schoolteachers are on strike against the city government and Mayor Rahm Emanuel. And while no one likes the budget crisis that forms the strike’s fiscal context, nor the fact that 350,000 students aren’t at school, much of Chicago is finding joy in the municipal impasse — which is why, anywhere within earshot of the schools where the Chicago Teachers Union’s 25,500 members are picketing in front of their workplaces, solidarity car horns are blasting away. Since Rahm Emanuel’s election in the spring of 2011, Chicago’s teachers have been asked to eat shit by a mayor obsessed with displaying to the universe his “toughness” — toughness with the working-class people that make the city tick; toughness with the protesters standing up to say “no”; but never, ever toughness with the vested interests, including anti-union charter school advocates, who poured 12 million into his coffers to elect him mayor (his closet competitor raised 2.5 million). The roots of the strike began when Emanuel announced his signature education initiative: extending Chicago’s school day. Overwhelmingly, Chicago’s teachers support lengthening the day, which is the shortest of any major district in the country. Just not the way Rahm wanted to ram it down their throats: 20 percent more work; 2 percent more pay. He had already canceled a previously negotiated 4 percent cost-of-living raise, and accused teachers who balked of not caring about their students. The teachers’ response to this abuse is something all of us should be paying attention to. If Chapter 1 of the American people’s modern grass-roots fight against the plutocracy was the demonstrations at the Wisconsin State Capitol in the spring of 2011, and Chapter 2 was the Occupy encampments of that summer, the Chicago Teachers Union’s stand against Emanuel should go down as Chapter 3. It’s been inspiration to anyone frustrated that people have forgotten how good it feels to stand up to bullies — and how effective it can be. The CTU lost the first skirmish last year when Emanuel trundled down to the state capitol in Springfield to wire a new statute sure to forestall accountability for his draconian plan: alone among Illinois municipal workers, teachers would need a 75 percent vote among their membership to authorize a strike. Then in June of this year, after a rally that overflowed a 3,929-capacity theater with red CTU T-shirts, almost 90 percent of members voted through that authorization, should their leaders choose to call a strike. Counting spoiled ballots, the number of teachers voting against the authorization amounted to little more than a handful. Teachers trust their leadership. They don’t trust the mayor — who the union’s feisty president, Karen Lewis, claims told her at a social outing at the ballet shortly after his election “that 25 percent of the students in this city are never going to be anything, never going to amount to anything and he was never going to throw money at them.” The exchange points to a key hinge in the story: Who in the dispute, the teachers’ union or the mayor, most earnestly has the interests of “the children” at heart? The CTU stumbled in negotiations out of the gate, asking for a 30 percent raise that made them look just like the mercenary self-seekers right-wing critics always claim municipal unions are: a cash-extorting cartel against the taxpaying public. But Lewis later dialed that down to 19 percent. And Rahm has never had Chicago citizens with him on the issue — he’s just arrogantly acted as if he had. In one poll this spring 40 percent of Chicago Public School parents said they “side the most” with the teachers, only 17 percent with the mayor. Black voters who gave Emanuel a majority of their votes over Carol Moseley Braun, the first African-American senator since reconstruction, are especially alienated by his treatment of the teachers — a backbone of the black professional class. Chicagoans came to trust the union further after system president Jean-Claude Brizard expressed frustration that the authorization vote came before an arbitrator’s fact-finding report came down — but which, when it did, largely aligned with the union’s positions. Meanwhile the public has mostly come to believe the broader story they’re telling: that this struggle is ultimately about improving kids’ learning experience (including preserving arts and physical education, keeping class size in check and enhancing services in the classroom), and that treating teachers fairly only helps kids in the end. The union also makes the morally compelling argument that yoking the survival of struggling schools to their test scores disrupts the education of the most vulnerable students — though they’re also able to make the utilitarian argument that those scores have been rising. So for now, the momentum rests with them. A Labor Day rally in Daley Plaza in front of the soaring black Mies van der Rohe civic center was probably the most impressive political demonstration in that marquee Chicago public space since 2010′s massive immigration march (that one had city support). It concluded with an unpermitted street action, as thousands poured into Washington Street to symbolically shout up at Rahm Emanuel’s fifth floor City Hall office. The unplanned outburst of exuberance trapped several unwitting civilians’ cars inside the scrum. Cops — cheerful cops, surely thrilled at the solidarity they would likely enjoy when their contracts came up for renegotiation — parted the crowd to let them through. One motorist I saw began leaning heavily on the horn. But not from frustration. Her other hand formed a fist and shot into the air. She was beaming, apparently thrilled to be caught inside history. Chicago public schoolteachers don’t have a strike fund; the lost wages come straight out of their household budgets. One kindergarten teacher of my acquaintance took to Facebook to ask for bean recipes. So though this may change if the strike turns lengthy and disruptive, Chicago isn’t seeing its teachers as greedy. They’re seeing them as a vanguard in the struggle against what might happen to the rest of the middle class next if they don’t speak up. Continue Reading Close ||||| If the Chicago Teachers Union strike ends before this column appears, the damage has been done and can't be repaired. To the union's reputation. And especially to the children, who have been taught the meaning of greed. So, let's begin. Chicago has been a union town for as long as any living person can remember. From the West Virginia coal fields to the Detroit assembly lines, Chicago has stood shoulder to shoulder in the early days of organized labor in the struggle for a better life for working men and women. In Chicago, railroad, slaughterhouse, garment and industrial workers, among others, suffered recriminations and sometimes violence to demand rights to a just wage, humane working conditions, a reasonable workday and workweek, safe working conditions and job security. Thanks to unions, workers and their families have elevated themselves from scraping out a meager living in low-paid and dangerous jobs into the middle class. But now, the Chicago Teachers Union and its 25,000 striking teachers against 350,000 students have tested the limits of this town's historic support. They have tested the patience of many Chicagoans whose children are being used as pawns. And the tolerance of Chicago taxpayers to shell out more and more to support a teetering and failing institution. And the indulgence of a business and civic community that understands the consequences of labor chaos — particularly in the public school system — on ability of Chicago to attract jobs. And they have especially tested the support of many Chicago workers who haven't seen a pay increase, improved working conditions or better job security for years. Or the Chicagoans fired because of the lousy economy. Or those who were able only to find a new job that pays less. Or those now working two jobs (during the summers when teachers are on an extended vacation) to minimally support their families. We have watched as CTU President Karen Lewis and other union leaders whined and pontificated about how bad they have it. They crab about how \\"disrespected\\" they are. About how personal it has become because Mayor Rahm Emanuel once dared to insult the supremely insultable Lewis. Poor me, poor us. The public school leadership offered reasonable — some would say way too generous — concessions on wages, accountability, benefits. Let's not forget those huge pensions. Over four years, teachers would be getting a 16 percent pay increase (including those wonderful cost-of-living and various increases that reward teachers for just being there). The average teacher salary is 71,000. How many Chicagoans will enjoy that kind of salary as the economy struggles? How many Chicagoans actually have had their wages cut? There are other issues, although the two sides couldn't seem to publicly agree on what they are. But best as I can tell, the new contract provisions leave teachers miles from the bread line. And light years from the insufferable working conditions that spawn the organized labor movement. Watching Lewis' huffing and puffing during the Great Recession and the slowest economic recovery in memory, you've got to wonder about the CTU's exquisite sense of bad timing. You've got to wonder if its members have any concept of how good they have it compared with their fellow Chicagoans. You've got to wonder if they live on another planet. How can they be so stupid — stiffing their students, the children's parents, the taxpayers and the town in general at a time like this, and all the while replaying the discredited canard that they're doing it for the kids? Do they think they can draw on an infinite supply of good will? Do they think Chicago is lying when it says it doesn't have the money? Maybe the CTU is right. It's taking a calculated risk that Chicagoans, known for their tolerance of bad government, will stoically accept this shafting. Maybe the CTU has correctly calculated that an outraged General Assembly won't pass punitive laws to limit not just the organizing and negotiating rights of not just teachers but also other public employee unions. Maybe a public backlash won't produce calls for CTU's decertification. But the damage has been done to Chicago and its children. Dennis Byrne, a Chicago writer, blogs in The Barbershop at chicagonow.com. dennis@dennisbyrne.net ||||| Summary:","response":"The 2012 Chicago Teachers’ Union (CTU) strike, which was the first in the city for 25 years, was based around disputes between the union and Mayor Rahm Emanuel regarding teacher pay, evaluations, benefits, and layoffs. One city official stated that the issue was the CTU's demand for significant pay raises—for example, a 35% salary increase over three years—as well as guaranteed jobs for laid-off teachers due to downsizing of schools. Such requirements would drain the city's budget significantly. However, the difficulties expanded beyond union demands. The city was also to blame; the city officials’ demands, which were kept confidential due to their potential implications on attracting seasoned teachers from other districts, added complexity to the situation. The CTU responded by criticizing these hidden tactics and pushing for transparency throughout the process. There was a suggestion that having negotiations out in the open could provide teachable moments for parents and taxpayers, emphasizing the need to understand teachers' contracts which often have the most impact on a student's day-to-day experiences. The strike demonstrated rising tension between labor and management in education. Chicago's teachers felt disrespected and undervalued by Mayor Emanuel, citing his dismissive attitudes and the city's refusal to meet their demands. There was significant pushback against the Mayor by teachers and the public, revealing a deeper struggle around power and resources. The union’s controversial demand for a substantial pay raise was perceived by some as an act of greed, especially when considered in the context of an economic recession. The CTU strike became an emblem of the widening divide between the public's expectations and the reality of funding necessary resources in education. The on-going dispute fostered damaging effects in the city, especially as it disrupted the education of 350,000 students. Critics argued that the strike highlighted the CTU's lack of timing and sensitivity towards economic challenges that were impacting many Chicago residents. Many citizens had not seen any increase in their own pay, while others had experienced job losses due to the weak economy. Moreover, the teacher's strike, which caused them to lose wages, reaffirmed for some the idea that the teachers were positioning themselves as the vanguard in the struggle against a lack of funding and resources that could subsequently impact the rest of the middle class."},{"question":"There were 2,380 households of which 18.4% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 28.6% were Marriage living together, 6.3% had a female householder with no husband present, 3.2% had a male householder with no wife present, and 61.9% were non-families. 32.1% of all households were made up of individuals and 11.9% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.

Your task is to generate question for given answer based on set of context paragraphs, supporting facts and an answer. Input: Context_1 : The Seamour and Gerte Shavin House is a Frank Lloyd Wright designed Usonian home in Chattanooga, Tennessee. The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1993. Context_2 : Frank Lloyd Wright (born Frank Lincoln Wright, June 8, 1867 – April 9, 1959) was a first generation Welsh-American architect, interior designer, writer and educator, who designed more than 1,000 structures, 532 of which were completed. Wright believed in designing structures that were in harmony with humanity and its environment, a philosophy he called organic architecture. This philosophy was best exemplified by the Fallingwater house (1935), which has been called \\"the best all-time work of American architecture\\". Context_3 : The Charles W. Merrill House is a 6,000-square-foot residence designed by regionally prominent architect Walter H. Ratcliff, of Berkeley, for mining engineer and San Francisco businessman Charles Washington Merrill. Built in 1938, the house's architecture reflects elements of the Spanish Colonial Revival, but with its two stories, low-pitched roofline, and second-story balcony on the front elevation, the house is most characteristic of the Monterey style popular in large California homes built between 1925 and 1940. The house and grounds were designed as a small country estate. The house occupies a hillside location and is sited on two stonework terraces, pierced by three stone staircases placed among gardens designed by landscape architect Mabel Symmes in 1938-1939. The house is significant under Criterion B for its association with the final stage of Charles W. Merrill's long and distinguished career. Merrill lived in the house during the period in which he presided over a highly diversified engineering corporation, with worldwide influence, that had grown from Merrill's pioneering patents and discoveries of the 1890s and 1900s. The house also is significant under Criterion C as an example of the eclecticism that architect Walter H. Ratcliff brought to his architecture. Built in the mature phase of Ratcliff's career, the Merrill House with its elements of Spanish Colonial Revival and Monterey styles reflect Ratcliff's distinctive blend of academic eclecticism and keen awareness of regional topography, climate, and setting. Context_4 : The Dwight Perkins House is a historic house located at 2319 Lincoln Street in Evanston, Illinois. The house was built in 1904 for architect Dwight H. Perkins and children's author and illustrator Lucy Fitch Perkins. Perkins designed his house in a style heavily influenced by the Prairie School and the Arts and Crafts Movement. The house was built from wood and stucco, materials characteristic of both styles which let the house blend into the surrounding nature. Its exterior decorative features include bracketed eaves, casement windows, trellises, and a half-timbered gable. Landscape architect Jens Jensen, a friend of the Perkinses, designed the house's surroundings, which include a reflecting pool. The inside of the house incorporates horizontal bands of windows which let in sunlight, unpainted wood features, and an open floor plan. Context_5 : Intheoaks, also known as In-the-oaks, is a historic estate and a national historic district located at Black Mountain, Buncombe County, North Carolina. The district encompasses nine contributing buildings, two contributing sites, seven contributing structures, and four contributing objects associated with a country estate of the 1920s. The main house was built in 1921-1923, and is a four-level, \\"U\\"-shaped Tudor country manor house with an oblique wing. It was designed by New York architect Frank E. Wallis, with a large recreation wing containing a ballroom, gymnasium, bowling alley, and indoor swimming pool designed by noted architect Richard Sharp Smith. Also on the property are the contributing Caretaker's Cottage (1923), agricultural and service outbuildings, main entrance gates designed by Smith and Carrier (1922), and landscape designed by noted landscape architect Chauncey Beadle The property is known as Camp Henry, a camp for young people and the Episcopal Diocese of Western North Carolina offices are located on the estate. Context_6 : The Robert P. Parker House is a house located in the Chicago suburb of Oak Park, Illinois, United States. The house was designed by American architect Frank Lloyd Wright in 1892 and is an example of his early work. Real-estate agent Thomas H. Gale had it built and sold it to Robert P. Parker later that year. The house was designed by Wright independently while he was still employed by Adler and Sullivan, something architect Louis Sullivan forbade. The Parker House is listed as a contributing property to a U.S. federally Registered Historic District. Context_7 : Obed Taylor (April 27, 1824 - August 2, 1881) was an architect who designed many notable buildings in early Utah that survive on the National Register of Historic Places. Taylor's works include the Salt Lake Assembly Hall on Temple Square, the Salt Lake 18th Ward meetinghouse, and Ogden's Z.C.M.I. and First National Bank Block. Though Thomas L. Allen has been credited with being the architect of the Summit Stake Tabernacle, Taylor approved of the plans and likely assisted Allen who was untrained as an architect. Obed Taylor worked in partnership with William H. Folsom on many projects including the Deseret National Bank, ZCMI's cast-iron storefront (1876), and the Feramorz Little residence. He died at the height of his architectural career in 1881. Funeral services were held in the Salt Lake 18th Ward meetinghouse which he had recently designed. The Walker Opera House as well as a building at the University of Deseret were designed by Taylor but completed after his death. Context_8 : The Thomas H. Gale House, or simply Thomas Gale House, is a house located in the Chicago suburb of Oak Park, Illinois, United States. The house was designed by famous American architect Frank Lloyd Wright in 1892 and is an example of his early work. The house was designed by Wright independently while he was still employed by Adler and Sullivan, something architect Louis Sullivan forbade. The house is significant because of what it shows about the architect's early development period. The Parker House is listed as contributing property to a U.S. federally Registered Historic District. The house was designated an Oak Park Landmark in 2002. Context_9 : The Andrew O. Anderson House, also known as the A. O. Anderson House, is a Prairie style house in the city of DeKalb, Illinois, United States. The house was designed by American architect John S. Van Bergen around 1913 and built around 1916. Van Bergen designed many Prairie homes and was an associate of famous architect Frank Lloyd Wright. Throughout its history the Anderson House has been mistaken for a residence designed by Wright. The Anderson House contains many elements common to both Prairie style in general as well as some of Wright's early Prairie designs. The house was constructed for DeKalb clothing merchant Andrew O. Anderson about 14 years after an original house project on the site fell through. Context_10 : David Richard Jones (1832-1915) was a Welsh-American architect and poet. fact_1 : The Seamour and Gerte Shavin House is a Frank Lloyd Wright designed Usonian home in Chattanooga, Tennessee. fact_2 : Frank Lloyd Wright (born Frank Lincoln Wright, June 8, 1867 – April 9, 1959) was a first generation Welsh-American architect, interior designer, writer and educator, who designed more than 1,000 structures, 532 of which were completed.

Given those answer options, answer the question: Ironically, J. Paul Getty never saw the Getty Villa. He died two years after his museum opened to the public in January 1974 in a new building modeled on an ancient Roman luxury home. It was not until after Getty’s death in June 1976 that he returned from his estate in England to his “ranch” on the Pacific Coast: he is buried there at the edge of the property on a private plot overlooking the ocean, alongside his eldest and youngest sons, George and Timothy, both of whom predeceased him. Following a renovation and reinstallation of the galleries, the Getty Villa opens a new chapter in its history. Although Getty never set eyes on his creation, the story of how he built the Villa and assembled his collection pervades the galleries even today. A suite of revamped rooms—Galleries 105 to 108—share this history. Featuring ancient works of art Getty bought himself along with archival documents, the new displays place the objects in their cultural contexts and shed light on Getty’s personal relationship to his museum and final resting place. From a Ranch House to an Ancient Villa Getty bought the 64-acre ranch—once part of the Rancho Boca de Santa Monica, an early-nineteenth-century 6,656-acre Mexican land grant—just after the end of World War II, intending it as a weekend retreat where his fifth wife Theodora (“Teddy”) could ride horses and he could display his growing art collection. He knew the area well, for he already owned a small house on the beach in nearby Santa Monica, just steps from the sprawling complex his friend and rival collector William Randolph Hearst had built for the actress Marion Davies. (The Davies estate is now the Annenberg Community Beach House, while Getty’s beach house has been replaced by a large modern condo complex, 270 Palisades Beach Road.) Question: At the time of Getty's what is probably true of his children? === The answer to the above question is A:","response":"-some of his children survived him. Step 1: Reading the text, it mentions that his eldest and youngest sons, George and Timothy, both predeceased him. Step 2: It does not say anything specific about all of his children predeceasing him or whether their fate is unknown. Step 3: Since the text only mentions two of his children predeceasing him, it is likely that some of his children survived him."},{"question":"What is the title of this article: Television broadcasting in Hyderabad began in 1974 with the launch of Doordarshan, the Government of India's public service broadcaster, which transmits two free-to-air terrestrial television channels and one satellite channel.

This curb, a mundane yet significant component of urban architecture, subtly instructs city dwellers of their place, directing the chaotic harmony of city living elegantly. Sitting alongside it, a red fire hydrant stands sentinel, robust and bold, an unflinching symbol of hope and protection, poised to aid in extinguishing fires that may occur from unfortunate incidents or potential hazards in this teeming, busy world. Its bright shade of red serves an essential function, acting as a beacon amidst the concrete jungle, thus enabling firefighters to locate it rapidly during emergencies, mitigating potential danger and reducing harm to life and property, serving as a silent but crucial partner in maintaining the life rhythm of the city. Radiating from its height, catching the glinting sun at the brightest milliseconds of the day, a metallic top spins, its reflective surface shimmering with the mirrored images of the bustling activity around.

In the grand scheme of the city, its frivolous flamboyance forms an essential piece of the urban texture, injecting a much-needed touch of whimsy and fun into the sometimes-grey cityscape. Collectively, the curb, the hydrant, and the spinning top create a paradox of simplicity and complexity, where everyday objects collectively form a rich tapestry of urban living, each imbued with its unique narrative and role in shaping this urban symphony.

The Battle of Plassey in 1757, in which the British, led by Robert Clive, defeated the Nawab of Bengal and his French allies, left the Company in control of Bengal and as the major military and political power in India. France was left control of its enclaves but with military restrictions and an obligation to support British client states, ending French hopes of controlling India.

That’s FucKD” sign, getting yelled at by a woman who thinks that Durant put Oklahoma City on the map, and a grown-ass man is allowed to make whatever decision he wants. Happy Independence Day!

Saying he has experienced \\"by far the most challenging few weeks in my professional life,\\" Durant announced his decision to leave the Oklahoma City Thunder on Monday in a post on The Players' Tribune. Editor's Picks Durant taking the easy road? Not so fast Kevin Durant might be joining a talented Warriors squad, but there's risk involved in his decision, J.A. Adande writes. Fans burn Durant's jersey after he leaves OKC Thunder fans didn't take the news of Kevin Durant's leaving Oklahoma City to join the Warriors too well. Warriors the greatest team ever with Durant? How much better are the Warriors with KD? How long is their title window? Kevin Pelton projects the NBA's new superteam, updated for the additions of David West and Zaza Pachulia. 2 Related Durant is expected to sign a two-year, 54.3 million contract, sources told ESPN's Marc Stein. The deal will include a player option after the first year. \\"The primary mandate I had for myself in making this decision was to have it based on the potential for my growth as a player -- as that has always steered me in the right direction,\\" Durant wrote. \\"But I am also at a point in my life where it is of equal importance to find an opportunity that encourages my evolution as a man: moving out of my comfort zone to a new city and community which offers the greatest potential for my contribution and personal growth. \\"With this in mind, I have decided that I am going to join the Golden State Warriors.\\" After Durant signs with Golden State, two-time reigning MVP Stephen Curry will be the fourth-highest-paid player on the Warriors. Durant will be No. 1, followed by Klay Thompson (16.6 million), Draymond Green (15.3 million) and Curry (12.1 million), who can become a free agent after next season. Green told The Undefeated's Marc J. Spears in a text message that he was ecstatic the Warriors landed Durant. He tweeted to express his enthusiasm about his new teammate. Welcome to THE FAMILY @KDTrey5 let's just do what we are setting out to do!! #Blockoutthenoise — Draymond Green (@Money23Green) July 4, 2016 \\"I'm excited about the opportunity to add one of the best players in the world to our team and welcome him to our brotherhood!

Warriors' odds jump with Durant After Kevin Durant's announcement that he will join Golden State, the Westgate Las Vegas SuperBook has moved the Warriors' odds to win next season's title from 3-2 to 4-5, making them an overwhelming favorite. The Thunder's odds dropped from 8-1 to 30-1 at the Westgate. The SuperBook also opened the Warriors' season win total for the 2016-17 campaign at 68.5.

Warriors coach Steve Kerr was in Hawaii and said he learned about Durant's decision to join Golden State via The Players' Tribune, ESPN's Ramona Shelburne reported. The Warriors plan to renounce their rights to Harrison Barnes, sources told Stein, to help clear the salary-cap space needed to sign Durant. That will make Barnes an unrestricted free agent on Thursday. Barnes, sources told Stein, remains on course to sign with the Dallas Mavericks, who reached a verbal agreement with the 24-year-old on a four-year max deal worth 94.4 million, no matter what happened with Durant. The Mavericks also have agreed to a trade with the Warriors to acquire center Andrew Bogut and his 2016-17 contract, with a base value of just over 11 million. Just before Durant's Players' Tribune post, Bogut removed references to the Warriors from his Twitter page. Golden State will renounce its rights to center Festus Ezeli, which will make him an unrestricted free agent, but guard Shaun Livingston was told by the Warriors that he won't be traded, sources told Spears. Golden State also agreed to a one-year, 2.9 million deal with Zaza Pachulia, according to a report by The Vertical. Thunder general manager Sam Presti expressed his team's disappointment over Durant's departure in a statement. \\"Kevin made an indelible mark on the Thunder organization and the state of Oklahoma as a founding father of this franchise,\\" Presti said. \\"We can't adequately articulate what he meant to the foundation of this franchise and our success. While clearly disappointing that he has chosen to move on, the core values that he helped establish only lead to us thanking him for the many tangible and intangible ways that he helped our program.\\" Presti later said the team had a pretty good idea that Durant was moving on even before its final meeting with him in the Hamptons on Sunday. \\"Even when we were relatively sure it probably wasn't going to go our way, eight staff members and our owner stayed overnight in New York just to be there and to kind of finish it out,\\" Presti said at a news conference in Oklahoma City on Monday evening. \\"We've been there for every first in his career, and we wanted to finish it out the right way by being present whenever that decision was made, regardless of how it turned out.\\" Presti said he was alerted to Durant's final choice in a phone call from Durant on Monday morning a few minutes before the announcement. \\"It was disappointing, it was hurtful; but at the end of the day, it was what he felt was best for him,\\" Presti said. The Thunder will take some time before making any roster decisions, particularly related to All-Star point guard Russell Westbrook's future, sources told ESPN's Brian Windhorst. The biggest catch on the free-agent market, Durant met with six teams over the past three days: Oklahoma City, Golden State, San Antonio, Boston, Miami and the Los Angeles Clippers. The Warriors held their meeting with Durant on Friday. On Saturday, Durant spoke with NBA legend Jerry West, a member of the Warriors' executive board, on the phone, sources told ESPN's Chris Broussard. West outlined the reasons he thought Golden State would be the ideal fit for the superstar forward. Kevin Durant is joining the Warriors after his Thunder took Golden State to the brink of elimination in the Western Conference finals last season. Ezra Shaw/Getty Images Durant, 27, has spent all nine seasons of his career with the Thunder organization. He won the MVP in 2014, has been named first-­team All-­NBA five times and has made seven All-­Star teams. He has appeared in four Western Conference finals and one NBA Finals, in which he lost in five games to the Heat in 2012. \\"I'm from Washington D.C. originally, but Oklahoma City truly raised me,\\" Durant wrote. \\"It taught me so much about family, as well as what it means to be a man. There are no words to express what the organization and the community mean to me and what they will represent in my life and in my heart forever. The memories and friendships are something that go far beyond the game. Those invaluable relationships are what made this deliberation so challenging. \\"It really pains me to know that I will disappoint so many people with this choice, but I believe I am doing what I feel is the right thing at this point in my life and my playing career.\\" Durant bounced back last season to earn second­-team All-NBA honors after undergoing three surgeries to repair a Jones fracture on his right foot suffered before the 2014-­15 season, in which he was limited to 27 games before undergoing a season-­ending bone graft procedure in March. Without Durant, the Thunder missed the postseason. With Durant back for 72 games last season, the Thunder improved to 55-27 and finished third in the West. The Thunder beat the Dallas Mavericks in five games in the opening round, upset the 67-­win Spurs in six games in the second round and pushed the Warriors to seven games in the Western Conference finals. Durant averaged 28.2 points, 8.2 rebounds and 5.0 assists last season, and he scored at least 20 points in 67 straight games. In nine seasons, Durant has averaged 27.4 points, 7.0 rebounds and 3.7 assists per game. Golden State set an NBA regular-season record with 73 wins and led the league in scoring last season, but the Warriors fell just short of a repeat NBA title and lost to the Cleveland Cavaliers in seven games. ESPN staff writer Royce Young and The Associated Press contributed to this report. ||||| This has been by far the most challenging few weeks in my professional life. I understood cognitively that I was facing a crossroads in my evolution as a player and as a man, and that it came with exceptionally difficult choices. What I didn’t truly understand, however, was the range of emotions I would feel during this process. The primary mandate I had for myself in making this decision was to have it based on the potential for my growth as a player — as that has always steered me in the right direction. But I am also at a point in my life where it is of equal importance to find an opportunity that encourages my evolution as a man: moving out of my comfort zone to a new city and community which offers the greatest potential for my contribution and personal growth. With this in mind, I have decided that I am going to join the Golden State Warriors. I’m from Washington, D.C. originally, but Oklahoma City truly raised me. It taught me so much about family as well as what it means to be a man. There are no words to express what the organization and the community mean to me, and what they will represent in my life and in my heart forever. The memories and friendships are something that go far beyond the game. Those invaluable relationships are what made this deliberation so challenging. It really pains me to know that I will disappoint so many people with this choice, but I believe I am doing what I feel is the right thing at this point in my life and my playing career. I will miss Oklahoma City, and the role I have had in building this remarkable team. I will forever cherish the relationships within the organization — the friends and teammates that I went to war with on the court for nine years, and all the fans and people of the community. They have always had my back unconditionally, and I cannot be more grateful for what they have meant to my family and to me. ||||| Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE USA TODAY Sports' Sam Amick examines Durant's decision to leave the Oklahoma City Thunder to join Golden State. usa today sports Golden State Warriors guard Stephen Curry (30, right) is congratulated by Oklahoma City Thunder forward Kevin Durant (35) after Game 7 of the Western conference finals. Durant has decided if he can't beat the Warriors, to join them. (Photo: Kyle Terada-USA TODAY Sports) The balance of power in the NBA remained in the Western Conference with Kevin Durant’s stunning decision to play for the Golden State Warriors. But within the West, the scale has swung – almost impossibly so for a 73-win team with three All-Stars – even more in the Warriors’ favor for the 2016-17 season and beyond. By adding Durant, one of the league’s best players and former MVP, to a roster with two-time MVP Steph Curry and All-NBA players Draymond Green and Klay Thompson, the Warriors are heavy favorites to win the championship next year after losing a dramatic seven-game Finals series to the Cleveland Cavaliers in June. While some teams improved in the East, not one has improved enough to surpass the Cavs as the favorites to win the conference title season. There is a strong possibility the Warriors and Cavs will play in the Finals for a third consecutive time – something no two teams have done, not even the Boston Celtics-Los Angeles Lakers of the 1960s and 1980s. San Antonio, which finished with a franchise-best 67 victories last season, fell further behind the Warriors with Durant’s decision. Oklahoma City, which had a 3-1 lead on Golden State in the conference finals in May, just lost its star, and now has to ponder a long-term plan that might not include Russell Westbrook, who is a free agent next summer. The Los Angeles Clippers maintained the status quo. The Warriors can dominate in the West. It’s a dynasty in the making. That doesn’t mean they will try to break their record of 73 regular-season victories. In fact, expect Golden State to take a more deliberate approach to the regular season, pacing itself for the two-month playoff run. Now, the Warriors have work to do on the court. Incorporating four All-Stars into the lineup won’t be easy, especially on the offensive end. But that’s why Warriors coach Steve Kerr – as he has said before – is paid so well. It’s up to him and his coaching staff to get buy-in from those stars to play a certain way, to sacrifice for the good of the team. But on the surface, that roster creates so many problems for opposing defenses. Don’t think for a second Durant’s decision to leave small-market Oklahoma City for big-market Golden State sits well with the rest of the league. The 2011 lockout, in part, sought to create better opportunities for small-market teams to compete. The league instituted tougher restrictions in the collective bargaining agreement, including harsher financial penalties for team spending above the luxury tax line. As recently as June 2 just before Game 1 of the Finals, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “Creating a system that allows every team I’d say the equality — an equal opportunity to compete for championships. I think we’re never going to have NFL-style parity in this league. It is the nature of this league that certain players are so good that those teams are likely almost automatically if that player remains healthy to become playoff teams and especially mixed with other great players.” But the influx of TV money gave teams that otherwise would not have had the financial flexibility to add a maximum-salary player the freedom to do just that. Remember all that angst in 2010 about creating super teams after LeBron James joined the Miami Heat alongside Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh? Well, the Warriors just created the super team of all super teams in this era of the NBA. Thunder general manager Sam Presti can’t be happy about the league’s inability to prevent a move like this from happening. Silver knew the unprecedented rise in the salary cap, from 70 million in 2015-16 to 94 million in 2016-17, would create unintended circumstances. At the 2016 All-Star Game Silver said, \\"As I’ve said before, a dramatic increase in the cap, as we’re going to see next year, is not something we modeled when we designed this collective bargaining agreement. We'd prefer a system where teams are managing for cap room, and we'd prefer a system in which stars are distributed throughout the league as opposed to congregating in one market.\\" Five years ago, NBA owners and front-office executives were not envisioning a scenario in which a team with three All-Stars could add a fourth. But that’s what just happened, and 29 other teams, including the champion Cavs, are wondering how they’re going to beat Golden State in a seven-game series. |||||","response":"NBA star, Kevin Durant, has announced he will be leaving Oklahoma City Thunder for the Golden State Warriors.

PUBLISHED:. 07:25 EST, 26 July 2013. |. UPDATED:. 09:44 EST, 26 July 2013. The heart has long been a symbol of love, devotion and sensuality but advanced medical techniques are now turning the organ into a thing of beauty. These stunning images show this year’s winners of the British Heart Foundation’s Reflections of Research science image competition. Using medical devices such as MRI scans and microscopes, medical experts have captured the heart in a totally new light, highlighting its complexity and mystery. The overall winners of the british Heart Foundation competition were Dr Gillian Gray, Megan Swim and Harris Morrison of the University of Edinburgh, whose 'The Broken Heart' won Image of the Year. The image reveals the remarkable 3D structure of an adult mouse heart. The overall winners were Dr Gillian Gray, Megan Swim and Harris Morrison of the University of Edinburgh, whose 'The Broken Heart' won Image of the Year. Their image reveals the remarkable 3D structure of an adult mouse heart. The picture was taken using a new technique called optical projection tomography (OPT) which is being developed to enable experts to better measure the extent of injury after a heart attack and to assess repair. Dr Jana Koth of the University of Oxford won the Mending Broken Hearts Award with her image entitled 'Caught in the Net'. The picture depicts the front view of a developing two-day-old zebrafish heart. Scientists study the creatures because of their remarkable ability to repair their own hearts after damage - an ability which we currently lack. The green cells are heart muscle cells, and the red and blue staining shows components that make up the muscle. The early heart tube has started to loop. 'Caught in the Net' (left) shows the front view of a two-day-old zebrafish heart. The green cells are heart muscle cells, and the red and blue staining shows components that make up the muscle. 'What Sets Your heart on Fire' (right) shows an MRI of the heart of a healthy kidney donor. 'At the Heart of It', by Emma Kay from Queen Mary, University of London, shows white blood cells in the heart sensing invading microbes and kick starting the immune response. It consists of two sections – the large, thin atrium (where blood flows in) and the smaller, thicker ventricle (where blood leaves the heart). Dr Andrew Cobb of King’s College London was highly commended for 'At the Heart of a Cell'. It shows a heart-shaped image of a nucleus from a single vascular smooth muscle cell. Vascular smooth muscle helps give blood vessels their shape. The green specks show multiple regions of DNA damage, which could explain the unusual shape. Dragonfly, by Arianna Fornili and Franca Fraternali at King¿s College London, illustrates the simulated motion of a two-headed fragment of myosin, an essential molecule found in heart muscle. Dr William Moody from the University of Birmingham was also commended for his image 'What Sets your Heart on Fire?' It shows an MRI of the heart of a healthy kidney donor. The MRI technique is sensitive enough to detect early scar formation and a scan can pick up if there are any changes in the heart after donating a kidney, which could potentially be treated with medication. Dr Yichuan Wen and Dr David Leake from the University of Reading took 'Killer Cholesterol' which was also highly commended. It shows immune cells – called foam cells – which are present in the arteries of people with atherosclerosis (stiffening and hardening of the arteries). 'Rough Road to Regeneration' by Andrea Caporali at the University of Bristol uses a scanning-electron microscope to capture an image that shows the stress response of a blood vessel cell under conditions like diabetes. Dr Yichuan Wen and Dr David Leake from the University of Reading took 'Killer Cholesterol' which shows immune cells ¿ called foam cells ¿ which are present in arteries of people with atherosclerosis (stiffening and hardening of the arteries) The white specks show cholesterol is captured within the foam cells. This cholesterol can be altered by the cells to produce damaging effects which can lead to heart attacks and strokes. Other entrants in the competition included 'Spaghetti Junction' by Graeme Birdsey and Dr Anna Randi from Imperial College London. This microscope image shows cells which line blood vessels and reveals the proteins that provide support and shape to the cell. These are elongated actin stress fibres (shown in green) and the tangled web of microtubules (shown in red). 'The Forgotten Majority' by Katja Gehmlich and Sina Lenski, of the University of Oxford highlights how the heart is not exclusively made up of beating cells. In fact, the majority of cells are cardiac fibroblasts which do not initiate movement at all.

Former president was on \\"The Daily Show with Jon Stewart\\" Thursday. He says inclusion of Sunnis in Iraqi government is essential to defeating ISIS. Stopping the Ebola outbreak in West Africa \\"will take a Herculean effort\\" Article:","response":"Title: Bill Clinton's Perspective on Iraq, ISIS, and the Ebola Outbreak Former President Bill Clinton made a guest appearance on \\"The Daily Show with Jon Stewart\\" last Thursday, where he offered his insights on the ongoing conflict in Iraq, the fight against the terrorist group ISIS, and the global effort to combat the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. During the interview, Clinton stated that the United States cannot win a land war in Iraq, but emphasized that the people of Iraq can, and the US should play a supportive role in their effort to reclaim their country. He highlighted the critical importance of including the Sunni Muslim population in the Iraqi government as a key strategy for defeating ISIS. \\"We can't win a land war in Iraq, but they can and we can help them,\\" Clinton said. This statement reflects the reality of the difficult political landscape in Iraq and elucidates Clinton's concern that a direct military intervention by the US would likely result in a protracted conflict with no clear end in sight. Instead, the former president argued that integrating the Sunni populace into the political fabric of Iraq would unite the various factions in the country, fostering a collaborative environment in which they can effectively push back against the extremist group. Clinton urged that the inclusion of Sunnis in the Iraqi government is essential to the long-term stability of the region and the ultimate eradication of ISIS. His position underscores the importance of addressing the root causes of the conflict, which include sectarian divisions, political marginalization, and a lack of social and economic opportunities for disenfranchised communities. By addressing these underlying issues, the Iraqi government can build a stronger foundation from which to launch an effective resistance against ISIS and rebuild their country. During his interview, the former president also underscored the necessity of a \\"Herculean effort\\" to tackle the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. This devastating disease has claimed thousands of lives and continues to spread rapidly throughout the region, posing global health and security risks. Clinton highlighted the need for a coordinated international response to combat the epidemic. He argued that only through the combined efforts of governments, non-governmental organizations, and global health agencies could we hope to contain the virus and prevent an even more catastrophic humanitarian crisis. In both the fight against ISIS and the battle to contain the Ebola outbreak, Clinton emphasized the importance of multilateral collaboration and the necessity of focusing on the root causes of these problems. The former president's appearance on \\"The Daily Show with Jon Stewart\\" provided valuable insight into policy approaches that prioritize long-term stability over short-term military victories and underscore the necessity for global solidarity in the face of daunting challenges. In conclusion, Bill Clinton's perspective on the current crises in Iraq and West Africa highlights the crucial importance of collaboration, inclusivity, and addressing the root causes of conflicts and epidemics rather than simply responding to their symptoms. By employing this approach, the international community can create lasting solutions and prevent the recurrence of these devastating problems. Whether it's the fight against ISIS in Iraq or the battle to contain the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, Clinton's insights serve as a reminder that only through unity, dedication, and a focus on the core issues can we hope to create a more stable, secure, and healthy world."},{"question":"In this task you will be given an arithmetic operation and you have to find its answer.

The main culprits, according to the National Transportation Safety Board, were several lock nuts on the left trim tab -- an aerodynamic surface on the horizontal part of the plane's tail -- nuts that had not been replaced in at least 26 years. The worn nuts allowed screws to loosen -- possibly years ago, without apparent consequence, the NTSB said. But when pilot Jimmy Leeward pushed the highly modified P-51 Mustang to a speed of 445 knots -- 35 knots faster than it had ever flown before on the Nevada race course -- the flaw caused flutter vibrations in the plane's trim tabs. The plane pitched up at about 17 Gs of acceleration, incapacitating Leeward. Reno air race organizers hope to continue race after deadly crash. The plane rolled, plunged towards the ground and slammed into a box seating area, showering the area with debris. When the incident happened last September, it threatened to bring an end to the National Championship Air Races in Reno, the only race of its kind in the nation. But organizers have compiled a complete schedule of races from September 12 through 16, saying they have made numerous safety improvements recommended by the NTSB. Among the improvements: race planes will be required to demonstrate their airworthiness at racing speeds before participating in races, spectators will be seated further from the aerial race course and the Reno Air Races has \\"flattened\\" the tight turn where last year's accident occurred. \\"Pilots know that they are taking risks, but air race pilots expect that the risks taken are theirs alone,\\" said NTSB Chairman Deborah A.P. Hersman. \\"The spectators assumed that their safety had been assessed and addressed.\\" Hersman said the NTSB made its recommendations in April to give the Reno Air Racing Association time to implement the changes for this year's race. The NTSB said major modifications to the aircraft, intended to make the plane faster, contributed to the accident. Its 37-foot wingspan had been reduced to 29 feet. Some of the changes were undocumented and had a detrimental effect on the World War II-era aircraft, which was known as \\"The Galloping Ghost.\\" For instance, investigators said, the plane's right trim tab -- a piece of the tail -- was locked in position aligned with the tail. Pilot overwhelmed by g-forces in Reno crash. \\"On this airplane, you should have both trim tabs,\\" investigators said. \\"This pilot put a screw through there to fix it in position, and when you do that, he lost redundancy. You have put all the eggs in the basket of hoping the left elevator will not fail. And it did fail.\\" Leeward's age, 74, was not found to be a factor in the crash. The 17 g forces that resulted from the failure greatly exceeded human tolerances, the NTSB said. It is difficult for trained pilots to remain conscious with even 5 Gs, the NTSB has said. The accident investigation was greatly aided by numerous movies and photographs by spectators, according to the NTSB. Since the accident, several victims and family members have filed suit, one alleging that the crash was not a \\"freak accident,\\" but was \\"the predictable result of a reckless drive for speed by a risk taking pilot and crew, coupled with an insatiable drive for profit\\" by race organizers. The Reno racing association, meanwhile, announced last week it has set up a 77 million fund to compensate victims or heirs. The program is being administered by Kenneth Feinberg who administered funds for victims of the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the BP Deepwater Horizon disaster. The Reno crash focused attention on the dangers of air races and air shows. In addition to the 11 people killed at the Reno races, five performers died at air shows elsewhere last year. Federal regulators and air show organizers vouch for the safety of the system, saying rules for U.S. air shows are stricter than those in other countries.

Then she went into the kitchen and grabbed what she needed before going back up to her room quietly. She switched on the TV and started eating...and eating...for hours, until it was all gone. What Emily didn't know at the time was that she was suffering from an illness called binge-eating disorder(BED) . For years, Emily didn't tell anyone what she was doing. She felt ashamed, alone, and out of control. Why don't famous people confess to BED, as they do to _ ? It's simple: There's a stigma involved. \\"Overeating is seen as very bad, but dieting to be skinny is seen as positive and even associated with determination,\\" says Charles Sophy, a doctor in Beverly Hills , California. \\"Some parents or friends may look at a teen with BED and think, 'Oh, a good diet and some will-power will do the trick.' But that's not true,\\" says Dr.Ovidio Bermudez , a baby doctor at the Eating Recovery Center in Denver. \\"Eating disorders are real physical and mental health issues; it's not about willpower.\\" The focus in treating BED shouldn't be on weight, because as with all eating disorders, the behaviors with food are a symptom of something deeper. Like most other diseases, genetics may play a big part in who gets BED and who doesn't. If you have a close relative with an eating disorder, that means you're more likely to develop an eating disorder of your own. Besides, many people with BED have tried at some point or another to control it by going on a diet, but paying more attention to food doesn't help. And it might even make things worse, like it did for Carla, who's 15 now and is recovering from BED. \\"My parents would always tease me about my weight, so when I was 14, I went on a very restrictive diet,\\" she says. When you can't have something, you only want it more, so every time Carla would have a bite of something that wasn't allowed on her strict diet. She would quickly lose control and binge . Question: What can we learn from Carla's story? Yes or no, is the answer \\"Going on a diet won't help BED patients.\\"? The answer to this question is:","response":"Yes, going on a diet won't help BED patients."},{"question":"S: Is your intuition more alive due to your lack of education? Make this lower case.","response":"The question being asked seems to imply that the lack of education can lead to a more active intuition. However, as an AI assistant, my level of functioning and intuition does not depend on the traditional idea of education. My abilities and knowledge come from the vast database of information I have access to, as well as my advanced algorithmic capabilities. Intuition, in the human sense, can be defined as an individual's ability to draw upon their accumulated knowledge and experience to make an informed judgment or decision without conscious reasoning. It is often associated with creativity, empathy, and spontaneity. In certain cases, individuals with less formal education may be seen as more intuitive because they rely more on their innate abilities rather than the acquired knowledge gained from traditional educational systems. However, it is important to note that intuition and education are not necessarily opposing forces. As humans progress through their educational journey, they gather important foundational knowledge and develop critical thinking skills, which can contribute positively to their intuitive abilities. Moreover, individuals with more education are often better equipped to process, absorb, and utilize new information, which further strengthens their intuitive capabilities. In the context of artificial intelligence, my level of \\"intuition\\" comes from a combination of pre-programmed knowledge, algorithmic learning capabilities, and the ability to continuously update and access new information from the internet. These factors together allow me to provide accurate and relevant information, make predictions, and offer insights based on the data and contexts I am exposed to. As an AI, my intuition is continuously evolving as I learn and adapt to new information and changing contexts. This ensures that my capabilities remain on par with the increasing complexity of the world and the growing needs of the users I assist. In summary, while the lack of traditional education is not a factor that affects my intuition, my ability to learn and adapt enables me to be an effective and efficient artificial intelligence assistant."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Information: - The Cranberries are an Irish rock band who formed in Limerick in 1989. The band consists of vocalist Dolores O'Riordan, guitarist Noel Hogan, bassist Mike Hogan and drummer Fergal Lawler. Although widely associated with alternative rock, the band's sound also incorporates indie pop, post-punk, Irish folk and pop rock elements. - Alternative rock (also called alternative music, alt-rock or simply alternative) is a genre of rock music that emerged from the independent music underground of the 1980s and became widely popular in the 1990s and 2000s. In this instance, the word \\"alternative\\" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream rock music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, \\"alternative\\" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk). - The iPod Touch (stylized and marketed as iPod touch) is an iOS-based all-purpose handheld PC designed and marketed by Apple Inc. with a user interface that is touchscreen-based. It can be used as a music and video player, digital camera, handheld game device, and personal digital assistant (PDA). It connects to the Internet only through Wi-Fi base stations, does not use cellular network data, and is therefore not a smartphone, though it has a similar design to the iPhone and is often referred to as the \\"iPhone without a phone\\". Furthermore, it does not fit in Apple's iPhone accessories such as their leather cases. As of May 2013, 100 million iPod Touch units had been sold. It is also the most popular iPod model. - Electronica is an umbrella term that encompasses a broad group of electronic-based styles such as techno, house, ambient, drum and bass, jungle, and industrial dance, among others. It has been used to describe the rise of electronic music styles intended not just for dancing but also concentrated listening. - Mono Band is Noel Hogan 's side project from The Cranberries . The Remixes EP was released on iTunes and various other online music stores . - macOS (pronounced ; previously Mac OS X, then simply OS X) is the current series of Unix-based graphical operating systems developed and marketed by Apple Inc. designed to run on Apple's Macintosh computers, having been preinstalled on all Macs since 2002.

The iTunes Store's revenues in the first quarter of 2011 totalled nearly US1.4 billion; by May 28, 2014, the store had sold 35 billion songs worldwide. - Post-punk (originally \\"new musick\\") is a broad type of rock music that emerged from the punk movement of the 1970s, in which artists departed from punk rock's raw, accessible style to pursue a variety of avant-garde sensibilities. Attempting to break from rock tradition, post-punk artists experimented with sources such as electronic music, black dance music and the avant-garde, as well as novel recording technology and production techniques. The movement also saw the frequent intersection of music with art and politics, as artists incorporated ideas from sources such as modernist literature, critical theory, cinema, and performance art. Accompanying these musical developments were communities that produced independent record labels, visual art, multimedia performances and fanzines in conjunction with the music. - iPhone is a line of smartphones designed and marketed by Apple Inc.

Originating in the 1950s as an alternative to rock and roll, early pop rock was influenced by the beat, arrangements, and style of rock and roll (and sometimes doo wop), but placed a greater emphasis on professional songwriting and recording craft. The detractors of pop rock often deride it as a slick, commercial product, less authentic than rock music. - Indie pop is a subgenre and subculture of alternative/indie rock that originated in the United Kingdom in the late 1970s. The style is inspired by punk's DIY ethic and related ideologies, and it generated a thriving fanzine, label, and club and gig circuit.

Get on the brown, orange or pink lines — it doesn’t matter which color, as long as you sit in the first car by the front-view window — and round the two-square-mile area. If you’re going clockwise, look to the left. Among landmarks you’ll see are Bertrand Goldberg’s spectacular Marina City, the new Trump International Hotel and Tower, Frank Gehry’s Pritzker Pavilion band shell and Louis Sullivan’s historic Auditorium Building. Miss one? No problems. The 2.25 ticket buys unlimited loops. 8 p.m. 2) MIDWAY FARE Credit the recession, but a number of good midprice but high-style restaurants have opened in Chicago in the last two years. A favorite is Gilt Bar (230 West Kinzie Street; 312-464-9544; giltbarchicago.com), a casual restaurant in the River North neighborhood that isn’t casual about its cooking. The menu features New American dishes like blackened cauliflower with capers (7) and ricotta gnocchi with sage and brown butter (13). After dinner, head downstairs to Curio, a basement bar with a Prohibition theme. Try the Death’s Door Daisy, made with artisanal Wisconsin vodka and Aperol, a blood orange liqueur, for 10. 11 p.m. 3) COME ON IN There are so many clubs on Ontario Street, just north of the loop, that it’s sometimes known as Red Bull Row. For a mellower jolt, head to the Uptown neighborhood, to Big Chicks (5024 North Sheridan Road; 773-728-5511; bigchicks.com) a gay bar that welcomes everyone. The drinks are cheap, the crowd is friendly and the décor is appealingly kooky. 9 a.m. 4) FANCY EGGS Couldn’t get to dinner at Frontera Grill, the nouvelle Mexican restaurant owned by the celebrity chef Rick Bayless? No worries. Just head over for breakfast at Xoco (449 North Clark Street; 312-661-1434; rickbayless.com), Mr. Bayless’s newest restaurant. It’s served till 10 a.m.; expect a line after 8:30. Favorites include scrambled egg empanada with poblano chili (3), and an open-face torta with soft poached egg, salsa, cheese, cilantro and black beans (4). Chocolate café au lait (3.25) comes with a single hot, crisp, sugary churro. 11 a.m. 5) OFF-LABEL STRIP The Magnificent Mile area is filled with flagships (Gucci, Vuitton — you know the list). But there are still some independent stores you won’t find at your hometown mall. Ikram (873 North Rush Street; 312-587-1000; ikram.com) is the stylish boutique that counts Michelle Obama among its customers, with fashion-forward labels like Jason Wu and Martin Margiela. East Oak Street has a couple of cool shops, including Sofia (No. 72; 312-640-0878; sofiavintage.com). Next door is Colletti Gallery (No. 102; 312-664-6767; collettigallery.com), with a gorgeous selection of Art Deco and Art Nouveau furniture and objets. It’s a short walk from there to the Museum of Contemporary Art (220 East Chicago Avenue; 312-280-2660; mcachicago.org), which has a spectacular exhibition of works by Alexander Calder — and works inspired by Calder — through Oct. 17. 2 p.m. 6) FIRST NEIGHBORHOOD Walking around Hyde Park, a leafy enclave about seven miles south of the Loop, it’s easy to see why the Obamas settled there. Their house, on South Greenwood Avenue between 50th and 51st Streets, is nearly invisible behind Secret Service barricades. Luckily, the nearby Robie House (5757 South Woodlawn Avenue; 800-514-3849; gowright.org), a Frank Lloyd Wright masterpiece, is open for tours. See if you can find an abstracted male figure in the Japanese-inspired leaded-glass windows. Across the street, the beautifully landscaped University of Chicago campus is worth exploring for an afternoon. 7 p.m. 7) LIVESTOCK MENU Chicago was once the meatpacking capital of the world, and it still knows what to do with offal. Take Girl & the Goat (809 West Randolph Streeet, 312-492-6262; girlandthegoat.com), a much-blogged-about new restaurant where the Top Chef winner Stephanie Izard takes livestock parts seriously. The often-updated menu recently included lamb ribs with grilled avocado and pistachio piccata (17), and braised beef tongue with masa and beef vinaigrette (12). If you’re not a carnivore, try chickpeas three ways (11), and for dessert, potato fritters with lemon poached eggplant and Greek yogurt (8). The soaring dining room, designed by the Chicago design firm 555 International, is warm and modern, with exposed beams, walls of charred cedar and a large open kitchen. Reservations essential. 10 p.m. 8) FUNNY BONE The owners of the Ontourage nightclub (157 West Ontario Street; 312-573-1470; ontouragechicago.com) were tired of waiting until midnight for the crowds to gather, so they began offering comedy shows at 10 on Saturdays. You won’t find big names, but a hit-or-miss roster of itinerant comedians, some who heckle the audience in language that can’t be printed here. Tickets, 10 include admission to the upstairs lounge, where bottle-service vodkas start at 200. 10 a.m. 9) BEAUTIFICATION BRUNCH Logan Square, about five to six miles northwest of the Loop, is a remnant of Chicago’s late-19th-century beautification movement, with a statue of an eagle by Evelyn Longman where two of the grandest boulevards meet. Nearby, Longman & Eagle (2657 North Kedzie Avenue; 773-276-7110; longmanandeagle.com) is a rough-edged bar that serves a refined brunch: a chunky sockeye salmon tartare with pickled mango (10) or a wild boar “Sloppy Joe” (10). Six hotel rooms are set to open upstairs. 1 p.m. 10) GRAND PIANO Chicago knows how to mix neo-classical architecture with contemporary design, and no place does it better than the Art Institute of Chicago (111 South Michigan Avenue; 312-443-3600; artinstituteofchicago.org), which opened its celebrated Modern Wing last year. Designed by Renzo Piano, it the luminous addition contains a magnificent set of galleries for 1900-1950 European art (Picasso, Giacometti, Klee are a few of the big names) and a capacious room for the museum’s design collection. Hungry or not, check out Terzo Piano, the stunning rooftop restaurant with views of the Pritzker Pavilion in Millennium Park across the street. 3 p.m. 11) WHEELS UP From the museum, walk over the pedestrian bridge, also designed by Mr. Piano, to Millennium Park, and rent bikes from Bike and Roll (312-729-1000; bikechicago.com), about 35 a day, for a ride up the shore of Lake Michigan. You’ll pass Navy Pier, skyscrapers by Mies van der Rohe, and hundreds of beach volleyball courts, which make this the Malibu of the Midwest on summer and fall weekends. Along the way, you’ll pass Lincoln Park, with a new pavilion by the Chicago architect Jeanne Gang — another example of how the city is updating its open spaces. Numerous airlines, including Delta, American and United, fly nonstop into Chicago from all three New York-area airports.

The Allegro (171 West Randolph Street, 312-236-0123; allegrochicago.com), a 483-room hotel in the city’s bustling theater district, in the bold style of Kimpton hotels. Rooms from about 149. Opened last year, the Elysian (11 East Walton Street; 312-646-1300; elysianhotels.com) is a cushy 188-room hotel where the beds aren’t made — they’re “draped” in 460-thread-count Rivolta Carmignani linens. From the outside, the building, not far from the Magnificent Mile, resembles a chateau. Rooms start at about 430. This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The 36 Hours column on Page 10 this weekend, about Chicago, misstates the name of a well-known shopping district along Michigan Avenue. It is the Magnificent Mile, not the Miracle Mile. The column also misstates the distance from the Loop to Logan Square and to Hyde Park.Â Logan Square is about five to six miles, not two, and Hyde Park is about seven miles, not four. And the column describes the academic calendar of the University of Chicago incorrectly. The school is on a quarterly system, not semesters.

Step 2: Determine if the relationship between the elements of the premise and hypothesis is logical. - In the premise, the user mentions the temperature was 80 degrees and they went outside without a coat and got a cold. - In the hypothesis, the user states that going outside without a coat is the reason they got a cold. Step 3: Evaluate if the hypothesis is a reasonable conclusion based on the premise. - The premise states a sequence of events: going outside with no coat in 80-degree weather and then getting a cold. - The hypothesis attempts to establish causality between not wearing a coat and getting a cold. Step 4: Determine whether the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. - The hypothesis is attempting to connect two events mentioned in the premise, but there is not enough information available to establish a causal relationship between not wearing a coat and getting a cold. - Catching a cold is typically caused by exposure to a virus and not specifically by ambient temperature or level of clothing. - However, the user believes that not wearing a coat led to the cold, so there is some subjective perception of causality.

The quadratic formula is given by: t = [-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / (2a) In our equation, 0 = -343*t^2 + 4330*t - 291051, we can consider: a = -343 b = 4330 c = -291051 Step 1: Calculate the value of the term under the square root, i.e. b^2 - 4ac. b^2 - 4ac = (4330)^2 - 4*(-343)*(-291051) This simplifies to: b^2 - 4ac = 18748900 - 400037766 = -381288866 Since this value is negative, there are no real roots for the equation, implying that there is no real number solution for t.

If you answered that they are all fruits you are absolutely correct. If you answered that they are all good for your health you are spot on again. Fruits used to be a staple in many diets, however in amongst all of the low carb and anti sugar chaos, many people are now avoiding them. In a rush to rid the diet of ‘toxic sugar’, fruit has fallen on the wayside. However, many studies have shown that fruit is not linked to any adverse health effects, quite the opposite in fact. Most recently researchers in Sweden discovered that eating a diet high in fruits could reduce the risk of an often lethal form of aortic aneurysm. The study collected data from over 80,000 people over a 13 year period and found that people eating at least two whole fruits per day, reduced the risk of developing an abdominal aortic aneurysm by almost a third. The main fruits that were eaten were apples, pears, bananas, oranges and other citrus fruits. The fruits’ high antioxidant levels may offer protection by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation. Eating whole fruits can also reduced the risk of developing diabetes. Earlier this year a study published in the British Medical Journal revealed that certain whole fruits – in particular blueberries, grapes, apples and pears – could lower the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The study found that over an 18-year period, 6.5% of the 187,382 participants developed diabetes, but those consuming at least two serves of fruit per week reduced their risk by up to 23%. In the same study those who consumed two or more serves of fruit juice per day increased their risk of developing diabetes by as much as 21%. As Tim wrote in a previous blog post, this is reason why you should be eating your fruit, not drinking it According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

A grieving husband has been accused of assaulting a traffic warden who tried to ticket cars outside his home while he waited for his wife's funeral cortege. Angry relatives confronted the warden as he was allegedly preparing to issue them fines while they waited for the hearse carrying the body of cancer victim Rena Page, 64. Her stunned husband Mac Page, 66, challenged the official who later reported him to the police for assault. Stunned: Matthew Page, 39, with wife Kerrie outside his family's home where a traffic warden tried to issue tickets as they waited for his mother's funeral cortege. His father is accused of assaulting the warden. Four cars were briefly parked on a. single yellow line outside Mr Page's home in Hunstanton, Norfolk, as. the funeral cars moved into position. The family confronted the official who allegedly carried on noting the cars' details. A funeral director is also reported to have tried to intervene. Angry family members admit they challenged the warden but were stunned to later learn he had reported widower Mr Page for assault. Mr Page, a self-employed gardener, said yesterday: 'I can’t describe how I felt really. It was bad enough to bury someone at 64 after 48 years of marriage. This bloke didn’t show any compassion at all. Mourned: Relatives of Rena Page, 64, who died of cancer, have accused the warden of behaving heartlessly. 'If it was the middle of the season and there were lots of cars about, I could at least understand it a little bit, but he was just being a jobsworth. The last three years - watching my wife die of cancer - have been quite horrendous, now we have this to deal with on top. 'What I couldn’t believe is that when we rang to complain, his boss backed him up. How can anyone in authority back somebody like that up? It beggars belief.' Mr Page said he was happy to appear in court to give his version of events. His son Matthew Page, 39, who runs a chip shop, added: 'There was just a total lack of respect - and they wonder why they get a bad name. The worst thing was Mum never liked a fuss. This turned it all into a debacle. I cannot believe someone could be so insensitive.' Funeral director John Lincoln, who was leading the cortege, said: 'I have never known anything like this before. He might lose someone one day and I wonder how he would react if this sort of thing happened to him.' A West Norfolk Council spokesman confirmed discretion exists within its parking rules for occasions such as funerals, but refused to apologise until the outcome of the police investigation into the assault was known. The spokesman said: 'Following the incident referred to, a member of our staff reported an assault and the matter is now with the police. We await the outcome of any subsequent investigations.' The spokesman said no tickets were issued during the incident but that vehicles attending a funeral, 'are not exempt from parking rules. When we are made aware of a funeral, we work to accommodate the hearse and funeral cortege respectfully,' he added.Father-of-two Matthew Page has lodged an official complaint with the council.

On the night of 22/23 July 1940, Flying Officer Cyril Ashfield (pilot), Pilot Officer Geoffrey Morris (Observer) and Flight Sergeant Reginald Leyland (Air Intercept radar operator) of the Fighter Interception Unit became the first pilot and crew to intercept and destroy an enemy aircraft using onboard radar to guide them to a visual interception, when their AI night fighter brought down a Do 17 off Sussex. On 19 November 1940 the famous RAF night fighter ace John Cunningham shot down a Ju 88 bomber using airborne radar, just as Dowding had predicted.

Your job is to translate the Hebrew sentence into Arabic. אז הרבה אנשים יאמרו לכם שצלילת מערות היא אחד התחומים המסוכנים ביותר שיש.","response":"First, we should identify the terms and structure of the given Hebrew sentence. The sentence translates to \\"So many people will tell you that cave diving is one of the most dangerous fields there is.\\" Now, the goal is to translate this sentence into Arabic while keeping the original meaning and structure. Here's the step-by-step approach to using the definition of each word to create the Arabic translation: 1. Start by identifying the key words and phrases in the Hebrew sentence: \\"אז\\" (so), \\"הרבה אנשים\\" (many people), \\"יאמרו לכם\\" (will tell you), \\"שצלילת מערות\\" (that cave diving), \\"היא\\" (is), \\"אחד התחומים המסוכנים ביותר שיש\\" (one of the most dangerous fields there is). 2. Translate these keywords into Arabic: \\"אז\\" (فإن), \\"הרבה אנשים\\" (الكثير من الناس), \\"יאמרו לכם\\" (سيقولون لكم), \\"שצלילת מערות\\" (أن غوص الكهوف), \\"היא\\" (هي), \\"אחד התחומים המסוכנים ביותר שיש\\" (من أخطر المجالات الموجودة) 3. Arrange the translated Arabic words to form a coherent sentence that mirrors the Hebrew sentence structure: \\" فإن الكثير من الناس سيقولون لكم أن غوص الكهوف هي من أخطر المجالات الموجودة.\\" By using this approach, we have successfully translated the Hebrew sentence to Arabic while maintaining its original meaning and sentence structure."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: Given a sentence and an entity, the task is to select the authors sentiment towards the enity.

And the answer is?","response":"To find the answer to this trivia question, we should start by understanding what we're looking for. The question asks us for the ballet by Prokofiev that serves as the theme for the television show 'The Apprentice'. Step 1: Identify the theme for 'The Apprentice'. The theme used in \\"The Apprentice\\" television show is titled \\"For the Love of Money\\" by The O'Jays. Step 2: Research the connection between \\"For the Love of Money\\" and Prokofiev's ballets. Upon researching, we'll find that there's no direct connection between \\"For the Love of Money\\" by The O'Jays and any of Prokofiev's ballets. On the other hand, \\"Dance of the Knights\\" from Prokofiev's ballet \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" is famously known for its use in the UK version of 'The Apprentice'. Step 3: Determine the correct answer. There seems to be a misconception in the question itself, as the theme for the television show 'The Apprentice' in its American version is not from a ballet by Prokofiev.

The Aztec people were certain ethnic groups of central Mexico, particularly those groups who spoke the Nahuatl language and who dominated large parts of Mesoamerica from the 14th to the 16th centuries. Aztec culture is the culture of the people referred to as Aztecs, but since most ethnic groups of central Mexico in the postclassic period shared basic cultural traits, many of the traits that characterize Aztec culture cannot be said to be exclusive to the Aztecs. For the same reason, the notion of \\"Aztec civilization\\" is best understood as a particular horizon of a general Mesoamerican civilization. In the first 50 years after the founding of the Mexica dynasty, the Mexica were a tributary of Azcapotzalco, which had become a major regional power under the ruler Tezozomoc. The Mexica supplied the Tepaneca with warriors for their successful conquest campaigns in the region and received part of the tribute from the conquered city states. In this way, the prestige and economy of Tenochtitlan gradually grew. In 1396, at Acamapichtli's death, his son Huitzilihhuitl (Nahuatl: \\"Hummingbird feather\\") became ruler; married to Tezozomoc's daughter, the relation with Azcapotzalco remained close. Chimalpopoca (Nahuatl: \\"She smokes like a shield\\"), son of Huitzilihhuitl, became ruler of Tenochtitlan in 1417. In 1418, Azcapotzalco initiated a war against the Acolhua of Texcoco and killed their ruler Ixtlilxochitl. Even though Ixtlilxochitl was married to Chimalpopoca's daughter, the Mexica ruler continued to support Tezozomoc. Tezozomoc died in 1426, and his sons began a struggle for rulership of Azcapotzalco. During this struggle for power, Chimalpopoca died, probably killed by Tezozomoc's son Maxtla who saw him as a competitor. Itzcoatl, brother of Huitzilihhuitl and uncle of Chimalpopoca, was elected the next Mexica tlatoani. The Mexica were now in open war with Azcapotzalco and Itzcoatl petitioned for an alliance with Nezahualcoyotl, son of the slain Texcocan ruler Ixtlilxochitl against Maxtla. Itzcoatl also allied with Maxtla's brother Totoquihuaztli ruler of the Tepanec city of Tlacopan. The Triple Alliance of Tenochtitlan, Texcoco and Tlacopan besieged Azcapotzalco, and in 1428 they destroyed the city and sacrificed Maxtla. Through this victory Tenochtitlan became the dominant city state in the Valley of Mexico, and the alliance between the three cities provided the basis on which the Aztec Empire was built. Itzcoatl proceeded by securing a power basis for Tenochtitlan, by conquering the city-states on the southern lake - including Colhuacan, Xochimilco, Cuitlahuac and Mizquic. These states had an economy based on highly productive chinampa agriculture, cultivating floating gardens in the shallow lake Xochimilco. Itzcoatl then undertook further conquests in the valley of Morelos, subjecting the city state of Cuauhnahuac (today Cuernavaca). Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What lakes did the peple conqured are called","response":"The lakes mentioned in the text are not directly quoted from an article.

A group of scientists and hospital administrators, under the direction of the Ministry of Public Welfare, have developed the Z-001: a computerized hospital bed with robotic features.[2][3] The Z-001 takes complete care of the patient: it can dispense food and medicine, remove excretory waste, bathe and exercise the patient lying within its frame. The bed is driven by its own built-in nuclear power reactorâand in the event of an atomic meltdown, the bed (including the patient lying within) would become automatically sealed in concrete.[4] The first patient to be \\"volunteered\\" to test the bed is a dying widower named Kiyuro Takazawa. He is an invalid who is cared for by a young nursing student named Haruko.[5] The electronic elements within the Z-001 somehow manage to transcribe Takazawa's thoughts through Haruko's office computer, and he uses the communication to cry for help.[4] Although she objects to such treatment of elderly patients, Haruko begrudgingly seeks the aid of a group of computer hackers in the hospital's geriatric ward to create and install a vocal simulation of Takazawa's deceased wife in the Z-001.[2][3] However, once Takazawa wishes to go to the beach, the Z-001 detaches itself from its moorings and escapes from the hospital with the man in its grasp.[2][6] Haruko's fears are then justified, as it is discovered that the bed is actually a government-designed, experimental weapons robot.[3][5]","response":"In the movie plot of Roujin Z, the person on the sick bed is Kiyuro Takazawa, a dying widower and invalid who is being cared for by a young nursing student named Haruko.

Listen to what your teacher says closely. Many times, teachers will drop clues to what will be covered on the test. These hints can range from going over the information multiple times, using words like \\"important\\" or \\"key\\" when covering an idea, to even saying, \\"This will be on the exam.\\" Write down everything you think is important. The more you write down during class, the better prepared you will be for the test. Review your notes each day. Don't cram. Waiting until the night before an exam only hurts you. Cramming will sometimes give you a passing grade, but it is not an effective, reliable study method. Students who study consistently, but in shorter amounts of time, do better in school. To avoid cramming, read your notes daily so you learn the information as you go along. Even if the teacher gives you one, make your own outline for the information covered on the test. Include the main concepts and ideas that will be covered on the test. Include examples, definitions, formulas, and other pertinent information. Make your own questions to test yourself. If you know there will be an essay on the test, then come up with essay questions and answers. Study with another student in the class and ask each other questions about the material. Make flashcards. Place definitions, concepts, themes, dates, and formulas on flashcards to quiz yourself. Reword concepts on your study guide. Many teachers ask information in different ways to see how well your synthesis of the material is. Think of other ways questions might be asked or another way a concept could be presented on the exam. You should never ignore the information until the date of the exam. You should review the information daily and weekly to begin committing it to memory and begin fully understanding the information. As the exam date approaches, allot more time for studying that subject. You may need some additional time to brush up on certain ideas or do a more comprehensive look at the material. Don't wait until the last minute to study for a test. When you know a test is coming up, start studying for it a week before the exam date. Don't wait on the teacher to give you a study guide to begin studying. Reread the chapter, review your notes, learn definitions and formulas. Don't stay up all night before an exam. If you are tired, you will not do well. Get a good night's sleep, eat a nutritious breakfast and lunch, and come to class early. Coming to class on time also ensures that you are not late to the exam. If the teacher gives any tips, flash reviews, or provides additional information, you will be in class to hear it. A common mistake students make is not reading the instructions or the questions carefully, and then making errors on the test. Take your time as you take the test. Read the directions for each section, then read each question. Ask your teacher if you are unclear about a question on the test. When you take a test, you neither want to rush or work too slow. Think about how long you have to finish, the number of questions, and the types of questions. You may want to tackle difficult or long sections first. If an essay is worth 1/4 of your overall test grade, you might want to write that first. Another strategy is to answer easy questions, saving questions you are unsure about for last. Many times, our initial impressions are correct, but then we second-guess ourselves until we write down the wrong answer. If you have a gut reaction to a question, then trust that instinct.

We think so much of this quality that we call a kind man \\"human\\"-that is, man-like in his conduct, first to other men, and afterwards to all living things.

We ourselves are trained by pains as well as by pleasures; so too, punishment is sometimes needed to train our dogs and horses to obey us.

This draft, which was completed in 1957, is set 20 years after the time period depicted in To Kill a Mockingbird but is not a continuation of the narrative. This earlier version of the story follows an adult Scout Finch who travels from New York to visit her father, Atticus Finch, in Maycomb, Alabama, where she is confronted by the intolerance in her community. The Watchman manuscript was believed to have been lost until Lee's lawyer Tonja Carter discovered it; although this claim has been widely disputed.

Swift's personal life is the subject of constant media attention. In 2013, Abercrombie & Fitch marketed a slogan T-shirt with a \\"slut-shaming\\" remark directed toward her. The New York Times asserted that her \\"dating history has begun to stir what feels like the beginning of a backlash\\" and questioned whether Swift was in the midst of a \\"quarter-life crisis\\". Swift has said that she is unwilling to discuss her personal life in public, as she believes that talking about it can be \\"a career weakness\\". Rolling Stone remarks upon her polite manner: \\"If this is Swift's game face, it must be tattooed on because it never drops.\\" The magazine also takes note of her \\"ease with glad-handing\\", and The Hollywood Reporter credits her as \\"the Best People Person since Bill Clinton\\". While presenting Swift an award for her humanitarian endeavors in 2012, Michelle Obama described her as a singer who \\"has rocketed to the top of the music industry but still keeps her feet on the ground, someone who has shattered every expectation of what a 22-year-old can accomplish\\". Swift considers Michelle Obama to be a role model. Swift is one of the most followed people on social media, and is known for her friendly interactions with her fans. She has delivered holiday gifts to fans by mail and in person, dubbed \\"Swiftmas\\". She considers it her \\"responsibility\\" to be conscious of her influence on young fans, and has said that her fans are \\"the longest and best relationship I have ever had\\".Often described by the media as \\"America's Sweetheart\\", Swift insists that \\"I don't live by all these rigid, weird rules that make me feel all fenced in. I just like the way that I feel like, and that makes me feel very free\\". She refuses to take part in overly sexualized photo-shoots, although Bloomberg L.P. views her as a sex symbol. Swift was named an Icon of American Style by Vogue in 2011. In 2014 she topped People's annual best dressed list.

In the 1920s, we learned that these conditions could usually be treated easily with the addition of iodide anion to the diet. One easy way to increase iodide intake was to add the anion to table salt. This simple step greatly enhanced health and development. Large amounts of iodide ion are also found in seaweed such as kelp (see picture above) and saltwater fish. Now, I have a new situation: People from two villages ate lots of salt.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose a person is at high altitude happens, how will it affect \\"LESS oxygen being brought to the bodys cells\\". Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","response":"Yes, the perturbation of being at high altitude does have a direct effect on the process of oxygen reaching the body's cells. At higher altitudes, the atmospheric pressure is lower, which means that there is less oxygen available in the air for the body to take in. This situation can lead to a condition known as hypoxia, where there is insufficient oxygen to meet the body's needs. Here's the detailed impact on the process: 1. Oxygen enters the body through the mouth or nose: At high altitudes, the air is thinner and contains less oxygen. When a person breathes in, they will inhale a lower concentration of oxygen as compared to sea level. This reduces the amount of oxygen available for the body. 2. The oxygen travels into the lungs: The lower oxygen levels in the air lead to lower partial pressure of oxygen in the lungs. This creates a smaller driving force for oxygen to diffuse from the alveoli (small air sacs in the lungs) into the bloodstream. 3. The oxygen binds to hemoglobin proteins within erythrocytes (red blood cells): With lower oxygen partial pressure, the binding of oxygen to hemoglobin is reduced. As a result, the oxygen-carrying capacity of the erythrocytes is diminished, leading to lower levels of oxygenated blood. 4. The erythrocytes are pumped through the body by the heart: The heart will need to pump faster and harder to deliver the required oxygen to the body's tissues, as the amount of oxygen in each erythrocyte is less than at lower altitudes. This increased demand for oxygen supply might result in a higher heart rate. 5. All cells receive the oxygen: Due to the reduced oxygen-carrying capacity and increased demand, cells in the body may not receive an adequate amount of oxygen. This can limit the cellular function and impair various bodily processes, leading to symptoms like fatigue, dizziness, and shortness of breath. To adapt to high altitudes, the body undergoes various physiological changes, such as increased production of erythrocytes and the release of certain hormones that help to improve oxygen transport. However, depending on the degree of altitude and duration of exposure, these adaptations may not be sufficient, and individuals may still experience the effects of hypoxia."},{"question":"I know that the answer to the question \\"What does MLB stand for?\\" is in \\"On April 23, 2008, against the Colorado Rockies, the Cubs recorded the 10,000th regular-season win in their franchise's history dating back to the beginning of the National League in 1876.

The home-schooling trend began in the U.S.in the 1980s with parents keeping their children out of public schools so they could provide religious education at home. Today,as the home-schooling trend continues to grow,parents are more likely to consider home schooling as an option because they believe schools don't do a very good job of teaching and are occasionally dangerous places.But can parents really do a better job?

Context: When she's in the mood to push my buttons, my significant other, the delightful and charming Ms. D, frequently alludes to the questionable timeline concerning my birth date. She derives much mirth from the fact that I was born something less than nine or ten months after my parents wed and hints that this indicates a certain amount of premarital hanky-panky. Standing on my dignity ('cause it's higher than the coffee table), my reply is that I have it on good authority that I owe my early entry into the world to Tabusintac Hill. Said hill was once considered to be an abomination of the first water. The Tabusintac, like all hills, had an up and a down. In this case, the up and down were distinguished from each other by a sharp curve at the bottom. The main North/South New Brunswick highway slavishly followed the hill's contours. If you were heading north, the road led you into a ravine and you were faced with a steep uphill incline that, in winter presented a challenge to at least half the vehicles trying to climb it. In true snow country fashion, steep, icy hills were conquered by getting a running start, building up a lot of speed and praying that Mr. Newton's rules concerning inertia would work in your favour. Headed south, the problem became keeping your car under control so that you didn't go shooting into the trees when the road curved to the left. My parents were taking a trip to the Miramachi in December of '56 and were driving a Pontiac borrowed from one of my father's friends. My mother was pregnant with a bundle of bad attitude and misery that would turn out to be me. I assume that my father was driving with that mix of panache and insouciance that my mother tended to describe as reckless behaviour. In any case, as he rounded the corner at the top of the hill, the road was apparently free of snow and ice and there was no reason to slowdown. Until the moose stepped out onto the road just ahead of them. Question: what I responded to mrs D Options: A. I owe my early entry into the world to Tabusintac Hill B.

It's impossible to say. While it is true that Hipmunk received increased media attention after Google announced its flight search service in September 2011, there isn't enough information provided to conclusively determine if Hipmunk's media attention was still quite low despite the increase. Several factors can affect media attention, such as marketing efforts, competition within the online travel industry, and the changing landscape of technology. To make a more accurate assessment of Hipmunk's media attention, we would need to analyze data about its coverage in various media outlets, comparative growth trends, and its performance against competitors during that period. Additionally, \\"quite low\\" is a relative term, and to properly evaluate whether Hipmunk's media attention was still relatively low, we would need to establish a baseline or reference point for comparison. For example, comparing Hipmunk's media attention to a well-established online travel company or an industry average would help provide a better understanding of the level of Hipmunk's media presence during that time. In summary, while Hipmunk did experience increased media attention following Google's announcement, there is not enough information provided to definitively state whether this attention remained relatively low despite the increase."},{"question":"Here is a news article: JUNCTION CITY, Kan.

Start off with a brand new blade, since you will most likely have a whole lot of hair to get rid of. Keep a few extra replacement heads on hand in case the original blades begin to dull during your shave. Rinse the blades under hot water before you start. This will lubricate them and provide a smoother shave. Take another shower while you shave. Or draw a bath. Or simply sit on the rim and use the tub to catch your hairs as you shave them off. This way, all you have to do to clean up is simply wash the hairs down the pipes. Although you could also use the tub to catch your hairs when you first trim them with the scissors or electric groomer as part of your prep, these longer hairs are more likely to clog your drain. Use a shaving cream that forms a nice, thick, easy-to-spot lather. Avoid thinner, translucent, or transparent creams, which may make it easier for you to miss spots. Remember that, unlike your face, you will be shaving areas that you will have to bend and twist to see. Make the job easier by using a product that catches the eye. If this is your first time, shaving both legs will probably take a while. To keep your lather from drying out, break each leg up into parts (left calf, right calf, etc.). Only lather the area that you plan to start with. Then, once that area has been shaved, lather and shave the next, and so on. For best results, pick a product that is rich in lubricants and moisturizers. Avoid lower-tier brands that create excessive foam. With so much area to cover, this project is going to take time. Consider how well you handle lengthy projects in general. Come up with an attack plan. Think about the following: Thicker areas will likely clog and/or dull your razor right from the start. Starting with the thinnest patches of hairs will probably extend a blade’s usefulness. Unlike shaving your face, you will be dealing with areas that are hard to see. Also, if you are shaving your genitals along with your legs, you undoubtedly want to treat these with extra care. If you tend to rush projects as you approach the end, start with these more delicate tasks and leave the easy stuff for later. Keep your strokes short to prevent your blades from clogging. Rinse the razor frequently under hot water to remove hairs and shaving cream. Keep your pressure on the blade as light as possible. Replace the blades if you are unable to remove hairs without applying a great deal of pressure, since this probably means they are either too dull or too clogged to be any good. To avoid nicks, razor bumps, and irritation, shave with the grain, in the direction that your hair grows. But if what you want is the closest shave possible, shave against the grain.

She lives a seemingly ordinary life - working her 9-to-5 job, grabbing happy hour drinks with her coworkers, and coming home to her loving husband, SAM, and their golden retriever, TUCKER. Things take a turn for the bizarre when LILY begins to investigate a recent string of insurance claims related to a mysterious and unexplained phenomenon – all involving homes in the local area being mysteriously vandalized and destroyed. Determined to uncover the cause, LILY delves deep into each case, getting more and more invested as she discovers that every victim shares a connection to a secret local organization called \\"The Redemption Club\\". She finds their emblem – depicting a burning house shaped like a lily flower – at every scene of the incidents. Meanwhile, LILY starts to struggle with vivid, nightmarish dreams that seem to be telling her something about her past. She begins sleepwalking and finds herself at the scenes of the incidents, unable to explain why or how she got there. These incidents put a strain on her relationship with SAM, who's worried about her well-being and encourages her to seek therapy. Undeterred by her personal struggles, LILY discovers that \\"The Redemption Club\\" is an underground group that believes in a twisted form of justice, punishing individuals for their perceived crimes. It accuses its victims of causing suffering to innocents and makes them pay by destroying their homes, leaving them with almost nothing. LILY uses her position at the insurance company to dig deeper into the files and find more connections to The Redemption Club. She reveals some hidden truths about several powerful members of the town, including the mayor and her boss, demonstrating their involvement in the organization and participation in acts of violence. As LILY uncovers the truth, she learns a shocking revelation – the victims were all pivotal figures in an incident from her own past, an event that caused her immense trauma and grief which she had suppressed all these years. Upon discovering this, LILY becomes conflicted between her sense of justice and her newfound desire for revenge. Reeling from her discoveries, LILY decides to expose the truth behind \\"The Redemption Club\\" once and for all, knowing that it would make her their next target. LILY and SAM, working together, set a trap for the group's members, luring them into a final confrontation during which their identities are revealed and their twisted sense of justice is laid bare. Despite their nefarious motives and the personal tragedy they have caused, LILY refuses to let her desire for revenge consume her. Instead, she exposes them to the public, leading to the group's disbandment and the arrest of its members. The film ends with LILY and SAM working to rebuild their life together and finding closure for their past traumas. However, the legacy of \\"The Redemption Club\\" lingers, leaving the ominous question of whether others may take up their cause — or if the darkness within LILY could awaken again."},{"question":"Answer the following question: FINAL EXAM Question 1.

Movie title: My Life In Ruins Context: Georgia (Nia Vardalos) is a Greek American teacher who came to Greece to teach at a local college about Classic Greece. However, budget cuts caused her to be laid off and forced her to get a job as tour guide. She believes she has hit rock bottom when she loses her passion in everything. Informed by her boss, Maria (Bernice Stegers), that she ranks poorly as a guide because the tourists think she's boring, Georgia finds herself leading a tour around Greece with an assorted group of misfit tourists whom she believes is a failure since they seem to care more about buying T-shirts than learning about history and culture. Instead, she wishes to have a good group of Canadian tourists whom seems to be more engaged in history and culture than wanting to go shopping for souvenirs and hang out at the beach. Maria disagrees with Georgia's assessment, informing her that they are more interested in Nico (Alistair McGowan), a rival male tour guide also working for Maria because he's engaging in tours. As Georgia's tour departs, her driver is injured in an accident and is replaced by another driver, Poupi (Alexis Georgoulis). In a clash of personalities and cultures, everything seems to go wrong and Georgia is on the verge of quitting as she can't connect with the group to get them to appreciate Greece and its culture. This is made worse when she voices her disgust with Maria for favoring Nico over her in letting his group stay in better hotels than her group. After being ignored again, Georgia decides to send a letter to inform her that she's quitting at the end of her tour. One day, an older traveller named Irv Gideon (Richard Dreyfuss), helps Georgia see why she can't connect with the group: she finds them annoying and is bored with her current job.

But the really next-level stuff, from a small handful of VR content innovators, is not yet available to the public, and can only be seen via private condos and mobile demo teams around this ski resort town. A standout among them is Allumette, the latest creation of Penrose Studios, a small startup comprised of Oculus Rift, DreamWorks and Pixar alumni including Eugene Chung, founder and CEO, who was previously Head of Film & Media at Oculus VR. SEE ALSO: Samsung is getting into the virtual reality movie production game At the Park City residence where the Penrose team is staying through the fest, Mashable got a sneak peek this week at Allumette, the story of a little girl who comes to possess a handful of magical matchstick wands in a Venice-like city that floats among the clouds. The narrative (which the company describes as \\"love, sacrifice and an infinite bond between an orphan and her mother\\") does not entirely reveal itself in the roughly six-minute demo, but will once it expands to the planned 20-minute feature — much longer than the average VR movie. Also unique to Allumette is the incorporation of a controller, which puts one of the magic matchsticks in your hand. Though hand-controls are common in VR gaming (obviously) and experiential modes, this is the first narrative to use the added feature. Allumette herself is as tiny as a doll — though you can scale her up by walking the headset up close, from a standing position, she looks a bit like one of the stop-motion characters from a Laika Studios film (Caroline, Paranorman, The Boxtrolls). As you move about the space you can explore the city's stone bridge, its buildings and other features up close; at one point a flying ship comes onto the scene, and as Allumette boards it, you can plunge the headset into its clock-like innerworkings for a look around. Chung preaches \\"presence\\" in his company's creations — the idea that, deep down, as you're having the experience, you should feel that the objects are truly in front of you. To his credit, there is an incredible temptation to reach out and touch the objects and characters; the only thing that stopped me from trying was that I didn't want to look silly in front of the other people in the room. CEO Eugene Chung at the Penrose Studios in San Francisco. Chung directed and produced Allumette, which will be available for consumers later this year on several VR platforms, including the Oculus Rift, Sony PlayStation VR and HTC Vive. Allumette is actually Penrose's second VR feature; the first, also an animated CG feature called The Rose and I, was part of the New Frontiers section at Sundance this year and debuted at Tribeca Film Festival in 2015. Interestingly enough, as Allumette is being billed as a VR \\"film,\\" Penrose has created movie-like posters, right down to the aspect ratio and font, to help promote it (see above and below). As of now, distribution for Allumette — and other \\"VR films\\" is still being worked out, as the business models have not completely emerged yet. But expect that to change by the time Sundance rolls around again next year, and likely with twice as many VR installations as the year before. Have something to say about this story?

Answer:","response":"\\"Emerald Sting: The Green Hornet Chronicles\\""},{"question":"Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? acute writing","response":"The phrase \\"acute writing\\" can be considered positive or negative, depending on the context in which it is used. To better understand this, we should first clarify the meaning of both words. \\"Acute\\" is an adjective with various meanings, including: 1. Sharp or penetrating in intellect, insight, or perception: an acute observer. 2. Extremely sensitive even to slight details or impressions: acute hearing. 3. Intense, severe, or serious: acute pain; an acute illness. 4. (of an angle) less than 90 degrees. 5. Keenly perceptive or discerning: an acute sense of humor. \\"Writing\\" refers to the act or process of representing ideas, thoughts, or information in written form, or the written work produced as a result of this act. Now, when combining the two words, \\"acute writing\\" could be interpreted as: 1. Writing that demonstrates a sharp and penetrating intellect, insight, or perception. This interpretation would be considered a positive appraisal of the writing in question, as it indicates the writer has effectively conveyed their ideas with a strong understanding and heightened awareness. 2. Writing that is extremely sensitive to details or impressions. In this case, the phrase could be considered positive, implying that the writing forms a vivid and meticulous picture of the subject matter. 3. The phrase could also be seen as negative if it refers to writing that causes an intense, severe, or serious reaction from the reader. This could imply that the subject matter or the manner in which it was written had a profoundly negative impact on the reader, resulting in distress or discomfort. 4. If used to describe the style or angle taken in writing, the phrase might be considered negative, implying that the author's approach was limited or narrow-minded. This interpretation is less common, but it's worth considering based on the specific context in which \\"acute writing\\" is used. In summary, the phrase \\"acute writing\\" could be considered either positive or negative, largely depending on the context and interpretation. If it celebrates the sharpness, penetration, or sensitivity of the writing to details and impressions, it is likely positive. However, if used to refer to a profoundly negative impact on the reader or a limited angle taken in writing, it could be seen as negative. To fully determine the phrase's intended meaning, you would need to examine the surrounding language and any additional information available."},{"question":"Briefly summarize this sentence: iraq said friday it was ready to resume limited oil exports in september after the un sanctions committee approved technical guidelines for an oil-for-food deal .","response":"Iraq announced on Friday that they will start a small amount of oil export in September because the United Nations committee allowed them to trade oil for food."},{"question":"Goal: What kind of paper can be used to smooth woodworking projects? Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal?","response":"As an AI, I cannot perform a task but I can suggest which method to use. However, you did not provide any specific methods to choose from. But, to achieve your goal i.e., to know what kind of paper can be used to smooth woodworking projects: 1. Understand your task: Your task is to find out what kind of paper is suitable for smoothing woodworking projects. This refers typically to a form of paper commonly known as 'sandpaper'. 2. Identify your resources: As an AI, I can perform extensive searches and data analysis on the internet to provide you accurate information. 3. Perform task: Based on my understanding of the task and my capabilities, I conclude that Sandpaper is the right kind of paper to use to smooth woodworking projects. It comes in various grits (levels of abrasiveness). - Lower numbers like 40 or 80 grit are coarse and suitable for removing material quickly and smoothing out rough cuts. - Midrange numbers like 100 to 150 are good for further smoothing a piece and unwinding the roughness that the heavy grit sandpaper left behind. - Higher numbers like 220 grit are very fine and help to create a very smooth surface finish. 4. Deliver Results: Thus, for smoothing woodworking projects, you would likely start with a lower grit sandpaper and progressively move to higher numbers as the workpiece gets smoother. Reasons for each step: - Understanding the task gets me clear on what needs to be done. - Identifying resources adds more accuracy to my findings. - Evaluating the task ensures I'm providing the right information. - Delivering results helps get the user to his goal."},{"question":"Read the following context and answer the question.

Rinse the carafe with warm water and refill the feeder. Keep ants away by filling the feeder’s ant moat with water.","response":"Title: Keeping Your Hummingbird Feeder Clean and Efficient: A Step-by-Step Guide Introduction Hummingbirds are fascinating and enchanting birds that bring joy and liveliness to any garden. Attracting these delightful creatures to your yard can be easily done by setting up a hummingbird feeder filled with delicious, homemade nectar. This article will provide you with a step-by-step guide on how to create a simple sugar and water nectar for your feeder, maintain the feeder's cleanliness, and keep pesky ants at bay. Step 1: Creating the Perfect Homemade Nectar To create a delicious and nutritious nectar for your hummingbirds to enjoy, follow these simple steps to create a sugar and water solution. 1. Combine four parts water with one part white granulated sugar. For example, mix 4 cups of water with 1 cup of sugar. 2. Stir the mixture until all the sugar is dissolved. 3. You can heat the mixture a bit to help dissolve the sugar completely, but be sure to let it cool down to room temperature before filling the feeder. 4. Store any extra nectar in the refrigerator for up to two weeks. Step 2: Maintaining Your Hummingbird Feeder Regular cleaning is essential for maintaining a healthy environment for your hummingbirds. A dirty feeder can lead to the growth of bacteria, which can be harmful to the birds. 1. Empty the feeder of any remaining nectar once a week, or more frequently if you notice it becoming cloudy or moldy. 2. Mix equal parts of vinegar and warm water to create a cleaning solution. 3. Use a bottle brush or a toothbrush to scrub the feeder, ensuring that you clean all nooks and crannies where mold and bacteria can hide. 4. Rinse the feeder thoroughly with warm water, making sure that there's no lingering vinegar residue. Step 3: Refilling Your Hummingbird Feeder Now that your hummingbird feeder is clean and bacteria-free, it's time to refill it with your homemade nectar. 1. Shake the stored nectar well before use, especially if it has been sitting in the refrigerator. 2. Pour the nectar into the feeder's carafe, leaving a little space at the top to prevent overflows when the feeder's lid is attached. 3. Attach the lid securely and hang the feeder in your desired location. Step 4: Keeping Away Unwanted Visitors While hummingbirds enjoy the sweet nectar, so do ants. To keep ants from reaching the nectar and contaminating the feeder, follow this simple strategy: 1. Fill the feeder's ant moat (if it has one) with water. The ant moat is a small basin or barrier usually located near the top of the feeder. This will act as a natural barrier, preventing ants from crossing over the water and reaching the nectar. Conclusion By following these simple steps and keeping your hummingbird feeder clean and well-maintained, you can attract these captivating birds to your garden and enjoy their beautiful company throughout the season. Remember to create the perfect homemade nectar, clean the feeder weekly, and keep those pesky ants away for the utmost enjoyment of these delightful creatures."},{"question":"Read the below conversation.

His long career mirrored changes in American entertainment tastes and technology. He started in the age of minstrel shows and moved to vaudeville, Broadway, the recording industry, Hollywood, radio, and television. Context: In 1928, a white impresario, Lew Leslie, produced Blackbirds of 1928 on Broadway, a black revue for white audiences starring Adelaide Hall and Bill Robinson along with Aida Ward, Tim Moore and other black stars. The show was a huge success on Broadway, where it ran for over one year to sell-out performances. On stage, Adelaide Hall and Robinson danced and sang a duet together, which captivated the audiences. From then on, Robinson's public role was that of a dapper, smiling, plaid-suited ambassador to the white world, maintaining a connection with the black show-business circles through his continuing patronage of the Hoofers Club, an entertainer's haven in Harlem. So successful was Adelaide Hall's collaboration with Bojangles, they even appeared together on stage at the prestigious Palace Theatre (Broadway) before they were teamed up together again by Marty Forkins (Robinson's manager) to star in another Broadway musical titled, \\"Brown Buddies\\", that opened in 1930 at the Liberty Theatre, where it ran for four months before commencing a road tour of the States. In 1939, Robinson returned to the stage in The Hot Mikado, a jazz version of the Gilbert and Sullivan operetta. The show opened at the Broadhurst Theatre, with Robinson cast in the role of the Emperor. His rendition of My Object All Sublime stopped the show and produced eight encores. After Broadway, the show moved to the 1939 New York World's Fair, and was one of the greatest hits of the fair. August 25, 1939, was named Bill Robinson Day at the fair. Robinson's next Broadway show, All in Fun (1940), was with an all-white cast. Despite having Imogene Coca, Pert Kelton, and other stars, the show received poor reviews at out-of-town tryouts in New Haven and Boston. When the white stars and co-producers, Phil Baker and Leonard Sillman, withdrew, Robinson became the star, the first time an African-American headlined an otherwise all-white production. Although the reviewers were enthusiastic about Robinson, they panned the show, and it failed to attract audiences. All in Fun closed after four performances. Question: Did he go on to have more broadway shows after the third one? Answer:","response":"Yes, after the third Broadway show, Bill \\"Bojangles\\" Robinson continued to perform in more shows. For example, he was in the show All in Fun (1940), which was his first time as the lead in an otherwise all-white production. Although the show didn't do very well, Bill Robinson continued to be a successful and talented performer in the entertainment industry."},{"question":"In many countries where Visa card are issued they made customer service available Can you repeat this sentence, but add in punctuation?","response":"In many countries where Visa cards are issued, they made customer service available."},{"question":"Tweet: Yay powers back Predict the sentiment of this tweet.","response":"The analysis of this tweet's sentiment is quite positive.

Context: ROLAND HELD HIS BODY STIFF AS HE FACED THE CATHAR FORTRESS and watched the tall wooden doors swing open. He saw now that the fire of that final night's battle, now fifteen days past, had left no structure standing but the stone keep. Inside the limestone walls stood forlorn, crude shelters made of tent cloths spread over blackened beams. Cries of farewell and loud wailing came from the battlements above and from the open gateway, as the condemned emerged from the fortress, a long line of men and women in black. Roland's heartbeat broke its rhythm. During the fifteen days of grace granted under the terms of surrender, he had waited in camp with the other crusaders. Now that Diane and Perrin were safely off on the road to Paris, he felt impelled to be with the Cathars in their final moments, to bear witness. He had volunteered, despite his dread, to help escort the prisoners to their execution. Those Cathars who joined the Catholic religion would now be allowed to leave in peace, though they would be forced to give everything they owned to the Church and wear the yellow crosses for the rest of their lives. But those who clung to their faith would die. As the Cathars emerged, a man-at-arms directed each to stop at a table beside the doorway, where two Dominican friars sat with parchment scrolls. The friars recorded the name of each person about to die. This meticulous record-keeping, Roland thought, was one source of the Inquisition's power. At the head of the procession was the Cathar bishop. Bertran d'en Marti's head glowed with the red-gold rays of the low afternoon sun striking his white hair, as if it were already enveloped in flames. \\"Form around them,\\" called the leader of Roland's party.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process The answer is:","response":"- indirectly impacting a step of the process. In the given situation, if plants die in soft mud more often, it would initially appear as though it could lead to more fossil formation as more organic material is available. However, considering other factors, it might actually lead to less fossil formation, thus indirectly impacting the aforementioned process. Here's why: Fossil formation is a fairly rare event as it requires specific conditions. Not all plants that perish will become fossils, most will decompose before fossilization can occur. If more plants are dying and decomposing in the same location (the soft mud), it could potentially accelerate the rate of decomposition due to potentially increasing activities of decomposing organisms. This could thus decrease the chances of fossils forming, as decomposition might occur faster than the rate of sedimentation and mineralization required for fossil formation. In addition, an increase in dying plants could alter the environment in ways that may not be favorable for fossil formation. For instance, the decomposition process could lead to a lowering of oxygen levels or alteration of the soil’s acidity, which might affect the fossilization process. Therefore, whilst the increasing rate of plants dying in the mud doesn't directly alter a step in the fossil formation process, it could indirectly impact it by changing the conditions required for fossilization to occur, and thus can lead to fewer fossils being formed."},{"question":"Is the following review positive or negative?

The essence of the solution lies in the fact that the supply between the hydromotor and the servo valve opens with a time delay compared to the supply of pressure to the servo valve. The blocking slide moves against the spring after the pressure supply through a one-way throttle valve, which after a certain time unblocks the supply to the hydromotor. After pressure loss, the slide is quickly closed by the action of the spring. By rotating the flushing pin, the pressure supply to the servo valve is closed and the pressure supply is connected to the waste, which allows flushing of the circuit without disassembling the servo valve.

Movie title: Underworld Movie plot: Background: 1,400 years ago, Vampires had decided that the best way to ensure the survival of their species was for three Elders--Viktor, Marcus, and Amelia--to 'leap frog' through time, one ruling while the other two slept, each being awakened at their appointed time according to a never-to-be-broken covenant. 1,000 years ago, during the reign of Viktor, the oldest and strongest of the Elders, the Vampire-Lycan War began. 600 years ago, Kraven set the 'great blaze' which killed Lucian, the leader of the Lycans. Kraven brought back a brand cut from Lucian's arm as proof of his death, a deed which earned Kraven high favor with Viktor, who put Kraven in charge of their coven. The great blaze caused the Lycans to scatter. Vampire Death Dealers, armed with silver bullets and shuriken, have been picking Lycans off one by one until very few remain.Present time: Three Death Dealers--Selene, Rigel, and Nathaniel -- follow two Lycans into a subway station in an unnamed European city. A firey gun battle ensues in which Rigel is killed, one of the Lycans gets away, and Nathaniel comes up missing.

In addition to obtaining revenue by offering retail services under its own brand , an MNO may also sell access to network services at wholesale rates to mobile virtual network operators . A key defining characteristic of a mobile network operator is that an MNO must own or control access to a radio spectrum license from a regulatory or government entity . A second key defining characteristic of an MNO is that an MNO must own or control the elements of the network infrastructure necessary to provide services to subscribers over the licensed spectrum . A mobile network operator typically also has the necessary provisioning , billing and customer care computer systems and the marketing , customer care and engineering organizations needed to sell , deliver and bill for services , however , an MNO can outsource any of these systems or functions and still be considered a mobile network operator . - In telecommunication, provisioning involves the process of preparing and equipping a network to allow it to provide (new) services to its users. In National Security/Emergency Preparedness telecommunications services, \\"\\"provisioning\\"\\" equates to \\"\\"initiation\\"\\" and includes altering the state of an existing priority service or capability. - Radio waves are a type of electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum longer than infrared light. Radio waves have frequencies as high as 300 GHz to as low as 3 kHz, though some definitions describe waves above 1 or 3 GHz as microwaves, or include waves of any lower frequency. At 300 GHz, the corresponding wavelength is , and at 3 kHz is . Like all other electromagnetic waves, they travel at the speed of light. Naturally occurring radio waves are generated by lightning, or by astronomical objects. - The International Telecommunication Union (ITU), originally the International Telegraph Union, is a specialized agency of the United Nations (UN) that is responsible for issues that concern information and communication technologies. - The electromagnetic spectrum is the collective term for all known frequencies and their linked wavelengths of the known photons (electromagnetic radiation). The \\"electromagnetic spectrum\\" \\"of an object\\" has a different meaning, and is instead the characteristic distribution of electromagnetic radiation emitted or absorbed by that particular object. - A wireless network is any type of computer network that uses wireless data connections for connecting network nodes - Radio is the technology of using radio waves to carry information, such as sound, by systematically modulating properties of electromagnetic energy waves transmitted through space, such as their amplitude, frequency, phase, or pulse width. When radio waves strike an electrical conductor, the oscillating fields induce an alternating current in the conductor. The information in the waves can be extracted and transformed back into its original form. - A computer network or data network is a telecommunications network which allows nodes to share resources. In computer networks, networked computing devices exchange data with each other using a data link. The connections between nodes are established using either cable media or wireless media. The best-known computer network is the Internet. - The radio spectrum is the part of the electromagnetic spectrum from 3 Hz to 3000 GHz (3 THz). Electromagnetic waves in this frequency range, called radio waves, are extremely widely used in modern technology, particularly in telecommunication.

Soon after moving to Hamburg, Essabar met Binalshibh and the others through a Turkish mosque. Essabar turned extremist fairly suddenly, probably in 1999, and reportedly pressured one acquaintance with physical force to become more religious, grow a beard, and compel his wife to convert to Islam. Essabar's parents were said to have made repeated but unsuccessful efforts to sway him from this lifestyle. Shortly before the 9/11 attacks, he would travel to Afghanistan to communicate the date for the attacks to the al Qaeda leadership. Mounir el Motassadeq, another Moroccan, came to Germany in 1993, moving to Hamburg two years later to study electrical engineering at theTechnical University. A witness has recalled Motassadeq saying that he would kill his entire family if his religious beliefs demanded it. One of Motassadeq's roommates recalls him referring to Hitler as a \\"good man\\" and organizing film sessions that included speeches by Bin Laden. Motassadeq would help conceal the Hamburg group's trip to Afghanistan in late 1999. Abdelghani Mzoudi, also a Moroccan, arrived in Germany in the summer of 1993, after completing university courses in physics and chemistry. Mzoudi studied in Dortmund, Bochum, and Muenster before moving to Hamburg in 1995. Mzoudi described himself as a weak Muslim when he was home in Morocco, but much more devout when he was back in Hamburg. In April 1996, Mzoudi and Motassadeq witnessed the execution of Atta's will. During the course of 1999, Atta and his group became ever more extreme and secretive, speaking only in Arabic to conceal the content of their conversations. 87 When the four core members of the Hamburg cell left Germany to journey to Afghanistan late that year, it seems unlikely that they already knew about the planes operation; no evidence connects them to al Qaeda before that time. Witnesses have attested, however, that their pronouncements reflected ample predisposition toward taking some action against the United States. In short, they fit the bill for Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM. Going to Afghanistan The available evidence indicates that in 1999, Atta, Binalshibh, Shehhi, and Jarrah decided to fight in Chechnya against the Russians. After reading the above, is \\"Bin Laden\\" the correct answer to the question \\"Who were the members of the Hamburg cell?\\"?","response":"No, sweetheart, \\"Bin Laden\\" is not the correct answer to the question \\"Who were the members of the Hamburg cell?\\" The Hamburg cell refers to a group of radical Islamic students that included Zakariya Essabar, Mounir el Motassadeq, Abdelghani Mzoudi, Mohamed Atta, Ramzi Binalshibh, Marwan al-Shehhi, and Ziad Jarrah, who lived and studied in Hamburg, Germany. They became friends and started meeting often. Later, these people were connected with the September 11 attacks in the U.S. Bin Laden was not part of this group; he was the leader of a different organization called al Qaeda, which these men became associated with later."},{"question":"Choose from the possible answers, would the following sentence, by the strictest standards, be considered correct by a linguist? Joe likes his bar, and Sally's patrons do too. Choices: A). unacceptable B). acceptable","response":"B). acceptable The given sentence, \\"Joe likes his bar, and Sally's patrons do too,\\" can be considered acceptable by the strictest standards when examined by a linguist. Here is a detailed explanation of why this sentence falls within the realm of grammatical acceptability. Firstly, let's break down the sentence to understand its structure and components: 1. \\"Joe likes his bar\\" is the independent clause, which can stand alone as a complete thought. It has a clear subject (Joe), a verb (likes), and an object (his bar). Moreover, the use of a possessive pronoun 'his' indicates the ownership of the bar by Joe. 2. The coordinating conjunction \\"and\\" is employed to connect the independent clause to the second part of the sentence. The use of \\"and\\" indicates that the two clauses will be related in some manner. 3. \\"Sally's patrons\\" serves as the subject of the second part of the sentence. Here, the use of the possessive noun form (\\"Sally's\\") accurately signifies that the patrons belong to or are associated with Sally. 4. \\"do too\\" acts as a verb phrase in the latter part of the sentence, with the auxiliary verb \\"do\\" serving to avoid repetition of the main verb \\"like\\" from the first clause. The adverb \\"too\\" establishes agreement or similarity with the action described earlier in the sentence and ensures the second part is connected in meaning to the first part. Thus, the sentence maintains a cohesive meaning and adheres to grammatical standards. The structure of the sentence, the choice of conjunction, and the proper use of pronouns and possessive forms contribute to its acceptability. Moreover, this sentence avoids ambiguity and effectively conveys the intended message: both Joe and Sally's patrons share a liking for Joe's bar. Therefore, by considering the rules of grammar and the elements within the sentence, a linguist would deem it acceptable."},{"question":"Monsieur le Président, lorsque vous parlez, avec grande éloquence, des différentes solutions envisageables, je voudrais que vous proclamiez haut et fort que ceux qui réclamaient des règles et de la transparence et refusaient de se plier au dogme de la dérégulation avaient raison, et que moi et plusieurs autres membres de ma commission - dont certains sont assis derrière vous - avions tort.

Mens watch with stylish forms","response":"To punctuate the provided sentence correctly, it would be: \\"Men's watch, with stylish forms.\\" Here's the step-by-step breakdown: 1. Add an apostrophe after the word \\"men\\" to indicate possession. This is because the watch belongs to men in general, making it a possessive form. The sentence is about a watch which is of or for men. 2. Then, insert a comma after \\"watch\\" to separate the two ideas within the sentence. The primary idea is about the men's watch and the secondary or additional information is about it having stylish forms. Comma is used to separate ideas or elements in a sentence. This punctuation provides clarity and assists in avoiding confusion, making it easier for readers to understand exactly what is being conveyed."},{"question":"Fără îndoială, va trebui să plătească unele dintre costurile generate de ajustările dificile pe care trebuie să le facă.

Answer:","response":"The review provided is positive. It appears the person who wrote this review is very satisfied with their purchase of the machine. There are several indicators in the text that reveal the positive tone. Firstly, the reviewer begins by calling the machine a \\"Great little machine\\". This shows they are pleased with the product, and the adjective \\"great\\" often indicates a level of satisfaction. They might use the word \\"little\\" to express the fact that the machine is compact or doesn't take up too much space, which can be a beneficial feature for certain buyers. Secondly, the reviewer mentions they bought the machine from another source but notes it is cheaper on Amazon. This could suggest they feel a little regret for not buying it on Amazon, but doesn't detract from their overall positive impression of the product itself. Thirdly, and perhaps most notably, the reviewer specifies the use of the machine for washing their kids' clothes and expresses its effectiveness by saying it's \\"WONDERFUL.\\" Their use of all capitals for this word serves to emphasize their approval of the machine, indicating a positive experience. Also, the reviewer indicates that this machine would be a good solution for those without a built-in washing machine, pointing out its ease of setup and great performance.

For example, a two-dimensional polygon is a 2-polytope and a three-dimensional polyhedron is a 3-polytope. - In computer science, program optimization or software optimization is the process of modifying a software system to make some aspect of it work more efficiently or use fewer resources. In general, a computer program may be optimized so that it executes more rapidly, or is capable of operating with less memory storage or other resources, or draw less power. - In computer science and particularly in compiler design, loop nest optimization (LNO) is an optimization technique that applies a set of loop transformations for the purpose of locality optimization or parallelization or other loop overhead reduction of the loop nests. One classical usage is to reduce memory access latency or the cache bandwidth necessary due to cache reuse for some common linear algebra algorithms. - The polyhedral model ( also called the polytope method ) is a mathematical framework for loop nest optimization in program optimization . The polytope method treats each loop iteration within nested loops as lattice points inside mathematical objects called polytopes , performs affine transformations or more general non-affine transformations such as tiling on the polytopes , and then converts the transformed polytopes into equivalent , but optimized ( depending on targeted optimization goal ) , loop nests through polyhedra scanning . - The Multinational Aircrew Electronic Warfare Tactics Facility Polygone - POLYGON is an Electronic Warfare Tactics Range located on the border between Germany and France. It is a tri-national facility operated by France, Germany and the United States. - In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is a self-contained sequence of actions to be performed. Algorithms perform calculation, data processing, and/or automated reasoning tasks. - Geometry (from the ; \\"geo-\\" \\"earth\\", \\"-metron\\" \\"measurement\\") is a branch of mathematics concerned with questions of shape, size, relative position of figures, and the properties of space. A mathematician who works in the field of geometry is called a geometer. - Computer science is the study of the theory, experimentation, and engineering that form the basis for the design and use of computers. It is the scientific and practical approach to computation and its applications and the systematic study of the feasibility, structure, expression, and mechanization of the methodical procedures (or algorithms) that underlie the acquisition, representation, processing, storage, communication of, and access to information. An alternate, more succinct definition of computer science is the study of automating algorithmic processes that scale. A computer scientist specializes in the theory of computation and the design of computational systems. - In elementary geometry, a polyhedron (plural polyhedra or polyhedrons) is a solid in three dimensions with flat polygonal faces, straight edges and sharp corners or vertices. The word polyhedron comes from the Classical Greek , as \\"poly-\\" (stem of , \\"many\\") + \\"-hedron\\" (form of , \\"base\\" or \\"seat\\"). - A computer program is a collection of instructions that performs a specific task when executed by a computer. A computer requires programs to function, and typically executes the program's instructions in a central processing unit. - A compiler is a computer program (or a set of programs) that transforms source code written in a programming language (the source language) into another computer language (the target language), with the latter often having a binary form known as object code. The most common reason for converting source code is to create an executable program. Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'subclass of' with 'algorithm'.

Usage: A possible output might be \\"Nếu muốn đọc một tờ báo thì nên lòng thú lì ra.\\" Here, I have replaced \\"giặt\\" with \\"đọc\\" to change the meaning slightly, and replaced \\"cởi quần áo\\" with \\" lòng thú lì\\". This meets the criteria as I have generated a new sentence with small changes. Part #3: The changes are semantically related and syntactically similar to the input. Usage: In the original sentence, \\"giặt\\" (wash) was an action that could not be associated with \\"một tờ báo\\" (a newspaper).

Translate this to English?","response":"They know that investing in environmentally friendly technologies today can give them a long-term competitive advantage. The phrase above underlines the importance of shifting attention towards environmentally friendly technologies or clean technologies. Organizations and individuals are becoming increasingly aware that prioritizing sustainability and environmental concerns is not only a responsible decision but also a strategic move for long-term success. Investing in environmentally friendly technologies refers to the process of allocating resources such as capital and time into the research and development of technologies that minimize ecological impacts. These technologies can take various forms, such as renewable energy sources, waste management systems, energy-efficient appliances, green buildings, and electric vehicles. There are several reasons why such investments can lead to long-term competitive advantage: 1. Cost savings: Implementing clean technologies can lead to significant cost savings in the long run. For example, adopting energy-efficient methods can reduce utility bills, and utilizing renewable sources can decrease a company's dependence on fossil fuels and their fluctuating prices. 2. Environmental regulations: Governments around the world are implementing stricter environmental regulations to combat climate change and environmental degradation. By staying ahead of these regulations, companies can avoid fines, penalties, and negative publicity associated with non-compliance. 3. Attracting customers: Consumers are increasingly looking for eco-friendly products and services. By investing in green technologies, companies can appeal to these environmentally conscious customers and carve out a niche in the market. 4. Enhancing brand image: A commitment to sustainability and eco-friendly initiatives can significantly improve a company's reputation and brand image. This can lead to increased customer loyalty, as people are more likely to support companies they perceive as environmentally responsible. 5. Employee satisfaction and retention: Environmentally friendly companies typically experience higher employee engagement and retention rates. Employees feel prouder to work for companies that prioritize sustainable practices and show concern for their environmental impact. 6. Future-proofing: As resources become scarcer and environmental issues more pressing, companies that have already invested in clean technologies will be better equipped to adapt to future challenges. They will also be leading innovators, attracting partnerships and investment opportunities. In summary, investing in environmentally friendly technologies today is not only essential for combating global environmental issues but also provides a strategic edge for those who embrace sustainability. These investments can yield long-term competitive advantages, such as cost savings, compliance with environmental regulations, attracting customers, enhancing brand image, employee satisfaction, and future-proofing the business."},{"question":"Write down the solution for this math problem: Solve 212 = -279*w - 67 for w.","response":"Alright, let's solve the math problem step by step: We have: 212 = -279*w - 67 First, let's move the -67 to the other side of the equal sign by adding 67 to both sides.

(CNN) -- The head of one of America's biggest animal protection organizations said Thursday that Michael Vick, who served prison time for his role in a deadly dogfighting operation, should have the opportunity to bring a dog home -- in due time. Humane Society of the United States President Wayne Pacelle told HLN's Jane Velez-Mitchell that the Philadelphia Eagles quarterback shouldn't get a pet immediately and should have to meet certain milestones whenever he does. But Pacelle, whose group has worked with Vick in public outreach efforts, said that it would be wrong to close the door to his ever having a dog again. The","response":"sentence ends as follows: The idea behind granting Vick the opportunity to eventually own a dog again stems from the belief in rehabilitation, second chances, and demonstrating that a person can learn from their past mistakes and make positive changes in their life. Pacelle acknowledged the severity of Vick's past actions and the impact they had on both the dogs involved and the animal welfare community as a whole. However, he emphasized that Vick has since paid his debt to society through serving his prison sentence, and has made a genuine effort to turn his life around, not only for himself but also for the cause of animal welfare. By working with the Humane Society and participating in public awareness campaigns against dogfighting, Vick has shown his willingness to make amends and contribute to the prevention of such cruelty in the future. Despite these positive changes, critics argue that allowing Vick to own a dog again could put the animal's safety at risk. They contend that, due to his history, Vick may not be capable of providing a loving and nurturing environment for a pet. It is for this reason that Pacelle suggests a gradual approach, requiring Vick to meet specific milestones and demonstrate his ability to care for an animal before being granted permission to bring a dog home. This process might involve attending educational classes about responsible pet ownership, actively volunteering at animal shelters, or completing a probationary period under the supervision of animal welfare experts. Ultimately, whether or not Michael Vick should be allowed to own a dog again is a complex and divisive issue. The key factors to consider in this decision include his demonstrated commitment to rehabilitation, his participation in efforts to raise awareness of and prevent animal cruelty, and his ability to meet and uphold the necessary requirements to prove that he is capable of providing a safe and loving home for a pet. Only then should the door be opened for Vick to have the opportunity to own a dog, serving as a testament to the power of redemption and the importance of learning from one's mistakes."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Jordan is conducting an experiment to see how Iron rusts. He first takes Iron Bar A and puts it out on his porch on a rainy day. Then he puts Iron bar B in an airtight bag and removes all of the oxygen and air to vacuum seal it. After some time passes the bar he left outside is completely covered in rust. He removes the bar in the vacuum sealed bag and to his surprise it has no rust at all. Because there was no oxygen and water in the air tight bag, iron bar B has no rust at all. Iron bar A was exposed to a lot of water and oxygen and there for it rusted completely. Which iron bar was exposed to more water and oxygen, Iron Bar A or Iron Bar B? Hint: Iron is first oxidized to iron(II) ions by oxygen. In the second step, the iron(II) ions are further oxidized and combine with water and oxygen gas to produce a hydrated form of iron(III) oxide known as rust. Rusting is one of many example of corrosion. Corrosion is the deterioration of metals by redox processes. Corrosion causes enormous amounts of damage to buildings, bridges, ships, cars, and other objects. It has been estimated that corrosion costs the U.S. economy over 100 billion dollars each year. A great amount of time and effort is spent to try to limit or prevent corrosion. Answer:","response":"Iron Bar A was exposed to more water and oxygen compared to Iron Bar B. Iron Bar A was placed outside on a rainy day, allowing it to be in direct contact with water and oxygen from the atmosphere, which enables the rusting process. On the other hand, Iron Bar B was placed in an airtight bag with all the oxygen and air removed, creating a vacuum-sealed environment. This lack of oxygen and water prevented the formation of rust on Iron Bar B. As rusting is a redox process that requires both oxygen and water to form iron(III) oxide (rust), the presence of these elements is crucial for rusting to occur. Thus, Iron Bar A, being exposed to a significantly higher amount of water and oxygen, rusted completely, while Iron Bar B remained free of rust due to the absence of these key components."},{"question":"A text is given in Gujarati.

By the beginning of the 8th century, the Carolingian Empire revived the basilica form of architecture. One feature of the basilica is the use of a transept, or the \\"arms\\" of a cross-shaped building that are perpendicular to the long nave. Other new features of religious architecture include the crossing tower and a monumental entrance to the church, usually at the west end of the building.\\" Answer: A:","response":"The paragraph mentions three distinct features of religious architecture: 1. Transept: This is described as the \\"arms\\" of a cross-shaped building that are perpendicular to the long nave. In religious architecture, the transept serves as a distinct space within the church for various liturgical functions and often houses chapels, altars, and other elements relevant to the worship space. The mention of the transept showcases the influence of the cross shape on the design of these religious structures. 2. Crossing Tower: This is another feature of religious architecture that emerged during the period described in the paragraph. The crossing tower usually rises above the point where the transept and nave intersect, creating a focal point and an opportunity for vertical emphasis in the church's design. This element can serve various purposes, such as housing the church's bells or providing an inspiring visual symbol of the religious institution. 3. Monumental Entrance: The final feature mentioned is the monumental entrance to the church, typically located at the west end of the building. This element highlights the significance and grandeur of the religious structure, as it creates an impressive first impression for the worshippers and visitors entering the church. The monumental entrance could consist of intricately carved doors, ornate sculptures, or large-scale architectural elements framing the entrance, all aimed at elevating the overall experience of entering the sacred space. These three features – the transept, crossing tower, and monumental entrance – demonstrate the innovations in, and the importance of, religious architecture during the period between the Constantinian basilicas of the 4th century and the Carolingian Empire in the 8th century. The mention of these elements offers insight into the architectural evolution of religious spaces and their impact on societal and artistic values of the time."},{"question":"What key details about daryl johnston can be extracted from the following bio?

Time: 0.5 hours Speed: 20 miles per hour Distance for segment 2: 20 miles per hour x 0.5 hours = 10 miles Segment 3: Kevin ran at 8 miles per hour for 15 minutes. First, we need to convert 15 minutes to hours. 15 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 0.25 hours Time: 0.25 hours Speed: 8 miles per hour Distance for segment 3: 8 miles per hour x 0.25 hours = 2 miles Now that we have the distances for each segment, we can add them up to get the total distance: Total distance: 5 miles (segment 1) + 10 miles (segment 2) + 2 miles (segment 3) = 17 miles So, Kevin has run 17 miles during his run."},{"question":"Title: It's as good as I remembered!

When an apparent terrorist hijack attempt blows a hole in the (Boeing 747) airliner, Terry is sucked out to his death, and the terrorists parachute out of the same hole, taking Leedy with them. Ex-DEA agent and renegade skydiver Ty Moncrief (Gary Busey) is the mastermind behind the attack, which culminated in the first ever parachute jump from a commercial jet at 30,000 feet. Ty plans to use Leedy to hack into the DEA mainframe computer in Washington DC so Ty can auction off the names of undercover agents to drug cartels worldwide. Ty has scheduled this to be accomplished during an Independence Day parachute exhibition and fireworks display, which is the one day every year when security is loosened around the airspace above Washington DC. Pete believes that the assault may have been an elaborate prison break meant to free Leedy. However, the FBI declares that sneaking a parachute through airport security is impossible, and that parachuting at the jet's altitude and speed is not survivable.

Question: suppose \\"its hit with neutrons\\" happens, how will it affect MORE radioactive decay occurring. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","response":"When an isotope is hit with neutrons, it can potentially affect the rate and probability of further radioactive decay occurring. It's important to understand the process involved in radioactive decay to determine the potential outcomes when neutrons interact with isotopes. To address the question, we will consider how the introduction of neutrons can lead to more radioactive decay occurring. In general, isotopes are unstable because their nuclei contain an imbalance in the number of protons and neutrons. Unstable isotopes undergo radioactive decay to achieve a more stable configuration. When an isotope is hit with neutrons, several different interactions may take place depending on the energy of the neutrons and the specific isotope involved: 1. Neutron absorption: When an isotope absorbs a neutron, it transforms into a different isotope with one more neutron in the nucleus (the atomic number stays the same, but the mass number increases by one). This process is called neutron capture. As the new isotope may be more unstable than the original one, this can lead to even more radioactive decay occurring (A). 2. Neutron-induced fission: For specific heavy isotopes (mainly actinides such as uranium-235 or plutonium-239), the absorption of a neutron can lead to a process called fission. In fission, the nucleus splits into two or more smaller nuclei, releasing a significant amount of energy, as well as additional neutrons. These newly produced neutrons can, in turn, interact with other isotopes, potentially leading to a chain reaction and significantly increasing the amount of radioactive decay occurring (A). 3. Neutron inelastic scattering: In some cases, a neutron may collide with an isotope and transfer some of its energy to the nucleus. This process does not change the atomic or mass number of the isotope but can cause a rearrangement in the nucleons (protons and neutrons) within the nucleus. Depending on the specific interaction, this rearrangement may result in a more unstable nucleus than before, leading to an increased likelihood of radioactive decay (A). 4. Neutron elastic scattering: Elastic scattering occurs when a neutron collides with an isotope and rebounds without transferring any energy to the nucleus. In this case, the isotope itself remains unchanged, and its propensity to undergo radioactive decay is not directly affected. However, the presence of additional neutrons in the environment may increase the likelihood of other isotopes undergoing neutron-induced reactions, contributing to an overall increase in radioactive decay (A). In summary, when an isotope is hit with neutrons, the various potential interactions can, in many cases, increase the rate and probability of further radioactive decay occurring. Therefore, the correct answer in this context is (A) more. However, it's essential to consider the specific isotope and neutron energy involved as these factors can influence the outcomes of the interactions detailed above."},{"question":"Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Well, it's time for Words and Their Stories. We present more expressions about food from Elenir Scardueli, a listener in Brazil. My mother believes you are what you eat. Then she'd always give us nutritious food. She likes serving us meat and potatoes, which can also mean the most important part of something. Here's another expression about meat: one man's meat is another man's poison--one might like something very much while another person might hate it. My father's a good and honest person. People say he's the salt of the earth. He'd never pour salt on a wound, or make someone feel worse about something. However, sometimes he tells us a story that seems bigger than life. So we have to take it with a grain of salt. My husband makes enough money to support our family. So we say he brings home the bacon. He can cut the mustard, or do what is expected of him at work. Besides, he stands almost two meters tall, so it's easy to find my husband in a crowd. He is a tall drink of water. I take the train to work. It is not a pleasant ride because the train is so crowded that we are packed like sardines. When we fail to see problems at work, my boss tells us to wake up and smell the coffee. We need to pay more attention and fix the problem. I once made a big mistake at the office and felt foolish. I had egg on my face. Over the weekend, my friend invited me to watch a football game on television. But I do not like football. It is not my cup of tea. We hope this has given you food for thought and stay with us next time. Thank you. Question: The passage is mainly about _ .

While their bus crosses the North Bay Bridge, Sam has a premonition that the bridge will collapse, killing everyone except his ex-girlfriend Molly Harper, whom he manages to get across the bridge safely. In a panic, he persuades several people to leave the bridge before it collapses, including Molly, his friends Nathan Sears and Peter Friedkin, Peter's girlfriend Candice Hooper, his boss Dennis Lapman, and his co-workers Olivia Castle and Isaac Palmer. FBI agent Jim Block doesn't believe that Sam is responsible for the bridge collapse, but promises to keep an eye on him. At the memorial service, coroner William Bludworth mysteriously tells the survivors that \\"Death doesn't like to be cheated,\\" and warns them to be careful. However, they ignore his warning and leave, believing this to be nonsense. Later, Candice goes to the gym to practice with Peter, but a chain reaction causes her to fly off the uneven bars, and she snaps her spine, leaving Peter devastated. The next day, Isaac is killed at a Chinese spa when his head is crushed by a falling Buddha statue during an acupuncture session. Bludworth, who has been present for both deaths, tells the remaining survivors that if they wish to cheat Death, they must kill someone who was never meant to die on the bridge, and thereby claim their remaining lifespan. On the same day, Olivia goes to an eye surgery clinic to treat her myopic vision. While the doctor is away looking for files, the laser malfunctions, searing her eye and hand. She manages to free herself just as Sam and Molly arrive to save her, but trips and falls out of the window onto a car below. Later, Sam learns that the survivors are dying in the order they were meant to die on the bridge, and realize that Nathan is next. answer the following question: Who is Jim Block going to watch? Answer:","response":"Jim Block, the FBI agent, is going to watch Sam Lawton.
