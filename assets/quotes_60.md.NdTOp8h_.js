Born and brought up near Edinburgh,Mollie has devoted her talents to writing primarily for young people. She firmly believes that there is and should always be a wider audience for any good book whatever its main market is. In Mollie's opinion it is necessary to make full use of language and she enjoys telling a story,which is what every writer should be doing. \\"If you aren't telling a story, you're a very dead writer indeed.\\" She says. With the chief function of a writer being to entertain,Mollie is indeed an entertainer. \\"I have this great love of not only the meaning of language but of the music of language,\\" she says. \\"This love goes back to early childhood. I had a school teacher who used to ask us what we would like to be when we grew up and,because my family always had dogs,and I was very good at handling them,I said I wanted to work with dogs,and the teacher always said 'Nonsense,Mollie;dear,you'll be a writer.' So finally I thought that this woman must have something,since she was a good teacher and I decided when I was nine that I would be a writer.\\" This childhood intention is described in her novel,A Sound of Chariots,which although written in the third person is clearly autobiographical and gives a picture both of Mollie's ambition and her struggle towards its achievement. Thoughts of her childhood inevitably brought thoughts of the time when her home was still a village with buttercup meadows and strawberry fields--sadly now covered with modern houses. \\"I was once taken back to see it and I felt that somebody had lain dirty hands all over my childhood. I'll never go back,\\"she said \\"Never.

Chris Christie of New Jersey had been enjoying something of a romance with the American left. On Thursday, in the liberal lion’s den that is “The Daily Show With Jon Stewart,” that flirtation seemed to be unofficially declared over. In his first appearance on the Comedy Central talk show — and fresh off a widely discussed cameo on another left-leaning television mainstay, “Saturday Night Live” — Mr. Christie, a Republican who supported Mitt Romney, endured a half-hour of grilling from the host about his political beliefs, his personal style and even a hug he recently received from Bruce Springsteen. “He said, ‘C’mon, gimme a hug,’ ” Mr. Christie recalled, sounding awed at the memory. “And I hugged him.” “And then did he go, ‘C’mon, stop, let me go’?” Mr. Stewart replied with a sly grin. The audience roared. Mr. Christie looked nonplused. The Springsteen banter gave way to an aggressive line of questioning from Mr. Stewart, who challenged the governor about his change of attitude toward the president in the days before and after Hurricane Sandy struck. “The week before the storm, you were out there: ‘President Obama couldn’t lead his way out of a paper bag,’ ” Mr. Stewart said. “And then right after the storm was over, you were like” — he adopted a robotic tone — “ ‘This man is a leader.’ ” Mr. Christie replied, “What it tells me is that people have different skill sets at different times.” Mr. Stewart shot back, “So he wasn’t a leader until you needed leadership?” With a smile, Mr. Christie said, “Maybe until he was presented with a stark opportunity to lead.” The interview, taped in Manhattan, also touched on Mr. Christie’s penchant for insulting political opponents. Mr. Stewart said he had planned to play a game with the governor: “Which of these quotes was from you, and which was from Don Rickles?” Mr. Christie retorted that Mr. Stewart could be guilty of “trying to categorize people very narrowly,” and he added, “You’ve been trying to do that a little bit with me here.” They eventually agreed that politicians should strive to be more genuine. Mr. Stewart told Mr. Christie that if he did so, “You and Hillary are going to have a hell of a battle in 2016.” At one point, Mr. Christie said his name-calling “doesn’t make me nonhumble, it makes me honest.” Explaining his attitude, the governor said, “If you are an idiot, I’m going to call you an idiot, and if you don’t like it, then stop acting like an idiot.” The audience laughed, and then Mr. Stewart offered his guest a suggestion: “You better write a Chris Christie’s ‘Chicken Soup for the Soul.’ ” Title:","response":"\\"Chris Christie's Rocky Romance with the Left: From Hugs to Grilling on The Daily Show\\""},{"question":"Choose from options, is the following sentence linguistically acceptable?

Polytheistic religions commonly attribute to each of the gods a gender, allowing each to interact with any of the others, and perhaps with humans, sexually. In most monotheistic religions, God has no counterpart with which to relate sexually. Thus, in classical western philosophy the gender of this one-and-only deity is most likely to be an analogical statement of how humans and God address, and relate to, each other. Namely, God is seen as begetter of the world and revelation which corresponds to the active (as opposed to the receptive) role in sexual intercourse. What is the answer to this question: How is sex by God handled in a monotheistic religion?","response":"Sex, as it pertains to God in monotheistic religions, is not understood in the human sense of the term but rather as a metaphorical and symbolic representation of the relationship between God and creation. In general, monotheistic religions do not attribute a specific gender or sexual identity to God, as the divine being transcends physical attributes and bodily form. Instead, the concept of sex and gender is employed to portray the nature of God's relationship with the world and humanity. This relationship is understood in a variety of ways, depending on the religious tradition. In Judaism, the Hebrew Bible presents a complex portrayal of God's relationship with creation. Although the language and descriptions used are often anthropomorphic, the Jewish tradition understands that God is beyond human categories and physicality. For example, God is sometimes described as a father or husband in relation to the people of Israel, with the nation being portrayed as a child or wife. This metaphorical language communicates the deep, intimate connection between God and the Jewish people and highlights aspects of love, loyalty, and covenant. In Christianity, the concept of gender and sex in relation to God is also symbolic and not literal. The central tenet of the Christian faith is the belief in the Holy Trinity - God as Father, Son (Jesus Christ), and Holy Spirit. Although the use of male terminology is predominant, it is important to note that traditional Christian teaching affirms that God transcends gender. The imagery of God as a Father is employed to convey authority, love, and care for creation. Moreover, the New Testament introduces the metaphor of Christ as the bridegroom and the Church as his bride, which signifies the deep spiritual union between Christ and his followers, highlighting the themes of love, commitment, and sacrifice. Islam, another major monotheistic religion, holds that God (Allah) is entirely transcendent and beyond human comprehension. In the Islamic tradition, God is neither male nor female and is not subject to human limitations. The Qur'an and Hadith (sayings and actions of the Prophet Muhammad) use both masculine and feminine language to describe God's attributes, but this language is understood to be metaphorical rather than literal. In Islam, God's relationship with creation is often described using the terms Rahmah (mercy) and Rahman (most merciful), emphasizing the compassionate and caring nature of the divine. Sex in relation to God is not generally a significant aspect of Islamic theology. In conclusion, the handling of sex by God in monotheistic religions is largely metaphorical, with the focus being on the symbolic aspects of relationships rather than the physical act of sex itself. God is typically seen as transcending gender and physicality in these traditions. The use of sexual metaphors and language helps to illustrate the nature of the relationships between God and creation, such as love, loyalty, authority, compassion, and commitment. It is important to note, however, that this understanding may vary among individual believers and interpretations within each religious tradition."},{"question":"I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it. Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"From roughly 115 to 60 BC, Han forces fought the Xiongnu over control of the oasis city-states in the Tarim Basin. Han was eventually victorious and established the Protectorate of the Western Regions in 60 BC, which dealt with the region's defense and foreign affairs. The Han also expanded southward. The naval conquest of Nanyue in 111 BC expanded the Han realm into what are now modern Guangdong, Guangxi, and northern Vietnam. Yunnan was brought into the Han realm with the conquest of the Dian Kingdom in 109 BC, followed by parts of the Korean Peninsula with the colonial establishments of Xuantu Commandery and Lelang Commandery in 108 BC. In China's first known nationwide census taken in 2 AD, the population was registered as having 57,671,400 individuals in 12,366,470 households.\\"? Answer:","response":"Question: In the passage above, discuss the territorial expansions of the Han dynasty from 115 to 60 BC and the resulting administrative and defense measures implemented by the Han. Additionally, explain the implications of the first nationwide census taken in 2 AD for the size and scope of the Han dynasty. Answer: The passage recounts several key territorial expansions of the Han dynasty from 115 to 60 BC, highlighting their military conquests and establishment of control over new territories. Initially, the Han forces fought against the Xiongnu for control over the oasis city-states in the Tarim Basin. Emerging victorious, they established the Protectorate of the Western Regions in 60 BC, which was responsible for the region's defense and foreign affairs. This strategic move allowed the Han dynasty to protect its newly-acquired territories and ensure their political stability. In addition to their conquests in the Tarim Basin and the establishment of the Protectorate, the passage also notes the Han dynasty's southern expansions. The naval conquest of Nanyue in 111 BC allowed the Han to extend their rule into modern-day Guangdong, Guangxi, and northern Vietnam. They continued their expansion by incorporating Yunnan through the conquest of the Dian Kingdom in 109 BC. The Han dynasty's influence reached as far as parts of the Korean Peninsula, where they established Xuantu Commandery and Lelang Commandery in 108 BC. These colonial establishments served as administrative centers, allowing the Han dynasty to effectively govern and manage their expanding territories. The passage also mentions the first known nationwide census taken in 2 AD, which recorded 57,671,400 individuals in 12,366,470 households. This information is significant because it reflects the enormity of the Han dynasty's population and the vast scope of their territory. The census data provides an insight into the complexity of governing such a large number of people, as well as the extensive resources and infrastructure necessary to maintain the realm's stability and prosperity. As a result, the census highlights the importance of the Han dynasty's territorial expansions and the establishment of various administrative, defense, and foreign affairs measures in maintaining their power and influence across the region."},{"question":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

These bars are made of fiberglass covered in wood laminate, to prevent them from breaking. In the past, bars were made of wood, but the bars were prone to breaking, providing an incentive to switch to newer technologies. The width and height of the bars may be adjusted. In the past, the uneven parallel bars were closer together. They've been moved increasingly further apart, allowing gymnasts to perform swinging, circling, transitional, and release moves, that may pass over, under, and between the two bars. At the Elite level, movements must pass through the handstand. Gymnasts often mount the Uneven Bars using a springboard, or a small mat. Chalk and grips (a leather strip with holes for fingers to protect hands and improve performance) may be used while doing this event. The chalk helps take the moisture out of gymnast's hands to decrease friction and prevent rips (tears to the skin of the hands), dowel grips help gymnasts grip the bar. Answer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): Why are uneven bars round?","response":"Uneven bars are round for a few reasons: 1. Ergonomics: Round bars are easier for gymnasts to grip and hold onto during their routines. The circular shape naturally fits the curve of a closed hand, providing better grasping capability, security, and overall comfort for the gymnast. 2. Uniformity and consistency: The round shape of the bars ensures that the gymnast always has a consistent area to grip, no matter which part of the bar they are holding. This consistency ensures an even distribution of pressure on their hands and reduces the likelihood of injury or discomfort from uneven forces at different points on the bar. 3. Strength and durability: The round shape is structurally strong due to the distribution of forces that act on the bar during gymnastic routines. The circular profile is more resistant to bending and breaking compared to other shapes (like square or rectangular bars) as the stress is distributed evenly along the entire curve. 4. Smoother transitions and rotations: Round bars allow for smoother rotations and transitions during gymnastic moves, as the hands can slide and reposition easily along the curved surface without catching on any edges or corners. This smooth rotational ability is critical for many of the complex maneuvers performed on the uneven bars."},{"question":"What sentence would provide a factual answer to this question: \\"A person wanting to find a live bear in a forest will have difficulty because bears\\"","response":"A person wanting to find a live bear in a forest will have difficulty because bears are often elusive and tend to avoid human contact.

How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect","response":"If seeds that are not compatible with the soil are planted, it can lead to several issues, including insufficient water absorption or nutrient availability, which in turn may affect the process of photosynthesis. In the context of the question, the perturbation refers to the process of breaking down water in photosynthesis, which might be influenced by the seeds' incompatibility with the soil. In the process of photosynthesis, sunlight causes chlorophyll in chloroplasts to absorb energy, leading to the splitting of water molecules (H2O) into oxygen (O2), hydrogen (H2), and electrons. When the water is not broken down efficiently, there will be a limited supply of hydrogen and electrons, which are both essential for converting NADP+ into NADPH. NADPH is an essential molecule that acts as a reducing agent and carries high-energy electrons to be used in other reactions, like the synthesis of glucose. If seeds are not compatible with the soil and thus unable to absorb water effectively, there will be a reduced amount of water available for the photosynthesis process. As a result, the breakdown of water during photosynthesis will be negatively impacted due to insufficient water supply. The effect will be \\"less,\\" meaning there will be less production of oxygen, hydrogen, and electrons. This, in turn, will lead to a decrease in NADPH production as there will be a shortage of hydrogen and energized electrons. In summary, planting seeds that are not compatible with the soil will have a negative effect on the process of photosynthesis. It will result in less efficient water breakdown due to limited water availability, which will subsequently lead to a reduced production of hydrogen, oxygen, and electrons. This will further impact the conversion of NADP+ into NADPH, indicating a \\"less\\" effect on the second stage mentioned in the process. Ultimately, a reduced rate of photosynthesis may affect the overall growth and development of the plant, and in severe cases, the plant may not survive due to inadequate energy production."},{"question":"Please answer a question about the following article about Northwestern University: The foundation of Northwestern University is traceable to a meeting on May 31, 1850 of nine prominent Chicago businessmen, Methodist leaders and attorneys who had formed the idea of establishing a university to serve what had once been known as the Northwest Territory.

He places one in refrigerated storage, but forgot one and left it out on the counter top. and a hint : Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in matter. In everyday usage, temperature indicates a measure of how hot or cold an object is. Temperature is an important parameter in chemistry. When a substance changes from solid to liquid, it is because there was an increase in the temperature of the material. Chemical reactions usually proceed faster if the temperature is increased. Many unstable materials (such as enzymes) will be viable longer at lower temperatures. Please answer this question : Which sample will be viable for a shorter time, the one on the counter top or the one in refrigerated storage? A:","response":"The sample that will be viable for a shorter time is the one left on the counter top. The reason is that temperature plays an important role in the stability and longevity of enzymes. At lower temperatures, enzymes can remain functional and stable for longer periods of time. When Thomas left the sample on the counter top, it was exposed to room temperature, which is generally higher than the temperature inside the refrigerated storage unit. As a result, the enzymes in the sample on the counter top undergo faster degradation and lose their viability at a quicker pace than the sample placed in the refrigerated storage. On the other hand, the enzymes in the sample placed in refrigerated storage are subjected to a lower temperature, which helps to slow down any chemical reactions and thus preserve the enzyme's stability and functionality for a longer time. This leads to a higher likelihood of the sample remaining viable when compared to the one left on the counter top."},{"question":"Generate a positive review for a place.","response":"Review for the Elysium Gardens - Botanical Gardens The Elysium Gardens are a treasure trove of lush greenery, meticulously arranged flower beds, and tranquility that you wouldn't expect to find in an urban setting.

At Foro Italico however, Djokovic needed just 70 minutes to rally from an early break to beat qualifier Montanes 6-2 6-3.

And Taitz thinks there will be a landscape shift when the new Netflix feature arrives. \\"We know from our sources within the industry that Netflix is going to launch this product,\\" says Taitz. \\"My expectation is that by the end of the year Netflix will be launching download-to-go as an option for their customers.\\" Industry gossip from a technology vendor is one thing, but Frost & Sullivan Principal Analyst Dan Rayburn confirms that Netflix Inc. (Nasdaq: NFLX) is developing a downloading solution and says that it's something of an open secret in the streaming video community. \\"It's a natural progression for Netflix to want to have some of their content available for consumers to watch offline, and we've been hearing for months now that they are in fact going to roll something out soon,\\" says Rayburn. For Netflix's part, CEO Reed Hastings said earlier this year that he was open to the idea of offering video downloads, but the company is still being coy about its actual product roadmap, unwilling to offer either official confirmation or denial. \\"While our focus remains on delivering a great streaming experience, we are always exploring ways to make the service better,\\" says Netflix spokesperson Anne Marie Squeo. But she adds, \\"We don't have anything to add at this time.\\" Want to know more about video and TV market trends? Check out our dedicated video services content channel here on Light Reading. Taitz at least has reason to hope that Netflix will launch its downloading option soon and create a wave of new demand for the feature. His company Penthera Partners Inc. develops video downloading technology with customers that include Comcast Corp. (Nasdaq: CMCSA, CMCSK), Charter Communications Inc. and Starz Entertainment LLC . While the company has been successful at attracting marquee clients, however, actual usage of the technology is still limited. Taitz says that Charter, for example, only offers a handful of shows for download each month, and many of those are from Starz, which requires a premium subscription. Comcast's deployment is broader, but the company isn't sharing any consumer adoption numbers, suggesting that pick-up isn't high. (See Comcast Cloud DVR Storms Down East Coast.) \\"The majority of our customers use streaming to watch content on-the-go, which is why we've been so focused on growing our catalog of live streaming networks and building out more WiFi hot spots,\\" says Vito Forlenza, Comcast Cable's senior director for TV Everywhere content and product strategy. \\"That said, it's less about evaluating the volume or frequency of downloads, and more about the convenience it offers customers at the moments when they need it.\\" Despite what appears to be slow adoption, Taitz believes there's still a big future ahead for video downloading. \\"I still view download as something that's emerging into the consciousness of consumers,\\" says Taitz. \\"They know about downloads because before there were streaming services people downloaded movies and videos from iTunes, but they're not necessarily looking for download as a feature of their streaming service they're already paying for.\\" In other words, as consumer awareness grows, demand for content downloading should rise. Taitz also thinks expansion into international markets -- regions where internet connectivity can be lacking -- will be good for Penthera's business. And Taitz sees a big opportunity with programmers like Starz because many of them are now launching their own direct-to-consumer subscription services. These networks represent a brand new set of potential customers for Penthera. With regard to challenges, one of the biggest barriers to greater adoption of video downloading is still the issue of content rights. Referring to Netflix's plans, Rayburn says, \\"Netflix will be limited by the studios in terms of which titles are available for download so we'll have to see just how much of Netflix's inventory is offered and which devices will be supported.\\" He adds, \\"One would also imagine that all of Netflix's originally produced content would be available as a download, since Netflix owns that content.\\" Rayburn also brings up another downside to downloading, however. \\"It would make sense to focus on mobile device support over streaming media boxes connected to the TV as that's the real benefit of a downloading service,\\" notes Rayburn, \\"but the service will be limited in use to a degree, since mobile devices can't store too many movies.\\" Consumers have generally applauded the introduction of downloading features, like the expansion of Amazon.com Inc. (Nasdaq: AMZN)'s downloading option to Android and iOS devices last year. However, they don't necessarily follow through with adoption. Whether that behavior changes when Netflix launches its downloading solution remains to be seen. — Mari Silbey, Senior Editor, Cable/Video, Light Reading ||||| Soon, you might be able to Netflix and chill without WiFi. Industry sources predict that the streaming giant may soon allow users to download content instead of streaming it. \\"We know from our sources within the industry that Netflix is going to launch this product,\\" industry insider Dan Taitz told the trade publication Light Reading. \\"My expectation is that by the end of the year Netflix will be launching download-to-go as an option for their customers.\\" WATCH: Nine fabulous flicks to celebrate LGBT pride month Downloading would allow users to watch Netflix content without consistent internet access. While streaming requires an internet connection, downloading stores the content so it’s accessible later. That means catching up on “Orange is the New Black” on the subway or binging on “House of Cards” during a flight. A Netflix spokesperson told the Daily News the company wouldn’t comment directly, but added, “While we are focused on delivering a great streaming experience, we are always open to other ways to improve the service.” That’s a far cry from the unenthusiastic response Chief Product Officer Neil Hunt gave last fall. “I still don’t think it’s a very compelling proposition,” he told Gizmodo UK at a trade show in Berlin, just days after Amazon Prime announced its decision to allow downloading. Brexit’s on, British TV stars are still ugly — and we love it If rumors are true, \\"Orange is the New Black\\" fans might be able to download their favorite show.

It’s not going to be instant, you have to have the right storage on your device, you have to manage it, and I’m just not sure people are actually that compelled to do that, and that it’s worth providing that level of complexity,” Hunt said. But the company started singing a different tune this year. \\"We should keep an open mind on all this,” CEO Reed Hastings said on an earnings call in April, according to TechInsider. “As we expand around the world where we see an uneven set of networks, it's something we should keep an open mind about.\\" Even if Netflix moves forward with a downloading option, there will likely be significant limitations just as with Amazon. As of now, Jeff Bezos’ company only allows users a 48-hour window to watch after hitting play, and there are limits on both the number of titles that can be downloaded at one time and the number of devices they can be on. Netflix has not offered any hints as to what restrictions it might impose. ||||| A summary of this is?","response":"Netflix is developing a \\"download to go\\" feature for offline viewing, according to industry insiders.

Question: Which gender of moth is able to detect the other gender? Context: Many insects possess very sensitive and, or specialized organs of perception. Some insects such as bees can perceive ultraviolet wavelengths, or detect polarized light, while the antennae of male moths can detect the pheromones of female moths over distances of many kilometers. The yellow paper wasp (Polistes versicolor) is known for its wagging movements as a form of communication within the colony; it can waggle with a frequency of 10.6±2.1 Hz (n=190). These wagging movements can signal the arrival of new material into the nest and aggression between workers can be used to stimulate others to increase foraging expeditions. There is a pronounced tendency for there to be a trade-off between visual acuity and chemical or tactile acuity, such that most insects with well-developed eyes have reduced or simple antennae, and vice versa. There are a variety of different mechanisms by which insects perceive sound, while the patterns are not universal, insects can generally hear sound if they can produce it. Different insect species can have varying hearing, though most insects can hear only a narrow range of frequencies related to the frequency of the sounds they can produce. Mosquitoes have been found to hear up to 2 kHz., and some grasshoppers can hear up to 50 kHz. Certain predatory and parasitic insects can detect the characteristic sounds made by their prey or hosts, respectively. For instance, some nocturnal moths can perceive the ultrasonic emissions of bats, which helps them avoid predation.:87–94 Insects that feed on blood have special sensory structures that can detect infrared emissions, and use them to home in on their hosts.

These differences continue into adult life,she says.In public conversations,men talk most and interrupt other speakers more.In private conversations,men and women speak in equal amounts--although they say things in a different style.Professor Tannen believes that,for women,private talking is a way to establish and test intimacy(,).For men,private talking is a way to explore the power structure of a relationship.

Lauren Adrian (Jennifer Lopez), an impassioned American news reporter for the \\"Chicago Sentinel\\" wants to be assigned to the Iraq front-lines to cover the war. Instead, her editor George Morgan (Martin Sheen) assigns her to investigate a series of slayings involving young maquiladora factory women in a Mexican bordertown.

Never busy. How would this review be described in terms of sentiment?","response":"The given review of The Lady Silvia can be characterized as having a predominantly positive sentiment. Several key factors contribute to this positive sentiment: 1. The review refers to the venue as a \\"hidden bar,\\" indicating that it is relatively unknown and therefore less likely to be overly crowded or noisy. The lack of a visible sign outside is mentioned, further emphasizing the hidden charm of the place. 2. The reviewer appreciates an environment suitable for enjoying a low-key evening with friends. Mentioning the cocktails as moderately priced implies that the value for money is considered fair, contributing to the overall positivity of the review. 3. The range and selection of traditional cocktails, such as the Manhattan and Sazerac, appear to delight the reviewer. He or she enjoys the classic drinks available, further enhancing their experience at the bar. 4. The advantage of The Lady Silvia not being busy on both weekends and weekdays supports the review's positive sentiment. The reviewer appreciates the comparatively tranquil atmosphere at the bar, making it an appealing location for those seeking a relaxed night out. To summarize, this review encompasses favorable impressions of The Lady Silvia, including its discreet location, moderately-priced cocktails, availability of traditional drinks, and a consistent atmosphere of calmness. Consequently, the overall sentiment can be classified as positive."},{"question":"Not until 1998 did al Qaeda undertake a major terrorist operation of its own, in large part because Bin Laden lost his base in Sudan. Ever since the Islamist regime came to power in Khartoum, the United States and other Western governments had pressed it to stop providing a haven for terrorist organizations. Other governments in the region, such as those of Egypt, Syria, Jordan, and even Libya, which were targets of some of these groups, added their own pressure. At the same time, the Sudanese regime began to change. Though Turabi had been its inspirational leader, General Omar al Bashir, president since 1989, had never been entirely under his thumb. Thus as outside pressures mounted, Bashir's supporters began to displace those of Turabi. The attempted assassination in Ethiopia of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in June 1995 appears to have been a tipping point. The would-be killers, who came from the Egyptian Islamic Group, had been sheltered in Sudan and helped by Bin Laden. When the Sudanese refused to hand over three individuals identified as involved in the assassination plot, the UN Security Council passed a resolution criticizing their inaction and eventually sanctioned Khartoum in April 1996. A clear signal to Bin Laden that his days in Sudan were numbered came when the government advised him that it intended to yield to Libya's demands to stop giving sanctuary to its enemies. Bin Laden had to tell the Libyans who had been part of his Islamic army that he could no longer protect them and that they had to leave the country. Outraged, several Libyan members of al Qaeda and the Islamic Army Shura renounced all connections with him. Bin Laden also began to have serious money problems. International pressure on Sudan, together with strains in the world economy, hurt Sudan's currency. Some of Bin Laden's companies ran short of funds. As Sudanese authorities became less obliging, normal costs of doing business increased. Saudi pressures on the Bin Laden family also probably took some toll. In any case, Bin Laden found it necessary both to cut back his spending and to control his outlays more closely. After reading the above, is \\"A change in Sudanese regime and less support for Bin Laden\\" the correct answer to the question \\"What was the assassination of President Hosni Mubarak a tipping point for?\\"? Available choices: a). no b). yes","response":"b). yes The assassination attempt of President Hosni Mubarak was a tipping point for a change in the Sudanese regime and less support for Bin Laden. This is because, after the attempt, outside pressures increased, and supporters of General Omar al Bashir, the president of Sudan, started to displace those of Turabi, who had supported Bin Laden. This led to the UN Security Council criticizing Sudan and eventually sanctioning it. This also signaled to Bin Laden that he would lose support in Sudan. The answer is not \\"a). no\\" because the passage clearly states that the assassination attempt was indeed a tipping point for the change."},{"question":"This year has seen most parts of the UK being affected, with thousands of properties being flooded. Despite efforts to improve and strengthen community flood defence schemes, many homes and businesses remain vulnerable. The Environment Agency acknowledges that it is impossible to completely flood-proof a property, but there are a number of measures to prevent flood-water getting in and limit the damage. There are a number of routes in which floodwater can enter a property. As well as coming through doors and patios, water can find its way in through air bricks on exposed walls and through gaps in the floor. Another way is via through drains and pipes as the pressure created by flooding can reverse the flow, causing water to back-up and enter a home through sinks, toilets, washing machines etc. The Environment Agency lists two ways that homes and businesses can protect properties: \\"flood resistance\\" measures, and making a building \\"flood resilient\\". Flood resistance refers to preventing water from entering in the first place. The traditional methods of using sandbags can help for short periods when used in conjunction with plastic sheeting, and they can prevent contaminated mud and silt from entering a property. But they do allow water to seep through and are not as effective as purpose-designed flood products. There are a range of products on the market that are designed to offer protection. These include: Flood protection experts recommend that people buy products that have been awarded a kitemark, as this means that the product has undergone a series of tests to ensure it is fit for purpose. If a product is awarded a kitemark, it means that it meets the requirements outlined in PAS-1188 - a quality benchmark developed by the British Standards Institution (BSI), the Environment Agency and other partners. The benchmark covers a range of product types, including removable products that act as barriers across vulnerable points, such as doors and airbricks; temporary, freestanding barriers which are assembled close to, but not in contact with, a building; and property flood skirt systems. As well as fitting flood protection measures to your home, another measure is landscaping your garden in a way that helps divert water away from your property. From the BBC: Elsewhere: It is impossible to guarantee that flood-water will not enter your property, even if you have taken steps to protect your property. The Environment Agency lists a number of ways to make your home \\"flood resilient\\", which will limit the damage and allow residents to return to their property quickly (on average, people are unable to live in their homes for nine months after being flooded). These include: This will depend on the size of your property and the level of flood resistance and resilience you require. Figures from the Association of British Insurers (ABI) estimate that protecting a property against shallow flash floods will cost in the region of £2,000-£6,000. However, protection against prolonged flooding requires bigger changes and could cost up to £40,000. But the Environment Agency says taking measures to protect your property will limit the distress and damage caused by flooding, reduce the level of repairs and will allow you to return to your home or business more quickly. As an estimated one-in-six homes are located within at-risk areas, more than one million people have signed up to the Environment Agency's flood warning service. As well as its flood warning service, the Agency has a section on its website that offers practical advice on how people can protect their homes and businesses from flooding, including an interactive guide on ways to reduce flood damage. It also offers advice on how to develop a \\"flood plan\\" and what you and your neighbours need to do once a flood warning has been issued for your area. The National Flood Forum, a charity that is dedicated to representing people living in areas at risk from flooding, has produced the \\"blue pages\\", which is an independent directory of flood protection products. What was that article about?","response":"This article is about how to protect homes and businesses from floods in the UK. Even though stopping floods completely is not possible, there are ways to lessen the damage they can do. The Environment Agency suggests two ways to do this: to make buildings \\"flood-resistant\\" and \\"flood resilient\\". You can imagine \\"flood-resistant\\" as a big, strong superhero who prevents the water from getting into the building in the first place, and \\"flood resilient\\" as a quick healer who helps the building bounce back faster even if some water gets in. The article also says there are different ways water can sneak in, like through gaps, drains, and even through doors and walls. But don't worry, there are many products available to protect against this, including special barriers and other items - kind of like magic shields! Just like you might choose the best toy with a safety mark to make sure it's top quality, these products also have a kitemark to show they've been tested and will work. The cost of these protections can vary, but the article explains that they could save time, money, and distress in the long run. It's like spending a little money on an umbrella to stay dry instead of getting soaked in the rain and then having to pay more to replace your wet clothes. The article also talks about a warning service and other tools and advice to help people stay safe."},{"question":"Facts: - name: john jackson - yearsactive: 2001 -- present - occupation: writer Based on these bullet points, write a short biography describing the life of john jackson -lrb- writer -rrb- .

Let's solve step-by-step:","response":"We cannot definitively conclude that \\"The guy is sleeping\\" based on the given sentence. Let's break it down step-by-step: 1. \\"Guy in green shirt\\": This tells us about the person we are referring to - he is wearing a green shirt. 2. \\"with hand covering part of his face\\": This indicates that the person's hand is partially covering his face. It doesn't give us enough information to determine if he is sleeping or not, as covering the face could happen when one is sleepy, but it could also be for a variety of other reasons like rubbing eyes or resting a chin. 3. \\"in restaurant booth\\": This clue only describes the setting - the person is sitting in a restaurant booth.

What would happen if color were to disappear from the earth? Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","response":"Yes, these two questions are paraphrases of each other, as both are asking about the consequences of color disappearing on Earth. Now, to address the question at hand: Step 1: Identify what it means for color to disappear. Color disappearing from Earth implies that all objects, including natural and man-made, would lose their colors and appear in monochrome shades (e.g., greyscale). Step 2: Analyze the impact on various aspects of life. A. Impact on the environment and animals Many aspects of the natural world rely on color, such as plant and animal camouflage, predator-prey interactions, and pollination. The removal of color would likely disrupt the delicate balance of ecosystems, making it more challenging for plants and animals to survive and reproduce. B. Impact on human perception and culture Color plays a significant role in human perception, emotion, and symbolism. Entire industries rely on color, such as art, design, fashion, and advertising. With the absence of color, these fields would need to adapt to rely on other visual elements, such as texture, shape, and patterns. C. Impact on communication and safety Color is an essential aspect of communication and safety. From traffic signals to hazard warnings, color helps convey essential information for individual and public safety. Without color, alternative systems would need to be developed, which may be less efficient or more prone to misinterpretation. Step 3: Summarize potential consequences. In summary, if color were to disappear from the Earth, it would likely cause a widespread disruption to ecosystems, human perception, culture, and safety. Alternative solutions and adjustments would need to be made to adapt to a colorless world."},{"question":"Definition: You are given a science question (easy-level) and four answer options (associated with \\"A\\", \\"B\\", \\"C\\", \\"D\\").

I rarely take the time for writing reviews; however, after the disastrous experience I had at this place, I couldn't help but share my thoughts, hoping to save others from the same fate. Allow me to offer a fair warning to any potential customers considering visiting this establishment. First, let's discuss the ambiance. Upon entering, I was greeted with a strange, stale odor, as if the place hadn't been properly cleaned or ventilated in ages. The dim lighting did nothing to set a pleasant mood and actually made it difficult to read the menu. The furniture and decor were worn out and outdated, which in turn, added to the overall uninviting atmosphere. Now, moving on to the service (if you can even call it that). The staff members were not friendly or welcoming at all, but rather, quite rude and disinterested. I understand that people have their off days, but when multiple staff members display such a level of indifference, it's clear that there's a bigger problem. The wait time for our order to be taken was painfully long, and our server appeared to be more focused on scrolling through their phone than providing decent customer service. As for the food, it was honestly one of the most disappointing aspects of the entire ordeal. Though the menu boasted a variety of delicious-sounding dishes, reality couldn't be further from the case. After waiting for what felt like an eternity, our dishes arrived cold and served in a less-than-appetizing manner. Taste-wise, the food was subpar at best, bland and lacking any real flavor. Considering the exorbitant prices on the menu, I anticipated a dining experience on par with gourmet establishments. Instead, I was left with a regrettable choice that still leaves a bad taste in my mouth, both literally and figuratively. To make matters worse, the restrooms were in such poor condition it's almost unfathomable that a business can continue to operate with such blatant disregard for cleanliness and hygiene. With unsanitary surfaces, empty soap dispensers, and tattered, damp paper towels, it became evident that basic maintenance was not a priority for this establishment. In conclusion, my experience at this restaurant was nothing short of abominable. If I could give it less than one star, I would. I sincerely implore anyone considering a visit to steer clear and find a better alternative. There are plenty of other establishments that value their patrons and offer decent food, service, and atmosphere without hesitation.

They were requesting he be restrained with leather ones. I had not done any restraining and was asked to assist a woman counselor to show me the ropes (no pun intended). When we arrived in the patients room, I was shocked to see a man in his early 20’s flailing around spasmodically on the bed with his gums bleeding in between his teeth. The nurse informed us that the patient was dying of a liver disease and his body and brain had become toxic, causing delirium. The counselor instructed me to hold down his arms and she placed him in leather restraints which were fastened to the side of the bed. The most upsetting thing which to this day I can not remove from memory was this man literally snapping his jaws at me like a mad animal with traumatized bloody gums from biting so hard on the cloth restraints. There was nothing I, or anyone could do, except keep him restrained from hurting himself or others. It is the kind of witness to suffering I had never experienced before, and I felt almost relieved when the nurse quietly said, “ He will die before morning. “ I suppose what is so traumatic about witnessing such situations is the utter sense of helplessness.

Thanks to the doctor in charge of his institutionalization (James Hampton), Karl lands a job at a repair shop in the small town where he was born and raised. He befriends 12-year-old Frank Wheatley (Lucas Black) and shares some of the details of his past, including the killings. Frank reveals that his father was killed - hit by a train - leaving him and his mother on their own. He later admits that he lied, and that his father committed suicide. Frank introduces Karl to his mother, Linda (Natalie Canerday), as well as her gay friend, Vaughan Cunningham (John Ritter), the manager of the dollar store where she is employed. Despite Vaughan's concerns about Karl's history in the mental hospital, Linda allows him to move into her garage, which angers Linda's abusive alcoholic boyfriend, Doyle Hargraves (Dwight Yoakam). Karl bonds with Linda, who makes him biscuits to eat, and also with Vaughan, who tells Karl that a gay man and a mentally challenged man face similar obstacles of intolerance and ridicule in small-town America. Karl quickly becomes a father figure to Frank, who misses his father and despises Doyle. Karl is haunted by the task given to him by his parents when he was six or eight years old to dispose of his premature, unwanted, newborn brother. He visits his father (Robert Duvall), who has become a mentally unbalanced hermit living in the dilapidated home...","response":"In the movie \\"Sling Blade\\" directed by Billy Bob Thornton, the character Doyle Hargraves is portrayed as an abusive, alcoholic boyfriend to Linda, Frank's mother. Doyle is a source of distress and discomfort for both Linda and her son, Frank. The main character of the movie, Karl Childers, who is intellectually disabled, does end up killing Doyle but not without significant consequences both morally and legally. The decision to kill Doyle is one that Karl doesn't take lightly. It is informed by his deep affection for Linda and Frank, and his desire to protect them from Doyle's abuse. The act itself is accomplished using the same type of weapon that was used earlier in the film and mentioned in your film proposal, the \\"Kaiser blade\\" or as Karl calls it, the \\"sling blade.\\" Remember, Karl is no stranger to the violent use of such implements, having already killed his mother and her lover when he was younger. In terms of the number of blows it took to kill Doyle, the film isn't explicitly clear. The scene is highly intense and emotionally charged, and doesn't focus on the gory details. Karl viciously swings the blade, perhaps multiple times, until Doyle is dead. The act is not valorized; it is portrayed as gruesome and devastating. So, as an investor, you may want to consider the impact this violent scene and the overarching theme of violence might have on potential audiences. On the one hand, the intensity of these scenes might be off-putting to some. However, others might appreciate the exploration of complex themes such as morality, mental illness, and the lengths one might go to protect those they care about. You should also consider the performances by notable actors like Billy Bob Thornton and Dwight Yoakam, which may draw in audiences out of appreciation for their work. Be sure to weigh these factors carefully, knowing that the ultimate return on investment would depend on the film’s market acceptance and performance, beyond the obscurity of how many blows were needed for Karl to kill Doyle."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: On a scale of 1-5 (with 1 being least favorable and 5 being most favorable), how would you rate this review? \\"It takes all your battery 😠😠😠😠😠💩 and it does not work I download it and it download' s again 😣😣😝😝😤😤😲😠😠😠\\" Answer:","response":"Based on the information provided in the review, it seems that the user had a negative experience with the app or product, as they mentioned it drained their device's battery and experienced issues with the download process.

Teka Not too many people know what to do when someone has a heart attack other than call 911.But Teka, an Australian Cattle Dog, skipped the phone call when her owner suffered a severe heart attack.Not only did she bark in his face to bring him back to consciousness and run outside barking to attract attention, but she climbed on his chest and jumped up and down. When medics arrived, they couldn't say whether or not Teka's unusual version of CPR had any effect, but her owner feels grateful to her.And her efforts didn't go unnoticed: Teka was given a Purple Cross medal for bravery by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Zoey Size is no barrier to a dog determined to protect her family and Zoey, a 5-pound chihuahua puppy from Colorado, is living proof. She made headlines in 2007 after saving a one-year-old from the bite of a large rattlesnake. Zoey, who weighed only five pounds, was just 10 months old at the time, but she rose to the occasion when needed.One-year-old Booker West was playing in his grandparent's backyard when a rattlesnake struck at him! Zoey sprang into action, putting herself between the snake and the kid.She got several snakebites and was rushed to an animal hospital.Her head swelled and she almost lost an eye, but with proper treatment, Zoey made a full recovery. Hachiko Hachiko, an Akita, was brought to Tokyo in 1924 by Ueno, a college professor. Every day Hachiko waited for him to return from work, meeting him at the train station at four. The following year, Ueno suffered a stroke at work and died.Unaware of his death, the dog still returned to the train station every day to await his owner.He became such a familiar presence there, in fact, that the station master set out food for the dog and gave him a bed in the station.Even so, every day at four, he hopefully waited by the tracks as the train pulled in, searching through the crowd for his master.Every day.For ten years. Upon his death in 1935, Hachiko was a national celebrity and a bronze statue of him was installed at Shibuya Station as a tribute. Stubby In 1917 Stubby was adopted by a soldier, who trained him to drill and salute. His owner developed such a strong connection with him that when he was sent to war in Europe, he took Stubby along, hiding him on the ship bound for France. Stubby proved a war star.He served 18 months in the front lines and took part in seventeen battles.He kept watch, warned the soldiers of surprise attacks, and saved the wounded in no man's land.He once found a German spy and held him by the seat of the pants until American soldiers arrived.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","response":"If the soil is polluted, it may not have a direct impact on the heating process within the house itself, since the process described primarily involves coal combustion, steam generation, and powering of turbine blades. However, soil pollution can indirectly affect the process and the efficiency of providing heat to the house in several ways: 1. Groundwater contamination: Polluted soil can contaminate the groundwater, which may be a source of water for the boiler. Contaminated water can cause scaling or corrosion within the boiler system, reducing its efficiency and leading to less heat production for the house. 2. Coal quality: If the soil pollution is due to the presence of contaminants in the coal itself, this can lower the efficiency of the coal combustion process. Poor quality coal may not burn as efficiently, leading to lower heat production and reduced effectiveness of the heating system. 3. Air pollution: Soil pollution can contribute to air pollution, especially if the contaminants in the soil become airborne. This can have an indirect effect on the coal combustion process by reducing the quality of the air used for combustion. Poor air quality may reduce the efficiency of the combustion process and subsequently generate less heat for the house. 4. Impact on power plant infrastructure: Soil pollution can have detrimental effects on the infrastructure of the power plant supplying power for the heating system. If the foundations of the power plant are built on polluted soil, it can cause erosion or weakening of the structure, which could potentially lead to a decrease in efficiency or failure of the plant. 5. Health hazards and regulatory requirements: Soil pollution may result in stricter regulatory requirements or increase the health hazards associated with the power plant operation. Meeting these stricter regulations may incur additional time and resource investments, which could inadvertently lead to reduced efficiency in the heating system and subsequently less heat for the house. In summary, while soil pollution does not have a direct impact on the heating process, it can cause a series of indirect effects that may lower the efficiency of the heating system and result in less heat generation for the house."},{"question":"Choose from options: Determine if the sentence is true based on the text below: The Eolica Sarichioi Wind Farm is a suposed wind power project in Sarichioi, Tulcea County, Romania The Eolica Sarichioi Wind Farm is a proposed wind power project in Sarichioi, Tulcea County, Romania.

Article: A TV series in England,Away from it all,has surprised everyone by becoming a success with young people across the country. Its success is surprising because the series is about the relaxing lifestyles of people who live in the country. There is none of the action that we usually see on TV today. There are also no stressful moments, busy offices or crowded cities. Away from it all is set in the peaceful English countryside and tells simple stories about people's kindness. The director of the TV series says that its success is a sign of teenagers suffering from stress. They say that watching Away from it all helps teenagers forget about the pressures of exams and homework, and the troubles that fill the world today. They also say that it's a good sign of today's young people turning to happier TV series as it shows they want a happier and healthier world. Although the series' success might have a good side, many teachers and parents are worried, however. They say that some of their students and children spend more time before TV and are using Away from it all as an excuse for not finishing homework. Some children have even refused to learn for exams because they say that they can only get personal happiness by avoiding stressful situations. And what do the experts say? Paula Ray, a doctor of education, says that TV can influence children's lifestyles. But she says that if a child reacts strongly, it' s likely that there are other reasons for his change in behaviour. She says that there is nothing wrong with watching Away from it all but suggests that parents should let their children know TV is not the same as real life.

OPTIONS: - unacceptable. - acceptable.","response":"To evaluate the test sentence for grammatical correctness, I will examine each component and determine how well it adheres to English grammar rules. Test sentence: \\"In the mountains there raged a fire.\\" Step 1: Identify the subject and verb. In this sentence, \\"fire\\" is the subject, and \\"raged\\" is the verb. Step 2: Check for subject-verb agreement. The subject \\"fire\\" is singular, and the verb \\"raged\\" is also singular, so they agree with each other. Step 3: Analyze the sentence structure. The sentence begins with a prepositional phrase \\"In the mountains,\\" which gives context to where the action takes place. Next, the sentence uses the word \\"there\\" as an expletive to introduce the subject. This structure is acceptable in English. Step 4: Check for spelling and typing errors. The word \\"r\\" is not a correctly spelled or appropriately used word in this context. It should be replaced with the correct full word \\"are.\\" The corrected sentence: \\"In the mountains there raged a fire.\\" Verdict: The test sentence contains a spelling error and should be considered \\"unacceptable\\" in its current form.

The Dutch Republic, long-time British ally, kept its neutrality intact, fearing the odds against Britain and Prussia fighting the great powers of Europe, even tried to prevent Britain's domination in India. Naples, Sicily, and Savoy, although sided with Franco-Spanish party, declined to join the coalition under the fear of British power. The taxation needed for war caused the Russian people considerable hardship, being added to the taxation of salt and alcohol begun by Empress Elizabeth in 1759 to complete her addition to the Winter Palace. Like Sweden, Russia concluded a separate peace with Prussia.\\". Can you tell me what it is? Answer:","response":"The conflict mentioned in your text appears to be escalating in multiple locations across Europe, including among larger nations, middle powers and small powers. However, specific locations mentioned include Denmark-Norway, the Dutch Republic, Britain, and Russia, as they negotiate their interests, alliances, and fears related to the escalating conflict. While other locations like Naples, Sicily, Savoy, and India are also mentioned, they are primarily in the context of the broader international conflict. Overall, countries are strategizing their positions considering the increasing conflict, with some attempting to maintain neutrality. Meanwhile, the conflict's impact on Russia's domestic affairs—namely, taxation—is also notable. Please note that the specifics of 'where' the conflict is escalating would need more context, like a time period or the parties involved in the conflict.

It is possible for a woman to perform both actions, but they are not necessarily directly related or happening simultaneously. A woman can work as a bartender and feed her child at different times. Based on the analysis of the statements, we can conclude the following: Answer: It is not necessarily true that \\"A woman feeding her child\\" given the sentence \\"A woman is working as a bartender.\\" The two actions can be performed by the same woman but are not directly connected or happening at the same time."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Information: - The South Island or Te Waipounamu (\\"Mori\\") is the larger of the two major islands of New Zealand, the other being the smaller but more populous North Island. It is bordered to the north by Cook Strait, to the west by the Tasman Sea, and to the south and east by the Pacific Ocean. The South Island covers and is influenced by a temperate climate. - The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east. - Wellington is the capital city and second most populous urban area of New Zealand, with residents. It is at the south-western tip of the North Island, between Cook Strait and the Rimutaka Range. Wellington is the major population centre of the southern North Island and is the administrative centre of the Wellington Region, which also includes the Kapiti Coast and Wairarapa. As the nation's capital city, the New Zealand Government and Parliament, Supreme Court and most of the civil service are based in the city. - New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland. - The Southern Alps (Mori: K Tiritiri o te Moana ) are a mountain range extending along much of the length of New Zealand's South Island, reaching its greatest elevations near the island's western side.

While isostatic response is important, an increase in the mean elevation of a region can only occur in response to tectonic processes of crustal thickening (such as mountain building events), changes in the density distribution of the crust and underlying mantle, and flexural support due to the bending of rigid lithosphere. - Cook Strait lies between the North and South Islands of New Zealand. It connects the Tasman Sea on the northwest with the South Pacific Ocean on the southeast, and runs next to the capital city, Wellington. It is wide at its narrowest point, and is considered one of the most dangerous and unpredictable waters in the world. - The Tasman Sea (Mori: \\"Te Tai-o-Rehua\\") is a marginal sea of the South Pacific Ocean, situated between Australia and New Zealand. It measures about across and about from north to south. The sea was named after the Dutch explorer Abel Janszoon Tasman, who was the first recorded European to encounter New Zealand and Tasmania. The British explorer Captain James Cook later extensively navigated the Tasman Sea in the 1770s as part of his first voyage of exploration. - The Seaward River is a river in New Zealand 's South Island .

Many members of other rodent genera and families are also referred to as rats, and share many characteristics with true rats. - Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands. It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east. Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney. - Climate is the statistics of weather, usually over a 30-year interval. It is measured by assessing the patterns of variation in temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, precipitation, atmospheric particle count and other meteorological variables in a given region over long periods of time.

He soon meets with the widow (Lelia Goldoni) of his friend and fellow thief Roger Beckermann (Rossano Brazzi), who was killed by the Mafia while driving a Lamborghini Miura in the Italian Alps. Mrs Beckermann gives Croker her husband's plans for the robbery that attracted the hostile attention of his killers, which detail a way to steal 4 million dollars in the city of Turin and escape to Switzerland. Croker breaks back into his former prison to convince Mr. Bridger (NoÃ«l Coward), the head of a huge criminal empire, to finance the plan. Bridger, who has bribed almost all of the prison guards to work for him, initially rejects the plan, but changes his mind after he learns Fiat is set to build a new factory in China. With Bridger's backing, Croker recruits computer expert Professor Peach (Benny Hill), his girlfriend Lorna (Maggie Blye) and a team of thieves and drivers. The plan calls for Peach to replace the programme in the computer controlling Turin's traffic control system, creating a paralysing traffic jam that will allow the thieves to escape with the gold in three Mini Cooper S getaway cars.[7] After planning and training, Croker and crew set out for Turin. Mafia boss Altabani (Raf Vallone) and his underlings are waiting in the Alps at the same pass where they killed Beckermann. Altabani warns Croker that the Mafia are aware of the gang's intentions and smashes their Jaguar E-Type cars, sending Croker's personal Aston Martin DB4 drophead off a cliff. Croker tells Altabani that Mr. Bridger will avenge their deaths by attacking the Italian community in Britain. Altabani lets them go, ordering them to return to England.

At this point, they were already fully Christianized. Islam later emerged as the majority religion during the centuries of Ottoman rule, though a significant Christian minority remained. After independence (1912) from the Ottoman Empire, the Albanian republican, monarchic and later Communist regimes followed a systematic policy of separating religion from official functions and cultural life. Albania never had an official state religion either as a republic or as a kingdom. In the 20th century, the clergy of all faiths was weakened under the monarchy, and ultimately eradicated during the 1950s and 1960s, under the state policy of obliterating all organized religion from Albanian territories. The Communist regime that took control of Albania after World War II persecuted and suppressed religious observance and institutions and entirely banned religion to the point where Albania was officially declared to be the world's first atheist state. Religious freedom has returned to Albania since the regime's change in 1992. Albania joined the Organisation of the Islamic Conference in 1992, following the fall of the communist government, but will not be attending the 2014 conference due a dispute regarding the fact that its parliament never ratified the country's membership. Albanian Muslim populations (mainly secular and of the Sunni branch) are found throughout the country whereas Albanian Orthodox Christians as well as Bektashis are concentrated in the south and Roman Catholics are found in the north of the country. The first recorded Albanian Protestant was Said Toptani, who traveled around Europe, and in 1853 returned to Tirana and preached Protestantism. He was arrested and imprisoned by the Ottoman authorities in 1864. Mainline evangelical Protestants date back to the work of Congregational and later Methodist missionaries and the work of the British and Foreign Bible Society in the 19th century. The Evangelical Alliance, which is known as VUSh, was founded in 1892. Today VUSh has about 160 member congregations from different Protestant denominations. VUSh organizes marches in Tirana including one against blood feuds in 2010. Bibles are provided by the Interconfessional Bible Society of Albania. The first full Albanian Bible to be printed was the Filipaj translation printed in 1990. After reading the above, is \\"Late 10th\\" the correct answer to the question \\"By when were the Albanians fully Christianized?\\"? Pick from: i. no ii. yes","response":"ii. yes The passage states that \\"The Albanians first appear in the historical record in Byzantine sources of the late 11th century. At this point, they were already fully Christianized.\\" This means that the Albanians were fully Christianized by the late 11th century, making \\"Late 10th\\" incorrect.

Be empathetic: Display empathy and compassion, especially when your friends are experiencing difficulties or challenges. Being supportive and understanding will help strengthen your friendships. 7. Practice patience: Building a strong and meaningful friendship takes time and effort. Be patient as relationships naturally progress at different paces. 8. Be reliable and trustworthy: Keep your promises, maintain confidentiality, and demonstrate loyalty. Being reliable and trustworthy will earn you the respect and admiration of your friends. 9. Engage in social activities: Plan social events, attend gatherings, and get involved in group activities. An active social life creates opportunities to make new friends and maintain existing connections. 10. Stay open to technological avenues: While it's essential to maintain a balance between technology and real-life connections, utilizing social media and online platforms can help you make friends too. Meet people who share your interests in online forums, gaming communities, or social media platforms. Now, to address the second question: how to make friends that are not in tech? While the second question may appear similar in meaning to the first one, it addresses a slightly different issue. This question concerns making friends who have different interests and are not technology-oriented, whereas the first question is more general. Here are some strategies to help you make friends with interests outside of technology: 1. Diversify your interests: Explore new subjects and develop hobbies apart from technology, such as art, sports, literature, or nature. Broadening your interests will give you more common ground with a wider range of people. 2. Attend non-technology events: Join clubs, classes, and social groups that are unrelated to technology. These events provide a chance to meet people who share your newfound interests. 3. Share your expertise kindly: While you want to make connections outside of the tech realm, you may have unique technological knowledge that can be helpful to others. Share this knowledge with your new friends when appropriate, but avoid being condescending or flaunting your expertise. 4. Learn from your non-tech friends: Just as you have knowledge to share, your non-tech friends have their own areas of expertise. Be open to learning from them and respect their skills and interests. 5. Be active on non-tech platforms: If you're using technology to communicate with others, participate in online forums, social media platforms, or groups that cater to your non-technology interests. In summary, these two questions are not mere paraphrases of each other. While both seek to understand the process of making friends, the first question has a broader scope, whereas the second question specifically focuses on befriending individuals with interests outside the domain of technology. By understanding these nuances and following the various strategies outlined above, you can successfully make friends in and out of tech and enrich your social life."},{"question":"First question: Where can I start learning Hindi?

The case has gained significant attention, eliciting a widespread call for a thorough examination of the events leading to the tragic incident and further review of the officers' actions. Background While the official report is yet to be released, sources close to the matter have provided a clearer understanding of the incident. The man, whose identity is currently withheld by the authorities, was arrested based on undisclosed charges. Following the arrest, he was transported to the custody suite where he later passed away. The cause of death is still under investigation. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), the independent body responsible for investigating complaints against the police, swiftly launched an inquiry into the matter. As the investigation progressed, critical evidence emerged implicating five Sussex Police officers' potential misconduct during the arrest and detention process. Criminal Charges and Their Implications The exact nature and severity of the criminal charges the five officers could face remain undisclosed. However, the possibility of criminal charges being filed indicates that the IOPC suspects significant misconduct, which may have played a direct or indirect role in the man's death. Possible charges could range from excessive force, negligence, manslaughter, or even murder, depending on the investigation's outcome. Should the officers be charged, the event's aftermath may have significant implications for the broader policing community. The legal proceedings surrounding the case will be closely monitored, and a high-profile court case will likely spark public debate on police accountability and potential systemic issues within the police force. Additionally, the case could serve as a referendum on current officer training methods, mental health awareness, and the use of force in various arrest situations. Concerns for Police Accountability and Systemic Issues The incident has fueled public concern over police accountability, putting law enforcement agencies under increased scrutiny. The possibility of criminal charges filed against the officers in question raises questions about the transparency of police work, the use of force in arrest situations, and the general protection of detainee rights. Many argue that systemic issues within the police force may contribute to violence or negligence in arrest situations. The five Sussex Police officers' potential criminal charges underscore the need for a comprehensive review of policies and practices to address these issues effectively. Furthermore, police departments across the nation may face increasing pressure to demonstrate an ongoing commitment to improving officer training and ensuring safe environments for detainees. Conclusion The ongoing investigation into the death of a man under Sussex Police's custody serves as a stark reminder of the importance of police accountability and the need for improved procedures at every stage of the arrest and detainment process. As the IOPC continues its investigation, a clearer picture of the possible criminal charges and the case's broader implications will emerge. Regardless of the outcome, the incident has already ignited public conversations on police conduct, use of force, and accountability measures. It is an opportunity for law enforcement agencies to re-evaluate their practices and policies, ensuring that such tragic occurrences are thoroughly investigated and that appropriate measures are taken to prevent their recurrence."},{"question":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

I think that this is important because the treatment of acne is such a personalised journey that it is good to hear about the results of the skincare from a variety of people. In the third review of this series, Nalini from The Made Up Maiden has reviewed this acne set for me. Nalini is 30 and has troublesome skin. She has tried many products to fix it without a lot of luck. Here is Nalini's review: I've always thought the journey to clear skin can be quite a complicated one. There are just so many things that affect the condition of your skin; genetics, skincare, diet, hormones, weather, stress...the list is endless. In my case, both parents had acne when they were younger, and I had hopes that my acne would fade once I left my teens. My skin isn't completely horrendous, but I do have some minimal scarring on my cheeks (which goes away after a little while), and the odd large pimple on my chin during those hormonal times, which goes away after a while but is still really frustrating when it happens! I'm 30 years old, so it looks like these problems are here to stay. I have contemplated taking hormonal pills or medication aimed at reducing acne, but decided that the possible side effects haven't really been worth the benefit.

It typically results in warm, swollen, and painful joints. Pain and stiffness often worsen following rest. Most commonly, the wrist and hands are involved, with the same joints typically involved on both sides of the body. The disease may also affect other parts of the body. This may result in a low red blood cell count, inflammation around the lungs, and inflammation around the heart. Fever and low energy may also be present. Often, symptoms come on gradually over weeks to months. While the cause of rheumatoid arthritis is not clear, it is believed to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors. The underlying mechanism involves the body's immune system attacking the joints. This results in inflammation and thickening of the joint capsule. It also affects the underlying bone and cartilage. The diagnosis is made mostly on the basis of a person's signs and symptoms. X-rays and laboratory testing may support a diagnosis or exclude other diseases with similar symptoms. Other diseases that may present similarly include systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriatic arthritis, and fibromyalgia among others. The goal of treatment is to reduce pain, decrease inflammation, and improve a person's overall functioning. This may be helped by balancing rest and exercise, the use of splints and braces, or the use of assistive devices. Pain medications, steroids, and NSAIDs are frequently used to help with symptoms. A group of medications called disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), such as hydroxychloroquine and methotrexate, may be used to try to slow the progression of disease. Biological DMARDs may be used when disease does not respond to other treatments. However, they may have a greater rate of adverse effects. Surgery to repair, replace, or fuse joints may help in certain situations. Most alternative medicine treatments are not supported by evidence. RA affects between 0.5 and 1% of adults in the developed... - Arthritis is a term often used to mean any disorder that affects joints. Symptoms generally include joint pain and stiffness. Other symptoms may include redness, warmth, swelling, and decreased range of motion of the affected joints. In some types other organs are also affected. Onset can be gradual or sudden. There are over 100 types of arthritis. The most common forms are osteoarthritis (degenerative joint disease) and rheumatoid arthritis. Osteoarthritis usually occurs with age and affects the fingers, knees, and hips. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disorder that often affects the hands and feet. Other types include gout, lupus, fibromyalgia, and septic arthritis. They are all types of rheumatic disease. Treatment may include resting the joint and alternating between applying ice and heat. Weight loss and exercise may also be useful. Pain medications such as ibuprofen and paracetamol (acetaminophen) may be used. In some a joint replacement may be useful. Osteoarthritis affects more than 3.8% of people while rheumatoid arthritis affects about 0.24% of people. Gout affects about 1 to 2% of the Western population at some point in their lives. In Australia about 15% of people are affected, while in the United States more than 20% of have a type of arthritis. Overall the disease becomes more common with age. Arthritis is a common reason that people miss work and can result in a decreased quality of life. The term is from Greek \\"arthro-\\" meaning joint and \\"-itis\\" meaning inflammation. - Palindromic rheumatism ( PR ) consists of sudden and rapidly developing attacks of arthritis . There is acute pain , redness , swelling , and disability of one ( usually ) or multiple joints . The interval between recurrent attacks is extremely variable and how long the attack lasts is also variable . There is no joint damage after attacks . - Fibromyalgia (FM) is a medical condition characterised by chronic widespread pain and a heightened pain response to pressure. Other symptoms include feeling tired to a degree that normal activities are affected, sleep problems, and troubles with memory. Some people also report restless legs syndrome, bowel or bladder problems, numbness and tingling, and sensitivity to noise, lights or temperature. Fibromyalgia is frequently associated with depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Other types of chronic pain are also frequently present. The cause of fibromyalgia is unknown; however, it is believed to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors with half the risk attributed to each. The condition runs in families and many genes are believed to be involved. Environmental factors may include psychological stress, trauma, and certain infections. The pain appears to result from processes in the central nervous system and the condition is referred to as a \\"central sensitization syndrome\\". Fibromyalgia is recognized as a disorder by the US National Institutes of Health and the American College of Rheumatology. There is no specific diagnostic test. Diagnosis involves first ruling out other potential causes and verifying that a set number of symptoms are present. The treatment of fibromyalgia can be difficult. Recommendations often include getting enough sleep, exercising regularly, and eating a healthy diet. Cognitive behavioral therapy may also be helpful. The medications duloxetine, milnacipran, or pregabalin may be used. Use of opioid pain medication is controversial with some stating their use is poorly supported by evidence and others saying that weak opioids may be reasonable if other medications are not effective. Dietary supplements also lack evidence to support their use. While fibromyalgia can last a long time, it does not result in death or tissue damage. Fibromyalgia is estimated to affect 28% of the population. Females are affected about twice as often as males. Rates appear... - Septic arthritis, also known as infectious arthritis or joint infection, is the purulent invasion of a joint by an infectious agent which produces arthritis. People with artificial joints are more at risk than the general population but have slightly different symptoms, are infected with different organisms and require different treatment. Septic arthritis is considered a medical emergency. If untreated, it may destroy the joint in a period of days. The infection may also spread to other parts of the body. - Replacement arthroplasty (from Greek \\"arthron\\", joint, limb, articulate, + \\"plassein\\", to form, mould, forge, feign, make an image of), or joint replacement surgery, is a procedure of orthopedic surgery in which an arthritic or dysfunctional joint surface is replaced with an orthopedic prosthesis. Joint replacement is considered as a treatment when severe joint pain or dysfunction is not alleviated by less-invasive therapies. During the latter half of the 20th century, rheumasurgery developed as a subspecialty focused on these and a few other procedures in patients with rheumatic diseases. - Osteoarthritis (OA) is a type of joint disease that results from breakdown of joint cartilage and underlying bone. The most common symptoms are joint pain and stiffness. Initially, symptoms may occur only following exercise, but over time may become constant. Other symptoms may include joint swelling, decreased range of motion, and when the back is affected weakness or numbness of the arms and legs. The most commonly involved joints are those near the ends of the fingers, at the base of the thumb, neck, lower back, knee, and hips. Joints on one side of the body are often more affected than those on the other. Usually the symptoms come on over years. It can affect work and normal daily activities. Unlike other types of arthritis, only the joints are typically affected. Causes include previous joint injury, abnormal joint or limb development, and inherited factors. Risk is greater in those who are overweight, have one leg of a different length, and have jobs that result in high levels of joint stress. Osteoarthritis is believed to be caused by mechanical stress on the joint and low grade inflammatory processes. It develops as cartilage is lost and the underlying bone becomes affected. As pain may make it difficult to exercise, muscle loss may occur. Diagnosis is typically based on signs and symptoms, with medical imaging and other tests occasionally used to either support or rule out other problems. In contrast to rheumatoid arthritis, which is primarily an inflammatory condition, in osteoarthritis, the joints do not typically become hot or red. Treatment includes exercise, efforts to decrease joint stress, support groups, and pain medications. Efforts to decrease joint stress include resting and the use of a cane. Weight loss may help in those who are overweight. Pain medications may include paracetamol (acetaminophen) as well as NSAIDs such as naproxen or ibuprofen. Long-term opioid use is generally discouraged due to lack of information on benefits as well as risks of addiction and other side effects. If...

Yes or no? Answer: The skin interfaces with the environment and is the first line of defense from external factors. Question: what is human skin made of A:","response":"Yes, your statement is correct that the skin interfaces with the environment and acts as the first line of defense against external factors. Now, to answer your question: Human skin is primarily made of multiple layers, cells, and tissue that work together to provide protection, regulate body temperature, and perform various other functions essential for maintaining overall health. The three main layers of the skin are the epidermis, dermis, and hypodermis. Each of these layers consists of specific components and structures: 1. Epidermis: The outermost layer of the skin serves as the primary barrier between the body and the environment. It is made up of several types of cells, including: a. Keratinocytes: These cells produce keratin, a fibrous protein that gives skin its strength and waterproof properties. Keratinocytes undergo a process called stratification, where newly formed cells push older cells toward the skin's surface, where they eventually die and are shed. b. Melanocytes: These cells produce melanin, a pigment responsible for the skin's color and protection against ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Melanin absorbs UV light and dissipates it as heat, preventing damage to the skin and underlying tissues. c. Langerhans cells: These cells are part of the immune system and function as sentinels, detecting pathogens and other foreign materials that may breach the skin's surface. They help initiate an immune response to protect the body. 2. Dermis: The middle layer of the skin provides structural support, elasticity, and strength. The dermis is primarily composed of: a. Collagen and elastin fibers: These proteins provide the skin with strength and flexibility. Collagen is responsible for the skin's structural integrity, while elastin allows the skin to stretch and return to its original shape. b. Fibroblasts: These cells produce and maintain the extracellular matrix, which consists of collagen, elastin, and other proteins that provide structural support. c. Blood vessels: These provide oxygen and nutrients to the skin cells while also removing waste products. Blood vessels also play a role in temperature regulation, as they dilate or constrict to regulate heat dissipation. d. Nerve endings: These sensory receptors detect and transmit information related to touch, pressure, pain, and temperature signals to the brain. 3. Hypodermis: Also known as the subcutaneous layer, the hypodermis connects the skin to the underlying tissues and organs. Its primary components include: a. Adipose tissue: Fat cells store energy and provide insulation, helping to regulate body temperature. b. Connective tissue: This layer of tissue anchors the skin to the underlying structures, such as muscles and bones. c. Blood vessels and nerves: These extend from the dermis into the hypodermis, supplying nutrients and oxygen to the skin and facilitating the sensory functions of the skin. In summary, human skin is a complex organ made up of multiple layers, cells, and proteins that interact together to provide protection, maintain temperature regulation, and perform various other essential functions. The three primary skin layers - the epidermis, dermis, and hypodermis - each have unique structures and functions, contributing to the overall functioning of the skin as a whole."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

Plot title: Sleepaway Camp IV: The Survivor Movie plot: Allison Kramer (Carrie Chambers), a survivor of the original Sleepaway Camp, is being plagued by nightmares which gruesomely force her to revisit the camp site. Unable to recall the actual occurrences due to a forced mental block, she seeks the help of a psychiatrist in overcoming her insomnia. After numerous visits and hypnosis, Allison's psychiatrist advises her that she is a survivor of a massacre which occurred at a camp over a decade ago. Her disbelief for the whole situation inclines her doctor to advise her to return to the site for an afternoon, in hopes that if she were to see the scenes of the crimes, she would remember them and overcome them. Doubtful, Allison sets out for the camp she attended but never remembered. When she reaches her destination, she finds the camp to be closed and abandoned, the land now Federal Property. She remininces about the events that occurred in the original trilogy. Allison narrates over many of these scenes. Archive footage from the first three film are organised into themes, such as Angela being afraid of water. Allison looks for the ranger, Jack (John Lodicos), that her psychologist, Dr. Lewis, advised her to meet up with. The ranger tries to have sex with her, but Allison decides things are going too far and runs away. The ranger chases her through the woods. Allison stops because she can run no longer. Then she is found by a hunter, Eugene (Victor Campos). Later on, she approaches the ranger with a gun and threatens to kill him if he doesn't stay away from her. She then approaches the hunter and shoots him. In the next scene, Allison is standing in the sun with a knife, which the sun is reflecting light off of.

Cupid was a prominent figure in Roman mythology and continued to be a popular theme in art, literature, and folklore in Western culture throughout the centuries. Cupid's character is deeply rooted in classical mythology. He is the son of Venus, the Roman goddess of love and beauty, and Mars, the Roman god of war, which symbolizes the duality of love as both a passionate, tender emotion and a force that can lead to chaos and conflict. In Roman mythology, Cupid is mainly known for his various love affairs and adventures that often ended up turning dramatic or tragic. These stories were designed to teach moral lessons or warn against the potential negative consequences of falling in love. There are countless stories and legends involving Cupid, but one of the most famous is the tale of Cupid and Psyche. In this myth, Cupid falls in love with a mortal woman named Psyche, who is renowned for her incredible beauty. Venus, Cupid's mother and Psyche's ardent admirer, grows jealous of Psyche's beauty and sends Cupid to make her fall in love with a monstrous beast. However, Cupid mistakenly scratches himself with one of his golden arrows and is overcome with love for Psyche. The story continues as the couple faces numerous trials and tribulations, including Psyche being given seemingly impossible tasks by Venus in an attempt to drive a wedge between the lovers. Ultimately, through their love and dedication to one another, the couple triumphs over adversity, and Psyche is granted immortality by Jupiter, the king of the gods, allowing her and Cupid to live together for eternity as divine figures. Apart from the story of Cupid and Psyche, Cupid is often mentioned in other myths, poems, and literature, where he serves as a symbol of love and passion. The image of Cupid shooting arrows from his bow has become a popular and recognized symbol of affection, infatuation, and romantic love, particularly in connection to Valentine's Day celebrations. The concept of \\"Cupid's arrow\\" has persisted throughout history as the spark or catalyst that ignites feelings of adoration and attraction when two people begin to fall in love. Although Cupid is commonly seen as a light-hearted and mischievous character who brings love and joy to those he targets, his presence in mythology and literature also carries darker undertones. This signifies the various qualities of love and the complexity of human emotions, with the potential for love to lead to both happiness and misery. As the Roman god of love, Cupid will continue to be a symbolically important figure in the ongoing exploration of the human experience of love through art, literature, and cultural mythology."},{"question":"Combine facts and answer this: Where has Chihiro Noda and the forward for Juventus played together?","response":"I apologize, but I don't have direct access to real-time information or existing facts about specific individuals.

Each kind gesture has been documented on the Instagram feed Tipsforjesus, which has the tagline, 'Doing the Lord's work, one tip at a time.' Selby was among a small group of alumni who made an astronomical fortune at PayPal, and since leaving the firm has dabbled in film production, venture capitalism and now, according to his Facebook, he's opened a drycleaning business. While he hasn't officially revealed himself anywhere since the story went viral, he posted a link to an article about one generous gratuity on his page. And his Facebook friends appear to be in on the charitable scheme. One, Anne Woolway, commented: 'Do we win if we know whom is behind tipsforjesus?' Another, Rob Hughes, added: 'and the mystery tipper strikes again...' He also owns homes in all the states where tips were received, including multiple residences in Arizona and California. Last year, Selby started a company Incognito Pictures with the aim to make movies for a budget of 10 million or less. Selby secured 50 million in financing for the project and entered into a long-term distribution deal with The Weinstein Company. Tipsforjesus has left a trail of extremely happy servers across the country after dropping the ridiculously generous tips. The servers at the Legends of Notre Dame, pictured, were thrilled by the generous tip. Harris' Restaurant in San Francisco received a 1500 tip on a 468 bill. Selby earned a reputation for leaving extremely generous tips and Instagram-ing photos to prove it such as this one with a waitress who has just received 5,000. Little was known about Tipsforjesus bar an Instagram page until his identity was revealed Wednesday. Until now, little was known about the. mystery money man bar the Instagram page where a series of photographs. have been posted since September of happy servers and receipts bearing. gratuities with up to five figures. Adding. up all the tips posted so far, Tips4jesus has handed out over 54,000. to servers across the country in establishments including Tio's Mexican. Cafe in Ann Arbor, the Paris Club in Chicago and the Hungry Cat in Los. Angeles. To begin with many people – especially waiters and waitresses - questioned the authenticity of the mega-tips which have so far ranged in size from 500 to 10,000. But one lucky recipient came come forward to confirm that Tips4jesus is the real deal. Robbie Schulz, co-owner of the Alley Bar in Ann Arbor, who was lucky enough to pick up a 7,000 tip for a 215 bar tab. Selby was also generous in Phoenix at the restaurant Crudo. Robbie Schulz, co-owner of the Alley Bar in Ann Arbor, was lucky enough to pick up a 7,000 tip for a 215 bar tab, he described Tipforjesus as 'friendly and polite' Tipsforjesus Instagram feed was set up to show the growing number of generous tips. Schulz recently confirmed to local blog. Damn Arbor that the tip was real and that he served the mysterious. Tip4jesus in September when he and his entourage were in town for the. Notre Dame versus Michigan game. According to Schulz, the Tips4jesus crew found themselves at his bar at 1:45am after a couple of other places had turned them away. He described Tips4jesus as friendly, polite, nice and a pleasure to serve and that he was told he would be taken care of the staff at the end of the night. Schultz had expectations that perhaps a 50 tip might be in the offing, but was flabbergasted when Tips4jesus reached for his black American Express card and tipped an amazing 7,000. A black AMEX card was a sure sign that the customer was going to be good for massive tip as the exclusive card is by invitation only and. the average cardholder has 16.3 million in assets and a household. income of 1.3 million.

At Legends Of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana, Tipsforjesus, or Selby, left a 10,000 tip - over two receipts - which wasn't cleared because of concerns about fraud. According to Schultz, Tips4jesus promised him that the amount was 100 per cent legit and he was good for the amount. He even returned the next day to buy some T-shirts and take the picture that appears on the Instagram account. After the tip cleared Schultz very generously distributed the money amongst the staff who worked that night, in addition to at least one employee who had the night off.

On Sunday, both The Post and the New York Times assembled more than 20 savants and asked them, as the Times put it, \\"How Can Obama Rebound?\\" Good question. Not only do six out of 10 voters \\"lack faith in the president to make the right decisions for the country,\\" according to a Post-ABC News poll, but Barack Obama does not even get credit for the right decisions he's made. The bank bailout averted a financial crackup and the stimulus package pulled the economy back from the abyss. Along with reform of the financial industry and health care, these are considerable achievements. Only the voters disagree. Why? Some of the answers are apparent. The economy remains sluggish and unemployment remains high. The effects of the health-care act have yet to be felt and the ink is hardly dry on financial reform. Until these measures prove popular, they can be mischaracterized by Republicans and other evil-doers. As for the economy, not letting things get worse is not the same as making them better. If you're out of work, it hardly cheers you that the recession stopped at your house and spared the guy next door. It's your job that matters. So what can be done about all this? The experts in the most mainstream of the mainstream media brimmed with ideas. \\"New thinking\\" could save the day, says David Frum, and a revived war on cancer would work wonders, says Elizabeth Edwards. The Democratic strategist Catherine A. \\"Kiki\\" McLean says Obama should focus on \\"jobs, jobs, jobs,\\" while Matthew Dowd, he of ABC News, suggests the president \\"get off the partisan campaign trail.\\" Donna Brazile urges Obama to step up his rhetoric, and Bob Kerrey, the former Nebraska senator, favors \\"a campaign to promote private-sector innovation.\\" Mark Penn proposes doubling the size of the space program. Edward Rollins thinks Obama would do better if he stopped blaming his predecessor for what ails the country, and Robert Shrum opines that \\"Obama needs only to be himself.\\" (What's that?) All these are nifty suggestions, and some could make a really exciting panel discussion at Brookings. But the fallacy in all of them is apparent when -- as always happens -- Obama is likened to Ronald Reagan. (Shrum does this.) The similarities are superficial, and foremost among them is the fact that Reagan too had dismal numbers at this state of his presidency -- a consequence of a steep recession. In fact, the Republicans lost House seats in the 1982 midterm elections, just as the Democrats are fated to do, according to every conceivable political seer. Reagan, of course, went on to win reelection by a landslide and has since become a Mount Rushmorian figure. Break out the chisels. The comparison to Reagan may give Obama cheer, but it is not really apt. For even in Reagan's darkest days when, according to Gallup, six out of 10 Americans reported that they did not like the job he was doing, an astounding six in 10 nevertheless said they liked the man himself. He was, of course, phenomenally charming, authentic and schooled at countless soundstages in appearing that way. Just as important, the public had faith in the consistency of his principles, agree or not. This was the Reagan Paradox and it helped lift his presidency. No one is accusing Obama of being likable. He is not unlikable, but he lacks Reagan's (or Bill Clinton's) warmth. What's more, his career has been brief. He led no movement, was spokesman for no ideology and campaigned like a Nike sneaker -- change instead of swoosh. He seems distant. No Irish jokes from him. For the average voter, he casts no shadow. Reagan, by contrast, had been around forever. He was not defined solely by gauzy campaign ads but by countless speeches, two contentious and highly controversial terms as California governor, and a previous race for the presidency. There was never a question about who Reagan was and what he stood for. Not so Obama. About all he shares with Reagan at this point are low ratings. What has come to be called the Obama Paradox is not a paradox at all. Voters lack faith in him making the right economic decisions because, as far as they're concerned, he hasn't. He went for health-care reform, not jobs. He supported the public option, then he didn't. He's been cold to Israel's Binyamin Netanyahu and then all over him like a cheap suit. Americans know Obama is smart. But we still don't know him. Before Americans can give him credit for what he's done, they have to know who he is. We're waiting. What is a short summary of the above article?","response":"The article discusses the challenges faced by President Barack Obama amidst low voter confidence and unfavorable comparisons to former President Ronald Reagan. Despite Obama's significant achievements such as the bank bailout, stimulus package, financial industry reform, and healthcare reform, the economy remains sluggish, and unemployment is high.

Today I want to take it a step further and focus on how to start clean eating on a budget. It is very similar with just a couple of extra steps. Clean eating focuses on fresh ingredients, no processed foods, and eating good foods as close to nature as possible such as: fruits, vegetables, whole grains, cage-free eggs, grass-fed beef and grain-fed poultry, and raw milk (if possible) to your diet. Some of these may seem like a burden when you are on a small food budget, but with the tips below, you can eat clean and stay within your budget. I am sure you will recognize some from the previous post; but read through there is extra information that applies specifically to clean eating. A major component of clean eating is buying fresh produce rather than canned fruits and vegetables. Frozen produce is OK; but, if in-season fruit is available, it is always better to choose that. Buy in bulk, and freeze it yourself. Use Google to help you search for seasonal produce in your area. When you can buy it from a Farmer’s Market, or even directly from the farmers, it will be less expensive. My next choice is SPOUTS Farmer’s Marker, if there is one near you. Those sources will probably be the least expensive. For example: you may be able to buy strawberries, peaches, and nectarines very inexpensively in the summer and find that squash is a better buy in the fall. Always buy extra when the price is right and freeze the leftovers. When you first start reading about clean eating, you may find “experts” expounding the importance of certain superfoods that you should start eating. The reality is – they are nutritious and excellent additions to your diet; but, you don’t have to eat them just start a clean eating. If you cannot afford to add chia seeds of flax seeds to every smoothie or eat a pomegranate each morning, don’t worry about it. Buy the clean foods you can afford and eat those – you will be doing just fine. What does the narrator probably think of dried foods? A. That you can eat dried food as much as fresh food B. not enough information C. That you shouldn't buy dried food as much as fresh food D. That dried food is awful","response":"C.

In this case, a PA system with 8 monitors would be an ideal setup for medium to large-sized events or venues. Let's take a closer look at the components of such a system and their functions. 1. Mixing Console: The heart of the PA system is the mixing console, which is responsible for controlling the overall sound of the audio signals from various sources, such as microphones, instruments, and other audio devices. This console allows the sound engineer to adjust the levels, equalization, and other audio parameters of each input channel. In some cases, a digital mixer may also be used to provide additional features like built-in effects, compression, and a large number of input channels. 2. Signal Processing: After the mixing console, the audio signals usually pass through signal processors, which can enhance or modify the sound. These processors could include equalizers, compressors, limiters, noise gates, and effects units such as reverb and delay. These devices can be standalone units or built into the mixing console. 3. Amplifiers: Amplifiers are essential components in a PA system. They are responsible for boosting the audio signal to a level that can adequately drive the speakers and monitors. Depending on the setup, amplifiers may be integrated with the speakers/monitors or used as separate units. Using a power distribution system is highly recommended to ensure a proper electrical supply to the amplifiers. 4. Main Speakers: Main speakers are the primary audio source for the audience. Depending on the size of the venue and the coverage requirements, you may need more than one pair of main speakers placed on either side of the stage. These speakers can be passive (requiring an external amplifier) or active (having a built-in amplifier). In some cases, subwoofers may be added to create more low-end sound reinforcement. 5. Stage Monitors: Stage monitors are essential for performers to hear themselves and their fellow musicians clearly during the performance. In this setup, eight monitors can be arranged strategically on stage to provide adequate monitoring for all the performers. These monitors can be connected to a separate monitor mixing console, or the main mixing console may have dedicated auxiliary outputs for sending custom monitor mixes to each stage monitor. Like main speakers, stage monitors can be passive or active. 6. Microphones and Direct Input (DI) Boxes: Microphones are a crucial part of capturing the sound from different sources on stage. Different types of microphones (dynamic, condenser, ribbon) can be used for various purposes, such as vocals, instruments, and drums. Additionally, direct injection (DI) boxes are used to capture the sound from electronic instruments and balance the signal for long cable runs. 7. Cabling and Accessories: To connect all the different components of the PA system, you'll need a variety of cables, such as XLR, TRS, and speaker cables. It's essential to use the right type of cable and length for each connection to ensure optimum sound quality and system performance. Accessories such as microphone stands, speaker poles, and mounting brackets are also essential for a successful live sound setup. In conclusion, a PA system with 8 stage monitors offers a comprehensive audio solution for medium to large-sized events and venues. By understanding the different components involved and their functions, you can configure and set up the sound equipment to deliver an optimal live audio experience for both the audience and the performers."},{"question":"Given the question: Title: Great read!

There are several factors that contribute to this conclusion. Firstly, the title of the review, \\"don't buy this,\\" signals a direct warning for potential buyers. The phrase \\"don't buy\\" implies that the reviewer has had a negative experience with the product and strongly advises others to avoid making the same mistake. Furthermore, the content of the review focuses on the user's dissatisfaction with the product's performance. The user highlights a specific issue with the swing's movement when set to level 5, remarking that it \\"will not move.\\" This complaint suggests that the product does not function as intended or advertised, which is a clear indicator of a negative review. In addition, the reviewer expresses uncertainty about the swing's performance when used with a baby, given that they \\"just tried it\\" without an actual baby.

The tellers knew them by their first names. They were comfortable there. So when a teller suggested that they meet with the bank’s investment brokers, the Toffels made an appointment. After discussions and an evaluation, the bank sold them variable annuities, in which they invested more than 650,000. The annuities promised to generate lifetime income payments. “We wanted to make the most amount of interest we could so if we needed it to live on, we could use it,” said Ms. Toffel, 74, of Lindenhurst, Ill. What she says they didn’t fully understand was that the variable annuities came with a hefty annual charge: about 4 percent of the amount invested. That’s more than 26,000, annually — enough to buy a new Honda sedan every year. What’s more, if they needed to tap the money right away, there would be a 7 percent surrender charge, or more than 45,000. Michael Walsh, a spokesman for U.S. Bank, said that the investments were appropriate for the Toffels, that fees were disclosed and that the sale was completed after months of consultations. But the Toffels now question whether they were given financial advice that was truly in their best interests. Like many consumers, they say they didn’t realize that their broker wasn’t required to follow the most stringent requirement for financial professionals, known as the fiduciary standard. It amounts to this: providing advice that is always 100 percent in the consumer’s interest. Many people think that they are getting that kind of advice when they are not, said Arthur Laby, a professor at the Rutgers School of Law and a former assistant general counsel at the Securities and Exchange Commission. “Brokerage customers are, in a certain sense, deceived,” he said. “If brokers continue to call themselves advisers and advertise advisory services, customers believe they are receiving objective advice that is in their best interest. In many cases, however, they are not.” Brokers, like those at the Toffels’ bank, are technically known as registered representatives. They are required only to recommend “suitable” investments based on an investor’s personal situation — their age, investment goals, time horizon and appetite for risk, among other things. “Suitable” may sound like an adequate standard, but there’s a hitch: It can mean that a broker isn’t required to put a customer’s interests before his own. There are some specific situations when brokers must act as fiduciaries — for example, when they collect a percentage of total assets to manage an investment account, or when they are given full control of an investor’s account. But under current rules, a broker can take off his fiduciary hat and recommend merely “suitable” investments for the same customer’s other buckets of money. Confusing? Absolutely. “While many brokers do right by their clients, others push bad products at high prices,” said Knut A. Rostad, the regulatory and compliance officer at Rembert Pendleton Jackson, an investment adviser, and a longtime champion of requiring a uniform fiduciary standard for brokers. “They do so because their culture celebrates sales. They do so because they can.” IT’S a bewildering situation for consumers, particularly as they try to figure out which advisers do follow a fiduciary standard: Investment advisers, who generally must register with the S.E.C. or a state securities regulator, must put their customers’ interests first, regardless of what accounts they are working with. This creates a muddle for investors. Say you sit down with a broker — one who isn’t legally required to act as a fiduciary — and the broker has access to a dozen mutual funds, all of which are deemed “suitable” for a particular customer. The broker can recommend the most expensive fund, even if it makes him more money at the consumer’s expense and isn’t preferable in any other way, Professor Laby said. On the other hand, if advisers are following a fiduciary standard, the proper course is clear: “They have to recommend the one that is the lowest cost” because that will be in a consumer’s best interest, he added. Regulators have been considering whether stronger rules are needed. The Dodd-Frank financial regulatory law of 2010 gave the S.E.C. the authority to propose a rule that would require brokers to act as fiduciaries — but the law didn’t actually require the S.E.C. to enact new regulations. The agency hasn’t yet decided whether it will move forward. Two Republican commissioners have publicly questioned whether it is necessary. The Labor Department expects to issue a new proposal in January for a rule that would broaden fiduciary requirements for retirement accounts. In 2010, the department withdrew an earlier proposal after fierce opposition from the financial services industry. Investors can’t simply accept an adviser’s title at face value. For example, certified financial planners, a professional designation with some of the more rigorous curriculum and experience requirements, pledge to put their customers’ interests ahead of their own when providing advice — and can lose their designation if they don’t. But even they do not have to act as fiduciaries if they are just selling an investment without including any advice, said Craig W. Lemoine, a program director at the American College of Financial Services in Bryn Mawr, Pa. To make matters worse, many brokers call themselves “advisers,” a term that suggests consumers can unequivocally trust their counsel much as they might trust the family physician’s. Merrill Lynch, for instance, recently introduced an approach called Merrill Lynch Clear — which is essentially a way for the company to set up a conversation with customers about their longer-term goals and priorities, including family or health issues or whether they need long-term care insurance. Merrill advertises this approach on its website as a conversation with a “trusted adviser,” though not all of its “advisers” are legally bound by a fiduciary duty. Matt Card, a Merrill Lynch spokesman, says the firm’s focus on customers’ broad goals is designed to put a client’s interests first, regardless of whether its representatives are acting as fiduciaries. Even if stronger protections are enacted, some advisers at financial firms may face potential conflicts of interest, depending on issues like sales goals or incentives that encourage them to push financial products that aren’t ideal for customers. A former senior account executive at Fidelity, who left last year to join a small independent firm, said he was given sales targets that helped to determine whether he would receive bonuses or retain his job. (He spoke on condition of anonymity, saying he needed to protect colleagues who were still at the company.) “By far, the biggest two weightings were on your ability to sell annuities and portfolio advisory services,” he said, referring to a program in which Fidelity investment accounts are managed for a fee. “So if you hit all the other goals but missed one of these two, there was a good risk that you could be put on verbal or written warning and quite possibly terminated.” Joseph Madden, a Fidelity spokesman, said representatives’ compensation is based on whether their advice was appropriate for the customer, as well as other factors related to sales, service and customer satisfaction. Advisers’ pay can provide clues about whether their interests may be mismatched with consumers’. At the largest brokerage firms — Merrill, Wells Fargo, UBS and Morgan Stanley — there are incentives to bring in new money. These firms typically pay their brokers and advisers 45 to 55 percent of fees and commissions generated for their companies, explained Alois Pirker, research director of wealth management at the Aite Group, which tracks and advises the financial services industry. “They are very much hunters,” he said. “They are hunting for assets.” Some brokers may collect a higher percentage of the money they generate for the firm once they hit certain thresholds. That may reward hard workers, as outlined in a 2013 report from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the brokerage industry’s private self-regulator. But it could also encourage an increase in the number or a shift in the types of recommendations that brokers make to customers. Conflicts can also arise when a brokerage firm receives money from, say, a mutual fund provider through a practice known as revenue sharing: Those funds may land on a “preferred list,” which a broker may favor. It may be less confusing for consumers to simply pay for advice through “fee-only” independent financial planners who are fiduciaries. Independent planners typically charged from 0.85 percent to 1.15 percent of assets at the end of 2013, according to Cerulli Associates, though fees can vary depending on how much you have to invest. (There is always the additional cost of the underlying investments, though they can be quite low.) Often, in addition to investment advice, those fees cover issues like how much to save or how much term life insurance to buy. Other advisers charge a single flat fee or hourly fees. The National Association of Personal Financial Advisors and the Garrett Planning Network are groups of fee-only planners, while a network of advisers, called the XY Planning Network, charges subscription fees, typically around 100 a month. IF consumers really want to put prospective advisers to the test, they could try a direct approach: Ask them to sign an oath stating they will act as fiduciaries, like the one recently created by the Committee for the Fiduciary Standard, an advocacy group. Andrew Stoltmann, a securities lawyer in Chicago, said such an oath would be binding in an arbitration proceeding, which is how a vast majority of customer disputes are settled. “If the adviser refused to sign it, then the investor should run for the hills,” he said. A fiduciary pledge doesn’t protect an investor from outright chicanery, however. Consider the case of the former Seattle investment adviser Mark Spangler, who was sentenced to 16 years in prison for defrauding customers and money laundering. He previously served as a chairman of the National Association of Personal Financial Advisors, a group whose advisers pledge to act as fiduciaries. Barbara Roper, director of investor protection at the Consumer Federation of America, said a fiduciary standard might protect people from brokers who are acting legally but who aren’t recommending the best options for them. “Evidence overwhelmingly suggests that investors suffer real financial harm — albeit unquantifiable harm — as a result of so-called ‘advice’ to invest in products that have high costs, that expose them to unnecessary risks or that simply offer mediocre performance relative to other options,” Ms. Roper said. The Toffels, who bought their investments through their bank’s brokerage unit, now wish they had taken much more care in choosing their advisers. “We thought they could help us invest our money smartly and soundly and that just hasn’t happened,” Ms. Toffel said. When the couple initially went to the bank for investment help, they had a portfolio of low-cost Vanguard funds, with an allocation in the stock market that was probably too high, according to the Toffels’ son-in-law, Christopher Lombardo. But following the bank’s advice, instead of merely adjusting that portfolio, they sold it and paid taxes on the capital gains. They put most of their money in the annuities, which were invested in mutual funds and paid 5 percent each year. But the illiquidity of the annuities caused serious problems last year, Ms. Toffel said. While the couple followed the bank’s suggestion and held more than 200,000 in money market funds, they found that they were short of cash because their life situation had changed: Mr. Toffel, 78, received a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s and needed to move into a skilled nursing facility, while Ms. Toffel wanted to buy an apartment in the same senior community. But much of their money was locked inside those very costly annuities, which carried the 7 percent surrender charge. “I was sick about it,” said Tammy Lombardo, the couple’s daughter. Her husband, Mr. Lombardo, has spent many hours documenting their predicament and petitioning the bank for a hardship withdrawal, which has been successful. They ultimately received some of the money from the annuities without paying the surrender charge, but they are still trying to undo other changes made by the bank to their financial arrangements. “It’s been a mountain of red tape and hoops to jump through,” Mr. Lombardo said. Required to make “suitable” recommendations to investors based on criteria like age, goals, time horizon and risk appetite. Generally not required to put customers’ interest first at all times, a standard called fiduciary duty. Background Check: For information on a specific broker, try the BrokerCheck website, at finra.org/Investors/ToolsCalculators/BrokerCheck/. It covers brokers and firms registered with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or Finra, Wall Street’s self-regulator. But Finra’s system has been criticized because some brokers have had complaints expunged from their records. Required to put customers’ interests ahead of their own — that is, they are required to act as fiduciaries. Advisers and their firms generally register with the Securities and Exchange Commission or a state securities regulator. Background Check: For information on specific advisers, try the Investment Adviser Public Disclosure website, reachable at adviserinfo.sec.gov. It scans S.E.C. data, as well as BrokerCheck and state securities regulators’ sites. Because some people giving financial advice are dually registered as brokers and investment advisers, ask them which hat they are wearing — and whether they are acting as fiduciaries.

The most dominant of these was the Cathedral of Saint Martin, inside the old Roman fortress. The construction of the present Gothic building was begun in 1254 after an earlier romanesque construction had been badly damaged by fire. The choir and transept were finished from 1320 and were followed then by the ambitious Dom tower. The last part to be constructed was the central nave, from 1420. By that time, however, the age of the great cathedrals had come to an end and declining finances prevented the ambitious project from being finished, the construction of the central nave being suspended before the planned flying buttresses could be finished. Besides the cathedral there were four collegiate churches in Utrecht: St. Salvator's Church (demolished in the 16th century), on the Dom square, dating back to the early 8th century. Saint John (Janskerk), originating in 1040; Saint Peter, building started in 1039 and Saint Mary's church building started around 1090 (demolished in the early 19th century, cloister survives).

Will the site work this time? The second year of Obamacare’s open enrollment begins Saturday, and unresolved problems from the first season are complicating the already daunting task of enrolling millions of uninsured and re-enrolling millions more. The lingering challenges involve both flawed technology and public perception of the Affordable Care Act as the Supreme Court prepares to review yet another key provision. The first season actually beat enrollment expectations, despite its disastrous start. More than 7 million people have exchange plans, and about 8.7 million were added to Medicaid. Premium increases for 2015 have generally been modest, though not all states have announced them yet. But the distrust and opposition, as the midterm elections vividly illustrated, still runs deep. Story Continued Below While consumers who click onto HealthCare.gov will see a cleaner, simpler application page, insurers still have headaches. They interact with the website’s so-called back end, which is supposed to tell carriers who signed up and to pay out Obamacare’s subsidies. (From POLITICO Pro: Full health care coverage) That part still doesn’t work as it should. Insurance industry sources say the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) had sorted through about 80 percent to 85 percent of existing accounts to make sure its records match those of insurers. The agency is not likely to be done by Saturday; the latest best-case scenario is for the job to be finished by Dec. 15. The date is key because anyone currently covered who doesn’t either re-enroll or pro-actively opt out will automatically be re-enrolled in the same plan or the closest match for 2015. But with all the gaps in the system, consumers could find themselves in the wrong plan — or even enrolled in more than one plan. Nor will the health plans always know promptly if a customer dropped one plan and chose another (even though the “834s” — those initial enrollment files that nobody had ever heard of until they gummed things up last year — are pretty reliable now). CMS has been using cumbersome workarounds to clear up the records and calculate subsidy payments. But it’s been messy, even without a wave of potentially millions of new enrollees added to the mix. The solution — a computer-facilitated automatic monthly reconciliation and payment process — fell by the wayside with last year’s rollout disaster. Insurers don’t expect it to come online until sometime next year. (Also on POLITICO: Obama: 'The buck stops right here') The administration, for its part, is much better prepared this fall to handle glitches. The tech SWAT team that made the frantic push to salvage the sign-up site last year is in the wings. Some are back at their regular Silicon Valley jobs, ready to swoop back in if they get the call from Washington. Others now work for the government, either toiling away at the new and improved HealthCare.gov or as part of a new White House-based cavalry of coders and software engineers ready to ride to a tech rescue anywhere the government needs them. The website that serves as the primary enrollment portal for the Affordable Care Act was repaired last year, and by the end of the debut sign-up season it was working fairly well for consumers, although the pieces on which the insurance industry relies were incomplete. Health officials working on the site on Sunday previewed for reporters a new “window shopping” feature that people should be able to use this week, to start checking out health plan options before enrollment opens. Officials said they’ve met their deadlines for testing, and should be ready to go next weekend. (Also on POLITICO: Texas is officially clear of Ebola) Another total meltdown is unlikely. But even less serious problems will catapult into the headlines given the first year’s calamity, when a faulty website nearly derailed President Barack Obama’s top domestic achievement. Any missteps this season will be magnified by the GOP. Having a slew of problems from last year only makes the job of the Obama administration, new Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell and supporters in the states more difficult. HHS officials aren’t predicting perfection this year. But they and the many coders who helped in last year’s rescue do say they’ve done more testing this time around, and expect the site to work well. And if trouble comes, they’re better prepared. “I’m cautiously optimistic about the site, but I definitely will be watching the news just like everybody else,” said Jason Huggins, a former Google employee who helped improve HealthCare.gov’s automated testing last fall. He’s been helping implement the retooled site, too — and he says he’d return to the trenches if summoned. (Also on POLITICO: Can D.C. get something done? Fat chance) “For a lot of us, when you hear the president needs your help, how do you say no?” he asked. “If you have a skill set and the country needs you, how do you say no? I expect a lot of people that I worked with would say yes again.” Others who came to join the tech surge — an exhausting, intensive six-week 24/7 operation that went right through Thanksgiving — never left. They’ve moved from the rescue-squad headquarters at the DoubleTree hotel in suburban Columbia, Md., and are installed in downtown Washington offices. Andy Slavitt, who at Optum led the contractors helping to fix the ailing website, is now a top-tier CMS official. A new “CEO” for HealthCare.gov has been brought on, an expert who helped get both Massachusetts and Connecticut’s exchanges up and running. Ryan Panchadsaram, a Presidential Innovation Fellow called in last year, now works in the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy as a deputy CTO. Paul Smith and Greg Gershman, both part of the original SWAT team, founded a private company, Ad Hoc LLC, which has been called in to help with digital projects like HealthCare.gov. ||||| WASHINGTON — The Obama administration said Sunday that consumers could shop for health insurance and compare their options on HealthCare.gov starting Monday, even before the open enrollment period formally begins five days later. Andrew M. Slavitt, the No. 2 official at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said the new website would have more information and would be easier to use than the one that frustrated millions of consumers last fall. Consumers would be able to sort plans not only by the amount of the premium, but also by the size of the deductible, Mr. Slavitt said. In addition, he said, consumers would be able to see all health plans that have special programs to manage certain conditions like asthma, heart disease, depression, diabetes, lower back pain, high blood pressure and high cholesterol. The announcement came as the Obama administration ramped up preparations for the second open enrollment period under the Affordable Care Act. People would be able to see prices and other the details of health plans on Monday, but would not be able to buy insurance until the open enrollment period starts on Saturday. To see plans Monday after the new feature is live: https://www.healthcare.gov/see-plans/ By contrast, consumers last year could not see details of the available health plans until the first open enrollment period began on Oct. 1. Even then, consumers could not engage in anonymous “window shopping.” They had to create accounts, providing personal information in response to numerous questions, a restriction lifted by early December. About 7.3 million people have insurance coverage purchased through the federal and state insurance exchanges, or marketplaces. If people did nothing, they would, in most cases, be automatically re-enrolled in the same or similar health plans. However, Kevin J. Counihan, the chief executive of the federal marketplace, said Sunday: “We are strongly encouraging our customers to return to HealthCare.gov, update their income and eligibility information, shop and compare and see if there are better values out there for them. A majority of our customers will be able to save money by shopping and comparing.” In June, the Obama administration emphasized the benefits of passive re-enrollment. “At least 95 percent of consumers in the marketplace will not have to do anything to renew plans and their financial assistance,” the administration had said. Mr. Counihan predicted on Sunday that 15 percent to 25 percent of applications for insurance would be submitted by people using smartphones or tablet computers, and the website was able to handle such applications, he said. In addition, the government said it had 14,000 customer service representatives, an increase of 1,000, to answer questions and help people who call the health insurance marketplace for assistance, at 1-800-318-2596. Administration officials and insurance counselors said the second open enrollment period could be more difficult than the first for several reasons. It will, for example, be only half as long: three months, rather than six. Officials said they believed that people who remained uninsured would be more difficult to reach, since they passed up an opportunity to buy insurance in the first enrollment period. The most common reason people gave for not signing up was that they thought they could not afford health insurance. Low- and moderate-income people can often get federal subsidies to help defray the cost, but officials said they could not guarantee that the money would be available if the Supreme Court blocked payment of subsidies. The Supreme Court agreed on Friday to hear a new challenge to the Affordable Care Act that questions the government’s authority to pay subsidies in three dozen states that use the federal exchange. If the plaintiffs are right, people in those states could become ineligible for assistance, destabilizing and perhaps dooming the law. For now, at least, “nothing has changed,” Josh Earnest, President Obama’s press secretary, said on Friday. “Tax credits and affordable coverage remain available.” Asked Sunday if the lawsuit might have a negative effect on public willingness to sign up, Mr. Slavitt said, “We believe consumers should be very confident in the subsidies being offered.” Democrats said it was troubling that the court would even consider the legal question. They said Congress intended for the subsidies to be available in every state, regardless of whether its exchange was established by the federal government or by the state itself. More than four million people have been receiving the subsidies. For people who obtained insurance through the exchanges this year, subsidies reduced the average premium by more than 75 percent — to 82 a month, from 346. By entering information about their income and family size at HealthCare.gov, consumers can get an estimate of how much financial assistance they would receive for a particular health plan. In addition, smokers can see the amount of any surcharge imposed for tobacco use. The administration has tried to lower expectations for the second sign-up period, refusing to set a numerical goal for enrollment and acknowledging, as Mr. Slavitt said, that “things will not be perfect.” Consumers have frequently complained that HealthCare.gov had inaccurate information about doctors in the networks of their health insurance plans. Mr. Counihan said the federal website included links to “provider directories” on insurance company websites. But he said, “These directories are almost out of date as soon as they are printed,” so consumers should call doctors’ offices to see if they are taking new patients from a particular health plan. ||||| HealthCare.gov is a federal government website managed by the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Service. It was redesigned and simplified for 2015. (Photo: AP) The federal health insurance exchange went live Sunday night for window shopping — a couple days later than some expected — as government officials worked to refine both their technology and their message to one encouraging people to re-enroll to save money when they start buying plans Nov. 15. The Department of Health and Human Services is trying to prevent a repeat of last year's disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov, an experience that many newly insured consumers may want to avoid going through again. HHS principal deputy administrator Andy Slavitt said the window shopping \\"functionality has been ready for a while ... (but) obviously we've been continuing to test it.\\" The launch comes two days after the Supreme Court announced it would reconsider a lower court ruling that upheld the Affordable Care Act's system of subsidizing the insurance coverage it requires. Slavitt said Sunday that the administration isn't worried. \\"We believe consumers are very confident in the subsidies being offered,\\" he said on a call with reporters. \\"We encourage everybody to see what's available on the website.\\" Insurers and agents were expecting the site to open so consumers could browse plans Friday, but Slavitt said the department wanted people to be able to access the site Monday morning \\"when they're starting to think about the marketplace.\\" And although \\"things will not be perfect,\\" shopping around will be \\"simpler faster and more intuitive\\" this year, said Kevin Counihan, CEO of HealthCare.gov. After announcing in June how easy it would be for consumers to auto-enroll in their existing plans, HHS has changed its message to emphasize the importance of re-enrollment to get the best deal and to update subsidies. Despite any potential glitches remaining, experts in and outside the government say both uninsured and newly insured people need to compare their current plans with new offerings, as many will be able to find better rates and plan features. \\"There are a lot of changes that are price declines,\\" said Katherine Hempstead, director of insurance coverage at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. \\"But there are going to be a lot of incentives to shop around and people need to look at the whole plan design.\\" For some, a small premium change may be less important than the out-of-pocket costs a plan requires for specialist visits, Hempstead said. So it's important to consider what kind of health care services you and your family are likely to need before choosing a plan, she said. HealthCare.gov runs the exchanges for 37 states. Idaho and California, which run their own sites, have already opened them for window shopping and several have made their rates available, if not individual plan details. A new Urban Institute/Robert Wood Johnson analysis of plans in 17 states plus the District of Columbia found six states will have average premium reductions across insurers' lowest cost silver plans, 10 will have premium increases of 5% or less and two will have increases greater than 5%. Exchange plans are grouped by metal categories ranging from platinum, which tend to have the highest premiums and lowest cost-sharing, to bronze, which have the lowest premiums and highest out-of-pocket costs. This year, consumers will also be able to search by insurance company, health conditions and types of plans, such as PPOs. A Kaiser Family Foundation analysis also found rate changes in 16 states it studied ranged from increases of as much as 8.7% to declines of as much as 15.6%. Kaiser looks at the second-lowest cost silver plan in each state because it's the benchmark that helps determine how much federal assistance eligible individuals can get in subsidies. Overall, the analysis found individuals will pay slightly less to enroll in these plans in 2015 than they did in 2014, before tax credits are applied. The majority of people would save money on premiums if they came back and shopped for a plan in the same metal level, Slavitt said. Despite all the evidence supporting re-enrollment, a study from consulting firm Strategy& found many people will simply keep their current plans. Almost three quarters were highly likely to stick with the same insurer in 2015 and 57% of those who bought on a public exchange say they're more than likely to stay with the same plan, the study showed. When it comes to shopping around, \\"there's a certain threshold which triggers that behavior,\\" said Ashish Kaura, a partner in Strategy&'s health practice. \\"Unless existing rates go up more than 7%-8%, people won't look and try to find a better deal.\\" Those who receive subsidies toward their plans have potentially even bigger reasons to re-enroll, said Mike Stahl, a senior vice president at the health insurance website HealthMarkets. About 80% of people checked a box on their insurance application last year saying the federal government can access their tax information. If those people don't re-enroll and their income changes, they could be sacrificing additional assistance or have to pay back money they shouldn't have gotten at tax time next year, he said. The benchmark plans that subsidies are tied to go up every year as the federal poverty limits are increased. So Stahl said people who face a premium increase and don't re-enroll might be forced to absorb the increase without additional federal help — until they get their tax refund the following year. If the 20% who didn't allow access to their tax information don't re-enroll, they'll automatically get the same plan as last year — but no subsidy at all, said Stahl.

Article:","response":"Title: \\"Train Driver Pleads Guilty to Drink-Driving Charges Following Alert from Manchester Station Staff Member\\" Introduction: A train driver from Manchester was charged with drink-driving, following concerns from a railway station staff member who noticed her slurred speech. Felicity Hall, 46, pleaded guilty in court, bringing to light the importance of vigilance when it comes to the safety of passengers and fellow staff members in the railway industry. Main Body: Felicity Hall, a 46-year-old train driver from Horwich, Manchester, admitted to charges of drink-driving after an incident at Manchester Piccadilly railway station. The case came to light when a staff member observed Hall slurring her words before she was scheduled to drive passengers. The concerned staff member took swift action, raising the alarm with management. Upon receiving reports of Felicity's condition, the railway officials promptly removed Hall from her duties. Following an investigation, which involved assessing her blood alcohol content, it was confirmed that the train driver was indeed above the legal limit to operate a vehicle. Consequently, she was charged with drink-driving. Felicity Hall quickly entered a guilty plea in court, sparing the prosecution from having to present their case and saving time for all parties involved. While the sentence is yet to be determined, the charge of drink-driving holds severe consequences. This case serves as a stark reminder to railway professionals of the perils of operating any motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or other substances. The staff member at Manchester Piccadilly station played a crucial role in preventing a potentially hazardous situation. Had they not been diligent and observant, Felicity Hall would have been operating a train carrying numerous passengers while being impaired by alcohol, increasing the risk of accidents or negligence-related incidents. Conclusion: This unfortunate incident has highlighted the importance of constant vigilance when it comes to passenger and staff safety within the railway industry. The swift action of the staff member at Manchester Piccadilly railway station showcases how individuals can work together to create a more secure travel environment, ensuring public transport remains a safe and reliable means of getting around.

Her position resonates with a growing trend of Euroscepticism among the French populace, impacted by years of sluggish economic growth and high unemployment rates, attributing them to the constraints imposed by the Eurozone policies. Le Pen famously stands for France breaking away from the EU, criticizing it for its alleged governing bureaucracy and lack of respect for national sovereignty. She holds the Euro guilty of weakening the French economy and forcing the country into economic patterns that do not cater for their interests. Her proposal to restore the Franc, France's currency prior to the adoption of the Euro, is seen as part of a wider strategy to gain political sovereignty and economic independence. Her controversial comments have stirred debates in the political and economic spheres, sparking an array of opinions. Supporters of her standpoint argue that transitioning back to the Franc would give France control over its own monetary policy, enabling them to devalue their currency to boost exports, something Eurozone rules currently prevent. Meanwhile, critics argue that such a move risks isolation, economic instability and legal complexities. They warn that reintroducing an old currency could plunge the country into a financial crisis by causing capital flight, creating market uncertainties and damaging investor confidence. Furthermore, skeptics challenge Le Pen's labelling of the Euro as \\"the currency of occupation.\\" They contend that the Euro, as a symbol and tool of European unity, reflects cooperation and shared decision-making among 19 different European nations to achieve common economic and political goals. The debate over the usefulness and viability of the Euro, particularly in its most distressed economies, continues to rage on, as evidenced by Le Pen's provocative comment. As France remains divided over its relationship with the EU and the Euro, it will be intriguing to see how political leaders navigate the complex and sensitive issue of national currency and sovereignty in the future."},{"question":"Vor allem abends wird unser Badeteich zum Geheimtipp für Romantiker, wenn sich das Licht zahlreicher Kerzen sanft im Teichwasser spiegelt und ein Ambiente vollkommener Behaglichkeit schafft.

Souvenirs and clothing featuring Putin... (Associated Press) MOSCOW (AP) — Russian President Vladimir Putin is celebrating his 62nd birthday in the wilderness of Siberia as supporters from across Russia create tributes in his honor. Putin celebrated his birthday Tuesday in the Siberian forest some \\"300-400 kilometers (185-250 miles) from the nearest populated area,\\" his press secretary told Russian news media. Putin has often brandished his tough-guy image with widely publicized wilderness romps during which he hunts, fishes or rides horses — often while shirtless. In Grozny, the capital of Chechnya, thousands carried a 600-meter-long (650 yards) Russian flag through the streets. Others dressed in the red, white and blue of the Russian tricolor walked through the streets as an enormous human flag, many of them holding portraits of the Russian leader over their heads. Ramzan Kadyrov, Chechnya's president, wrote on his official Instagram account that there were 100,000 participants. Russian news websites published photographs from a one-day exhibition in Moscow titled \\"The 12 Labors of Vladimir Putin,\\" in which Putin is depicted as Hercules — battling Western nations disguised as serpents and monsters or taming an ox bearing the symbol of Crimea, the Ukrainian region annexed by Russia in March. Putin's always-high ratings have skyrocketed this year as he responded to a pro-European uprising in Ukraine by seizing Crimea, and reacted defiantly to Western sanctions. His approval rating remains at 86 percent according to the independent Levada Center, which conducted a poll in September with a margin of error of plus or minus 3.4 percent. Souvenirs decorated with Putin's face have become best-sellers on Red Square, while Russian designers have made him the theme of pricey T-shirts and sweaters. Patriarch Kirill, head of the Russian Orthodox Church, congratulated Putin on his birthday and said his tenure in office had become \\"an integral part of national history.\\" However, as the value of the ruble sinks under pressure from sanctions, some online commentators were less enthusiastic: \\"The dollar is 40 (rubles), the Euro is 50 (rubles), and Putin is 62,\\" was one joke that spread across the web. ___ Musa Sadulayev in Grozny, Chechnya contributed reporting. ||||| Photo: Vasily Maximov/AFP/Getty Images For his birthday, President Obama only got a photo essay of the past year’s events posted to the White House website. Russian president Vladimir Putin, on the other hand, got a whole exhibition comparing him to the Greek mythical hero Heracles (known further west as Hercules). No joke — it’s called “The 12 Labors of Putin.” The exhibit was held on Monday by members of a pro-Putin Facebook group in Moscow’s “Red October” showspace, formerly the site of a chocolate factory by the same name. Putin turns 62 on Tuesday. “Interestingly, the events of the ancient legends about the mythological hero Hercules can be relayed onto our days, when the three-headed dog Cerberus reminds us of the USA, annihilation of the Stymphalian Birds — of stopping the air raids in Syria and the cleaning of the Augean stables is fighting corruption,” the organizers wrote on Facebook, apparently in earnest. The organizer at the event itself appeared to be a young, bearded man named Mikhail Antonov, whose T-shirt was almost obscured by his blazer. Almost, but not quite — it appeared to read “Vladimir Putin” and have a thumbs-up sign underneath. куратор выставки о подвигах Путина pic.twitter.com/uzoQT4pfgk — Feldman (@EvgenyFeldman) October 6, 2014 He said that members of the Facebook group often sent in artwork depicting the president, and they decided to do a thematic show for the leader’s birthday.

The industrial average was first calculated on May 26, 1896. Currently owned by S&P Dow Jones Indices, which is majority owned by S&P Global, it is the most notable of the Dow Averages, of which the first (non-industrial) was first published on February 16, 1885. The averages are named after Dow and one of his business associates, statistician Edward Jones. It is an index that shows how 30 large publicly owned companies based in the United States have traded during a standard trading session in the stock market. It is the second-oldest U.S. market index after the Dow Jones Transportation Average, which was also created by Dow. The \\"Industrial\\" portion of the name is largely historical, as many of the modern 30 components have little or nothing to do with traditional heavy industry. The average is price-weighted, and to compensate for the effects of stock splits and other adjustments, it is currently a scaled average. The value of the Dow is not the actual average of the prices of its component stocks, but rather the sum of the component prices divided by a divisor, which changes whenever one of the component stocks has a stock split or stock dividend, so as to generate a consistent value for the index. Since the divisor is currently less than one, the value of the index is larger than the sum of the component prices.

Problem:Passage: Despite William Bruce's fall from political favour, and his intermittent imprisonment, he continued to practice. During the 1690s he completed Hill of Tarvit (1696), Craighall (1697–99) in Fife, and Craigiehall (1699) near Edinburgh. The latter, built for the Marquess of Annandale, still stands, and is used as the British Army's Scottish headquarters. From 1698 he was working on a new house for the young Charles Hope, later first Earl of Hopetoun. Hopetoun House, near Edinburgh, was completed in 1702, and represents Bruce's grandest country house design. The master mason was again Thomas Bauchop, and the inspiration was again Anglo-Dutch, with French rustication. The bulk of Bruce's work is now obscured by 18th-century remodelling, carried out by William Adam. Bruce was commissioned again by Hopetoun in 1708, to build a private aisle at Abercorn Kirk. The Hopetoun Loft overlooks the interior of the kirk, and connects to a retiring room with an oval \\"squint\\" giving a view of the pulpit.In 1702 Bruce was commissioned by the burgesses of Stirling to design a new tolbooth for the town. Bruce provided only sketch plans, which were executed by local masons between 1703 and 1705. Bruce's last country houses were Harden House (now known as Mertoun House), built for the Scotts in the Borders, and his smallest house, Auchendinny in Midlothian. His final work, in around 1710, was for Nairne House, for the Jacobite Lord Nairne. The house was not completed until two years after Bruce's death, and the extent of his involvement is unclear. Nairne House was demolished in 1760, although the cupola was retained and installed on the roof of the King James VI Hospital in nearby Perth. Solution:","response":"1.

Implicit rationale: When observing women with painted faces, one may notice that some are dressed as geishas while others are not. This suggests that there is a variety of reasons for a woman to have a painted face, such as attending a costume party, participating in a cultural event, or simply for artistic self-expression. Corresponding answer: It is not possible to tell if a woman is dressed as a geisha solely based on her painted face, as there are multiple reasons why a woman may have a painted face other than impersonating a geisha. One must consider additional factors, such as clothing, hair accessories, and overall appearance in order to make an accurate determination."},{"question":"german pharmaceutical company schering reported strong first quarter growth friday of its flagship oral contraceptive yasmin .

It was installed outside the band's rehearsal rooms in South Yorkshire. The plaque was one of 47 commemorating people or places that have influenced musical culture. Live updates and more stories from Yorkshire Brassed Off, which starred the late British acting legend Pete Postlethwaite, featured the fictional town of Grimley and was partly based on the closure of Grimethorpe's pit in 1993.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there is no coal available happens, how will it affect MORE power produced by the steam engine. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","response":"Step 1: Identify the original source of energy in the process - In this case, coal is the energy source for heating the boiler. Step 2: Consider the perturbation - No coal is available. Step 3: Analyze the consequences of the perturbation on the process - Since there is no coal to heat the boiler, the boiler cannot generate heat. Step 4: Evaluate the effect of this consequence on the rest of the process: - The water tank over the boiler will not be heated, so no steam will be produced. - The steam cannot be funneled to the piston since it is not being generated. - The piston will not receive any energy from the steam, so it will not move. - The crankshaft will not receive any motion from the piston and thus will not move. Step 5: Conclusion of the direct or indirect effect of the perturbation - The absence of coal in the process has a direct effect on the power produced by the steam engine. Without coal, no energy can be provided to heat the boiler, leading to a chain reaction affecting all other components in the system. This ultimately results in the steam engine not producing any power."},{"question":"This article: Following the accession of James VII in 1685, Bruce gradually fell from favour, and was distrusted by the new regime. After the Revolution of 1688, and the accession of William of Orange as King, he was once again at odds with his Protestant rulers, and he refused to take up his seat in Parliament. As a staunch Episcopalian, Bruce was considered a potential Jacobite threat. In 1693 he was briefly imprisoned in Stirling Castle for refusing to appear before the Privy Council. He was incarcerated again at Stirling in 1694, and from 1696 in Edinburgh Castle. Bruce was expelled from parliament in 1702, his seat passing to his son John Bruce. Despite these imprisonments, he continued his architectural work, indeed the 1690s and 1700s were his most prolific years. Bruce was imprisoned at Edinburgh Castle again in 1708 and was only released a short time before his death, at the beginning of 1710.He was buried in the family mausoleum at Kinross Kirk. The ruins of the church still stand beside Kinross House, the mausoleum remains intact in the churchyard. Dating from 1675 it is probably by William Bruce in design, initially to house his parents. Bruce's surviving account books show purchases of books on music, painting and horticulture, as well as numerous foreign-language works, suggesting that William Bruce was a learned man. He studied horticulture extensively, and applied his knowledge of the subject in his own gardens at Kinross. He was a friend of James Sutherland of the Edinburgh Botanic Garden, and may have known John Evelyn and other English horticulturalists. contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person that was once again at odds with his Protestant rulers?, what is it ?

Given these facts, what can be a source of food for many species of fish among the following options: - Fully cooking the oysters - Organic compounds - beef - fishing poles - sessile organisms - barnacles - grass - gastropod shells Answer:","response":"To answer the question, let's evaluate the given options step-by-step and relate them to the facts provided. 1. Fully cooking the oysters: This option is irrelevant as the question is about a natural food source, not a prepared dish. 2. Organic compounds: While organic compounds are essential for life, the question is more specific about a particular type of food source. 3. Beef: Beef is not a natural food source for most species of fish. 4. Fishing poles: This option is an inanimate object and not a food source. 5. Sessile organisms: The fact is given that most sponges are sessile and they are a source of food for many species of fish. This option is relevant and directly connected to the facts. 6. Barnacles: Barnacles are sessile organisms, so they could potentially be a food source for some fish species. However, the question is focused on sponges. 7. Grass: Grass is not a common food source for many species of fish, especially if they eat sponges. 8. Gastropod shells: This option indicates the shells, not the gastropods themselves, which makes it irrelevant as a food source. Justifying my steps, I conclude that the best answer is \\"sessile organisms.\\" This is because most sponges are sessile, and sponges are a source of food for many species of fish, as stated in the facts provided."},{"question":"Given a sentence in Russian, generate a new Russian sentence by performing small changes on the sentence.

Area officials told CBC News the wind pushed built-up ice off Dauphin Lake on Friday evening and caused it to pile up in the community, located on the lake's southern shore. The piles of ice, which were more than nine metres tall in some cases, destroyed at least six homes and cottages, according to the Rural Municipality of Ochre River. Another 14 homes suffered extensive damage, with some structures knocked off their foundations. Clayton Watts, Ochre River's deputy reeve, said it's a miracle no one was hurt. He told CBC News one minute people were watching hockey in their living rooms, the next they heard something that sounded like a freight train near their homes. \\"It happened so quick,\\" said Watts. \\"And you can't predict it — not like water that slowly comes up.\\" Watts said there are several cabins that were completely flattened by the wall of ice that came at them. \\"The ice is over top of them, they've been crushed, there's nothing left,\\" he said. \\"There are other cabins that have been knocked right off their footings,\\" he continued. \\"There's ice right over top of some of the cabins, coming over the roof on the other side.\\" According to Environment Canada winds were registered at about 80 km/h in the area Friday night. No insurance coverage for ice damage Dennis Stykalo, whose cottage is full of ice after Friday night's wind storm, told CBC News his insurance does not cover damage done by ice. He said he's devastated after the event — he can't even get inside to recover his valuables. \\"You know you've got cement, concrete blocks, and steel and the ice goes through it like its just a toothpick,\\" said Stykalo. \\"It just shows the power. There is nothing you can do, you just get out of the way and just watch.\\" CBC News also contacted an insurance company in Winnipeg who said generally coverage is not provided for damage to homes caused by shoreline ice build up or water-borne ice. Same area hit by flood in 2011 The damage is even more traumatic for some, he added, as many of the homes in the area were ruined by flooding in 2011. Dozens of properties in Ochre Beach and Dauphin Beach were evacuated due to extremely high lake levels that spring. \\"They're devastated. Most of these people were hit pretty hard during the flood,\\" said Watts. \\"Most of them were just back to the stage where they were back living in their homes again. And now this has happened. So they're pretty devastated right now.\\" Ochre Beach is about 300 kilometres northwest of Winnipeg and 20 kilometres east of Dauphin. ||||| Hey there, time traveller!

Then the volunteers cometh. 730 CKDM 730 CKDM 730 CKDM Ice from Dauphin Lake smashed into this home at Ochre Beach Friday. About 23 homes were destroyed and 27 affected. No injuries were reported. Hundreds of local residents arrived by the dozens on Saturday with backhoes and bulldozers and wheelbarrows — helping to chip away massive ice floes that on Friday night destroyed 12 homes and damaged another 15 along Ochre Beach, located 20 kilometres east of Dauphin. \\"Today was just a work day,\\" RM of Ochre River deputy reeve Clayton Watts told the Free Press Saturday night. \\"They got a lot done. They had an unbelievable amount of people working out there; all kinds of friends and people from around other beaches.\\" Or total strangers. \\"Everybody was pitching in to help them (residents) make it through the day,\\" Watts said. \\"It was a good community effort. It’s typical. Everybody just helps out.\\" According to provincial Emergency Measures Organization officials, a total of seven permanent homes were literally crushed by the ice that rose up within minutes from Lake Dauphin around supper time on Friday, pushed by north winds gusting up to 60 kilometres per hour. Doug Davis had just taken a shower and was about to sit down on his couch and relax at his home along Ochre Beach on Friday night. Then he heard the ice coming. \\"All of a sudden,\\" said Davis’s wife, Elaine, \\"that was it.\\" Within the next five minutes, a wall of ice rose from the lake so powerful that it plowed though the Davis’s two-storey home, pushing furniture from one bedroom into another. It pushed the bathroom tub and vanity into the hallway. The Davis family wasn’t alone. In all, 27 homes and cottages were damaged or destroyed – although no injuries were reported. A local state of emergency was declared in the municipality, and residents along the beach were evacuated on Friday night. The provincial Emergency Social Services were called to the scene Friday night to assist residents in finding temporary lodging. Structural experts from the Office of the Fire Commissioner were also on hand to determine whether some residents could be allowed to attempt clean up or collect belongings. On Saturday, the residents and volunteers were allowed to return to the area and begin digging the ice on homes that were declared structurally stable. All for a natural event that was over in just 15 minutes. \\"They (homeowners) heard it before they saw it (the ice) coming up their decks,\\" Watts said. \\"Then it came right in their front windows. It was just a matter of minutes. Fortunately, no one was hurt. We were very lucky.\\" On Saturday morning, Watts was standing on an adjacent beach, looking over the damage. \\"The ice is up taller than the cottages and homes,\\" he said. \\"It kind of dwarfs them.\\" \\"This is nothing you can predict,\\" Watts said. \\"Water, you can see it coming up. There’s nothing you can do to prevent this. Sometimes, it’s just the luck of the way the wind is blowing. You can just hope for the best, and the best was no one got hurt.\\" However, Watts said many of the cottagers and home owners affected by the ice wave were also just recovering from severe flooding in 2011. In fact, a few of the homes were newly constructed. \\"That’s what’s so devastating,\\" he said. \\"These people have rebuilt their homes and got their lives back together. Now they have to start over again.\\" In fact, the Davis’s were just in the process of seeking out contractors to rebuild the foundation of their home, due to lingering flood damage. Instead, on Saturday morning, Elaine was surveying an entirely different dilemma. \\"We’re looking at a front room filled ice and we’re trying to shovel it out,\\" she said. \\"There are huge chunks. It breaks my heart to see our house....everybody’s houses. The feeling is indescribable. She’s gone. \\"But you salvage what you can. There’s not much a person can do. You just have to take a deep breath and do what you have to do.\\" Davis was even more concerned about weather reports on Saturday that high winds were being predicted this weekend. \\"Mother nature’s not done with us yet,\\" she said. \\"You never know.\\" However, on Saturday night, the winds had begun to die down, Watts said. randy.turner@freepress.mb.ca ||||| Write a summary.","response":"A local state of emergency was declared in Ochre Beach, a western Manitoba municipality, after homes were destroyed and seriously damaged by a wave of lake ice.

Article: A few years ago, pop poets such as Murray Lachlan Young began to set poetry to rock music with some surprising results. People thought that poetry was the new rock 'n' roll. However, despite the brief popularity of a few pop poets, poetry and pop music didn't seem to mix. But are they really so different? If you look back at the origins of poetry, there is a strong connection between poems and popular music. In Greek mythology, for example, the muse Erato is pictured with a lyre in her hand, and looks just like the ancestor of the modern rock star with his electric guitar. In addition, the poets Shelley and Byron were as famous in the nineteenth century as the pop stars of today. But despite their common origins, there are many differences between poetry and pop music. Pop songs are always written for a public performance, whereas poetry often isn't. And the lyrics in pop songs sometimes have less rhythm than those in poetry. This is because the music provides the rhythm rather than the words. Pop lyrics are also simpler and often keep on saying the same thing. This repetition works well in a performance and means that pop songs are easier for people to sing and learn by heart. Both songs and poems tell a story or talk about feelings. Songs in particular deal with the different stages in a relationship, such as falling in love or breaking up. The words and ideas in songs are usually easier to understand than those in \\"serious\\" poetry. However, talented performers like Paul McCartney, or newer stars like Robbe Williams, often give simple songs more expression when they perform them. And some of the best lines from pop lyrics are as beautiful as poetry. So although pop music and poetry have many differences, they do have one important thing in common: the power to make us think about how we feel. Question: According to the article, the difference between poetry and pop songs is that _ . - there is more rhythm in pop songs than poetry - pop songs are more difficult to understand than poetry - some words in pop songs are repeated over and over again - pop songs are not always performed before audience","response":"According to the article, the difference between poetry and pop songs is that some words in pop songs are repeated over and over again."},{"question":"Video: Boys rescued from 75-foot cliff in Marin Rescuers plucked two boys wearing only swim trunks from a 75-foot cliff in the Rodeo Beach area of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area Friday, and the whole thing was caught on video.

Article: Is it possible to persuade mankind to live without war? War is an ancient custom which has existed for at least six thousand years. It was always evil and usually foolish, but in the past the human race managed to live with it. Modern skill has changed this. Either man will stop war, or war will stop man. For the present, it is nuclear weapons that cause the greatest danger, but bacteriological( ) or chemical weapons may, before long, offer an even greater threat. If we succeeded in stopping war, there would be no danger for us. To do this, we need to persuade mankind to look upon international questions in a new way, not by contests of force, in which the victory goes to the side which is most skillful in massacre ( ),but by judging in accordance with agreed rules of law. It is not easy to change old mental habits, but this is what must be attempted. There are those who say that the adoption of this or that ideology would prevent war. I believe this to be a complete error. All ideologies are based upon beliefs without proof which are, at best, doubtful, and at worst, totally false. Those people who believe them are willing to go to war in support of them. The movement of world opinion during the past two years has changed very largely such as we can welcome. It has become a common belief that nuclear war must be avoided. Of course, very difficult problems remain in the international world, but the spirit in which they are being approached is a better one than it was some years ago.

The cause of death was not immediately clear, but for years Shenouda had suffered from back and liver problems, and health issues forced him to cancel his weekly sermon on Wednesday. Named pope in 1971, Shenouda led the Coptic Orthodox Church through 40 years of quiet expansion, including a strong growth in North America, but came under criticism in his native Egypt during the later years of his papacy. Most of the church's more than 10 million members are in Egypt, where Copts are believed to make up around 10 per cent of the population. For most Egyptian Copts, Shenouda was the only spiritual leader they have ever known, a beloved figure who nonetheless became controversial for rarely opposing a government that was often accused of promoting Muslims' rights over those of Copts. Naguib Sawiris, a liberal Coptic Christian political leader and billionaire telecommunications tycoon, wrote on Twitter that Shenouda had been \\"an icon of wisdom, intellect and knowledge, a man of courage and honour\\". Exile and return Shenouda, who worked as a journalist before spending years as a monk and being elected pope, entered his tenure with a political agenda, set on reforming the church from within, Al Jazeera's Sherine Tadros reported from Cairo. In the 1980s, Shenouda spent more than three years in exile in a desert monastery after former president Anwar Sadat stripped him of his powers by decree. At the time, Shenouda had been pressing for more rights for the Coptic community and trying to preserve his congregation from escalating attacks by Muslim extremists. Former president Hosni Mubarak canceled Sadat's decree in 1985, and Shenouda returned to lead Christmas Mass before a crowd of thousands in Cairo's St Mark's Cathedral. After returning, Shenouda oversaw the growth of the church in the United States and South America. He emphasised Christian unity and dialogue between churches throughout the world. 'Beloved children' In recent years, some Egyptian Copts had begun to express criticism of Shenouda for not speaking out on Coptic rights, particularly as sectarian violence seemed to increase. \\"It was really after the former president Hosni Mubarak then took power that you saw a more cordial relationship ... and at that point people began to criticize the pope,\\" Tadros said. Although Shenouda gave limited praise to Egypt's revolution, he often encouraged protesters to go home, both before and after Mubarak's fall, and he pleaded for stability. The later part of his papacy was marked by co-operation with Mubarak and, after the revolt, the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces. When sectarian clashes began to erupt after Mubarak's removal, including church burnings throughout the country, Shenouda praised the military leadership for helping to rebuild. But in October, when soldiers brutally dispersed a Coptic protest outside state media headquarters, leaving at least 26 people dead, Shenouda declared that those killed were martyrs and blamed the military for the violence. \\"These martyrs are our beloved children and their blood does not come cheap,\\" he said. \\"I, along with all the bishops, priests and monks, will pray for them. And we know that God will forgive their sins.\\" ||||| Image caption Pope Shenouda III led Egypt's Coptic Christian church for more than three decades Egypt's Coptic Christian Pope Shenouda III has died at the age of 88, state television has announced. The leader of the Middle East's largest Christian minority was reported to suffer from cancer that had spread to several organs. Coptic Christians make up 10% of Egypt's population of 80 million. After attacks on Coptic Christians in recent years, Pope Shenouda urged officials to do more to address the community's concerns. Pope Shenouda led the church, one of the oldest Christian communities in the world, for four decades. His political adviser Hany Aziz told Reuters news agency that Shenouda \\"died from complications in health and from old age\\". He had returned recently to Egypt after seeking treatment abroad. Pope Shenouda was born Nazeer Gayed into a devout Christian family on 3 August 1923 in Asyut, Upper Egypt, and became a monk in 1954, taking the name Shenouda. After Pope Cyril died in 1971, Shenouda was enthroned as Pope of Alexandria. He fell out with President Anwar Sadat, who in 1981 sent him into internal exile. He was allowed back to Cairo by President Hosni Mubarak four years later. The BBC's Jon Leyne in Cairo says Pope Shenouda sought to protect his Christian community amid a Muslim population by striking a conservative tone and lending tacit support to President Mubarak's rule. Whoever succeeds him now faces the task of reassuring the Coptic community as the Islamists of the Muslim Brotherhood look on the verge of sharing power in Egypt for the first time, our correspondent says. Many younger Copts will now be looking for a leader who can help redefine their community's role in a rapidly changing post-Mubarak Egypt, our correspondent adds. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","response":"Egypt's Coptic Pope Shenouda III, who was the leader of the Middle East's largest Christian minority, has passed away at 88 years old.

Even though many people loved him, some criticized him for not fighting enough for the rights of Coptic Christians in Egypt.

Over the past few years, there has been a notable increase in the number of people transitioning to a vegan lifestyle. This change is driven by various factors such as increased awareness of the health benefits associated with a plant-based diet, concerns related to environmental sustainability, and the ethical implications of consuming animal-based products. The meat industry, which has long dominated the food market, is now being challenged by the rapid rise of veganism. Market researchers and experts have been analyzing the trend in order to understand the reasons for this shift in dietary choices and to determine its long-term effects on society, the economy, and the environment. Hypothesis: The increasing popularity of veganism will lead to a significant decrease in the demand for meat products which will ultimately force the meat industry to adapt by investing in alternative protein sources and environmentally sustainable practices. The exponential growth of veganism suggests that as more people become mindful of the health, environmental, and ethical concerns related to meat consumption, they will continue to seek out plant-based alternatives. This shift in consumer preferences may lead to a decrease in the demand for meat, causing a potential decline in the meat industry's market share and profitability. In response to this threat, the meat industry will need to adapt its strategies and business models by intensifying research and development efforts to create meat alternatives and innovate in the realm of plant-based protein sources. This will not only allow the industry to maintain its relevance in the market but also contribute to a more sustainable future. Moreover, this change could also encourage the meat industry to examine its existing practices, focusing on aspects like resource management, processing techniques, waste reduction, and animal welfare. By investing in and implementing environmentally sustainable practices, the industry will be better positioned to withstand the pressure exerted by the rising veganism trend and demonstrate its commitment to operating in a responsible manner. In conclusion, the hypothesis suggests that the rise of veganism will lead to a significant decrease in demand for meat products, forcing the meat industry to adapt by investing in alternative protein sources and environmentally sustainable practices. This transformation is essential for the industry's longevity amidst changing consumer preferences and societal values."},{"question":"How does the sentence end? Samantha got her nails done at the spa near the beach instead of the one near the lake, because she liked the","response":"atmosphere and the view better while enjoying her relaxation time. Samantha made this decision because she knew that the overall experience at the spa near the beach would be more pleasurable and satisfying for her. There were several factors that influenced her preference for the beach spa over the one near the lake, and these factors went beyond just the treatments and services provided. Here is a detailed analysis of why Samantha chose the beach spa: 1. Ambiance and atmosphere: Samantha found the ambiance and atmosphere at the beach spa more serene and calming. She knew that this environment would be conducive to stress relief during her visit. The sound of the waves crashing against the shore, the feel of the gentle ocean breeze, and the mesmerizing view of the vast sea all contributed to make the beach spa a much more inviting and alluring setting. In contrast, the spa near the lake did not offer the same vibrant sensory experience that she craved. 2. Accessibility and convenience: The spa near the beach was conveniently located, with easy access to nearby facilities such as restaurants, shops, and hotels. This allowed Samantha to maximize her time spent at the spa and experience more of the surrounding attractions. On the other hand, the lake spa was relatively isolated, which meant that Samantha would not be able to effortlessly engage in other activities during her stay. 3. Services offered and quality: Samantha was aware that both spas provided excellent services, but she felt that the beach spa offered a wider range of treatments. These included not only nail services, but also massages, facials, and body treatments that incorporated local, beach-inspired ingredients such as seaweed, sea salt, and coconut oil. The spa employees were highly skilled and proficient in delivering exceptional services, making the beach spa even more desirable. 4. Social interaction: The beach spa, being located in a popular area, attracted a more diverse clientele, which made the experience more stimulating for Samantha. She knew that she would enjoy the opportunity to meet new people, engage in conversations, and exchange ideas with other spa-goers, rather than be limited to a more tranquil experience at the lake spa. 5. Personal preferences and experiences: It is important to acknowledge that personal preferences and past experiences play a crucial role in shaping decisions. Samantha had a deep affinity for the sights, scents, and sounds of the ocean, as they evoked pleasant memories and positive emotions. The lake spa, while being highly appealing to others, simply did not resonate with Samantha the same way the beach spa did. 6. Potential for adventure and exploration: With the beach spa being located near a lively and thriving coastal area, Samantha knew that she could easily combine her spa day with other beach activities such as sunbathing, swimming, snorkeling, or even exploring the local beach town. This further enriched her overall experience and made the beach spa a more enticing option for her. In conclusion, Samantha chose to get her nails done at the spa near the beach instead of the one near the lake primarily due to the superior atmosphere, the expanded range of services and experiences, the potential for social interaction, and her personal connection to the beach. This decision allowed her to optimize her relaxation time and establish lasting memories of her visit to the spa."},{"question":"Teacher:In this task, you will be shown a prompt from a judicial decision and multiple holding statements derived from citations following text in a legal decision.

Congress readily obliged the President's request, voting to declare war on Germany by a margin of 373-50 in the House and 82-6 in the Senate. This decision of the United States government to enter World War I was backed up with additional legislation imposing military conscription in America to staff the nation's wartime Army and Navy. On May 18, 1917, a draft bill became law. The bill called for all eligible young men nationwide to register for the draft on a single day — June 5, 1917.

In just ten minutes, nearly 400 people are dead and more than a thousand injured – the exact numbers are unknown due to the chaos caused by Dyer's actions. The Amritsar Massacre, as it came to be known, leaves a deep scar on the Indian psyche and marks a crucial turning point in the struggle for Indian independence. Public outrage at the brutality of Dyer's actions is felt not only in India but also across Britain and the world. The massacre becomes a symbol of British imperialism's ruthlessness and strengthens the resolve of Indians to fight for their freedom. In response to the massacre, Mahatma Gandhi intensifies his nonviolent resistance campaign, which ultimately leads to India gaining independence in 1947. Yet, despite the global condemnation and subsequent investigation into the Amritsar Massacre, the British government has never issued a formal apology. Decades later, while visiting the Golden temple in Amritsar, then Prime Minister David Cameron acknowledges the atrocities as 'monstrous,' but falls short of giving an official apology. As we approach the centenary of this tragic event, the debate over whether Britain should finally apologize for the Amritsar Massacre continues. Supporters argue that offering an apology would be a significant gesture towards healing historical wounds, while skeptics question the purpose such an apology would serve today. Regardless of where one stands on this issue, the Amritsar Massacre remains a poignant reminder of the human capacity for cruelty and the importance of never forgetting our history."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Fact 1: Planting trees has a positive impact on an ecosystem.

The development of the periodization has generally been accredited to historian Peter Brown, after the publication of his seminal work \\"The World of Late Antiquity\\" (1971). Precise boundaries for the period are a continuing matter of debate, but Brown proposes a period between the 3rd and 8th centuries AD. Generally, it can be thought of as from the end of the Roman Empire's Crisis of the Third Century (c. 235 284) to, in the East, the early Islamic period (7th9th centuries), following the Muslim conquests in the mid7th century. In the West the end was earlier, with the start of the Early Medieval period typically placed in the 6th century, or earlier on the Western edges of the empire. - A capital city (or simply capital) is the municipality exercising primary status in a country, state, province, or other region, usually as its seat of government. A capital is typically a city that physically encompasses the offices and meeting places of its respective government; the status as capital is often designated by its law or constitution. In some jurisdictions, including several countries, the different branches of government are located in different settlements. In some cases, a distinction is made between the official (constitutional) capital and the seat of government, which is in another place. - Constantine the Great (27 February 272 AD 22 May 337 AD), also known as Constantine I or Saint Constantine (in the Orthodox Church as Saint Constantine the Great, Equal-to-the-Apostles), was a Roman Emperor from 306 to 337 AD. Constantine was the son of Flavius Valerius Constantius, a Roman Army officer, and his consort Helena. His father became \\"Caesar\\", the deputy emperor in the west, in 293 AD. Constantine was sent east, where he rose through the ranks to become a military tribune under the emperors Diocletian and Galerius. In 305, Constantius was raised to the rank of \\"Augustus\\", senior western emperor, and Constantine was recalled west to campaign under his father in Britannia (Britain). Acclaimed as emperor by the army at Eboracum (modern-day York) after his father's death in 306 AD, Constantine emerged victorious in a series of civil wars against the emperors Maxentius and Licinius to become sole ruler of both west and east by 324 AD. - The Count of Flanders was the ruler or sub-ruler of the county of Flanders, beginning in the 9th century. The title was held for a time by the Holy Roman Emperor and the King of Spain. During the French Revolution in 1790, the county of Flanders was annexed to France and the peerage ceased to exist. In the 19th century, the title was appropriated by Belgium and granted twice to younger sons of the King of the Belgians. The most recent holder died in 1983. - Constantinople was the capital city of the Roman/Byzantine Empire (3301204 and 12611453), and also of the brief Latin (12041261), and the later Ottoman (14531923) empires. It was reinaugurated in 324 AD from ancient Byzantium as the new capital of the Roman Empire by Emperor Constantine the Great, after whom it was named, and dedicated on 11 May 330 AD. - An empire is defined as \\"an aggregate of nations or people ruled over by an emperor or other powerful sovereign or government, usually a territory of greater extent than a kingdom, as the former British Empire, French Empire, Brazilian Empire, Russian Empire, Ottoman Empire, Byzantine Empire or Roman Empire.\\" An empire can be made solely of contiguous territories such as the Austro-Hungarian Empire, or of territories far remote from the homeland, such as a colonial empire. - The Empire of Romania, more commonly known in historiography as the Latin Empire or Latin Empire of Constantinople, and known to the Byzantines as the Latin Occupation, was a feudal Crusader state founded by the leaders of the Fourth Crusade on lands captured from the Byzantine Empire. It was established after the capture of Constantinople in 1204 and lasted until 1261. The Latin Empire was intended to supplant the Byzantine Empire as the titular Roman Empire in the east, with a Western Roman Catholic emperor enthroned in place of the Eastern Orthodox Roman emperors. Baldwin IX, Count of Flanders, was crowned the first Latin emperor as Baldwin I on 16 May 1204. The Latin Empire failed to attain political or economic dominance over the other Latin powers that had been established in former Byzantine territories in the wake of the Fourth Crusade, especially Venice, and after a short initial period of military successes it went into a steady decline. Weakened by constant warfare with the Bulgarians and the unconquered sections of the empire, it eventually fell when Byzantines recaptured Constantinople under Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos in 1261. The last Latin emperor, Baldwin II, went into exile, but the imperial title survived, with several pretenders to it, until the 14th century. - The Byzantine Empire, also referred to as the Eastern Roman Empire, was the continuation of the Roman Empire in the East during Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages, when its capital city was Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul, which had been founded as Byzantium). It survived the fragmentation and fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD and continued to exist for an additional thousand years until it fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1453. During most of its existence, the empire was the most powerful economic, cultural, and military force in Europe. Both \\"Byzantine Empire\\" and \\"Eastern Roman Empire\\" are historiographical terms created after the end of the realm; its citizens continued to refer to their empire as the \\"Roman Empire\\" (tr. ), or \\"Romania\\", and to themselves as \\"Romans\\". - The Empire of Trebizond or the Trapezuntine Empire was a monarchy that flourished during the 13th through 15th centuries, consisting of the far northeastern corner of Anatolia and the southern Crimea. Originally formed during a revolt against the usurpation of the imperial throne by the grandsons of Emperor Andronikos I Komnenos, Trebizond (current Trabzon, Turkey, with which the name of the empire is a cognate) became a Byzantine Greek successor state established after the fall of the Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantine) in the Fourth Crusade, along with the Empire of Nicaea and the Despotate of Epirus. The Emperors of Trebizond pressed their claim on the Imperial throne for decades after the Nicaean reconquest of Constantinople in 1261. - The Empire of Nicaea was the largest of the three Byzantine Greek successor states founded by the aristocracy of the Byzantine Empire that fled after Constantinople was occupied by Western European and Venetian forces during the Fourth Crusade. Founded by the Laskaris family, it lasted from 1204 to 1261, when the Nicaeans restored the Byzantine Empire in Constantinople. - The Fall of Constantinople ('; Conquest of Istanbul) was the capture of the capital of the Byzantine Empire by an invading army of the Ottoman Empire on 29 May 1453. The Ottomans were commanded by the then 21-year-old Mehmed the Conqueror, the seventh sultan of the Ottoman Empire, who defeated an army commanded by Byzantine Emperor Constantine XI Palaiologos. The conquest of Constantinople followed a 53-day siege that had begun on 6 April 1453. - Alexios Komnenos Strategopoulos ( Greek : ) was a Byzantine general during the reign of Michael VIII Palaiologos , rising to the rank of megas domestikos and Caesar . Of noble descent , he appears in the sources already at an advanced age in the early 1250s , leading armies for the Empire of Nicaea against Epirus . After falling out of favour and being imprisoned by Theodore II Laskaris , Strategopoulos sided with the aristocrats around Michael Palaiologos , and supported him in his rise to the throne after Theodore II 's death in 1258 . He participated in the Pelagonia campaign in 1259 , going on to capture Epirus , but his successes were undone in the next year and he was captured by the Epirotes . Released after a few months , he led the unexpected reconquest of Constantinople from the Latin Empire in July 1261 , restoring the Byzantine Empire . He was captured again by the Epirotes in the next year and spent several years in captivity in Italy , before being released . He retired from public affairs and died in the early 1270s . - Michael VIII Palaiologos or Palaeologus (\\"Mikhal VIII Palaiologos\\"; 1223 11 December 1282) reigned as Byzantine Emperor 12591282. Michael VIII was the founder of the Palaiologan dynasty that would rule the Byzantine Empire until the Fall of Constantinople in 1453. He recovered Constantinople from the Latin Empire in 1261 and transformed the Empire of Nicaea into a restored Byzantine Empire. - Istanbul (or ), historically known as Constantinople and Byzantium, is the most populous city in Turkey and the country's economic, cultural, and historic center. Istanbul is a transcontinental city in Eurasia, straddling the Bosphorus strait (which separates Europe and Asia) between the Sea of Marmara and the Black Sea. Its commercial and historical center lies on the European side and about a third of its population lives on the Asian side. The city is the administrative center of the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality (coterminous with Istanbul Province), both hosting a population of around 14.7 million residents. Istanbul is one of the world's most populous cities and ranks as the world's 7th-largest city proper and the largest European city. - The Laskaris or Lascaris family was a Byzantine Greek noble family whose members formed the ruling dynasty of the Empire of Nicaea from 1204 to 1261 and remained among the senior nobility up to the dissolution of the Byzantine Empire, whereupon many emigrated to Italy and then to Smyrna (much later). According to George Pachymeres, they were also called Tzamantouros (T). The feminine form of the name is Laskarina (). - Komnenos, Latinized Comnenus, plural Komnenoi or Comneni (, pronounced /komniní/), is the name of a noble family who ruled the Byzantine Empire from 1081 to 1185, and later, as the Grand Komnenoi (, \\"Megalokomnenoi\\") founded and ruled the Empire of Trebizond (12041461). Through intermarriages with other noble clans, notably the Doukai, Angeloi, and Palaiologoi, the Komnenos name appears among most of the major noble houses of the late Byzantine world.

Speaking out: 11-year-old Emily Bracamontes, who is sick with leukemia, says she's 'happy' her mother removed from a Phoenix hospital two weeks ago so she could continue her care in Mexico. Claims: 'She's happy. She's getting better,' Emily Bracamontes' mother told NBC's Today Show in her first interview since removing Emily from Phoenix Children's Hospital. 'I'm happy that I'm going back home. to see my doctors in Mexico,' Emily, wearing a bright pink hat, told. NBC. 'My mom's only trying to save my life,' she added. 'She doesn't. want me to die in a hospital. So I was happy that she took that. decision.'

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: The Prestige Context: The Prestige begins with shots of several dozen top hats inexplicably strewn about in a forest.Cutter (Michael Caine), in voiceover, explains the three parts of a magic trick while performing a disappearing bird trick for a little girl. Part one is the pledge, where the magician shows you something ordinary, like a bird. Part two is the turn, where he does something extraordinary, like make the bird disappear. But this isn't enough. There always has to be a third act, the prestige, where you have a twist, and bring the bird back. Only then will the audience applaud.Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman), stage name \\"the Great Danton,\\" attempts a transporting trick that involves walking under a giant electrical machine with a Tesla coil and then disappearing through a trapdoor. Except that he falls straight into a giant tank of water that has been placed under the stage, and is automatically locked inside. A man in the audience, who we shortly learn is fellow magician Alfred Borden (Christian Bale), stage name \\"the Professor,\\" forces his way beneath the stage in time to see Angier drown.After this introduction, we follow three timelines at once. In the present day (19th century England), Borden is on trial for murdering Angier, who we learn was his greatest rival. Cutter is revealed to be Angier's engineer, the man who builds the machinery for his tricks, and the little girl is Borden's daughter Jess (Samantha Mahurin).Cutter confides to the judge in a private meeting that the machine Angier was using wasn't built by him, but by \\"a wizard,\\" and it legitimately did what it appeared to do.The trial does not go well for Borden, and he faces execution. Later, in jail, Borden is approached by the solicitor for a collector, Lord Caldlow, who is interested in buying his secrets, particularly the secret of Borden's famous \\"Transported Man\\" trick. The same collector has also bought all of Angier's equipment and props. When Borden refuses, the solicitor threatens that Jess is in danger of being declared an indigent orphan and... Answer:","response":"In the movie The Prestige, Angier (Hugh Jackman) uses a machine to create duplicates of himself in order to perform a seemingly impossible magic trick called the \\"Transported Man.\\" The machine was built by Nikola Tesla, a real-life inventor, and electrical engineer, who is portrayed by David Bowie in the film. In the \\"Transported Man\\" trick, Angier disappears on one side of the stage and instantly reappears on the other side. However, instead of merely creating the illusion of transport, the machine that Tesla had built actually worked by creating a duplicate of Angier. One Angier would go through the trapdoor and into a tank of water below the stage, where he would drown. Simultaneously, the duplicate Angier would appear on the other side of the stage, thus completing the trick and receiving applause from the audience. Angier's use of the machine to create duplicates of himself is an essential plot point in The Prestige, as it drives the intense rivalry between him and fellow magician Alfred Borden (Christian Bale). The competition between the two magicians escalates, leading to Angier framing Borden for his own murder by drowning, which eventually results in Borden's execution. In the end, it is revealed that Borden also had a \\"prestige\\" of his own - he had a secret twin brother, who had helped him perform their version of the \\"Transported Man\\" trick. Ultimately, Angier's obsession with besting his rival and achieving the perfect magic trick leads to tragic consequences for both magicians. As they continually try to outdo each other, their lives become entangled with deceit, loss, and revenge. The Prestige serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of ambition and obsession, as well as the power of secrets in the art of illusion."},{"question":"Given the question: Read the bio below and try to give details on amadou samb 's: - clubs - caps - position - currentclub - height - years - clubnumber - youthclubs - youthyears - birth date - name - birth place - goals Bio: amadou samb -lrb- born 22 april 1988 -rrb- is a senegalese footballer who plays for floriana fc in the maltese premier league , on loan from italian side hellas verona .

It’s quite uncommon, but essentially I can get an excruciating migraine in my arm, leg, etc., on top of getting them in my head/temples. For years my family and I had no idea what was happening, and with no vocabulary to properly explain what was happening, I described it for about fifteen years as “beeping.” Doctors told us it was anything from growth spurts to a grab for attention, and for a while I gave up trying to figure out what they were. When they got worse and I couldn’t ignore them anymore, I was finally sent to a neurologist, who diagnosed me with ice pick headaches. I let out a sigh of relief that I didn’t even know I was holding in; I felt like I could finally breathe. Years of stress and confusion washed off of me, and I started taking a beta blocker to prevent them. I’ve been on them for a few years now, and it’s changed my life for the better. I used to be terrified of learning to drive, for many reasons, but a large one being that if I got an ice pick headache on the road, I couldn’t guarantee the safety of those around me if I was at the wheel. Now I’m considering finally getting my license (considering - I still don’t like being behind the wheel), I don’t double over in white hot pain randomly anymore, and when I do get a cluster headache, I can still function. It almost sounds a little silly, but really, they were crippling, and being able to work through them on my own? It’s the greatest gift I’ve given to myself. You know yourself better than anyone, even if you feel like you don’t know yourself. If something feels wrong, don’t just live with it - keep pushing for a correct diagnosis! Why did the main character get excruciating migraines in her arms and legs? - not enough information - She has a rare form of ice pick headaches that were undiagnosed that cause that type of pain all over her body - She was having growth spurts - She was seeking attention from others The answer to this question is:","response":"She has a rare form of ice pick headaches that were undiagnosed that cause that type of pain all over her body."},{"question":"Write a sentence not in English.","response":"Voici une phrase en français: \\"Le chat est sur le canapé.\\" Now let me explain it to you like you're five: This is a sentence in French, and it says, \\"The cat is on the couch.\\" Just like how we speak English and say words, people in other parts of the world speak different languages like French, and they also use words to share what they're thinking.

In this case, the book in question originally published in 1951, has been recognized by both the author's contemporaries and subsequent generations as a definitive work on its subject. The fact that it was reprinted in 1995, over four decades later, speaks to the enduring legacy and influence that Sneddon's writing continues to hold within the literary world. Sneddon's classic text has likely achieved this lasting impact for a number of reasons.

Eventually, they buy the potatoes for their chips. On the other hand, Kettle Foods supplied non-GMO potato seeds to their farmers. They wanted to see how customers react to their non-GMO products, mostly chips. But I can use this background: Genetically modified organisms (GMO) are organisms whose genetic material has been altered by genetic engineering techniques generally known as recombinant DNA technology. Genetic engineering has expanded the genes available to breeders to utilize in creating desired germlines for new crops. Increased durability, nutritional content, insect and virus resistance and herbicide tolerance are a few of the attributes bred into crops through genetic engineering. For some, GMO crops cause food safety and food labeling concerns. Numerous countries have placed restrictions on the production, import or use of GMO foods and crops. Currently a global treaty, the Biosafety Protocol, regulates the trade of GMOs. There is ongoing discussion regarding the labeling of foods made from GMOs, and while the EU currently requires all GMO foods to be labeled, the US does not.Herbicide-resistant seed has a gene implanted into its genome that allows the plants to tolerate exposure to herbicides, including glyphosate. These seeds allow the farmer to grow a crop that can be sprayed with herbicides to control weeds without harming the resistant crop. Herbicide-tolerant crops are used by farmers worldwide. With the increasing use of herbicide-tolerant crops, comes an increase in the use of glyphosate-based herbicide sprays. In some areas glyphosate resistant weeds have developed, causing farmers to switch to other herbicides. Some studies also link widespread glyphosate usage to iron deficiencies in some crops, which is both a crop production and a nutritional quality concern, with potential economic and health implications.Other GMO crops used by growers include insect-resistant crops, which have a gene from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), which produces a toxin specific to insects. These crops resist damage by insects. Some believe that similar or better pest-resistance traits can be acquired through traditional breeding practices, and resistance to various pests can be gained through hybridization or cross-pollination... What is an answer for this question: Would Kettle Foods potatoes be less or more herbicide tolerant than PepsiCo'? Answer:","response":"Kettle Foods potatoes would likely be less herbicide tolerant than PepsiCo's potatoes. This conclusion is based on the information provided about the two companies' choice of potato seeds. PepsiCo uses GMO potato seeds, which often have herbicide-resistant traits engineered into them, allowing the plants to tolerate exposure to herbicides like glyphosate. This enables farmers to use herbicides to control weeds without damaging their crops, which contributes to higher crop yields and potentially lower production costs. On the other hand, Kettle Foods supplies non-GMO potato seeds to their farmers. Non-GMO potatoes would not have the same level of engineered herbicide resistance, as their genetic material has not been altered through recombinant DNA technology. As a result, these potatoes may be more susceptible to herbicide damage, leading to potential lower crop yields if farmers need to use herbicides in the field. It is important to note that herbicide-tolerance is just one factor to consider when comparing these two types of potatoes. Other factors, such as nutritional content, environmental impact, and consumer preferences, should also be taken into account when evaluating the overall desirability of a potato crop."},{"question":"Do these mean the same? Suddenly Greg appears and asks Mr. Collins , the knife he holds against Jane , to hand over . Suddenly , Jane appears and asks Mr. Collins to hand over the knife he is holding against Greg . Select from: a). no; b). yes;","response":"a). no; These two sentences do not mean the same. Although they share some similarities, they differ on the key roles played by Greg and Jane in the situations. Let's break down each sentence to understand the differences. 1. \\"Suddenly Greg appears and asks Mr. Collins, the knife he holds against Jane, to hand over.\\" In this sentence, Greg is the one appearing suddenly and making a request to Mr. Collins. The situation involves Mr. Collins holding a knife against Jane, and Greg asking Mr. Collins to hand over the knife. 2. \\"Suddenly, Jane appears and asks Mr. Collins to hand over the knife he is holding against Greg.\\" In this sentence, Jane is the one appearing suddenly and making a request to Mr. Collins. The situation here involves Mr. Collins holding a knife against Greg, and Jane asking Mr. Collins to hand over the knife. The key difference lies in who is being threatened with the knife and who is making the request: - In the first sentence, Mr. Collins is holding the knife against Jane, and Greg appears to ask Mr. Collins to hand the knife over. - In the second sentence, Mr. Collins is holding the knife against Greg, and Jane appears, asking Mr. Collins to hand the knife over. These two sentences describe different scenarios with the roles of Greg and Jane being reversed between the two situations. While they both involve Mr. Collins being asked to hand over a knife, the differing roles played by Greg and Jane make it clear these sentences do not mean the same thing."},{"question":"Question: Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

Who wouldn't enjoy getting even with a sadistic boss, a two-faced friend who slept with your spouse or that teacher who had it in for your child for no good reason? Most of us have revenge fantasies, human behavior researchers say, and nearly everyone believes that punishing someone who did him wrong would feel tremendously satisfying. But new studies suggest the reality of revenge is far different. Acting on vengeful thoughts often isn't nearly as gratifying as expected and â surprisingly â can even make people feel worse. Still, the delicious pleasure anticipated from taking revenge is such a powerful drive that it appears to be hard-wired in the brain. University of Zurich scientists found that merely contemplating revenge stimulates a region of the brain called the dorsal striatum, which is known to become active in anticipation of a reward or pleasure, such as making money or eating good food. In the study, 14 volunteers earned money if they cooperated with one another in games. A double-crosser pretended to cooperate but secretly took an unfair share of the cash. Victims could retaliate by imposing a fine on the betrayer, though they sometimes had to spend their own money to carry out the punishment. All 14 volunteers chose to retaliate if they could do so at no charge, and 12 out of 14 did so even if it cost them additional money. When they decided to seek revenge, the dorsal striatum lighted up on a PET scan. Those whose brains were activated the most were willing to spend the most to punish the double-crosser, notes study co-author Ernst Fehr, whose research was published in Science in 2004. It's not surprising that our brains signal \\"pleasure\\" at the prospect of punishing someone who wronged us, says Michael McCullough, a University of Miami psychologist and author of \\"Beyond Revenge: The Evolution of the Forgiveness Instinct.\\" Although it can be a misguided, costly craving in the modern world, evolutionary psychologists believe the thirst for revenge ensured our ancestors' survival â retaliation was the only way for victims to deter aggressors from harming them or their tribes in the future. \\"Revenge burrowed into the brain's reward system â it hitched a ride on our neurons â because it really was effective at deterring future harm,\\" says McCullough, who notes that revenge is ubiquitous throughout the animal kingdom. What are the most important parts of this text?","response":"1. Most people have revenge fantasies, and research suggests that acting on vengeful thoughts isn't as satisfying as expected and can even make people feel worse. 2. The anticipation of revenge appears to be hard-wired in the brain. The dorsal striatum, a region associated with pleasure and reward, becomes active when contemplating revenge. 3. In a study where participants could retaliate against a double-crosser, most chose to do so even at a cost, showing a strong desire for revenge. 4. Michael McCullough, a psychologist, explains that the desire for revenge likely evolved for our ancestors' survival, as retaliation was the only way to deter aggressors from harming them or their tribes in the future. It is now deeply ingrained in the brain's reward system."},{"question":"A train 500 meters long is running with a speed of 44 kmph. The time taken by it to cross a tunnel 230 meters long is? Options: (A) 287 sec (B) 288 sec (C) 48 sec (D) 61 sec (E) 17 sec Hmmm, my stream of consciousness:","response":"To solve this problem, we first need to find the total distance the train travels to cross the tunnel. Then, we can determine the time taken by dividing that distance by the train's speed. 1. Calculate the total distance: The train has to cover the length of itself (500 meters) plus the length of the tunnel (230 meters) to completely cross the tunnel: Distance = Train Length + Tunnel Length Distance = 500 meters + 230 meters Distance = 730 meters 2. Convert the train's speed from kmph to meters per second: 44 kmph is equal to (44 * 1000 meters) / (60 * 60 seconds) 44 * (1000/3600) = 12.22 meters per second (approximately) 3. Calculate the time taken: Now, we can calculate the time taken by dividing the total distance by the train's speed: Time = Distance / Speed Time = 730 meters / 12.22 meters per second Time ≈ 59.7 seconds Since the given options are integers, we can round the 59.7 seconds to the nearest second, which is 60 seconds. However, none of the provided options exactly match this value. If we take rounding into consideration, the closest option would be: (D) 61 sec"},{"question":"Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What cast included Norman Bailey, Rita Hunter and Alberto Remedios? The company, retaining the title \\"Sadler's Wells Opera\\", opened at the Coliseum on 21 August 1968, with a new production of Mozart's Don Giovanni, directed by Sir John Gielgud. Though this production was not well received, the company rapidly established itself with a succession of highly praised productions of other works. Arlen died in January 1972, and was succeeded as managing director by Lord Harewood.The success of the 1968 Mastersingers was followed in the 1970s by the company's first Ring cycle, conducted by Goodall, with a new translation by Andrew Porter and designs by Ralph Koltai. The cast included Norman Bailey, Rita Hunter and Alberto Remedios. In Harewood's view, among the highlights of the first ten years at the Coliseum were the Ring, Prokofiev's War and Peace, and Richard Strauss's Salome and Der Rosenkavalier. The company's musical director from 1970 to 1977 was Charles Mackerras. Harewood praised his exceptional versatility, with a range \\"from The House of the Dead to Patience.\\" Among the operas he conducted for the company were Handel's Julius Caesar starring Janet Baker and Valerie Masterson; five Janáček operas; The Marriage of Figaro with pioneering use of 18th century performing style; Massenet's Werther; Donizetti's Mary Stuart with Baker; and Sullivan's Patience. The company took the production of the last to the Vienna Festival in 1975, along with Britten's Gloriana. Sir Charles Groves succeeded Mackerras as musical director from 1978 to 1979, but Groves was unwell and unhappy during his brief tenure. Starting in 1979, Mark Elder succeeded Groves in the post, and described Groves \\"immensely encouraging and supportive\\".A long-standing concern of Arlen and then Harewood was the need to change the company's name to reflect the fact that it was no longer based at Sadler's Wells theatre. Byam Shaw commented \\"The one major setback the Sadler's Wells Opera Company suffered from its transplant was that unheeding taxi drivers kept on taking their patrons up to Rosebery Avenue\\".Harewood...

Answer the above question based on the context below: At Eynsford, with Moeran as his co-tenant, Heseltine presided over a bohemian household with a flexible population of artists, musicians and friends. Moeran had studied at the Royal College of Music before and after the First World War; he avidly collected folk music and had admired Delius during his youth. Although they had much in common, he and Heseltine rarely worked together, though they did co-write a song, \\"Maltworms\\". The other permanent Eynsford residents were Barbara Peache, Heseltine's long-term girlfriend whom he had known since the early 1920s, and Hal Collins, a New Zealand Māori who acted as a general factotum. Peache was described by Delius's assistant Eric Fenby as \\"a very quiet, attractive girl, quite different from Phil's usual types\\". Although not formally trained, Collins was a gifted graphic designer and occasional composer, who sometimes assisted Heseltine. The household was augmented at various times by the composers William Walton and Constant Lambert, the artist Nina Hamnett, and sundry acquaintances of both sexes.The ambience at Eynsford was one of alcohol (the \\"Five Bells\\" public house was conveniently across the road) and uninhibited sexual activity. These years are the primary basis for the Warlock legends of wild living and debauchery. Visitors to the house left accounts of orgies, all-night drunken parties, and rough horseplay that at least once brought police intervention. However, such activities were mainly confined to weekends; within this unconventional setting Heseltine accomplished much work, including settings from the Jacobean dramatist John Webster and the modern poet Hilaire Belloc, and the Capriol Suite in versions for string and full orchestra. Heseltine continued to transcribe early music, wrote articles and criticism, and finished the book on Gesualdo. He attempted to restore the reputation of a neglected Elizabethan composer, Thomas Whythorne, with a long pamphlet which, years later, brought significant amendments to Whythorne's entry in The History of Music in...

But one of the regents was Ieyasu Tokugawa, who had been biding his time at Edo for 12 years, nurturing dynastic ambitions of his own. Of the cunning, ruthless triumvirate that came out on top at the end of the country's century of civil war, Tokugawa was without doubt the most patient, the most prudent — and most treacherous. He moved quickly to eliminate his strongest rivals, crushing them in 1600 at the great Battle of Sekigahara (near modern Nagoya). During its subsequent two and a half centuries of rule from the new capital established at Edo, the Tokugawa organized a tightly controlled coalition of some 260 daimyo in strategic strongholds throughout the country. The allegiance of this highly privileged and prestigious group was ensured by cementing their ethical principles in the code of bushido, \\"The way of the warrior\\": loyalty to one's master, defense of one's status and honor, and fulfillment of all obligations. Loyalty was further enforced by holding the vassals' wives and children hostage in Edo. All roads into Edo, the most famous being the Tokaido Highway, had checkpoints for guns coming in and for wives going out. One of the most effective ways of keeping a tight rein on the country was to cut it off from the outside world, to keep Japan Japanese. At first, Ieyasu Tokugawa was eager to promote foreign trade. He wanted silk and encouraged the Dutch and British as good, nonproselytizing Protestants just interested in trade. But he didn't like the Portuguese and Spanish Catholic missionaries, who he felt were undermining traditional Japanese values. He banned their activities in 1612 and two years later ordered the expulsion of all missionaries and unrepentant Japanese converts. Executions and torture followed. Converts were forced to renounce their faith by trampling crucifixes and effigies of Jesus and Mary. The Catholic Church has counted 3,125 martyrs in Japan from 1597 (beginning under Hideyoshi) to 1660. In 1635 the Japanese were forbidden, on pain of death, to attempt to travel abroad, and Japanese citizens already overseas were prevented from returning, in case they brought back subversive Christian doctrines. Western books were banned, as were Chinese books that mentioned Christianity. Question: \\"How was loyalty enforced in the bushido?\\" Response: \\"By the threat of eternal damnation\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct? Choices: +no +yes","response":"no The response is not factually correct because, according to the paragraph, loyalty was enforced in the bushido through ethical principles such as loyalty to one's master, defense of one's status and honor, and fulfillment of all obligations.

The dramatic revelation came Monday during a court hearing in New York where lawyers for Cohen and Trump argued for permission to determine whether thousands of pages of documents FBI agents seized from Cohen last week should be subject to attorney-client privilege. U.S. District Court Judge Kimba Wood appeared to reject the idea, saying that a “taint team” created by prosecutors to set aside privileged documents is a “viable option,” while a court-appointed outside lawyer known as a “special master” may also play a role in determining which records can and cannot be viewed by prosecutors. The disclosure about Hannity, who also hosts a nationally syndicated talk radio show, came after prosecutors indicated that Cohen performed “little to no legal work” and had just one client: Trump. In response, Cohen’s lawyers said that Cohen has represented three clients in the past year — Trump, GOP fundraiser Elliott Broidy and a third “publicly prominent individual” who wished to remain anonymous.

Monday saw an influx of additional crews, who were sent to the scene to skim the oil from the surface of the water and place protective booms along the shoreline in an attempt to prevent further environmental damage. The focus of this cleanup effort resulted from fears expressed by various environmental groups concerning the welfare of a vital shorebird habitat located approximately 45 miles southeast of Houston. The company that owns the barge has come forward to accept responsibility for the grievous spill and will shoulder the costs associated with the cleanup operation. In the meantime, comparisons have been drawn to the infamous Exxon oil tanker disaster that occurred 25 years ago, during which 11 million gallons of oil were spilled into the waters of Prince William Sound, Alaska. To this day, that area still feels the profound and lasting effects of the pollution that came about as a result of this incident. While the Houston Ship Channel spill may not be as extensive as the Exxon case, it remains a solemn reminder of the potential hazards posed by humanity's reliance on oil and the transportation methods used to carry it around the globe. Moving forward, it is essential to diligently monitor the situation in the Houston area, particularly as it pertains to the ecological impact on the shorebird habitat and the overall wellbeing of the marine ecosystem. Additionally, the disruption caused by the channel's closure will inevitably have economic implications, and the swiftest return to normalcy should be pursued by the responsible company's reparation efforts. In conclusion, the oil spill in the Houston Ship Channel represents not just an isolated accident, but a crucial reminder of the environmental and economic consequences that go hand in hand with the oil industry. Society's ongoing endeavours to find more efficient and less hazardous transportation methods, as well as cleaner alternative energy sources, remain paramount in mitigating the likelihood of future disasters on this scale. This incident serves as a stark cautionary tale—a serious call to action for corporations and governments alike—to safeguard the precious natural resources at stake, all around the world."},{"question":"if you deposit 1500 euros in a bank account on august 26 at 12% interest pa., how much money will there be in the account on nov. 8?

Photograph: Butch Comegys/AP Pennsylvania's expansive Pocono mountains are a tourist hotspot in the summer and bring skiers and snowboards in the winter, but year-round the mountain range hosts a community of longtime residents used to travelling down miles of dirt roads and densely wooded areas to travel from their isolated homes to more populated areas for school and work. These winding, wooded roads have become a source of anxiety for some residents of Monroe County, after a local resident killed a police officer, Bryon Dickson, and injured another late last week. The suspect managed to evade the eyes of law enforcement until police discovered an abandoned SUV several days after the shooting, leading police to identify him as Eric Frein on Tuesday. A day later, they described him as an anti-law enforcement survivalist who had talked of mass murder. Frein grew up in the mountain town of Canadensis, population 2,164, and attended school in the 5,546-person city of Stroudsburg, where some residents from the wooded areas work and study. The revelations about Frein's views and lifestyle prompted Stroudsburg colleges to take increased security measures, and led to fear among residents. \\"The only concern is that he could be right there and we wouldn't know it,\\" Salwa Khalifa, a student at East Stroudsburg University (ESU), where Frein studied, told the Guardian. Rumours of sightings have become commonplace at ESU and police swarmed the area on Wednesday after reports of a sighting. They found no sign of him. Frein, identified as a member of a war simulation group known as the Eastern Wolves, was added to the FBI's most-wanted list on Thursday. At ESU, Khalifa and her friend Franchesca Davila said his face has clogged their Facebook feeds, as community members post photos in an effort to speed up his discovery. Both women were more worried about people living deep in the Monroe County mountains than themselves. This feeling was echoed across the city, from residents residing in the more populated central areas to those living in the more riskier wooded area, like Mount Pocono, where Frein attended high school and was a member of its rifle team. One Monroe County resident, who did not want to be identified because of fear that Frein would target her, provided copies of a yearbook showing Frein as a rifle-bearing high-school senior, \\"exhibiting a steady hand\\" as he aims at a target. \\"I'm happy we're here and not on Mount Pocono,\\" joked Jason Cumberbatch, a barber at Satori Cuts on Stroudsburg's Main Street. Frein was the hot topic of conversation at the barbershop on Thursday, as he was in bars and coffee shops across the city. The Eastern Wolves played war games set in cold war-era eastern Europe. They used airsoft guns – realistic replicas of real guns that fire small plastic metal pellets, usually using compressed gas. The Eastern Wolves were a member of a wider \\"airsoft, militaria and reenactment\\" group called Red Alliance, which organises tournaments. Bob Courtney, an airsoft player who met Frein at an event several years ago attended by the Eastern Wolves, gave the Guardian some insight into the group. \\"They were much younger than me,\\" he said, adding that he had only played with them at that one event. \\"They were really into their portrayal.\\" He said they put on eastern European accents and \\"listened to Serbian rock music\\". He said that level of immersion was not unusual in the reenactment scene. \\"I do revolutionary war, civil war and World War 2 reenacting. A lot of people immerse themselves in those just as much.\\" But he said that the airsoft hobby, by contrast, was usually \\"more laid-back, less authentic.\\" This hobby, the high-school rifle club membership and the in-depth reporting provided by the Pocono Record have fed tension. On Thursday, the Pocono Record reported that a sniper manual had been found in Frein's possession. \\"We definitely can't wait for this to be over – especially because we have kids,\\" said Cumberbatch. The barbershop was packed with children on Thursday afternoon, primarily because all the schools in the Pocono Mountain school district were closed for the day out of safety. In Stroudsburg, schools cancelled outdoor activities. Glen Hoyte, who was cutting a child's hair two chairs away from Cumberbatch, moved from New York City to Monroe County in 2003. He said he had bought a lock for his grill once he moved, inspiring jokes from his friends who couldn't understand why anyone would need to lock their grill in this safe, friendly area. \\"It definitely takes away that Pocono free-living feeling,\\" said Cumberbatch, who is optimistic that this, like all things, will pass. Dorothy Schips, the owner of a gallery and custom framing shop on Stroudsburg's Main Street, has lived in the woods for 19 years, with her husband of 62 years. She said that now when she gets home, she parks close to her front door instead of in the parking spot on the side of her house. \\"But they'll catch him,\\" said Schips. Write a one or two sentence summary.","response":"A survivalist killer, Eric Frein, has been on the run after killing a police officer and injuring another in Monroe County, Pennsylvania, bringing life in the Poconos area to a standstill as residents and law enforcement remain on high alert.

For those heading to an airport, weather conditions could not have been better for a safe and pleasant journey. Among the travelers were Mohamed Atta and Abdul Aziz al Omari, who arrived at the airport in Portland, Maine. Boston: American 11 and United 175. Atta and Omari boarded a 6:00 A.M. flight from Portland to Boston's Logan International Airport. When he checked in for his flight to Boston, Atta was selected by a computerized prescreening system known as CAPPS (Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System), created to identify passengers who should be subject to special security measures. Under security rules in place at the time, the only consequence of Atta's selection by CAPPS was that his checked bags were held off the plane until it was confirmed that he had boarded the aircraft. This did not hinder Atta's plans. Atta and Omari arrived in Boston at 6:45. Seven minutes later, Atta apparently took a call from Marwan al Shehhi, a longtime colleague who was at another terminal at Logan Airport. They spoke for three minutes.

Padding in shoes and seats allows the time to increase. The front of automobiles are designed to crumple in an accident; this increases the time the car takes to stop. Similarly, barrels of water or sand in front of abutments on the highway and airbags serve to slow down the stoppage time. These changes all serve to decrease the amount of force it takes to stop the momentum in a car crash, which consequently saves lives. Now, I have a new situation: Keith designs car seats. He noticed that some other car seats didn't have any padding. He marked it as case A. On the other hand, most of the seats he designed had padding. He marked it as case B. Keith needed to know pros and cons of both designs. Answer this question please: Would case B take less or more time for the force to act than case A?

Please answer step by step:","response":"Yes, Harry Houdini's wife, Bess Houdini, along with her husband, were involved in efforts to expose fraudulent psychics and mediums. The couple became disillusioned with the spiritualist movement when it became clear that many claimed psychics were using trickery and deception to exploit the grieving. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of their efforts: 1. Personal experiences: Harry Houdini began his career as a magician and escape artist, which gave him an understanding of misdirection and other techniques that fake psychics could use to fool people. Due to personal losses in his life, Houdini became interested in spiritualism and psychic phenomena, hoping to find evidence of an afterlife and wanting to connect with his late mother. 2. Investigation of mediums and psychics: Both Houdini and Bess attended séances and psychic readings, often in disguise, to investigate the legitimacy of spiritualists. Harry Houdini would use his knowledge of tricks and sleight-of-hand to discover the methods fraudulent mediums used to fool their clients. He would also expose mediums who were using basic cold reading techniques to give the appearance of psychic abilities. 3. Public exposure: Once they had gathered enough evidence of fraud, Harry and Bess would reveal their true identities and expose the deceitful psychics, often through dramatic public demonstrations. For example, during a séance, Houdini would identify the tricks the medium was using and then demonstrate the same tricks to the audience. 4. Collaboration with others: Harry Houdini worked with several other prominent skeptics and investigators, like Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, to expose charlatans and frauds within the spiritualist movement. However, his relationship with Doyle became strained due to their differing beliefs on the paranormal; Doyle believed in the legitimacy of some mediums, while Houdini remained steadfast in debunking them. 5. The Houdini-Doyle friendship: Despite their differing opinions on spiritualism, Harry Houdini and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle were friends for some time. Doyle was a devout spiritualist who believed Houdini had true psychic abilities that he didn't acknowledge. Their friendship ultimately ended due to ongoing disagreements on the subject of spiritualism and psychic phenomena. 6. The Houdini's Code: After Harry Houdini's death, Bess Houdini continued his work of debunking psychics in a unique manner. Houdini had left her a secret code, which only she knew, that he would use to communicate with her from the afterlife. She challenged any psychic who claimed to be in contact with her late husband to provide the secret code. For over ten years, none of the psychics she encountered could produce the code, further demonstrating the fallacy of their alleged abilities. In summary, Harry Houdini and his wife Bess were actively engaged in debunking fraudulent psychics and mediums, often through attending séances and psychic readings undercover to expose their trickery to the public. These efforts continued even after Harry Houdini's death, with Bess testing claimed psychics by asking for a secret code given to her by her husband."},{"question":"Annelids are worms such as the familiar earthworm, and annelids have bodies that are segmented. Given these facts, what has bodies that are segmented among the following options: - fur seals - graptolites - a fish - mammals - insects - cacti - Earthworms - sensory neurons A:","response":"To find out which of the given options have bodies that are segmented, we will eliminate the options that do not possess segmented bodies based on their characteristics. Step 1: Since annelids are worms and have segmented bodies, and earthworms fall in this category, we can safely say that earthworms have segmented bodies. Step 2: Fur seals and mammals belong to the same taxonomic class (Mammalia), which are not characterized by segmented bodies. Therefore, we can eliminate fur seals and mammals from the list. Step 3: A fish does not have a segmented body; instead, it has a continuous body structure. Therefore, it can be eliminated from the list. Step 4: Insects have segmented bodies comprising head, thorax, and abdomen, making them a suitable answer to the question. Step 5: Cacti are plants, which do not have segmented bodies in the same way as animals. Thus, we can eliminate cacti from the list. Step 6: Sensory neurons are a type of nerve cell and do not possess segmented bodies. Therefore, we can eliminate sensory neurons from the list. Step 7: Graptolites are an extinct group of marine animals, and though they have a colonial structure, it is unclear if they possess a proper segmented body. However, since we have other clear examples of segmented bodies, we can eliminate graptolites from the list. Therefore, based on the provided information, the options with segmented bodies are: 1.

Who is he referring to in this sentence? OPT: [A]. The gardener. [B]. the owner.","response":"In the given sentence, \\"The gardener watered the owner's rose because he was doing his job,\\" the pronoun \\"he\\" refers to: [A]. The gardener. The structure of the sentence suggests that the pronoun \\"he\\" is referring to the person who watered the owner's rose. In this case, that person is the gardener. The reason we can assume this is because the phrase \\"doing his job\\" is related to the action of watering the rose. The fact that it is the gardener's job to water the roses provides context that links the pronoun \\"he\\" to the gardener. Furthermore, if the pronoun \\"he\\" were referring to the owner, the sentence would have an ambiguous or confusing meaning, as the owner's job is not typically to water roses, but rather, to own property or manage it.

The ball rolls quickly there, then falls to the carpeted floor where it slows down and stops. The golf ball stopped on the carpeted floor because the floor had (A) more friction (B) less friction. Choose the answer between \\"wooden desk\\" and \\"carpeted floor\\". Answer:","response":"The golf ball stopped on the carpeted floor because the floor had more friction. Therefore, the correct answer is \\"carpeted floor.\\" When objects move across different surfaces, they experience friction, which is a force that resists motion between two objects in contact. In this case, Ahmed rolled the golf ball across a wooden desk and then onto a carpeted floor. Different materials and surfaces have varying amounts of friction. When the golf ball rolls on the wooden desk, it experiences less friction because the smooth surface of the desk allows the ball to move relatively easily and quickly. However, as soon as the golf ball falls onto the carpeted floor, it encounters a different surface that has a higher amount of friction. The carpet fibers generate more resistance against the rolling motion of the golf ball, causing it to slow down and eventually come to a stop. Friction is essential in everyday life, as it allows us to walk, drive, write, and even play sports without slipping. In Ahmed's case, the difference in friction between the wooden desk and the carpeted floor caused the golf ball's stop. Hence, the carpeted floor has more friction, which is crucial in stopping the golf ball's motion."},{"question":"Here is a dialogue: Anita: I'm at the station in Bologna Jenny: No problems so far?

This is where economies of scale become important. Since each firm has large initial costs, as the firm gains market share and increases its output the fixed cost (what they initially invested) is divided among a larger number of customers. Therefore, in industries with large initial investment requirements, average total cost declines as output increases over a much larger range of output levels. Paragraph: City D's mayor wants to invite more businesses in the city. Three firms, firm A, firm B, and firm C, took advantage of this opportunity. Firm A does not require large initial costs, but firm B and firm C require large initial costs. Firm B managed to increase its market share, but firm C failed to increase its market share. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which frim's average total cost would decline, firm B or firm C? Answer:","response":"Based on the given information, firm B's average total cost would decline. The reason for the decline in firm B's average total cost is the concept of economies of scale. As mentioned in the background, firms with high fixed costs benefit from an increased number of customers, as the fixed costs are spread over a larger customer base. This results in a decrease in average total cost as output increases over a wider range of output levels. In the given scenario, both firm B and firm C have high initial costs, but their market performance differed. Firm B managed to increase its market share, which implies that it has expanded its customer base and increased its output. Due to this increase in output, firm B is benefiting from economies of scale, leading to a decline in its average total cost. On the other hand, firm C failed to increase its market share. This suggests that firm C did not experience a significant increase in output or customer base. As a result, firm C's high fixed costs were not spread across enough customers to benefit from economies of scale, which would have led to a decline in average total cost. Therefore, it can be concluded that firm B's average total cost would decline, while firm C's would not experience the same decline."},{"question":"Q:Process: - Sunlight passes through the glass into the greenhouse - The plants and floor absorb the the sunlight - The absorbed sunlight is converted to heat - The heat cannot escape the glass - The heat is trapped in the greenhouse - The hot air rises - The colder air at the top is pushed to the bottom - The colder air is then warmed by the floor and the plants.

Tucked into the woods along a country road in rural Virginia, the church holds about 50 worshippers. On this cold November Sunday, Abduraheem and his family of eight noticeably increase the congregation's size. They do their best to follow the unfamiliar English of the old Baptist hymns, which are very familiar to their new neighbors. And they share the hymns from their former home — Sudan. Standing in a single line in front of the altar, the family fills the church with Arabic song. \\"Unbelievable,\\" Abduraheem says repeatedly, as he describes his journey from a crowded prison cell in Sudan to a fixed-up house on the farm of his new pastor. \\"Unbelievable\\" seems like the only word that could describe the turn his life took, thanks to a Facebook post and a U.S. congressman. Abduraheem's work as a former pastor is not outlawed in his native Sudan, but Christians are a minority in a diverse country that has suffered through multiple civil wars. According to the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, there has been \\"an escalation in the Sudanese government's persecution of Christians,” since the 2011 secession of South Sudan. Abduraheem says his work was spreading the gospel; the Sudanese government accused him of espionage, and he was detained along with two other pastors in December 2015. \\"The first day when they took us to the prison, they beat us,” he says softly. Abduraheem was shifted from prison to prison. For five months, he wore the same clothes he was wearing when he was arrested. His eyes became damaged from the harsh prison light.

It has also been variously described as a subgenre of black metal, albeit one that abandoned black metal's Satanic imagery, \\"slow black metal\\" with influences from Nordic folk music, straddling black metal and folk metal almost equally, or running the gamut from \\"folk to black to death metal\\". Typically, Viking metal artists rely extensively on keyboards, which are often played at a \\"swift, galloping pace\\". These artists often add \\"local cultural flourishes\\" such as traditional instruments and ethnic melodies. It is similar to folk metal, and is sometimes categorized as such, but it uses folk instruments less extensively. For vocals, Viking metal incorporates both singing and the typical black metal screams and growls. Overall, Viking metal is hard to define since, apart from certain elements like anthem-like choruses, it is not based entirely on musical features and overlaps with other metal genres, with origins in black and death metal Some bands, such as Unleashed and Amon Amarth, play death metal, but incorporate Viking themes and thus are labeled as part of the genre. Generally, Viking metal is defined more by its thematic material and imagery than musical qualities. Rather than being a mock-up of medieval music, \\"it is in the band names, album titles, artwork of album covers and, especially, in the song lyrics that Viking themes are so evident.\\" Viking metal, and the closely related style pagan metal, is more of a term or \\"etiquette\\" than a musical style. Since they are defined chiefly by lyrical focus, any musical categorizations of these two styles is controversial. Thus, Viking metal is more of a cross-genre term than a descriptor of a certain sound.

Next, let's examine the hypothesis: \\"Two people eat a horse.\\" Key elements: Two people, one horse, eating the horse. 3. Compare the key elements between the premise and the hypothesis. Does the premise provide information that relates directly to the hypothesis? - Two people: Both premise and hypothesis mention two people, but there's no information about their actions towards the horses. - Horses: The premise talks about three miniature horses while the hypothesis talks about one horse. They don't necessarily refer to the same horses. - Walking towards vs eating: The premise mentions that the two people are walking towards the horses, while the hypothesis mentions that they eat a horse. These are unrelated actions. 4. Based on the comparison, the premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the hypothesis.

Question 2: Is Taco Bell good? OPT: 1). no; 2). yes; Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","response":"The answer to these two questions would not be the same, as they touch upon different aspects of Taco Bell and its food. Let's break down each question and provide a detailed answer to help clarify the difference: Question 1: Is Taco Bell bad for you? Taco Bell is a fast-food chain that serves a variety of Tex-Mex dishes, such as tacos, burritos, and nachos. As with any fast-food restaurant, the nutritional value of the food varies depending on the menu item you choose. Some menu items can be high in calories, fats, and sodium, which can make them less healthy options when consumed in large quantities or on a regular basis. It is important to note that not all Taco Bell items are bad for you. If you make conscious choices while ordering, you can find healthier options on the menu, such as the Fresco menu, which offers lower-calorie items. Moreover, Taco Bell has made efforts to improve the nutritional aspects of its menu, by reducing sodium and artificial ingredients in its dishes. In conclusion, whether Taco Bell is bad for you depends on the specific menu items you choose and how frequently you eat them. Moderation and mindful eating are key factors when it comes to assessing the impact of Taco Bell on your health. Question 2: Is Taco Bell good? Taco Bell's appeal and goodness can be subjective and depends on one's personal preferences, priorities, and cultural tastes. Many people enjoy Taco Bell due to its combination of affordability, convenience, and unique Tex-Mex offerings. The fast-food chain is particularly popular among late-night eaters and budget-conscious diners, as it provides fast service and budget-friendly menu options. Moreover, Taco Bell has been improving its menu over the years, incorporating vegetarian and vegan options, and offering lower-calorie choices through its Fresco menu. This expansion has made the brand more inclusive and appealing to a wider range of customers with diverse dietary needs. In terms of flavor, some people enjoy the unique taste of Taco Bell's menu offerings, while others may prefer more authentic or gourmet Tex-Mex cuisine. Ultimately, the question of whether Taco Bell is good depends on individual tastes, preferences, and priorities. In summary, the answer to the questions \\"Is Taco Bell bad for you?\\" and \\"Is Taco Bell good?\\" is not the same because they address different aspects of the restaurant and its offerings. While Taco Bell can potentially be bad for your health if you consistently consume high-calorie, high-fat, and high-sodium menu items, its overall goodness varies based on individual perspectives, preferences, and culinary tastes."},{"question":"Instructions: In this task, you're given a question, along with a context passage which has extra information available on certain terms mentioned in it.

His wife Janet would load the banjos into their station wagon and try to hawk them to L.A. music stores, which often said no to the upstart company. Even after landing accounts, they scrambled to pay their bills and struggled to shake off the image of banjo players as toothless hillbillies in overalls. At times, the Deerings wanted to give up. But they had a pact — they would make banjos no matter what. “We would say, ‘We can’t give up,'” says Janet Deering. “So let’s figure it out.” Did they ever. From that inauspicious start in 1975, the Deering Banjo Company of Spring Valley, Calif., has grown into North America’s largest banjo maker, riding the instrument’s current boom in popularity. The company owns an estimated 80% to 90% of the U.S. market and has almost doubled its sales since 2009, to a projected 5 million this year. In the past year alone, sales are up 1 million. In January, they expect to sell their one hundred-thousandth banjo. Instead of banging on music store doors, they have a one-year back order on new instruments. MORE: We need business leaders with some sense of shame Deering is not just the nation’s dominant banjo purveyor. It’s also a brand that’s attracting a new breed of young musicians. Taylor Swift strums a six-string, 2,100 model. “Taylor has really brought a lot of new people to the banjo,” Janet says. “Just watching her play, they buy banjos. It’s a wonderful thing.” Steve Martin, Keith Urban, and Winston Marshall of Mumford & Sons are all Deering banjo players too. The current roster of A-list musicians playing a Deering represents a 180-degree turn from the 1970s, ’80s and ’90s, when Nashville shunned the banjo. Zen Crook, an old-time Nashville session player, told a company official how a fellow musician warned him, “Don’t let anyone know you play the banjo because it will be the kiss of death of your music career.” The Deerings say the banjo backlash hurt them early on. “We felt like we couldn’t climb out of the box,” Janet says. “I had country artists say, ‘As soon as I cut a record with a banjo, they cut it from the album.'” Greg Deering credits Emily Robison of the Dixie Chicks. “They told Emily she couldn’t play the banjo, and she told them to stuff it,” he says. “She said, ‘Either I play the banjo, or we walk.'” She used an electric Deering banjo she bought at age 15. Keith Urban also widened the instrument’s appeal, recording with a Deering far from Nashville in his native Australia. From the time he was a kid listening to The Kingston Trio, Greg says he has always loved the banjo. “It’s a primitive sound,” he says. “It has a haunting quality to it.” Greg was a good banjo player, but he was a better craftsman who honed his skills building model airplanes with his father. In 1969, as a 19-year-old student at San Diego State University, he made his first banjo because he couldn’t afford the 700 Gibson banjo he longed for. He and his buddies, including Bob Taylor (who would go on to guitar-making fame) formed an instrument-making co-op called The American Dream. In 1974, the co-op closed. The next year, Greg and Janet, who met at church after she watched him play hymns, started the Deering Banjo Company. In the early, lean years, they would eat from their garden and chicken coop, scrounge for tools at a salvage yard, and rush to the bank to deposit any profits before their checks bounced. After they hired four employees, the neighbors complained, so they moved their operation to a small plant. Pricing was a challenge initially. Greg wanted to put as much value as possible into each banjo, but when Janet tried to sell a 175 model, store owners would ask, “What’s wrong with it? Why is it so cheap?” The next week, they raised the price to 275, and still the stores wouldn’t bite. Only after they raised the price to 375 did they start racking up orders. The Deerings now rely on a skilled workforce of 47 craftspeople, some of whom were carpenters and others who trained on the job. With fluctuations in sales, keeping a core crew posed a challenge. During the recent recession, Deering’s sales skidded from 3.4 million in 2007 to a low of 2.4 million in 2009. The company shrunk down to what the Deerings call an ” irreversible minimum” of 31 workers. “We spent two weeks with barely enough sales to make payroll,” Greg says. But they wanted to keep all their best employees, so they had everyone in the shop read a book about lean technologies called The Goal: A Process of Ongoing Improvement. They moved machinery to a central location so workers did not have to walk as far, and Greg developed new, more efficient machines. When sales picked up, they could produce banjos faster and for less. MORE: Japan: A haven for humanoid robots Deering’s current offerings span the market. Their entry-level 500 banjos compete with Chinese imports. They also make custom-made, high-end instruments such as the Banjosaurus, which features an intricate mural depicting dinosaur evolution on the neck. George Grove of the Kingston Trio plays it onstage when he is not lending it to the American Banjo Museum in Oklahoma City. Anyone who wants to fork over 60,000 can have one custom-built just like it. Often, it’s rich amateurs, not professional musicians, who spend tens of thousands on a banjo as a piece of art. To keep banjo fever hot, the Deerings advertise in magazines, on the radio, and even on the side of a bus, under the tagline “Relax and Enjoy the Sound. Play the Banjo.” The company has sponsored banjo giveaways through the Facebook page of the Celtic punk group The Dropkick Murphys. To register to win, people have to submit their email address. “Within minutes, we’ll get 10,000 to 15,000 emails,” Greg says. This fall, the Deerings traveled with Mumford & Sons, setting up a tent and giving free banjo lessons to 2,000 fans in two weeks. “Within 15 minutes, I can teach you to strum and play two songs,” Greg says. They also travel worldwide, visiting dealers in 11 countries, and sell to other countries online. Jamie Deering, the Deerings’ daughter, is in charge of artist relations and also travels with bands. She has been mentioned as a possible successor, but Greg says she doesn’t want to go through the decades of struggle she saw her parents endure. “In order for her to take over, we’re going to have things running really, really well,” Greg says. Besides, Greg, who is 63, and Janet, who is 59, say they have no plans to retire anytime soon. They ignore advice to take their company public or cash out. That, after all, would break their pact. “We just want to make banjos,” Greg says. “It’s all about the magic of the music and the magic of banjos.” What was this article about?","response":"This article narrates the journey of Greg Deering and his wife Janet, the founders of Deering Banjo Company - the largest banjo maker in North America today. Greg Deering, originally a skilled craftsman who was also a good banjo player, made his first banjo when he was a 19-year-old student at San Diego State University because he couldn't afford to buy the 700 Gibson banjo he wished for. He, along with his friends, created an instrument-making co-op, The American Dream. When this co-op shut down in 1974, Greg and his wife Janet, whom he met at church, launched the Deering Banjo Company the next year. Despite the hardships they faced, from bankruptcy threats to negativity from market influencers, the Deerings held onto their pact – to produce banjos no matter what. They began to surface when they found out that pricing their banjo at 375 helped them secure orders, as compared to the lower prices they initially offered. Their company owns around 80% to 90% of the U.S market today and has almost doubled its sales since 2009, witnessing an increase of 1 million in sales in the past year alone. They cater to both entries in the market - those looking for banjos at lower prices (500) and those who seek custom-made, high-end instruments (even going upto 60,000). Prominent artists like Taylor Swift, Steve Martin, Keith Urban, and Winston Marshall of Mumford & Sons, and Emily Robison of the Dixie Chicks have contributed to making the banjo popular. Their preference of the instrument for music has shattered its earlier image and has attracted a new generation of musicians. Greg Deering credits Taylor Swift as a significant influence for bringing new people to the banjo and inspiring them to buy it. Zen Crook, an old-time Nashville session player, explained that there was a time when one would be advised against revealing that they play banjo as it was considered detrimental to their music career. Along with dedicated marketing efforts, they ensure constant engagement with their audience through campaigns inviting mass participation. The company has sponsored banjo giveaways, given free banjo lessons and run advertising campaigns with catchy taglines. Greg and Janet's daughter, Jamie Deering, who is currently in charge of artist relations, is seen as a potential successor. The Deering couple, however, is nowhere close to considering retirement as they are passionate and content with their work of creating banjos. Their focus remains on enhancing the legacy of banjos in the world of music."},{"question":"the traditional madonna and child christmas stamp was issued wednesday by the postal service .

This poor man was scared to death and only pulled over when his vehicle ran out of gas. A request was made for us to send an officer to transport this gentleman the 200 miles back to his home. Because we were at minimum shift strength, the Sergeant determined that a family member would have to go and get him. I returned to work the following night and at nightly briefing, I asked if anyone had an update on the man’s transport. The sergeant said he hadn’t heard anything, which is when a junior patrolman spoke up. He said that man is from my neighborhood and after I got home from work this morning, I drove the 400 mile round trip and picked up my neighbor and returned him home to his wife.

With no further explanation, a sadistic madman degrades, tortures and mutilates them. Initially, he punctures Kazuo's belly with a screwdriver and slices his tongue, then rapes both, one at a time, forcing the other to watch. Sometimes he stops the torture to provide medical assistance and cure the couple's wounds, so they can continue alive for a long period of time. This way he cuts off all their fingers, makes collars with them, pops out Kazuo's right eye, removes the girl's nipples and cuts off her right arm. As the torture progresses, it is revealed he is simply doing it for sexual stimulation, and tells the couple he wants the two to survive. He finally castrates Kazuo, claiming he has found all the sexual relief he needs, so no longer needs the couple's \\"services\\". Then the couple is moved to a room which resembles a modern and clean hospital room, where the kidnapper takes care of the couple's wounds. While it is never explicitly mentioned on the movie, it becomes gradually apparent that the man has professional medical training, refined manners, taste for classical music and good wines and dressed with expensive clothes when he is not in surgeon dress torturing the couple. At some point he even mentions he is a wealthy man, which suggests he may be a reputable surgeon, not merely a violent sadist, looking for an extreme and different way to obtain satisfaction on his lonely life; however, the couple also notes the doctor has a particular rotting smell always present behind his clean and elegant appearance.

On Earth, an ocean is one of the major conventional divisions of the World Ocean, which covers almost 71% of its surface. These are, in descending order by area, the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic Oceans. The word \\"sea\\" is often used interchangeably with \\"ocean\\" in American English but, strictly speaking, a sea is a body of saline water (generally a division of the world ocean) partly or fully enclosed by land. - A tributary or affluent is a stream or river that flows into a larger stream or main stem (or parent) river or a lake. A tributary does not flow directly into a sea or ocean. Tributaries and the main stem river drain the surrounding drainage basin of its surface water and groundwater, leading the water out into an ocean. - Malawi (or ; or [maláwi]), officially the Republic of Malawi, is a landlocked country in southeast Africa that was formerly known as Nyasaland. It is bordered by Zambia to the northwest, Tanzania to the northeast, and Mozambique on the east, south and west. The country is separated from Tanzania and Mozambique by Lake Malawi. Malawi is over with an estimated population of 16,777,547 (July 2013 est.). Its capital is Lilongwe, which is also Malawi's largest city; the second largest is Blantyre, the third is Mzuzu and the fourth largest is its old capital Zomba. The name Malawi comes from the Maravi, an old name of the Nyanja people that inhabit the area. The country is also nicknamed \\"The Warm Heart of Africa\\". - Tanzania , officially the United Republic of Tanzania, is a country in Eastern Africa within the African Great Lakes region. Parts of the country are in Southern Africa. It is bordered by Kenya and Uganda to the north; Rwanda, Burundi, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the west; Zambia, Malawi, and Mozambique to the south; and by the Indian Ocean to the east. Mount Kilimanjaro, Africa's highest mountain, is in northeastern Tanzania. - The Dwangwa River in Malawi is a tributary river for Lake Nyasa . It flows for approximately 100 miles ( 160 km ) . The river 's source is in the Kasungu National Park , in Malawi 's central plateau . It flows north - easterly from this plateau through an ancient valley . The river 's mouth flows out of a more recently cut gorge , into the Lake . It also flows through the Bana Swamp The Dwangwa River is used both for irrigation and the generation of hydroelectric power . It is a fishing river , with prawns found in the river . - Mozambique (or ), officially the Republic of Mozambique (or \\"\\") is a country in Southeast Africa bordered by the Indian Ocean to the east, Tanzania to the north, Malawi and Zambia to the northwest, Zimbabwe to the west, and Swaziland and South Africa to the southwest. It is separated from Madagascar by the Mozambique Channel to the east. The capital and largest city is Maputo (known as \\"Lourenço Marques\\" before independence). - Lake Malawi, also known as Lake Nyasa in Tanzania and Lago Niassa in Mozambique, is an African Great Lake and the southernmost lake in the East African Rift system, located between Malawi, Mozambique and Tanzania. It is the ninth largest lake in the world and the third largest and second deepest lake in Africa. It is home to more species of fish than any other lake, including about 1000 species of cichlids. The Mozambique portion of the lake was officially declared a reserve by the Government of Mozambique on June 10, 2011,while in Malawi a portion of the lake is included in Lake Malawi National Park. Lake Malawi is a meromictic lake, meaning that its water layers do not mix. The permanent stratification of Lake Malawi's water and the oxic-anoxic boundary (relating to oxygen in the water) are maintained by moderately small chemical and thermal gradients. - A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, sea, lake or another river. In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague. - A sea is a large body of salt water that is surrounded in whole or in part by land. More broadly, \\"the sea\\" is the interconnected system of Earth's salty, oceanic watersconsidered as one global ocean or as several principal oceanic divisions. The sea moderates Earth's climate and has important roles in the water cycle, carbon cycle, and nitrogen cycle. Although the sea has been traveled and explored since prehistory, the modern scientific study of the seaoceanographydates broadly to the British \\"Challenger\\" expedition of the 1870s. The sea is conventionally divided into up to five large oceanic sectionsincluding the International Hydrographic Organization's four named oceans (the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, and Arctic) and the Southern Ocean; smaller, second-order sections, such as the Mediterranean, are known as \\"seas\\". - A drainage basin or catchment basin is an extent or an area of land where all surface water from rain, melting snow, or ice converges to a single point at a lower elevation, usually the exit of the basin, where the waters join another body of water, such as a river, lake, reservoir, estuary, wetland, sea, or ocean. Thus if a tributary stream joins a brook that in turn joins a small river which is a tributary of a larger river, there is a series of successively larger (and lower elevation) drainage basins. For instance, the Missouri and Ohio rivers are within their own drainage basins and also within the drainage basin of the Mississippi River. - \\"Main Stem\\" is 1942 instrumental by Duke Ellington and His Famous Orchestra. Although recorded in 1942, the single would not be released until 1944 where it was Duke Ellington's last of four number one's on the Harlem Hit Parade. \\"Main Stem\\" also peaked at number twenty on the pop chart.

He was one of five children of Denis and Mireille Brodeur. Denis played in the 1956 Olympics for Team Canada and won a bronze medal. After his playing career, Denis was a longtime photographer for the Montreal Canadiens. After a year of success, the Devils were in the middle of the pack for most of the 1995-96 season and barely missed the playoffs. Brodeur played in 74 of his team's 82 games, setting a single-season record for most minutes played by a goalie, while having the 2nd-most shutouts (6) in the league. He was named the starter in the All-Star Game for the Eastern Conference and stopped all 12 shots he faced. He finished fourth in voting for the Vezina Trophy, which is awarded to the league's top goaltender. Brodeur also played on Team Canada during the 1996 World Cup of Hockey, where Canada lost to the United States in the gold medal finals. In the 1996-97 season, the Devils finished 3rd in the NHL. Brodeur was runner-up for the Vezina Trophy, was named to the All-Star team, and had the lowest goals against average by a goalie in almost 30 years, earning him the Jennings Trophy. He also had 10 shutouts and a .927 save percentage. On April 17, 1997, in the first game of a first-round playoff matchup against the Montreal Canadiens, Brodeur fired the puck the length of the ice and into the Canadiens' empty net to ensure a 5-2 victory. It was only the second time in NHL history that a goaltender had scored in the playoffs, and the fifth time overall. The Devils went on to win that series, but lost in the second round to the rival New York Rangers. The following year, Brodeur had 43 wins and 10 shutouts in the regular season. The Devils finished first in the Eastern Conference, but lost in the first round of the playoffs to the eighth-seeded Ottawa Senators. Once again, Brodeur made the All-Star Team, finished as a runner-up for the Vezina Trophy, and won the Jennings Trophy. In the 1998-99 season, the Devils finished first in the Eastern Conference for the third straight year, with Brodeur winning 39 games. He was among the contenders for the Vezina Trophy and started in the All-Star game, making his fourth appearance. However, the Devils lost in the first round to the Penguins. It was Brodeur's worst playoff performance to date statistically, as he allowed 20 goals in seven games with an .856 save percentage. Did anything else notable happen during that season?","response":"During the 1998-99 season, Martin Brodeur was a very good goalie.

Stream-of-consciousness explanation: When considering a coin toss, one of the essential aspects of the event is the inherent randomness involved in the process. The outcome of a coin toss relies on various factors such as the force applied, air resistance, the angle in which the coin was tossed, the surface upon which it lands, and even minute imperfections on the coin itself. Effectively predicting which side of the coin will land up involves knowing all the variables and their precise values at the moment of the toss. While, theoretically, one could attempt to calculate these values, it would be incredibly challenging, if not impossible, to gather all of this detailed information and accurately model the precise physics involved in a real-world scenario. Furthermore, the act of observing and measuring these variables may also change the outcome of the coin toss, meaning that attempting to predict the result could only further obscure the final outcome. A coin toss is often used as an example of a random event and can be handy in making unbiased decisions or assigning equal probabilities to two possible outcomes. Therefore, given the unpredictability and various factors that influence a coin toss, the answer to the question is: it is not possible to tell which side of the coin will be face-up before it happens."},{"question":"there are no degrees of horror when children are murdered at their school .

Eat a maximum of 6 ounces of protein at mealtimes. Ideally, women should consume 1,500 to 1,800 calories per day, and men should consume 1,800 to 2,200 per day. If your weight loss has stalled, then try counting calories for a couple of days and see what is pushing you out of your acceptable calorie range. If you’re estimating, then you may be overeating.

(CNN) -- Imagine going in for a cancer screening, and the technician turns to you and says, \\"We're finished, but if I push this button over here, the machine can detect even smaller cancers. But here's the hitch: You have to pay 700 if you want me to push this button.\\" \\"You'd be enraged,\\" says Ellen Matloff, director of cancer genetic counseling at Yale University Cancer Center. \\"You'd want to know why you have to pay extra to push that button. Why didn't they just do it right the first time?\\" Doctors and genetic counselors interviewed by CNN say that Myriad Genetics in Utah is doing something very similar with tests that determine if a woman has a potentially dangerous genetic abnormality linked to breast cancers. CNN contacted four genetic testing centers, each of which did something different: One center quickly contacted all patients to tell them about","response":"the new technology and offer the additional test, another informed patients only during scheduled follow-ups, the third required patients to call in for the information, and the last did not inform patients at all, citing a lack of resources and funds. This disparity in protocols raises questions about the ethics and responsibilities of genetic testing centers, as well as the role of the healthcare system in ensuring that all patients have equal access to the most accurate and comprehensive diagnostic tools. Myriad Genetics' new testing method, which can detect even smaller genetic abnormalities linked to breast cancer, is seen as a potentially groundbreaking advancement in cancer diagnostics. However, the additional 700 fee for the more advanced screening has caused controversy, with critics arguing that such vital health information should not be withheld in exchange for money. The debate surrounding Myriad Genetics' practices touches on wide-ranging issues, such as healthcare accessibility, patient autonomy, and the role of private industry in shaping medical care. For some, the company's decision to charge extra for a potentially life-saving test amounts to a form of discrimination, undermining the principles of equal access to care and penalizing those who are unable to afford the additional fee. These critics argue that a just healthcare system must prioritize patients' health above all else, ensuring that medical advancements benefit everyone rather than only those who can afford higher-priced options. Others, however, may see Myriad Genetics' practices as a business decision in a free market. Supporters of this view might argue that companies like Myriad Genetics are under no obligation to provide their services for free, and that charging for advanced screenings allows them to continue researching and developing new diagnostic tools. For these individuals, the potential benefits of such innovations outweigh the financial burdens placed on some patients. To address these concerns and ensure a more cohesive approach to genetic testing, medical and regulatory authorities will need to develop a better framework for medical professionals and genetic centers to follow. This framework should outline guidelines for the dissemination of information, patient consent, and the pricing of diagnostic services. By establishing clear and consistent policies, healthcare providers and testing centers can be held accountable for their practices, thus preventing situations where patients are forced to make difficult financial decisions about their healthcare. In conclusion, the controversy surrounding Myriad Genetics' additional fee for advanced cancer screening highlights the need for clear healthcare guidelines and an ongoing conversation about the ethical responsibilities of genetic testing centers. The goal should be to strike a balance between the interests of private industry in creating innovative and effective diagnostic tools and the rights of patients to have access to potentially life-saving information. To achieve this, the implementation of a new policy framework for genetic testing that focuses on fairness, equity, and the best interests of patients will be essential."},{"question":"Q:- Over long periods of time rain can hit the limestone - And cause a acidic reaction - The limestone will slowly disintegrate - A large gap with be where the limestone was - Result in the cave. What might be the first step of the process? A:","response":"The first step of the process in the formation of a cave in a limestone-rich area due to the effects of rain over a long period of time is the chemical weathering of the limestone. This involves the interaction between the rainwater, which is slightly acidic, and the limestone, leading to the breakdown and dissolution of the rock. The formation of the cave takes place through a sequence of stages, which are explained in more detail below. 1. Acid rain formation: The rainwater becomes slightly acidic due to the dissolution of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere, forming carbonic acid (H2CO3). Additionally, anthropogenic factors such as air pollution can contribute to the formation of acid rain, further increasing the acidity of the rainwater. 2. Limestone dissolution: As the slightly acidic rainwater comes into contact with the limestone, which is composed predominantly of calcium carbonate (CaCO3), a chemical reaction takes place. The carbonic acid (H2CO3) reacts with the calcium carbonate (CaCO3) to form calcium ions (Ca2+), bicarbonate ions (HCO3-), and water: CaCO3 + H2CO3 → Ca2+ + 2HCO3- This reaction leads to the dissolution of the limestone and the subsequent formation of small cracks, fissures, and gaps in the rock. 3. Subsurface water flow and widening of gaps: Over time, the small cracks and gaps created in the limestone are gradually widened by the continuous flow of acidic water, which further dissolves the limestone and carries the dissolved calcium and bicarbonate ions away. The subsurface water flow can be facilitated by factors such as geological faults, fractures, or impermeable layers in the rock, which direct the flow of water towards the limestone formation. 4. Formation of underground streams and channels: As the gaps within the limestone continue to enlarge, they eventually form interconnected underground streams and channels, serving as conduits for the water flow. 5. Cave development and enlargement: The continuous process of limestone dissolution and subsurface water flow leads to the gradual enlargement of the underground channels, ultimately creating cavernous spaces. These open spaces are what we commonly refer to as caves. The development and enlargement of caves can be further influenced by processes such as erosion, physical weathering, and changes in the groundwater levels. 6. Secondary cave formations: Once the cave has formed, various secondary formations such as stalactites, stalagmites, flowstones, or columns may begin to develop. These cave formations arise due to the deposition of calcium carbonate from the slow dripping or flowing of water containing dissolved calcium and bicarbonate ions. So, in summary, the first step in the process of cave formation in limestone over long periods of time is the dissolution of the limestone due to the chemical weathering caused by the slightly acidic rainwater. This initial step sets the stage for the series of reactions and events that ultimately lead to the development and enlargement of the cave system."},{"question":"Write a sentence in Spanish.","response":"Step 1: Choose a subject (the person or thing doing the action) I choose \\"el gato\\" (the cat).

Acknowledge how you’re feeling and give yourself permission to experience the emotion. This allows your feelings to pass. Fighting or suppressing your emotions can make them boil over and makes it take longer for you to work through them. Be honest about how you feel and give yourself time to deal with it. For example, you might feel sad after getting passed over for a promotion. Don’t try to fight the feeling! Tell yourself, “I’m sad right now because I thought I was going to get the job. It’s okay to feel this way.” Stress is a normal part of life, but it can be harmful in large doses. When you’re under a lot of stress, you might not be able to deal with your emotions. To help you manage your stress, identify stress relievers that work for you. Then, incorporate them in your daily routine. For instance, you might call a friend after a stressful day at work, color in an adult coloring book to decompress, or take a warm bath to release the tension in your body. Try out different stress relievers to see what works for you. Options include things like going for a walk, journaling, sipping on hot tea, playing with your pet, reading, or engaging in a hobby. Think about the times you’ve gotten really upset in the past. Then, identify what was happening in that moment. This is an emotional trigger that you have. Knowing your triggers helps you better manage your emotional reactions to them. For example, let’s say you blew up at your friend for yelling at a dog. You might realize that seeing people be mean to animals is an emotional trigger for you. In the future, you might take a deep breath and count to 10 before you address your concerns about how animals are being treated. to stay focused on the present moment.

Her roommate, Carla, comes out and decides to take a more scientific approach toward the chicken sandwiches. Carla sees that the average kinetic energy in sandwich A is higher than the average kinetic energy in sandwich B. Carla then takes a big bite out of both sandwiches and returns to her room as if nothing happened. Hint: No doubt you already have a good idea of what temperature is. You might say that it’s how warm or cool something feels. In physics, temperature is defined as the average kinetic energy of the particles of matter. When particles of matter move more quickly, they have more kinetic energy, so their temperature is higher. With a higher temperature, matter feels warmer. When particles move more slowly, they have less kinetic energy on average, so their temperature is lower. With a lower temperature, matter feels cooler. A:","response":"Sandwich A was in the microwave for a longer period of time. The paragraph describes how Sarah reheated two chicken sandwiches and then left them on the counter. Carla, her roommate, observed the sandwiches and noted the difference in their average kinetic energies. In physics, temperature is defined as the average kinetic energy of the particles of matter. When particles move more quickly, they have more kinetic energy, and therefore have a higher temperature. Conversely, when particles move more slowly, they have less kinetic energy, resulting in a lower temperature. Carla observed that sandwich A had a higher average kinetic energy than sandwich B. Given the relationship between kinetic energy and temperature, we can infer that sandwich A had a higher temperature than sandwich B. When food is microwaved, the energy from the microwaves causes the molecules in the food to move faster, which in turn increases the kinetic energy and temperature of the food. Therefore, the higher temperature of sandwich A suggests that it absorbed more energy from the microwaves and was in the microwave for a longer period of time than sandwich B."},{"question":"Question: I know that the answer to the question \\"In which city is the ZIP code 10021?\\" is in \\"New York is the most important source of political fundraising in the United States, as four of the top five ZIP codes in the nation for political contributions are in Manhattan.

(Associated Press) WASHINGTON (AP) — Two longtime GOP lawmakers announced their retirements Tuesday from the House of Representatives, adding to the growing list of Republicans electing to leave Capitol Hill under the Trump administration rather than face voters in next year's midterm elections. Twelve-term Rep. Frank LoBiondo of New Jersey declared in a statement that \\"our nation is now consumed by increasing political polarization\\" and \\"there is no longer middle ground.\\" The 71-year-old became the latest moderate Republican to leave Congress and open up a seat that will be ripe for Democrats to pick up as they fight to retake control of the House next year. Then, several hours later, seven-term Rep. Ted Poe of Texas, a conservative, announced that he too plans to retire rather than seek re-election to another term next year. Poe, 69, whose district covers parts of Houston and northern suburbs, said in a statement that \\"Thanks to the lord, I'm in good health, but it's time for the next step.\\" He added that he was looking forward to spending more time with his grandkids. Poe's district is solidly Republican and would be a struggle for Democrats to win. With the announcements from LoBiondo and Poe, the list of Republicans who've announced plans to retire rather than seek re-election is now near two dozen, compared to fewer than half-a-dozen Democrats. Although only a handful of the GOP seats opening up are highly competitive for the Democrats, the many retirements nonetheless are adding up to an increasingly rosy scenario for Democrats, who must pick up two dozen seats to win back the House. LoBiondo said the time is right for him to leave anyway because of term limits on his service on the Intelligence Committee and as chairman of the Transportation Committee's subcommittee on aviation. But he also delivered an indictment of the current political climate. \\"As some of my closest colleagues have also come to realize, those of us who came to Congress to change Washington for the better through good governance are now the outliers,\\" LoBiondo wrote. \\"In legislating, we previously fought against allowing the perfect to become the enemy of the good. Today a vocal and obstinate minority within both parties has hijacked good legislation in pursuit of no legislation.\\" LoBiondo joins several other House GOP moderates, including Reps. Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida, who have decided not to seek re-election in next year's midterms. Also Tuesday, Arizona Republicans confirmed that another establishment-friendly House Republican, Rep. Martha McSally, plans to run for Senate for the seat being vacated by GOP Sen. Jeff Flake. Taken together, the departures of GOP moderates could result in an even more polarized House than exists today. In years past large blocs of moderate Blue Dog Democrats and centrist Republicans could sway outcomes on legislation, but the ranks of the Blue Dogs have already been decimated while the GOP moderates are dwindling fast. ___ Associated Press writer Alan Fram contributed. ||||| Sound smart: It's tempting to read too much into off-year elections. And, given both Virginia and New Jersey are states Hillary Clinton won, they by all measures should have gone to Democrats. But don't underestimate how much unity, momentum, money will now flow to Democrats — and how much finger-pointing and funk they avoided. For the first time since Election Night one year ago today, Democrats could smile. On a day that set the opening tone for the midterm elections of 2018, voters rejected President Trump, handed Democrats a big win in a swing state in a racially charged moment, and provided hope — however fleeting or fanciful — that they can win back power in Washington. In the Virginia governor's race, Democrat Ralph Northam beat Ed Gillespie by 9 points — a far bigger margin than either party had foreseen, and far wider than Hillary Clinton's win over Trump. Some empirical data behind the hope: The stunning margin was booked largely in Northern Virginia, in what MSNBC's Steve Kornacki called \\"the revenge of the suburbs\\" after a year of Trump. U.Va.'s Larry Sabato told me there's one explanation: \\"Donald Trump. He really is deeply unpopular in urban-suburban Virginia. Voter after voter wanted to send him a message, and said so. Of course, he won't listen, but the message was sent.\\" Gillespie lost women by 22 percentage points. He won men by 2 percentage points. Gillespie won whites by 15 percentage points, and still got crushed. Northam won by a 24 point margin among those who decided in last week. It looks like those racially tinged ads/moves backfired. And it wasn't just Northam: In what the Richmond Times-Dispatch called a \\"tsunami election,\\" Democrats erase a 32-seat GOP advantage in the House of Delegates, with recounts likely to determine control. Plus national history: \\"Virginia's most socially conservative state lawmaker was ousted from office ... by Danica Roem, a Democrat who will be one of the nation's first openly transgender elected officials and who embodies much of what Del. Robert G. Marshall fought against in Richmond.\\" (WashPost) A white mayor won by the largest margin in decades in predominantly black Detroit. The first African American Democratic woman was elected mayor of Charlotte. A Democrat will replace Chris Christie in New Jersey. A Democrat knocked off a GOP incumbent in New Hampshire's largest city to become Manchester's first female mayor. \\"Voters in Maine ... easily approved a referendum to expand Medicaid for low-income adults, doing an end-run around Republican Gov. Paul LePage, who vetoed the move — a key element of Obamacare.\\" (NPR) A big story that could get lost in the blizzard: Two more House Republicans — Rep. Frank LoBiondo of New Jersey and Rep. Ted Poe of Texas — announced their retirements, increasing chances Dems take the House a year from now. The takeaways: Top Republicans were stunned by the severity of the shellacking, and worry that it will endanger both tax reform and the House majority. ||||| Summary:","response":"Two long-time Republicans, Frank LoBiondo and Ted Poe, have decided to retire from the House of Representatives, adding to the growing list of Republicans choosing to leave under President Trump's administration.

He was the third of twelve children of Leva Mae (nee Stewart) and Charles \\"Bud\\" Penniman. His father was a church deacon who sold bootlegged moonshine on the side and owned a nightclub, the Tip In Inn. In October 1985, Little Richard returned to the United States from England, where he had finished recording his album Lifetime Friend, to film a guest spot on the show, Miami Vice. Following the taping, he accidentally crashed his sports car into a telephone pole in West Hollywood, California. He suffered a broken right leg, broken ribs and head and facial injuries. His recovery from the accident took several months. His accident prevented him from being able to attend the inaugural Rock and Roll Hall of Fame ceremony in January 1986 where he was one of several inductees. He instead supplied a recorded message. In 2007, Little Richard was having problems walking due to sciatica in his left leg, requiring him to use crutches. In November 2009, he entered a hospital to have replacement surgery on his left hip. Despite returning to performance the following year, Little Richard's problems with his hip continued and he has since been brought onstage by wheelchair. He has told fans that his surgery has his hip \\"breaking inside\\" and refuses to have further work on it. On September 30, 2013, he revealed to CeeLo Green at a Recording Academy fundraiser that he had suffered a heart attack at his home the week prior and stated he used aspirin and had his son turn the air conditioner on, which his doctor confirmed had saved his life. Little Richard stated, \\"Jesus had something for me. He brought me through\\". On April 28, 2016, Little Richard's friend, Bootsy Collins stated on his Facebook page that, \\"he is not in the best of health so I ask all the Funkateers to lift him up.\\" Reports subsequently began being published on the internet stating that Little Richard was in grave health and that his family were gathering at his bedside. On May 3, 2016, Rolling Stone reported that Little Richard and his lawyer provided a health information update in which Richard stated, \\"not only is my family not gathering around me because I'm ill, but I'm still singing. I don't perform like I used to, but I have my singing voice, I walk around, I had hip surgery a while ago but I'm healthy.'\\" His lawyer also reported: \\"He's 83. I don't know how many 83-year-olds still get up and rock it out every week, but in light of the rumors, I wanted to tell you that he's vivacious and conversant about a ton of different things and he's still very active in a daily routine. I used to represent Prince and he just engaged me in all kinds of Prince conversations, calling him a 'creative genius.'\\" Did he recover from the health problems he had?","response":"Little Richard faced multiple health problems throughout his life, including injuries from a car accident, sciatica, hip issues, and a heart attack. While he managed to recover from some of these challenges to an extent, certain health issues persisted. For example, his hip problems continued and required him to use a wheelchair to be brought on stage for performances. Although he was not in the best of health and his performances were not like they used to be, he maintained his singing voice and continued to engage in various activities. It is important to note that Little Richard passed away on May 9, 2020, but his health problems didn't completely hinder his ability to remain active and vibrant in his final years."},{"question":"Translate to Russian: Dongdan Kingdom Russian:","response":"Dongdan Kingdom in Russian would be \\"Королевство Донгдан\\".

On the other hand, Silvania, a southern country increased taxation hoping they would increase collection amounts. The problem was that Silvanian people increased taxation above the critical rate. and a hint : The Laffer curve depicts the amount of government revenue as a function of the rate of taxation. It shows that for a tax rate above a certain critical rate, government revenue starts decreasing as the tax rate rises, as a consequence of a decline in labour supply. This theory supports that, if the tax rate is above that critical point, a decrease in the tax rate should imply a rise in labour supply that in turn would lead to an increase in government revenue. Please answer this question : Which country experienced an increase in collection amounts?","response":"Based on the Laffer curve theory and the information provided, Hinland is the country that likely experienced an increase in collection amounts. The Laffer curve demonstrates that there exists a critical tax rate, above which the labor supply decreases, causing government revenue to decline. When tax rates are above the critical point, a reduction in tax rates stimulates the labor supply, resulting in increased government revenue. In the given situation, Hinland reduced taxation, which according to the Laffer curve, would mean more money for government spending if the country's previous tax rate was above the critical point. Assuming this to be true, Hinland's decision to lower tax rates led to an increase in labor supply and, therefore, an increase in government revenue. On the other hand, Silvania increased taxation above the critical rate, which, according to the Laffer curve, would likely result in a decline in labor supply and a decrease in overall government revenue. Silvanian people faced a higher tax burden, which could have disincentivized work and led to lower collection amounts compared to Hinland. In conclusion, Hinland is the country that most likely experienced an increase in collection amounts due to its decision to reduce taxation, while Silvania's choice to increase taxation above the critical rate may have led to a decrease in government revenue."},{"question":"Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: Garbage Review: This product is garbage.

Article:","response":"Title: \\"The Illusion of Infinite Growth: Royal Society Panel Sounds the Alarm\\" Introduction: A recent discussion by a panel of experts at the Royal Society has sparked a crucial debate on the long-held belief in perpetual economic growth. The panel has argued that unbridled economic expansion is unsustainable in the long run, posing significant challenges to both our environment and social structures. Step 1: Presenting the Argument To delve deeper into this argument, it's imperative first to understand the underlying assumption that economies must continually grow in order to progress and prosper. This notion, deeply ingrained in the minds of policymakers and business leaders alike, has been the driving force behind the global push for wealth creation and development over the past few decades. Step 2: The Environmental Consequences However, the implications of this relentless growth are particularly worrisome when it comes to the environment. As countries race against each other to raise their GDP (Gross Domestic Product) figures, this often leads to the exploitation and depletion of natural resources. The panel at the Royal Society was categorical in its assertion that unchecked growth poses a significant threat to our planet's ecosystems – an issue that transcends national boundaries and has a direct impact on the well-being of current and future generations. Step 3: The Social Repercussions Beyond the environmental impact, the panel also highlighted the social implications of endless economic growth. Wealth inequality and the marginalization of vulnerable communities are two critical concerns arising from a system focused solely on expanding the economy. The relentless pursuit of growth may have led to advances in our living standards, but the cracks in our social fabric are starting to show. Step 4: Challenging the Status Quo Given these pressing issues, the panel's message is an urgent call to reevaluate our understanding of progress and prosperity. Challenging the status quo, the panel posits that it is high time to explore alternative models of economic development that prioritize sustainability, environmental preservation, and social equity, rather than simply increasing GDP figures. Step 5: Offering Potential Solutions As nations grapple with the prospect of redefining progress, they need to consider creative approaches to address the economic and environmental challenges at hand. This may entail reshaping economic policies and business practices to prioritize long-term benefits over short-term gains. Broadening the focus to include circular economies, renewable energy sources, and resource-efficient technologies could be vital steps in building a more sustainable future for all. Conclusion: The Royal Society panel's remarks on the unsustainability of continuous economic growth serve as a stark reminder that the race for wealth and development must be tempered with considerations for our planet's well-being and the global community. The time has come to confront the challenges head-on and embrace alternative models of development that focus on creating a socially and environmentally sustainable future."},{"question":"Summarize this article: Labor said PM Tony Abbott's offer of a same-sex marriage plebiscite next year was nothing but a \\"delaying tactic\\". The attack comes as Mr Abbott faces criticism within his own ranks about how he has handled the issue. On Tuesday, he blocked a free vote for government MPs on any same-sex marriage bills but said the issue should be \\"put to the people\\" after the next election. Read more: 'Crocodile Dundee' MP leads Australia gay marriage push Labor leader Bill Shorten called on all Coalition MPs in favour of same-sex marriage to keep lobbying the prime minister. \\"The choice in this country is you either have Mr Abbott or you have marriage equality but you can't have both,\\" he told reporters on Wednesday. Mr Shorten has pledged to introduce same-sex marriage legislation within the first 100 days if Labor wins the next election, due in 2016. Mr Abbott, who personally opposes same-sex marriage, on Wednesday said under Liberal Party policy, any government frontbenchers who defied the agreed position to oppose gay marriage would be sacked. Backbench coalition MP Warren Entsch plans to introduce a cross-party bill next week to legalise same-sex marriage. Mr Entsch, who has campaigned publicly for marriage equality, told local media he believed some of his colleagues would cross the floor to vote in favour of his bill. \\"Absolutely I will be crossing the floor,\\" he said, \\"but even with some support I don't think the support is there to see it succeed\\". Analysis: Jon Donnison, BBC News, Sydney The gay marriage issue in Australia is an interesting one, not least because Tony Abbott, and indeed politicians in general, are out of touch with public opinion. Polls show the majority of Australians support same-sex marriage. And that's why it's a potentially dangerous issue for Mr Abbott who admits to feeling \\"a bit threatened\\" by homosexuality - even though his own sister Christine is a lesbian. And it's not just the public Tony Abbott is out of sync with. Some MPs within his own Liberal Party are in favour of legalising gay marriage. So if the prime minister continues to deny his parliamentary colleagues a free conscience vote on the issue, he risks alienating some within his own party. Is Abbott being refreshingly honest or out of touch? Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull, who supports same-sex marriage and a free vote on it by government MPs, said the issue would distract from debate about the economy and jobs ahead of next year's election. \\"The attraction of a free vote would have been that the matter would have been settled one way or another in this parliament,\\" Mr Turnbull told reporters on Wednesday. He said Mr Abbott's offer to hold a plebiscite meant same-sex marriage was now \\"a live issue all the way up to the next election\\". Mr Abbott's sister Christine Forster, a Liberal local councillor in Sydney, agreed with this assessment. Ms Forster, who is a lesbian and has publically supported same-sex marriage, told the BBC that she found her brother's decision \\"personally very disappointing\\" and hoped that the party would review its position soon. But she added: \\"We both respect each other's views... and that reflects Australian society as a whole, there are a range of views on this issue.\\" The Labor Party has also faced internal debate about the matter. At a party conference in July, Mr Shorten convinced his colleagues not to adopt a binding vote on same-sex marriage. Labor deputy Tanya Plibersek had unsuccessfully lobbied her colleagues to amend the Labor platform so that MPs would be forced to vote in favour of same-sex marriage in parliament. Summary:","response":"Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott has faced criticism within his own ranks about his handling of the same-sex marriage issue. Earlier this week, he blocked a free vote for government MPs on same-sex marriage bills, but said that the issue should be \\"put to the people\\" after the next election. This sparked opposition from Labor leader Bill Shorten, who accused Abbott of using delaying tactics and who has pledged to introduce same-sex marriage legislation within the first 100 days if Labor wins the next election, due in 2016. Meanwhile, polls indicate that the majority of Australians support same-sex marriage, suggesting that Tony Abbott may be out of touch with public opinion and risking conflict within his own party."},{"question":"First question: What are the odds of winning UK lottery?

Choices: (a). no (b). yes","response":"To answer these questions, I would need to determine the odds of winning the UK lottery as well as understand the other form of lottery being referred to. Since no information has been provided about the second lottery, I will focus on the UK lottery first. Step 1: Research UK lottery rules I will search for information on the UK lottery to understand its structure (e.g., number of balls drawn, range of numbers). Based on my research, the UK lottery (Lotto) involves selecting 6 numbers from a pool of 59. To win the jackpot, a player must match all 6 numbers. Step 2: Calculate odds of winning the UK lottery To determine the odds of winning the UK lottery, I will use the formula for combinations (nCr), which is the number of possible combinations of 6 numbers that can be chosen from a pool of 59: nCr = n! / (r!(n-r)!) where n is the total number of options available (59), r is the number of items being chosen (6), and ! denotes factorial. The odds of winning the UK lottery (Lotto) are: 59! / (6!(59-6)!) = 45,057,474 Therefore, the odds of winning the UK lottery are 1 in 45,057,474. To answer the second question, I need more information about the specifics of the other form of the lottery. Are these two questions asking the same thing?

His books on economic topics were bestsellers from the 1950s through the 2000s, during which time Galbraith fulfilled the role of public intellectual. As an economist, he leaned toward post-Keynesian economics from an institutionalist perspective. Galbraith was a long-time Harvard faculty member and stayed with Harvard University for half a century as a professor of economics. Context: In February 1946, Galbraith took a leave of absence from his magazine work for a senior position in the State Department as director of the Office of Economic Security Policy where he was nominally in charge of economic affairs regarding Germany, Japan, Austria, and South Korea. He was distrusted by the senior diplomats so he was relegated to routine work with few opportunities to make policy. Galbraith favored detente with the Soviet Union, along with Secretary of State James F. Byrnes and General Lucius D. Clay, a military governor of the US Zone in Germany from 1947 to 1949, but they were out of step with the containment policy then being developed by George Kennan and favored by the majority of the US major policymakers. After a disconcerting half-year, Galbraith resigned in September 1946 and went back to his magazine writing on economics issues. Later, he immortalized his frustration with \\"the ways of Foggy Bottom\\" in a satirical novel, The Triumph (1968). The postwar period also was memorable for Galbraith because of his work, along with Eleanor Roosevelt and Hubert Humphrey, to establish a progressive policy organization Americans for Democratic Action (ADA) in support of the cause of economic and social justice in 1947. During his time as an adviser to President John F. Kennedy, Galbraith was appointed United States Ambassador to India from 1961 to 1963. His rapport with President Kennedy was such that he regularly bypassed the State Department and sent his diplomatic cables directly to the president. In India, he became a confidant of Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and extensively advised the Indian government on economic matters. In 1966, when he was no longer ambassador, he told the United States Senate that one of the main causes of the 1965 Kashmir war was American military aid to Pakistan. While in India, he helped establish one of the first computer science departments, at the Indian Institute of Technology in Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh. Even after leaving office, Galbraith remained a friend and supporter of India. Because of his recommendation, First Lady of the United States Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy undertook her 1962 diplomatic missions in India and Pakistan. In autumn 1972 Galbraith was an adviser and assistant to Nixon's rival candidate George McGovern in the election campaign for the American presidency. During this time (September 1972) he travelled in to China in his role as president of the American Economic Association (AEA) at the invitation of Mao Zedong's communist government with the economists Leontief and Tobin and in 1973 published an account of his experiences in A China Passage. Galbraith wrote that there was \\"no serious doubt that China is devising a highly effective economic system,\\" \\"[d]issidents are brought firmly into line in China, but, one suspects, with great politeness,\\" \\"Greater Shanghai ... has a better medical service than New York,\\" and considered it not implausible that Chinese industrial and agricultural output was expanding annually at a rate of 10 to 11%. Question: What was the high point of his career? Answer:","response":"The high point of John Kenneth Galbraith's career was likely his tenure as the United States Ambassador to India from 1961 to 1963 during President John F. Kennedy's administration. During this time, Galbraith not only became a close confidant of Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and advised the Indian government on economic matters, but he also established a strong rapport with President Kennedy, allowing him to bypass the State Department and communicate directly with the president. His influence and connections during this period, as well as his role in helping set up one of the first computer science departments in India, showcase the peak of his career as a public intellectual and influential economist."},{"question":"Given those answer options, answer the question: You are presented with the quiz \\"What could be used to to measure how many milliliters something is?\\" But you don't know the answer, so you turn to your teacher to ask for hints.

The premise is that a bearded man is taking photographs with a camera and a long lens. The hypothesis is that a woman is looking at a magazine. Step 2: Analyze the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. The premise provides information about a bearded man's action of taking photographs. The hypothesis informs us about a woman's action of looking at a magazine. Both statements describe the actions of two different individuals who do not seem to have any direct relationship to each other based on the given information. Step 3: Evaluate if the premise supports the hypothesis. Since the premise and hypothesis discuss the actions of two different individuals with no clear connection, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis is true based on the premise. The actions of the bearded man taking photographs do not provide any evidence or support for the claim that a woman is looking at a magazine.

(AAP) Online whistle-blowing organisation WikiLeaks has released more than 2000 emails sent by the chairman of Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. Less than a week after founder Julian Assange warned it was going to release emails related to the US election, WikiLeaks has followed up on the threat. The enormous data dump focuses on John Podesta, head of Clinton’s campaign, who also served as President Bill Clinton’s Chief of Staff from 1998 to 2001. The emails appear to date back to 2008 and cover a wide range of topics. Some of the emails include relatively average subject lines such as ‘Clinton’s Chipotle Order’ and ‘Call with HRC’ but also more inflammatory ones, including ‘My position on the Iran deal’ – sent to Mr Podesta from former congress candidate Nancy Rotering. Mr Podesta takes aim at CNN’s chief Washington correspondent Jake Tapper in an email sent in June 2015. “Why is Jake Tapper such a d**k?” he wrote. Mr Tapper took to Twitter to humorously respond to the jab. “It’s a question that has confounded millions of people for hundreds of years,” he posted alongside a screengrab of the original correspondence.

The new rules extend existing anti-smoking regulations to more places, including fitness centers, cultural relic sites, offices, meeting rooms, dining halls, toilets and lifts. Restaurants, Internet cafes, parks, and waiting halls at airports, railway stations and coach stations are required to set up smoking areas. Hotels will have to offer smoke-free rooms or floors, but the regulations do not specify a proportion. However, some restaurant owners have complained that it would be difficult to have a separate smoking room as required by the new regulations. \\"We plan to issue specific rules to solve this problem as soon as possible,\\" Rao Yingsheng, vice-director of the Beijing Committee for Patriotic Public Health Campaign, was quoted by the Beijing News as saying Thursday. He said small restaurants without a separate room should set aside at least 70 percent of their area for non-smokers. He also said customers and restaurant owners would be asked for their thoughts on the new rule. Local authorities dispatched about 100,000 inspectors to make sure the ban was being enforced Thursday.

Choices: - stopping - stimulation - vibration - acceleration A: Answer:","response":"Deceleration is the opposite of acceleration. To provide a detailed answer, let us first discuss the concepts of velocity, acceleration, and deceleration in the context of motion. Velocity is defined as the rate of change of position concerning time. In simpler terms, it is essentially the speed and direction of an object's motion. Velocity is a vector quantity, which means it has both magnitude (the speed) and direction. For example, a car moving at 60 miles per hour due north has a velocity of both a specific speed and direction. Acceleration, on the other hand, is the rate at which velocity changes over time. It is also a vector quantity, having both magnitude and direction. When an object's velocity increases, it is said to be accelerating. Acceleration can occur in one of two ways: either an increase in the object's speed or a change in the direction of its motion (or both). For example, a car speeding up from 40 miles per hour to 60 miles per hour is experiencing acceleration, as well as a car turning at a constant speed. Now, let's discuss deceleration. Deceleration, simply put, is the opposite of acceleration. It is the rate at which an object's velocity decreases over time. Deceleration is also a vector quantity, like velocity and acceleration, and involves both magnitude and direction. When an object's velocity decreases, it is said to be decelerating. Deceleration can be caused either by a decrease in speed or a change in direction opposite to the object's motion (or both). For example, a car slowing down from 60 miles per hour to 40 miles per hour is decelerating, as well as a car turning in the opposite direction of its motion. To clarify the given choices: 1. Stopping refers to an object coming to a complete halt or having zero velocity. 2. Stimulation relates to an increase or enhancement of activity, typically in biological or psychological contexts, and is not related to motion or velocity. 3. Vibration is a mechanical phenomenon wherein an object oscillates (moves back and forth) around an equilibrium point, typically due to an external force. None of these choices are directly opposite to deceleration. Therefore, the answer is acceleration, which is the correct opposite concept in the context of motion, as acceleration refers to an increase in velocity, while deceleration refers to a decrease in velocity over time."},{"question":"Article: Colonial records of French and Spanish slave ships and sales, and plantation records in all the former colonies, often have much more information about slaves, from which researchers are reconstructing slave family histories.

The concept of density combines what we know about an objects mass and volume. Density reflects how closely packed the particles of matter are. When particles are packed together more tightly, matter is more dense. Differences in density of matter explain many phenomena. It explains why helium balloons rise. It explains why currents such as the Gulf Stream flow through the oceans. It explains why some things float in or sink. You can see this in action by pouring vegetable oil into water. You can see a colorful demonstration in this video. Question: \\"How can I observe the role density plays?\\" Answer: \\"Watching rocks\\" Is this answer correct?","response":"Yes, the answer is correct but let me explain it in a simpler way for a five-year-old. Density is how squished together or how much space the little pieces (particles) inside an object take up. If the particles are really close together, the object is more dense. Density can help explain why some things float and others sink in water. Now to answer your question about observing the role of density, imagine you have a light, fluffy sponge and a heavy rock. If you put them both in water, the fluffy sponge will float because it has less dense particles, while the heavy rock will sink because it has more dense particles.

In late March or early April he appeared before a local magistrate in the district, Captain G. V. Butler, who committed him for trial. In May, Butler wrote a letter to Charles Hervey Bagot, a member of the South Australian Legislative Council, in which he listed the victims as one \\"old man blind and infirm\\", three female adults, two teenage girls (aged 15 and 12 years), and three female children (aged two years, 18 months, and a baby). Butler added that there was \\"little question of the butchery or the butcher\\".Brown's trial came before the Supreme Court in Adelaide on 11 June 1849. The presiding judge considered that the evidence presented was insufficient, and gave the prosecution another week to investigate. The weakness of the case was directly related to the provisions of the Aboriginal Witnesses Act of 1848 regarding testimony given by Aboriginal witnesses. It was generally believed that Aboriginal people could not understand the oath, but the Act allowed unsworn testimony to be offered by Aboriginal witnesses, with two significant limitations. The court could determine the weight and credibility to be given to Aboriginal testimony, but even more telling was the restriction that when the punishment for a crime was death or transportation, the evidence of an \\"uncivilised person or persons\\" was considered insufficient unless corroborated by other evidence. A week later, the judge remained unconvinced about the strength of the prosecution, but given \\"great suspicion rested on the case\\", he gave the prosecution a further extension of time, and released Brown on bail of ₤500.In July 1849, the South Australian Advocate General produced a summary of the investigation to date. Several difficulties were detailed, including the fact that Parker denied any knowledge of the crime, as did others who were believed to have heard the incident, discussed in Brown's presence.

It comes just a day after another video showed a child aged around 14 apparently carrying out a suicide bombing in the Iraqi province of Salahuddin. A previous video showed a young boy who Isis claimed took part in a suicide bombing And while the apparent execution could not be independently verified, experts suggested that the increased use of children in the atrocities it films represented “a departure from past norms”, even by Isis standards. The new video is entitled “Uncovering an enemy within”, and has been published by the branch of Isis which specialises in making propaganda videos for an international audience. Including captions in Arabic and English, it claims the two men are “FSB agents”, offered money to “gather information about fighters and send the information to Russia”. After they are shown “confessing” to the camera, a separate part of the video shows the two men on their knees in the desert before a militant and a boy who can be no more than 10 years old. The militant says the men are now “in the custody of the lion cubs of the caliphate”, before the child steps forward and appears to shoot the men. The same child has appeared in previous Isis videos, and also features in a clip at the end of the most recent video that appears to have been shot some time earlier. Charlie Winter, a researcher for the anti-extremism thinktank Quilliam, said: “Whether it is real or staged, [Isis] used a young child in this video for the shock factor, and the shock factor alone. “Its propagandists have done it before – showing images of children training as soldiers and being kicked in the stomach in martial arts drills – but this latest video marks a departure from past norms.” The video comes amid increased speculation over the blurring of lines between disparate militant groups like Isis and al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), particularly in the wake of the Paris shootings. And while many social media users speculated as to whether the apparent execution was genuine, Isis supporters shared it as a warning to “you who sent spies”. One Isis-affiliated account under the name Abu Marthad al-Muhajir tweeted: “This is not al-Qaeda, this is the Islamic State, O you filthy stupid Marxists of Russia. This is your destiny.” ||||| LONDON -- A video released Tuesday by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) shows the apparent execution of two men, accused of being spies for Russia, at the hands of a young boy. The seven-and-a-half-minute long video was released by ISIS' multi-lingual production wing, al-Hayat, and begins with long television news-style interviews with both men, who confess to being spies against ISIS and working in both Syria and Turkey. The men, who speak Russian in the interviews, are identified by name as agents of Russia's premier spy agency, the FSB. One of them tells the interviewer he was under orders to try and assassinate an ISIS leader, but the name of the ISIS figure in question is edited out of the video. After what appears to be a scripted warning to others \\"who want to come here and spy\\" to \\"repent to Allah now before it's too late,\\" the setting in the video changes to an outdoor location where the men are seen kneeling with their backs to a bearded militant whom CBS News could not identify and a boy, who appeared to be less than 15 years old. Both the adult jihadist and the boy appear to be of Asian descent. The man recites Quranic verse before saying: \\"Allah has gifted the Islamic State's security agency with the apprehension of these two spies.\\" He says the men are \\"now in the custody of the lion cubs of Khilafah,\\" before prompting the boy to go ahead with the apparent execution with a pat on the shoulder. The video, which is heavily edited and includes English subtitles throughout, then appears to show the boy shoot both men in the back of the head. No blood can be seen on the bodies in the final shots of the purported execution sequence, and the video then transitions to a clip from an older video, released in Nov. 2014, in which the same boy is seen expressing aspirations to one day become a \\"mujahid.\\" The older video shows the boy with other purported newcomers to ISIS territory, including many women and other children. The November video includes images from an ISIS religious school, where kids as young as six or seven are seen being groomed to become future militants for the group. CBS News cannot independently verify the authenticity of the video released by ISIS, nor the identity of the men seen in it. CBS News was seeking comment from officials in Moscow. In the meantime, Russian news agency RIA Novosti said a representative of the FSB told them it \\"does not comment on the publication of the video executions allegedly of their agents by the members of the 'Islamic state.'\\" ISIS has executed scores of people in territory seized on both sides of the Iraq-Syria border, including American and European journalists and aid workers, rival militia members and soldiers from both nations' armies. ||||| What is a summary?","response":"A summary is a short and simple explanation that gives the main points or ideas of something, like a story, article, or event, in a way that is easy to understand.

A: pick from the following. -theory; -hypothesis; -scientific controls; -scientific method; A:","response":"The set of steps that help us answer questions in science can be described as the \\"scientific method.\\" The scientific method is a systematic and logical approach to problem-solving that involves observing, questioning, forming and testing hypotheses, and drawing conclusions based on empirical evidence. This method serves as the foundation of modern scientific inquiry and ensures that results are reliable, reproducible, and rigorously tested. Let's delve into the different components of the scientific method and understand how each step contributes to answering scientific questions. 1. Observation: The scientific process begins with careful observation. Researchers first notice a phenomenon or event and record these observations either quantitatively (with numbers) or qualitatively (in words). Observations can be made through direct experience, examination of data from previous studies, or review of pertinent literature. 2. Questioning: Based on the observations, scientists develop questions that seek to find explanations for the phenomenon or event. Questions should be specific, testable, and based on the available information. 3. Background research: To adequately address the question, researchers review existing literature, studies, and expert opinions to better understand the subject and refine their question or hypothesis. This research helps to ensure that their study is based on the latest knowledge and offers new insights into the problem. 4. Formulating hypotheses: A hypothesis serves as a tentative, testable explanation for the observed phenomenon. It is an educated guess, based on the available evidence and background research. A properly formulated hypothesis should be clear, concise, and falsifiable, meaning it must be possible to disprove it with empirical evidence. 5. Designing experiments: To test the hypothesis, researchers design experiments or studies that control for variables and manipulate conditions to observe the effects on the phenomenon. Careful experimental design is crucial to produce meaningful and interpretable results, accounting for potential confounding factors and sources of error. 6. Conducting experiments: Researchers carry out the experiments they have designed, carefully controlling empirical conditions and collecting data. This step involves repeating trials, ensuring adequate sample sizes, and using appropriate techniques to reduce the impact of bias or random error on results. 7. Analyzing data: Once the data is collected, researchers use statistical analysis to determine the significance of their findings and evaluate the support for their hypothesis. Depending on the nature of the data, various tests and methods can be employed to determine relationships, correlations, and causation between variables. 8. Drawing conclusions: After analyzing the data, scientists draw conclusions about whether the results support or refute the hypothesis. This step allows researchers to objectively evaluate their findings and determines if any adjustments or additional experiments are needed. 9. Communicating results: The final step of the scientific method involves sharing research findings with the scientific community. Researchers often publish their studies in peer-reviewed journals, ensuring that the study has been subjected to rigorous evaluation by other experts in the field. This process allows for further discussion, scrutiny, and improvement of the study and promotes the advancement of scientific knowledge. The scientific method thus provides researchers with a structured and thorough approach to answering questions, enhancing our understanding of the world and informing evidence-based decision-making. By following these steps, scientists can minimize sources of bias and error, ensuring the reliability and reproducibility of their results and fostering trust in the scientific process."},{"question":"Review: both sitcomishly predictable and cloying in its attempts Is this movie review sentence negative or positive?","response":"Step 1: Identify the adjectives and phrases that convey sentiment in the sentence. - \\"sitcomishly predictable\\" - \\"cloying in its attempts\\" Step 2: Determine the sentiment of each identified part. - \\"sitcomishly predictable\\" conveys a negative sentiment, as it implies the movie is predictable like a sitcom and lacks originality. - \\"cloying in its attempts\\" also conveys a negative sentiment, as \\"cloying\\" means excessively sweet or sentimental, suggesting the movie is trying too hard.

Now, the biggest social network wants to resurrect them – on your phone. Facebook said Thursday it is launching a standalone smartphone app called “Rooms,” a nostalgic throwback to Internet 1.0, updated for the mobile Web. The app is like an infinitely large house where users can create rooms for specific purposes, like discussing current events, planning exotic vacations or breeding yorkipoos. The posts, which can include photos or videos, appear in chronological order. Like Internet message boards, all posts in Rooms are public. But the creator of a room may limit who can contribute posts. Contributors can use pseudonyms. Rooms is the latest entry in Facebook’s strategy of building standalone apps independent of the social network itself. This year, it launched the news aggregator Paper, a photo-sharing product called Slingshot and a video-capture app called Hyperlapse. Rooms stands out because it encourages users to create longer-lasting content and participate in conversations. Some rooms may be silly or frivolous, but the app could become a place to discuss current events and breaking news. Every post in Rooms is tagged with a Web address, or URL, making it visible to search engines like Google . That’s an important feature because it links the mobile app to the desktop Web, opening the app’s contents to searches from personal computers. A room’s creator can turn off the web links and search features, making the room more private. But anyone who knows the location of the room can still visit it. Rooms was designed by Josh Miller, a 24-year-old Princeton dropout who co-founded the online-discussion site Branch and sold it to Facebook in January. Branch still operates. Miller said he met frequently with Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg while honing the concept of Rooms. Despite Zuckerberg’s involvement, Miller stressed that the app is separate from Facebook. It won’t offer users suggestions on which rooms to join based on their Facebook friends. It doesn’t use the phone’s address book to build a network. It can’t share content with Facebook. Miller said he wants people to interact with people outside their social network. “We’re risking our growth,” Miller said, because the app won’t take advantage of Facebook’s massive audience of 1.3 billion regular users. A Facebook spokesman said Facebook does not identify the devices that use Rooms, so it won’t know whether a Rooms user is a Facebook user or who they are. But he said Facebook might consider doing so in the future to better understand who is using the app. That would allow Facebook to know the real name of Rooms participant using a pseudonym, for example, but the spokesman said Facebook would never share a user’s identity. To build Rooms, Miller said he turned himself into a historian of the Internet, calling the creators of popular Internet message boards to ask how they attracted participants. He researched ways to block “flamers,” or people who post offensive or off-topic content in a room. Miller also wanted to give users the ability to control the look and feel of their chat rooms, something that’s not common in mobile apps. People who create rooms can choose any background color and post customized images. Invitations to join a room use QR codes. People who follow the room can send the code to others. They can also print the invite, allowing anyone who scans the code with a phone camera to join the room. ______________________________________________________ For the latest news and analysis, follow @wsjd Get breaking news and personal-tech reviews delivered right to your inbox.

As the troops who engage with the enemy in close-ranged combat, infantry units bear the largest brunt of warfare and typically suffer the greatest number of casualties during a military campaign. Historically, as the oldest branch of the combat arms, the infantry are the tip of the spear of a modern army, and continually undergo training that is typically more physically demanding and psychologically stressful than that of any other branch of the combat arms. Common representations of infantry fighting forces include the U.S. Army Infantry Branch, U.S. Marine Corps Infantry, Royal Canadian Infantry Corps, Infantry of the British Army, and the Royal Australian Corps of Infantry. - The Silver Star, officially the Silver Star Medal, is the United States military's third-highest decoration for valor in combat.

From the time of its inception, the military played a decisive role in the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even so, the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played an important role in the American Civil War, where leading generals on both sides were picked from members of the United States military. Not until the outbreak of World War II did a large standing army become officially established. The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War II and during the Cold War's onset, created the modern U.S. military framework; the Act merged previously Cabinet-level Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the Department of the Air Force and National Security Council. - A soldier is one who fights as part of an organised, land-based armed force.

You can find fresh peas in the produce section, canned peas in the canned goods section, and frozen peas in the freezer aisle. 2. Fridge: Your fridge is not the ideal place to buy peas unless you've already purchased them and stored them there. The fridge is suitable for storing fresh peas that you've already bought from a grocery store, supermarket, or farmer's market. 3. Grocery Store: A local grocery store is another excellent option for buying peas, similar to supermarkets. They should have fresh, canned, and frozen peas available in the respective sections (produce, canned goods, and freezer aisle). 4. Farmer's Market: This is a great place to find fresh, locally-grown peas. Farmer's markets usually have a selection of seasonal fruits and vegetables, and if peas are in season, you'll likely find them here. This option supports local farmers and ensures you get fresh and high-quality produce. 5. Freezer: Similar to the fridge, the freezer is not a place to buy peas; it's where you store them. Frozen peas can be purchased from a grocery store or supermarket and then stored in your freezer at home. In summary, the best options to shop for peas locally are at the supermarket, grocery store, or farmer's market, depending on your personal preferences and the availability of fresh or frozen peas.

VIDEO Scroll down to watch Koeman discuss potential Saints transfers Exit: Southampton forward Dani Osvaldo looks set for a move away from St Mary's this summer No bids: Dejan Lovren has told","response":"Southampton he wants to leave the club, but they have not received any formal offers yet Southampton manager Ronald Koeman has made it clear that the club is ready to part ways with their record signing, Dani Osvaldo, as the Italian striker failed to return for pre-season training. The 28-year-old's future at St Mary's has been in question ever since his training-ground altercation with teammate Jose Fonte last year, which led to him being loaned out to Juventus for the remainder of the season. Koeman has now confirmed that the striker's time at the club is coming to an end, citing the difficulty of Osvaldo reintegrating into the team after the incident. Speaking to BBC Radio Solent, he said: \\"It was a difficult situation for him to come back to. He had problems with some players, and that's not good for the rest of the season or for our team spirit.\\" Osvaldo, who cost Southampton a hefty £15 million in August 2013 from AS Roma, has long been rumored to be on the way out, with clubs from both the Premier League and Serie A reportedly interested in acquiring his services. Having scored just three goals in 13 appearances for the Saints, his time in England has been disappointing, which could make the club willing to accept a reduced fee for his transfer. In other transfer news, Southampton's Croatian center-back Dejan Lovren has reportedly told the club he wants to leave this summer. The 24-year-old has been linked with moves to several top-flight clubs, including Liverpool and Tottenham, and is now said to be keen on taking up a new challenge. However, there have yet to be any formal bids for the player, leading some to speculate that Southampton may be reluctant to part ways with their star defender, who has been crucial to the team's impressive defensive record last season. Southampton, who finished eighth in the Premier League last season, have already seen several high-profile departures this summer, with striker Rickie Lambert and midfielder Adam Lallana both joining Liverpool, and promising left-back Luke Shaw signing for Manchester United. These significant losses will undoubtedly leave the club with a significant rebuilding task on their hands, and the exit of both Osvaldo and Lovren could exacerbate their problems further. As the transfer window continues, Koeman and Southampton will need to work quickly and wisely to replace the key players they are losing, as well as strengthening other areas of the squad should they wish to have a successful 2014-2015 campaign. The challenge will be to ensure that the replacements brought in are not only capable of filling the boots of their high-profile predecessors, but also contributing to the team's overall success."},{"question":"Question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What people usually have a library and museum as their largest commemorative memorials? Funerary art tends to be conservative in style, and many grave markers in various cultures follow rather traditional patterns, while others reflect modernism or other recent styles. Public monuments representing collective memorials to particular groups of dead people continue to be erected, especially war memorials, and in the Western world have now replaced individual or family memorials as the dominant types of very large memorials; Western political leaders now usually receive simple graves. Some large memorials are fairly traditional, while those reflecting more contemporary styles include the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, and several Holocaust memorials, such as Yad Vashem in Jerusalem, the Vel d'Hiv Memorial in Paris (1994), the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe in Berlin (2004), and the Judenplatz Holocaust Memorial in Vienna (2000). These are in notable contrast to the style of most war memorials to the military of World War II; earlier modernist memorials to the dead of World War I were sometimes removed after a time as inappropriate. Some war memorials, especially in countries like Germany, have had a turbulent political history, for example the much-rededicated Neue Wache in Berlin and the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo, which is internationally controversial.Several critics detect a crisis in public memorial style from 1945, when the traditional figurative symbolic language, and evocation of nationalist values, came to seem inadequate, especially in relation to genocide, at least on the Western side of the Iron Curtain. In the Communist East the established style of Socialist Realism was still considered appropriate, at least by the authorities. The generation of abstracted and conceptual war and Holocaust memorials erected in the West from the 1990s onwards seems finally to have found a resolution for these issues.Many large mausoleums have been constructed for political leaders, including Lenin's Mausoleum and those for Atatürk, Jinnah, Kim Il-Sung, Che Guevara and several Presidential...

Different countries and conflicts have varying timelines between the cessation of war and the commencement of democratic processes. To gain a more comprehensive understanding, this article will examine several historical examples, highlighting the factors that influence the time taken for elections to occur post-conflict. World War II At the end of World War II in 1945, Europe embarked on a path of recovery and the re-establishment of democratic processes. The timing of post-war elections varied greatly among European countries. For instance, France held its first post-war elections in October 1945, just a few months after the war's end, while Germany took around a whole decade before its Federal Elections took place in 1949. The period required to hold elections significantly depended on factors such as the level of devastation in the country, the presence of occupying forces, political wrangling, and the need to draft and ratify new constitutions. African Conflicts Africa has seen its fair share of wars and conflicts, with several countries transitioning to peace and democracy in different timelines. For instance, Rwanda underwent a genocide in 1994, and it took approximately eight years for elections to be held in 2003. In Angola, after a long and bloody civil war which lasted from 1975 to 2002, it took five years for national elections to take place in 2008. Similarly, Liberia experienced over a decade of civil war (1989-2003) before the first post-war elections took place in 2005, two years after the end of hostilities. The delay was attributed to the need for disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration of former combatants, as well as drafting and ratifying a new constitution. Latin America In Central and South America, the timelines between the conclusion of armed conflicts and elections also vary widely. In El Salvador, which experienced a 12-year civil war from 1980 to 1992, the first post-war elections were held in 1994, just two years after the signing of the peace accords. Similarly, Nicaragua's general elections took place in 1990, one year after the effective end of the Contra War in 1989. On the other hand, Guatemala's 36-year-long civil war (1960-1996) concluded with peace accords in 1996, and the first post-conflict elections occurred relatively quickly in 1999. The difference in the timeline between war and elections in Guatemala compared to El Salvador or Nicaragua is mainly attributed to the pre-war electoral process, which was not entirely interrupted during the conflict. Asian Conflicts In Asia, the time gap between war and elections has been variable as well. Afghanistan experienced multiple conflicts, beginning with the Soviet invasion in 1979, followed by a civil war, and later a US-led invasion in 2001. In 2004, almost three years after the US invasion, Afghanistan held its first democratic elections. In contrast, Sri Lanka had a protracted civil war (1983-2009) against Tamil insurgents. The first post-war elections took place in 2010, just a year after the end of the conflict. However, it is important to note that elections were held regularly during the war in the regions not controlled by the insurgents. Conclusion The years between the end of a war and the holding of elections highly depend on the specific context of every conflict and country. Factors such as the extent of devastation, the need for restructuring and reshaping political and social institutions, drafting and ratifying new constitutions, and the facilitation of the international community play significant roles in determining how long it takes for democratic processes to resume after a war. A comprehensive analysis of various cases from Europe, Africa, Latin America, and Asia illustrates that the time taken for post-war elections can be as short as one year or as long as a decade. Therefore, it is critical to understand and consider the particular circumstances of each conflict to provide a more accurate answer to the question of how many years pass between the end of a war and the holding of elections."},{"question":"Problem: Solve 2266 = 278*l + 2087 - 3991 for l.

So, you need to add 2087 and then subtract 3991: 2087 - 3991 = -1904 4. Now, substitute this value back into the equation: 2266 = 278*l - 1904 5. Next, we need to get the 'l' all by itself. So, let's add 1904 to both sides of the equation: 2266 + 1904 = 278*l 4170 = 278*l 6. Now, we just need to find out what number 'l' is by dividing 4170 by 278: 4170 ÷ 278 = 15 So, the answer to the problem is: l = 15."},{"question":"Combine facts and answer this: In what year was the British explorer that is a descendent of the 16th Baron Saye and Sele born?

This is the correct answer because the story is about President Barack Obama and his administration's decisions regarding military commitments and troop withdrawals in foreign countries, specifically Iraq. Afghanistan is another foreign country where the U.S. has had a military presence. The other options are incorrect for various reasons: - America, Atlanta, and Georgia: These locations are all within the United States and are not relevant to the context of foreign military commitments. - American, Barack Obama, CNN, Disabled American Veterans, Obama, and U.S.: These are not separate locations and are either entities or a reference to the United States, making them irrelevant options. - Disabled American Veterans: This organization is mentioned in the story, but its focus is on supporting veterans and not directly related to military commitment decisions. - Iraq and Iraqi: This story is focused on the drawdown of troops from Iraq, not increasing the military commitment there. - Pakistan: Though a neighboring country, it is not mentioned anywhere in the story and is not relevant to the context of the issue being discussed."},{"question":"Please answer the following question about this movie plot. If it's un-answerable, please output \\"No answer\\". Question: Who is the last man loyal to Antony? Movie plot title: Cleopatra Movie plot: Claudette Colbert in Cleopatra In 48 BC, Cleopatra vies with her brother Ptolemy for control of Egypt. Pothinos (Leonard Mudie) kidnaps her and Apollodorus (Irving Pichel) and strands them in the desert. When Pothinos informs Julius Caesar that the queen has fled the country, Caesar is ready to sign an agreement with Ptolemy when Apollodorus appears, bearing a gift carpet for the Roman. When Apollodorus unrolls it, Cleopatra emerges much to Pothinos' surprise- he tries to deny who she is. However Caesar sees through the deception and Cleopatra soon beguiles Caesar with the prospect of the riches of not only Egypt, but also India. Later, when they are seemingly alone, she spots a sandal peeking out from underneath a curtain and thrusts a spear into the hidden Pothinos, foiling his assassination attempt. Caesar makes Cleopatra the sole ruler of Egypt, and begins an affair with her. Caesar eventually returns to Rome with Cleopatra to the cheers of the masses, but Roman unease is directed at Cleopatra. Cassius (Ian Maclaren), Casca (Edwin Maxwell), Brutus (Arthur Hohl) and other powerful Romans become disgruntled, rightly suspecting that he intends to abolish the Roman Republic and make himself emperor, with Cleopatra as his empress (after divorcing Calpurnia, played by Gertrude Michael). Ignoring the forebodings of Calpurnia, Cleopatra, and a soothsayer (Harry Beresford) who warns him about the Ides of March, Caesar goes to announce his intentions to the Senate. Before he can do so, he is assassinated. Cleopatra is heartbroken at the news. At first, she wants to go to him, but Apollodorus tells her that Caesar did not love her, only her power and wealth, and that Egypt needs her. They return home. Bitter rivals Marc Antony and Octavian (Ian Keith) are named co-rulers of Rome. Antony, disdainful of women, invites Cleopatra to meet with him in Tarsus, intending to bring her back to Rome as a captive. Enobarbus (C. Aubrey Smith), his close friend, warns Antony against meeting Cleopatra but he goes anyway. She... Answer:","response":"Enobarbus (C. Aubrey Smith)"},{"question":"Do professional poker have day jobs? How can you prepare for your first pap smear test? Please tell me if those questions are the same.","response":"The questions you have asked are not the same and pertain to different topics. I'll provide a detailed answer for each question separately. 1. Do professional poker players have day jobs? Professional poker players may or may not have day jobs, depending on their level of success, financial security, and personal preferences. For some poker players, the game itself is their primary source of income. These players invest a substantial amount of time and effort into honing their skills, analyzing opponents, and participating in high-stakes games and tournaments. They often find it challenging to maintain a day job alongside such commitments. However, many professional poker players do have day jobs, especially in the initial stages of their careers when they are still building their bankroll and gaining experience. These players typically have part-time or full-time jobs in various fields, which serve as a primary source of income and provide financial stability while they perfect their poker skills. Some players continue to work part-time even after achieving notable success in their poker careers, just to maintain steady income and a sense of balance in their lives. 2. How can you prepare for your first pap smear test? A Pap smear test, also known as a Pap test or cervical smear, is a routine medical examination that checks for any cellular changes in the cervix that could potentially indicate conditions such as cervical cancer. To prepare for your first Pap smear test, consider the following steps: a. Schedule your appointment: Schedule the test when you are not on your period. Ideally, it should be planned two weeks after the first day of your last menstrual cycle. Avoid scheduling during your period, as the presence of blood may interfere with the results. b. Avoid intercourse and vaginal products: For 24 to 48 hours before the test, abstain from sexual intercourse, using tampons, and applying vaginal creams or other products. These can affect the results of your test or cause discomfort during the examination. c. Prepare mentally: It is normal to feel nervous or anxious before your first Pap test. Research the procedure, understand its purpose, and be aware of what will happen during the examination. This can help you feel more comfortable and prepared. If you have concerns or questions, do not hesitate to discuss them with your healthcare provider. d. Dress comfortably: Wear comfortable, easy-to-remove clothing for the appointment. You will likely need to undress from the waist down for the examination, so wearing a skirt or dress might make the process easier for you. e. Arrive early: Give yourself ample time to fill out any necessary paperwork and discuss your medical history with the healthcare provider before the examination. This can help you feel more at ease and allow the appointment to run smoothly. f. Relax during the appointment: While the Pap smear test may feel slightly uncomfortable, it is generally not painful. Relax and take deep breaths during the examination, which typically lasts only a few minutes. Be sure to let the healthcare provider know if you experience any severe discomfort or pain. The two questions you have asked cover distinct topics: professional poker and medical examinations. These questions are not the same and require separate answers, as I have provided above."},{"question":"How is \\"I should finally like to say that, besides working towards peace in the Middle East, which the European Union must continue to strive for, I am just as keen to seeing Europe play a much more active part in ensuring that the referendum on self-determination in the Western Sahara, which is under serious threat, is held in the conditions stipulated under UN authority.\\" said in German?","response":"Ich möchte zum Schluss sagen, dass ich neben der Arbeit für Frieden im Nahen Osten, für die die Europäische Union weiterhin kämpfen muss, auch sehr daran interessiert bin, dass Europa eine viel aktivere Rolle dabei spielt, sicherzustellen, dass das Referendum über die Selbstbestimmung in der Westsahara, das ernsthaft bedroht ist, unter den Bedingungen abgehalten wird, die von der UNO festgelegt wurden."},{"question":"Article: The Adobe Acrobat Reader app that most people have can open files, but not export them.
