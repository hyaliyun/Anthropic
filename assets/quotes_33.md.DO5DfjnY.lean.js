BBC Sport guest editor Hannah Cockroft, 24, who won double Paralympic gold at London 2012 and bettered that with a hat-trick at this summer's Games in Rio, talks about her 'love-hate' relationship with the word 'inspirational' and why Paralympians should get more prize money. Winning a Paralympic gold is now seen as equal, in terms of achievement, to an Olympic gold and our sport, our nation, has progressed so much. People now appreciate how much work goes into winning a Paralympic gold. The Paralympics had been pitied for so long, seen as the secondary Games, but that started to change at Sydney 2000. London then became a game-changer, certainly for British perceptions at least, and Rio has pushed our sport on further. But, even though things have got better, there is still plenty of room for improvement. Aside from major championships, where we do get paid for competing, in most other competitions during the year we have to pay to enter races. In 2014, I raced 53 times and won a total of £6,000 in prize money. That's not a lot. I am fortunate I get National Lottery funding, which is fantastic and an amazing help, but that just about covers my annual sporting costs. That's partly why I still live with my mum and dad. Luckily, I've also got great sponsors, something all athletes really struggle to find and many don't have, but I wouldn't say I make money - mostly it goes on fuel, hotels, equipment, and by the end of the year I just about break even. I don't want to make it sound like a terrible life. I'm not really hard done by and I'm fortunate to have the support I do, but it would be lovely to be able to afford to buy my own home and make a living from my sport one day, the way other sportspeople can. At London 2012 there was a Paralympic bonus of £10,000 per gold. It was less than half of that in Rio, and at the 2015 IPC World Championships it was £4,000. If you're not winning things you're not getting any money at all. I don't know how this compares to able-bodied athletes, but I can imagine they have far better earning potential. Wheelchair road racers do get paid, again only if they win, but it's not physically possible for me - I would not get through a marathon - and neither is it on offer for my classification so I have to stick to the track. Disabled athletes are normal people. Genuinely, we're like you, it's just that a part of us doesn't work. The fact we're alive isn't inspirational. Each competition costs between £20 and £30 to enter, and generally we race in Stoke Mandeville, Bedford and Coventry so there's also travelling and hotel costs to add to that. Unfortunately, for a Yorkshire girl like me, there are no races in the north of England. It all comes down to sponsorship of events and athletes. We know Olympians get paid for every event they do so why not hold Paralympic events alongside Diamond League events? Us Paralympians have our Diamond League equivalent, called the IPC Grand Prix, and we get to travel the world, but we still have to pay to enter that and there are nowhere near the prize funds on offer. I understand the absence of prize money is because we don't draw large crowds and therefore commercial sponsors don't see any point in being involved, but Rio showed what can be achieved with the right focus and marketing as the Paralympics attracted bigger support than the Olympics. During the summer, at a normal track event, fans can see the likes of six-time Paralympic champion David Weir racing against someone who's just got in a racing chair for the first time - it's amazing. I think people should see that. The sport's biggest names are there, supporting the grassroots, giving advice and passing on their experience but people don't know about it - and neither do they know they can watch for free yet the athletes have paid to be there. The crowds are tiny. It's something we've got used to. It's almost always family supporting, and that's because people don't know these events are taking place. It goes back to the issue of sponsorship, of events and athletes. As athletes we try to promote events on social media, through Twitter and Facebook, but we've only got a certain amount of reach. If I were able to improve one thing about my sport it would be better advertising of events from all the relevant bodies responsible for promoting them. Let's get bums on seats! To be honest, if you aren't focused on winning, you can lose motivation competing in front of sparse crowds, especially after a Paralympics. People are often surprised to hear I do so many races a year as they only see or hear about me once every four years on TV. It makes you question whether the Paralympic movement is really progressing. Are we making that much of a difference? But occasions like London and Rio restore faith and, of course, we have the annual Anniversary Games in London helping keep the Paralympic athletes in focus too. Sports facilities for disabled people have improved in this country. The biggest problem in attracting people to track racing is the equipment. A race chair costs about £5,000, and just to afford that you have to fight for it. As of last year, my race chairs are sponsored, but before then I had to make a race chair last three years, when technically they're supposed to last 12 months, because I couldn't afford a new one. Most people wouldn't buy top-of-the-range spikes if they wanted to try running, but there is no such thing as a cheap racing chair. They're expensive no matter which one you want and, of course, it's not 'one size fits all' as we are all different shapes and sizes so the best chairs are made to fit. It's about generating enough funding to ensure stock of chairs available for people to borrow so they can have a go. There are certain pools around the country where people can try a chair, but if you don't live near London, Coventry or Leeds - I'm pretty sure those are the only areas where race chairs can be borrowed - you can't try the sport. It shouldn't be like that. Every sports club, every Harriers, in the country should have a race chair so anyone can give track racing a go. Another problem which goes hand in hand with funding is coaching. No-one shames the majority of the British public because they can't swim like Rebecca Adlington or run fast but, suddenly, everyone in a wheelchair has to be a wheelchair racer There aren't enough coaches to cover all elite athletes so more funding needs to be put into the grassroots so knowledge can be passed on about how to push a wheelchair properly etc. It's an ongoing battle. I was already involved in athletics, in seated discus, when I was spotted by British Athletics, who put me in touch with a wheelchair racing coach. Had it not been for them, I don't think I would have started racing because I wouldn't have known how to get a race chair. Wheelchair racing will never be as accessible as going down to your local running club because it's not that easy, unfortunately, but things are being done through charity groups all the time to try to change that. Half of the British population seem to think everyone can become a Paralympian, the other half understand it's not like that. Just as not every able-bodied person can run as quickly as Usain Bolt, or jump as far as Greg Rutherford, not every disabled person in a chair can push as hard as David Weir. It's a battle we're still fighting. The perception that any disabled person can become a Paralympian is frustrating for Paralympians, but also for the wider disabled community because not everyone is going to be a sports star - it's physically impossible for them. For people to look at them after watching the Paralympics and think 'you're so lazy, you could be on the track' is hurtful and it also dirties the legacy we're trying to leave behind. No-one shames the majority of the British public because they can't swim like Rebecca Adlington or run fast but, suddenly, everyone in a wheelchair has to be a wheelchair racer. What we do is a personal choice, we make a lot of sacrifices, work for hours every day and push ourselves really hard. Paralympians have had to overcome a lot of things, but some people can't overcome what they've got, nor do they have the support network to help them. Let's celebrate the fact they can write, or sing, or do great things working in the community. Let's celebrate all those things as equally amazing. Everyone has different talents. Some thought the message of Channel 4's 'Yes I Can' advert before Rio was 'yes I can do sport' but that wasn't the message behind it, the real message was 'you can do anything you want'. I was told throughout my childhood I wouldn't be able to do sport, but now I'm an elite athlete. Who would've expected that? Certainly not the doctors who gave my parents little hope for me. There's been a debate recently over 'inspiration' and what it means within the context of disability. I have a love-hate relationship with the word. It gets thrown around so much. Every time someone describes a Paralympian as 'inspirational', I want to ask: \\"Why?\\" Is it because I'm doing something with my life and you don't expect me to, or is it because I go fast and work hard? If it's the latter, that's fine, but if it's because I got out of bed today and didn't feel sorry for myself, then describing that as inspirational should probably stop. Disabled athletes are normal people. Genuinely, we're like you, it's just that a part of us doesn't work. The fact we're alive isn't inspirational. The word inspirational has lost its meaning. It's too easy to say inspirational. Saying it has become a habit so let's create a new word. Hannah Cockroft was talking to BBC Sport's Aimee Lewis. What was that article about?","response":"The article is about Paralympian Hannah Cockroft's perspective on the challenges faced by disabled athletes, the progress of the Paralympic movement, and her thoughts on being labeled as 'inspirational.' She discusses the financial struggles of being a Paralympian, stressing the need for better sponsorship and advertising for events, and the challenges faced due to the costs of equipment and limited availability of specialized coaches. Cockroft also expresses her concerns about the public perception of disabled athletes and their capabilities and calls for more understanding and support, rather than labeling all disabled athletes as 'inspirational' without recognizing the hard work and commitment they put into their sport."},{"question":"Sentence 1: It wasn't fair that anyone with character enough to be that human even as a zombie should be wiped out without even a moment's consideration. Sentence 2: A person might be human, even when they were a zombie, if they had enough character. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","response":"To determine if the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence, let's analyze both sentences step by step: Step 1: Understand the meaning of both sentences - Sentence 1 communicates the idea that it is unfair for someone with a strong character to be eliminated without any thought, even if they're a zombie. - Sentence 2 conveys the idea that someone can still be considered human if they have enough character, even if they are a zombie. Step 2: Compare the information in both sentences - Both sentences discuss the relationship between character and being a zombie. - However, the first sentence specifically discusses the fairness of wiping out someone with character, while the second one addresses the notion of being considered human. Step 3: Determine if the second sentence is entailed by the first - The first sentence implies that there can be zombies with character, and that it is unfair to wipe them out without consideration. - Although it doesn't explicitly state that these zombies are considered human, that being \\"human\\" is a core aspect of having character is implied. Thus, the first sentence indirectly suggests that a person might still be viewed as human even when they're a zombie, based on their character. Based on this analysis, I would argue that the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence, although not explicitly. The first sentence establishes the importance of character even in a zombie, and as a result, the second sentence becomes a plausible and related conclusion that can be derived from this premise."},{"question":"Choose from options, is the following sentence linguistically acceptable?

Step 1: Identify the structure of the sentence The sentence has two clauses that are connected with the conjunction 'and': - \\"This actress must play in this movie\\" - \\"she will play in this movie\\" Step 2: Examine the meaning Both clauses communicate the idea that the actress is going to play in the movie. The first clause indicates it as an obligation (\\"must\\"), and the second clause expresses it as a future plan (\\"will\\"). Step 3: Analyze for redundancy The meaning of these two clauses is very similar, but they emphasize different aspects (obligation and future certainty), so they are not completely redundant.

Although her works on coal and viruses were appreciated in her lifetime, her contributions to the discovery of the structure of DNA were largely recognised posthumously. Born to a prominent British Jewish family, Franklin was educated at a private day school at Norland Place in West London, Lindores School for Young Ladies in Sussex, and St Paul's Girls' School, London. Then she studied the Natural Sciences Tripos at Newnham College, Cambridge, from which she graduated in 1941. Upon the completion of their model, Crick and Watson had invited Wilkins to be a co-author of their paper describing the structure. Wilkins turned down this offer, as he had taken no part in building the model. He later expressed regret that greater discussion of co-authorship had not taken place as this might have helped to clarify the contribution the work at King's had made to the discovery. There is no doubt that Franklin's experimental data were used by Crick and Watson to build their model of DNA in 1953. Some, including Maddox, have explained this citation omission by suggesting that it may be a question of circumstance, because it would have been very difficult to cite the unpublished work from the MRC report they had seen. Indeed, a clear timely acknowledgment would have been awkward, given the unorthodox manner in which data were transferred from King's to Cambridge. However, methods were available. Watson and Crick could have cited the MRC report as a personal communication or else cited the Acta articles in press, or most easily, the third Nature paper that they knew was in press. One of the most important accomplishments of Maddox's widely acclaimed biography is that Maddox made a well-received case for inadequate acknowledgement. \\"Such acknowledgement as they gave her was very muted and always coupled with the name of Wilkins\\". Fifteen years after the fact, the first clear recitation of Franklin's contribution appeared as it permeated Watson's account, The Double Helix, although it was buried under descriptions of Watson's (often quite negative) regard towards Franklin during the period of their work on DNA. This attitude is epitomized in the confrontation between Watson and Franklin over a preprint of Pauling's mistaken DNA manuscript. Watson's words impelled Sayre to write her rebuttal, in which the entire chapter nine, \\"Winner Take All\\" has the structure of a legal brief dissecting and analyzing the topic of acknowledgement. Sayre's early analysis was often ignored because of perceived feminist overtones in her book. Watson and Crick did not cite the X-ray diffraction work of Wilkins and Franklin in their original paper, though they admit having \\"been stimulated by a knowledge of the general nature of the unpublished experimental results and ideas of Dr. M. H. F. Wilkins, Dr. R. E. Franklin and their co-workers at King's College, London\\". In fact, Watson and Crick cited no experimental data at all in support of their model. Franklin and Gosling's publication of the DNA X-ray image, in the same issue of Nature, served as the principal evidence: Thus our general ideas are not inconsistent with the model proposed by Watson and Crick in the preceding communication. Ask a question about this article.","response":"What role did Rosalind Franklin's X-ray crystallography work play in the discovery of the DNA structure, and how was her contribution acknowledged by Watson and Crick?"},{"question":"Nala found 5 seashells at the beach.

The well-to-do family must move to the \\"countryside\\" when the father is promoted (to Obersturmbannführer). Unknown to Bruno, the new house is near a Nazi concentration camp, and Ralf is the new commandant. Bruno initially dislikes the new house as he always has to stay in the house or the garden; also there are no other children to play with, apart from his sister. From his bedroom window, Bruno spots a barbed wire fence with people in \\"striped pyjamas\\" behind it. Though he thinks it is a farm, it is the camp with Jewish people in their camp clothing. Bruno is forbidden to go there, because according to Ralf, \\"they're not really people\\"; it is agreed that at least they are a bit weird, as demonstrated by their clothing.Bruno goes there anyway, secretly, and becomes friends with a Jewish boy, named Shmuel (Jack Scanlon), whom he meets at the fence, and who is the same age. Shmuel tells Bruno that he is a Jew and that the Jewish people have been imprisoned here by soldiers, who also took their clothes and gave them the striped camp clothing, and that he is hungry. Bruno is confused and starts having doubts about his father being a good person. Later, he is relieved after seeing a propaganda film about the camp (that is a parody of Theresienstadt). Bruno often returns to the fence.

They first came to prominence playing rhythm and blues music, but their second album, Days of Future Passed, which was released in 1967, was a fusion of rock with classical music and established them as pioneers in the development of art rock and progressive rock. It has been described as a \\"landmark\\" and \\"one of the first successful concept albums\\". The band became known internationally with singles including \\"Go Now\\", \\"Nights in White Satin\\", \\"Tuesday Afternoon\\", and \\"Question\\". In the spring of 1974, after completing a vast world tour that culminated with a tour of Asia, the group took an extended break, erroneously reported as a break-up at the time, because of the other band members feeling exhausted and overshadowed (this was said by Hayward in the final issue of Higher & Higher magazine 2006). Although the band had typically featured four lead vocalists (with Edge also contributing vocally), Hayward was the principal guitarist/vocalist whilst Pinder was considered to be the person most responsible for their symphonic sound, arrangements, and overall conceptual direction. Pinder and Thomas also doubled as the Moodies' onstage MCs (as the 1969 \\"Caught Live + 5\\" album displayed). Before the band's 1973-74 world tour (their last with Pinder), Hayward wrote a song called \\"Island\\" with the intention of including it on a potential follow-up album, which the Moodies recorded in 1973 before ultimately going their separate ways. An additional cause of the hiatus were the long tours that had by this time strained Pinder, who needed a rest. In 1974 the band oversaw preparation of the compilation album This Is The Moody Blues which was released that year. Hayward and Lodge released a duo album, the very successful Blue Jays (1975), and a UK chart single, \\"Blue Guitar\\" (no. 8), which was credited to Hayward and Lodge even though it was just Hayward with 10cc backing him. The album had originally been a projected liaison between Hayward and Pinder, but after Pinder dropped out, John Lodge stepped in. (Tony Clarke produced it.) The members then released solo albums. Pinder said he hoped to get the band back together that year. \\"Having moved to California in 1974, I returned to Britain for a visit in summer 1975.

Unlike most other 3D games of this type, Tenchu stresses stealth. You need to sneak over roofs, past guards, over walls, and through houses to succeed in your missions. Killing is done silently and by surprise. If you make too much noise or are seen by your opponents, all of the guards in the area are alerted, making your mission difficult, if not impossible to accomplish. Great weapons, a well rendered environment, and awsome gameplay make this game a keeper! I only wish they'd come out with a Tenchu II. Does this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment? The answer is:","response":"This product review conveys a positive sentiment. The reviewer praises various aspects of the game, including its unique emphasis on stealth, the well-rendered environment, and the engaging gameplay.

A drug dealer, Sabrina raised Jackson until she died in a mysterious fire when Jackson was 8. After his mother's death and his father's departure Jackson was raised by his grandmother. He began boxing at about age 11, and when he was 14 a neighbor opened a boxing gym for local youth. \\" In 2002, Eminem heard Jackson's Guess Who's Back? CD, received from Jackson's attorney (who was working with Eminem's manager, Paul Rosenberg). Impressed, Eminem invited Jackson to fly to Los Angeles and introduced him to Dr. Dre. After signing a 1 million record deal, Jackson released No Mercy, No Fear. The mixtape featured one new track, \\"Wanksta\\", which appeared on Eminem's 8 Mile soundtrack. Jackson was also signed by Chris Lighty's Violator Management and Sha Money XL's Money Management Group. Jackson released his debut album, Get Rich or Die Tryin' (described by AllMusic as \\"probably the most hyped debut album by a rap artist in about a decade\\"), in February 2003. Rolling Stone noted its \\"dark synth grooves, buzzy keyboards and a persistently funky bounce\\", with Jackson complementing the production in \\"an unflappable, laid-back flow\\". It debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, selling 872,000 copies in its first four days. The lead single, \\"In da Club\\" (noted by The Source for its \\"blaring horns, funky organs, guitar riffs and sparse hand claps\\"), set a Billboard record as the most listened-to song in radio history within a week. Interscope gave Jackson his own label, G-Unit Records, in 2003. He signed Lloyd Banks, Tony Yayo and Young Buck as members of G-Unit, and The Game was later signed in a joint venture with Dr. Dre's Aftermath Entertainment. In March 2005 Jackson's second commercial album, The Massacre, sold 1.14 million copies in its first four days (the highest in an abbreviated sales cycle) and was number one on the Billboard 200 for six weeks. He was the first solo artist with three singles in the Billboard top five in the same week with \\"Candy Shop\\", \\"Disco Inferno\\" and \\"How We Do\\". According to Rolling Stone, \\"50's secret weapon is his singing voice - the deceptively amateur-sounding tenor croon that he deploys on almost every chorus\\". After The Game's departure Jackson signed Olivia and rap veterans Mobb Deep to G-Unit Records, with Spider Loc, M.O.P., 40 Glocc and Young Hot Rod later joining the label, who all eventually departed the label. Jackson expressed an interest in working with rappers other than G-Unit, such as Lil' Scrappy of BME, LL Cool J of Def Jam, Mase of Bad Boy and Freeway of Roc-A-Fella, and recorded with several.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Opeth was formed as a death metal band in 1989 in Stockholm, Sweden, by lead vocalist David Isberg. Isberg asked former Eruption band member Mikael Åkerfeldt, who was just 16 years old at the time, to join Opeth as a bassist. When Åkerfeldt showed up to practice on the day after Isberg invited him, it became clear that Isberg had not told the band members, including the band's current bassist, that Åkerfeldt would be joining the band. An ensuing argument led to all members but Isberg and Åkerfeldt leaving to form a new project. The band name was derived from the word \\"Opet\\", taken from the Wilbur Smith novel The Sunbird. In this novel, Opet is the name of a fictional Phoenician city in South Africa translated as \\"City of the Moon\\". Isberg and Åkerfeldt recruited drummer Anders Nordin, bassist Nick Döring, and guitarist Andreas Dimeo. Unsatisfied with Opeth's slow progress, Döring and Dimeo left the band after their first performance, and were replaced by guitarist Kim Pettersson and bassist Johan De Farfalla. After the next show, De Farfalla left Opeth to spend time with his girlfriend in Germany, and was initially replaced by Mattias Ander, before Åkerfeldt's friend Peter Lindgren took on the role of bassist. Rhythm guitarist Kim Pettersson left following the band's next performance, and Lindgren switched to guitar, with the role of bassist falling to Stefan Guteklint. The following year, David Isberg left the band citing \\"creative differences\\".Following Isberg's departure, Åkerfeldt took over vocal duties and he, Lindgren, and Nordin spent the next year writing and rehearsing new material. The group began to rely less on the blast beats and aggression typical of death metal, and incorporated acoustic guitars and guitar harmonies into their music; developing the core sound of Opeth.

Francisco de Ibarra was a Spanish explorer and conquistador in the 16th century who played a significant role in the exploration and conquest of what is now known as northern Mexico. He embarked on a series of expeditions that expanded Spanish influence in the region over several years. One such expedition took him to the area of modern-day Casas Grandes, in the Mexican state of Chihuahua, where the archaeological site of Paquime is located. Paquime, also known as Casas Grandes, is an important archaeological site in the north of Mexico, dating back to the late Pre-Columbian period. Paquime was inhabited by the ancient Casas Grandes culture, also known as the Mogollon, between approximately AD 1130 and 1450. The site showcases a unique blend of architectural styles, combining influences from puebloan cultures in the north and Mesoamerican cultures in central and southern Mexico. This mixture is evident in the adobe architecture, ceramics, and artifacts discovered at Paquime. Excavations at the site have revealed a complex urban center featuring multi-story buildings, plazas, workshops, and an extensive, sophisticated water control system. Paquime was also an important center for trade, connecting the various cultural groups within the region. Turquoise, shells, copper, and macaws were traded, as well as goods from even more distant regions like Central Mexico and the American Southwest. Francisco de Ibarra, following in the footsteps of his uncle, Diego de Ibarra, helped expand Spanish control and influence in the north of Mexico throughout the 1560s and 1570s. It is thought that during his expeditions, Francisco de Ibarra encountered the ruins of Paquime, making him the first known European to see the remains of this once-thriving ancient city. This discovery signified the richness and complexity of the pre-Columbian cultures that inhabited the region before the arrival of the Europeans, providing valuable insights into the history and heritage of the region in which Paquime played a significant role."},{"question":"Given the following reasoning and answer, what was the question?

Article:","response":"Title: Prolonged Cold and Wet Weather Fuels Moth Population Surge in London and South East Introduction: The United Kingdom, especially the London and south-east regions, has experienced an unseasonal surge in moth populations in recent times. This rise is being attributed to the extended spells of cold, wet weather the regions have been witnessing. The moth population has a significant impact on ecosystems, not only affecting the natural ecological balance but also posing challenges for homeowners and businesses. In this article, we will delve deeper into how the changing climatic conditions have contributed to this boom in moth populations, the impacts on various sectors, and how residents and professionals can mitigate the moth influx. Causes for the Increase in Moth Populations: While moths can thrive in various climatic conditions, the recent unseasonal cold and wet weather has significantly favoured their growth and reproduction. Typically, these types of weather are expected during the winter months; however, their prevalence in the off-season has resulted in a conducive environment for moths to breed and multiply. In cold, damp conditions, many of the moth species are able to reproduce at a faster pace, thus increasing the moth population rapidly. The primary reason behind this prolonged spell of cold, wet weather is climate change, which has caused varying and unpredictable weather patterns across the globe. The increase in global temperatures has led to alterations in rainfall distribution, ultimately affecting the ecosystems and providing opportunities for species like moths to proliferate. Impact on Ecosystems: The surge in moth populations in London and the south-east regions has prompted concerns about the possible impacts on the local ecosystem. Moths play a crucial role in the food chain, serving as a vital food source for various other species, including birds and bats. While they are a natural part of any ecosystem, an imbalance in their numbers can have cascading effects on other flora and fauna, leading to disruptions in the natural balance. Mitigating the Moth Boom: Given the pressing need to control moth populations, both local authorities and residents have been implementing several measures to curb the influx. Some of these methods include: 1. Encouraging natural predators: Introducing species that prey on moths, such as birds and bats, can help to keep the moth population in check. Installing birdhouses and bat boxes in and around gardens can provide these predators with shelter and conducive environments for nesting, thus encouraging them to patrol the area and limit moth population growth. 2. Pheromone traps: These traps utilise pheromones to attract male moths, disrupting the mating process and effectively reducing the number of offspring produced. Pheromone traps are especially useful in managing clothes moths, which can cause considerable damage to fabric materials in homes. 3. Chemical control: Utilising pesticides is another option for homeowners and businesses looking to curb the moth population. However, this method should only be considered if other eco-friendlier alternatives have been exhausted, as indiscriminate use of chemicals can have negative effects on the environment and human health. 4. Good housekeeping practices: Residents can minimise the risk of moth infestations by maintaining cleanliness in their homes and gardens. Properly storing clothing, sealing cracks and crevices, and keeping food in airtight containers can prevent moth infestations from becoming a major problem. Conclusion: The recent surge in moth populations in London and the south-east is an alarming reminder of the ripple effects that climate change may have on our ecosystems. It is crucial for individuals, communities, and governments to work together to address the issue of climate change proactively. In the meantime, implementing the measures discussed above can help in effectively controlling the moth populations, ensuring that the delicate natural balance remains intact."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context.

Mike noticed that in his city some squirrels have darker coat, while others have lighter coat. He also knew that darker coats are more suitable in cold environment with less predator prey interaction. He started thinking why the squirrels developed different coat colors. Would darker squirrels have greater or smaller chance of survival than lighter squirrels? A:","response":"In Mike's cold mid-western city, it is possible that the squirrels have developed different coat colors due to several factors like adaptation, genetic variations, and the environment they live in. Let's discuss these factors and the chances of survival for darker and lighter squirrels in detail. Adaptation: Adaptive processes occur over generations when certain traits or characteristics become more common within a population due to selective pressures, such as predators or environmental conditions. This is known as natural selection, a fundamental mechanism of evolution. In the case of Mike's city, the darker coat color might be an adaptation for better heat retention in the cold climate. Darker fur absorbs more sunlight and retains heat more efficiently, thus helping the squirrel stay warm. Conversely, lighter fur might be an adaptation for locations with more predator-prey interactions as it could serve as camouflage, making the lighter squirrels harder for predators to spot against light-colored backgrounds. Genetic Variations: Genetic variations are the differences in genes among individuals within a population. These variations can lead to different phenotypic expressions – the observable physical or physiological traits of an organism, such as coat color in squirrels. The presence of both dark and light coat colors in the squirrels within Mike's city might be the result of genetic variations within the population. Genetic variation occurs through processes like mutations, genetic recombination during sexual reproduction, and gene flow among populations. Environment: The environment plays a significant role in shaping the characteristics of the organisms living in it. In a cold and predator-free environment like Mike's city, the squirrels might have less selective pressure to remain camouflaged or hidden. As a result, both dark and light coat colors could potentially coexist within the population, as there is no apparent disadvantage to having a lighter coat. Chance of Survival: The survival chances of darker squirrels, in this case, might be slightly greater than the lighter squirrels, primarily due to their better capacity to retain heat in a cold environment. This advantage can help them stay warm and conserve energy, which is essential for foraging, reproduction, and avoiding predators. However, since Mike's city has minimal predator-prey interaction, the survival advantage might not be as pronounced as it would be in an ecosystem with more predators, where camouflage and hiding are crucial aspects of survival. Alternatively, lighter squirrels might have an increased chance of survival if other factors, such as the availability of food or shifting environmental conditions, favor lighter coat colors. Given the wide range of factors that can influence survival and reproduction, it is difficult to make a definitive statement without more information on the specific environment and challenges faced by the squirrels in the area. In conclusion, while darker squirrels might have a slightly greater chance of survival due to their better heat retention, other factors like genetic variations and environment also play a part in shaping the distribution of coat colors in the local squirrels' population. Due to the minimal predator-prey interaction in Mike's city, the difference in survival chances between these two groups might be less significant than in environments with higher predator pressure or other environmental challenges that specifically favor one coat color over another."},{"question":"Read the article and select the best answer.

As one NSC staff note put it, \\"Under the Taliban, Afghanistan is not so much a state sponsor of terrorism as it is a state sponsored by terrorists.\\" In early 2000, the United States began a high-level effort to persuade Pakistan to use its influence over the Taliban. In January 2000, Assistant Secretary of State Karl Inderfurth and the State Department's counterterrorism coordinator, Michael Sheehan, met with General Musharraf in Islamabad, dangling before him the possibility of a presidential visit in March as a reward for Pakistani cooperation. Such a visit was coveted by Musharraf, partly as a sign of his government's legitimacy. He told the two envoys that he would meet with Mullah Omar and press him on Bin Laden. They left, however, reporting to Washington that Pakistan was unlikely in fact to do anything,\\" given what it sees as the benefits of Taliban control of Afghanistan.\\" President Clinton was scheduled to travel to India.

But President Clinton insisted on including Pakistan in the itinerary for his trip to South Asia. His one-day stopover on March 25, 2000, was the first time a U.S. president had been there since 1969. At his meeting with Musharraf and others, President Clinton concentrated on tensions between Pakistan and India and the dangers of nuclear proliferation, but also discussed Bin Laden.

His long career mirrored changes in American entertainment tastes and technology. He started in the age of minstrel shows and moved to vaudeville, Broadway, the recording industry, Hollywood, radio, and television. The idea for bringing a black dancer to Fox to star with Temple in The Little Colonel was actually first proposed by Fox head Winfield Sheehan after a discussion with D. W. Griffith. Sheehan set his sights on Robinson but, unsure of his ability as an actor, arranged for a contract that was void if Robinson failed the dramatic test. Robinson passed the test and was brought in to both star with Temple and to teach her tap dancing. They quickly hit it off, as Temple recounted years later: Robinson walked a step ahead of us, but when he noticed me hurrying to catch up, he shortened his stride to accommodate mine. I kept reaching up for his hand, but he hadn't looked down and seemed unaware. Fannie called his attention to what I was doing, so he stopped short, bent low over me, his eyes wide and rows of brilliant teeth showing in a wide smile. When he took my hand in his, it felt large and cool. For a few moments, we continued walking in silence. \\"Can I call you Uncle Billy?\\" I asked. \\"Why sure you can\\", he replied... \\"But then I get to call you darlin.'\\" It was a deal. From then on, whenever we walked together it was hand in hand, and I was always his \\"darlin.'\\" Temple had already appeared in five films released in 1934, and had performed a tap routine with James Dunn in Stand Up and Cheer! After Robinson was signed by 20th Century Fox, it was decided that he would perform his famous stair dance with Temple. While Robinson liked the idea, he quickly realized that he could not teach his complex stair dance to a seven-year-old in the few days permitted by the shooting schedule. Instead, he taught Temple to kick the riser (face) of each stairstep with her toe. After watching her practice his choreography, Robinson modified his routine to mimic her movements, so that it appeared on film that she was imitating his steps. The sequence was the highlight of the film. Robinson and Temple became the first interracial dance partners in Hollywood history. The scene was controversial for its time, and was cut out in the south along with all other scenes showing the two making physical contact. Temple and Robinson appeared in four films together: The Little Colonel, The Littlest Rebel, Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm and Just Around the Corner. Robinson and Temple became close friends as a result of his dance coaching and acting with her. Robinson carried pictures of Temple with him wherever he traveled, and Temple considered him a lifelong friend, saying in an interview \\"Bill Robinson treated me as an equal, which was very important to me. He didn't talk down to me, like to a little girl. And I liked people like that.

After the recovery of Jerusalem in 1099, it took four hundred years of sieges and battles, treaties, betrayals, and yet more battles, before Christian kings and warlords succeeded in subduing the Moors. On 10 September 1229, a Catalan army led by King Jaume I of Aragón and Catalunya took the Mallorcan shore near the present-day resort of Santa Ponça. The defenders retreated inside the walls of Palma, but on the last day of 1229 the city fell, and pockets of resistance throughout the island were also defeated. Jaume I proved to be an enlightened ruler who profited from the talents of the Moors — converted by force to Christianity — as well as of the island's large Jewish and Genoese trading communities. Mallorca prospered. The Moors on Menorca speedily agreed to pay an annual tribute to Aragón and were left in peace. The island's tranquility lasted until 1287, when Alfonso III of Aragón, smarting over a series of humiliations at the hands of his nobles, found a pretext for invasion. The Moors were defeated and expelled or killed. In contrast to Mallorca, Menorca's economy was devastated for decades. Jaume I died after reigning in Aragón for six decades, but he made the cardinal error of dividing between his sons the lands he had fought for so long to unite. At first this resulted in an Independent Kingdom of Mallorca, under Jaume II, followed by Sanç and Jaume III. But family rivalry triggered the overthrow of Jaume III by his cousin Pedro IV, who then seized the Balearics for Aragón. Attempting a comeback, Jaume was killed in battle near Llucmajor in 1349. A newly unified Christian Spain under the Catholic Monarchs, Ferdinand and Isabella, completed the Reconquest, defeating the only Moorish enclave left on the Iberian peninsula, Granada, in 1492. However, the centralized kingdom failed to incorporate the Balearics politically or economically. Question: \\"Jaume was defeated by whom and died in what year?\\" Response: \\"Family rivalry triggered the overthrow of Jaume III by his cousin Pedro IV, who then seized the Balearics for AragÃ³n.

As the girls tour the factory, they see a number of very lifelike dolls stored in glass canisters locked in a display case on the wall. These are part of Mr. Franzâs special collection. Sally Reynolds (June Kenney) answers a newspaper advertisement for a secretary; Franz's previous one has mysteriously vanished.

Here's a state-by-state breakdown of what we know right now, based on the AP and other sources: In New York City, Mayor Michael Bloomberg said the storm was \\"maybe the worst we have ever experienced,\\" saying that at least 10 have died, and that 23 serious fires are burning in the city—including a Queens blaze that has consumed more than 80 homes. He said the subway would take 2 to 5 days to reopen \\"if you had to guess,\\" but the East River bridges have already been reopened, the Guardian reports. Gov. Andrew Cuomo blamed a \\"design flaw\\" in the subway system: \\"We did not anticipate water coming over the Hudson River.\\" In New Jersey, more than 2.4 million are without power, and at least 3 are dead. \\"I think the losses are going to be almost incalculable,\\" Chris Christie said today, the Star-Ledger reports.

More than 250,000 have already lost power in Ohio, as the storm bears down on the Cleveland region. All flights through Cleveland Hopkins International Airport have been canceled, the Plain-Dealer reports. Illinois is still awaiting its taste of Sandy; Chicago officials are urging residents to stay away from the lakefront, where waves are already at 17 to 20 feet, and expected to rise in the coming hours, the Chicago Tribune reports. Kentucky, too, has a storm warning in effect with gusts expected to hit 50mph. Two people have died in Connecticut, including one firefighter who was crushed by a falling tree.

In New York City, the person in charge, Mayor Michael Bloomberg, said this was maybe the worst storm they have ever had.

The trains underwater will take a few days to start working again, but cars can already cross the bridges over the East River.

In a state nearby called New Jersey, many people do not have electricity, and at least three people have died. They are still looking for people who did not leave their homes when they were told to because of the big storm. Chris Christie, the person in charge of New Jersey, thinks it will be very hard to count all the things that were lost. In some other states, like Ohio and Illinois, they are still waiting to see how the storm will affect them. In Ohio, some people have already lost power, and all the planes are not flying right now. In Illinois, officials are telling people to be careful and stay away from a big lake where the waves are very high.

Is Subsequently, Plato and Aristotle produced the first systematic discussions of natural philosophy, which did much to shape later investigations of nature. a good answer to this question?","response":"While the provided statement does mention Plato and Aristotle's considerable contributions to the development of natural philosophy, it doesn't specifically address the question about the discussion technique they are responsible for. A more appropriate and detailed answer would be: Plato and Aristotle are often credited with developing the philosophical discussion technique known as \\"dialectic\\" or \\"dialectical method.\\" This method involves structured discussions between two or more people, where opposing views are presented and debated in order to arrive at a greater understanding of the topic at hand or establish a consensus. The dialectic method relies on reasoned arguments and critical thinking, serving to uncover philosophical truths by examining different perspectives. Plato's Socratic Dialogues, a series of written works featuring Socrates as the protagonist, best exemplify this technique. In these dialogues, Socrates engages in discourse with various people and asks a series of questions, pushing them to question their own beliefs and ultimately reach a greater understanding. This process is also referred to as the \\"Socratic method\\" or \\"elenchus.\\" Aristotle, a student of Plato, also employed dialectic in his works, though he developed and refined the technique further. Aristotle maintained that dialectic helped in forming genuine knowledge by identifying the basic principles and axioms through a process of gathering information, challenging premises, and testing conclusions. Aristotle's dialectic can be found across his vast body of work, touching on topics such as metaphysics, ethics, politics, and natural sciences. Consequently, both Plato and Aristotle contributed significantly to the evolution of dialectic, shaping the discussions and debates that would occur in philosophical and intellectual circles for centuries to come."},{"question":"Q: If I tell you that Lupron usually brings on menopause, and ask you the question \\"lupron usually brings on \\", is the correct answer \\"dehydration\\"?

Answer the above question based on the context below: \\"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\\" was written by Beyoncé, Terius \\"The-Dream\\" Nash, Thaddis \\"Kuk\\" Harrell, and Christopher \\"Tricky\\" Stewart, and was produced by Nash and Stewart. Beyoncé recorded the song in May 2008 at the Boom Boom Room Studio in Burbank, California, and it was mixed by Jaycen Joshua and Dave Pensado, with assistance from Randy Urbanski and Andrew Wuepper. Nash conceptualized \\"Single Ladies\\" after Beyoncé's secret marriage to hip hop recording artist Jay-Z in April 2008. Stewart commented that the song was \\"the only public statement that [Beyoncé and Jay-Z had] ever made about marriage\\", and that while in the studio recording the song Beyoncé had remained tightlipped, even to the point of removing her wedding band. Beyoncé's marriage inspired Nash to compose a song about an issue that affected many people's relationships: the fear or unwillingness of men to commit. In an interview with Billboard magazine, Beyoncé added that she was drawn to the song because of the universality of the topic, an issue that \\"people are passionate about and want to talk about and debate\\". She stated that although \\"Single Ladies\\" is a playful uptempo song, it addresses an issue that women experience every day.In \\"Single Ladies\\", Beyoncé portrays her alter ego Sasha Fierce, which appears on the second part of I Am...

Answer: Chills are an involuntary contraction and relaxation of our muscles that generate heat and are triggered by our body's natural response to fear or cold temperatures. When we are scared, our body undergoes a \\"fight or flight\\" response. This physiological reaction releases adrenaline, which in turn increases our heart rate, blood flow, and respiration. The chills serve as a way for our muscles to prepare for any potential action we may need to take, making our reflexes quicker to respond to danger. In addition to the adrenaline rush, chills can also be caused by low ambient temperatures. When our body detects cold, it works to maintain our core temperature to ensure that our vital organs continue to function properly. Chills, in this case, are a form of thermogenesis. By shivering, our muscles generate heat, warming us up and helping to maintain a stable internal temperature. The experience of chills can be viewed as an evolutionary advantage that keeps us safe in multiple ways. Chills help prepare our body for potentially dangerous situations by quickening our reflexes, and they also aid in maintaining a stable internal temperature when faced with a cold environment. This dual-purpose response ultimately aids in our survival and overall well-being."},{"question":"Definition: Translate the given Spanish text to English Input: In turn, said DLC film can be coated with a decorative metallic film.

Give me reasons, before answering the question","response":"Before directly answering the question, let's discuss the reasons and assumptions: 1. Violet's water consumption rate is given as 800 mL per hour for herself and 400 mL per hour for her dog. 2. Violet can carry 4.8 liters (4,800 mL) of water in total. 3. We assume that there are no other sources of water available during the hike. 4. The water consumption rate is assumed to be constant throughout the hike. 5. We are not taking into account other factors like individual variations in water consumption, environmental conditions, or the intensity of the hike. Now, considering these reasons and assumptions, let's answer the question: To find out how many hours Violet and her dog can hike, we first add their combined water consumption per hour: Total consumption per hour = Violet's consumption + Dog's consumption Total consumption per hour = 800 mL + 400 mL Total consumption per hour = 1,200 mL (1.2 L) Now, we have the total water consumption per hour for Violet and her dog. To find out the number of hours they can hike, we divide Violet's total water carrying capacity by their combined consumption per hour: Number of hours = Total water capacity / Total consumption per hour Number of hours = 4,800 mL / 1,200 mL Number of hours = 4 Based on the given information and assuming no other sources of water, Violet and her dog can spend a maximum of 4 hours hiking."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Pick one category for the following text.

Hypothesis: A woman uses a very big machine to make blankets .Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis?","response":"Yes, we can conclude the hypothesis based on the given premise. First, let's break down the premise and the hypothesis into their core components and compare the two: 1. According to the premise, there is 'a woman working on a large machine'. This is mirrored in the hypothesis where it mentions 'a woman uses a very big machine'. The big machine in the hypothesis is a fair qualifier for the large machine in the premise. There is a clear relation between these statements. 2. The premise also states that she appears 'to be using' this machine 'to make a blanket of some sort'. In the hypothesis, this corresponds to her actually 'making blankets'. However, it is significant to underline the slight nuance between 'appears to be using' in the premise and 'uses' in the hypothesis. The latter implies certainty while the former indicates an observation which might be erroneous. Yet, without further defining context that could contradict this, it is reasonable to accept these statements as equivalent. So, with these correlation, we can conclude that the hypothesis — 'A woman uses a very big machine to make blankets' — is a valid conclusion based on the given premise about a woman using a large machine to make a blanket. However, it's important to note that this conclusion is contingent on how certain we are that the machine is indeed being used to make a blanket. In real-world scenarios, obtaining additional evidence might be necessary."},{"question":"Read the bio below and try to give details on georg frank 's: - clubs - caps - position - nationalcaps - years - nationalyears - death date - youthclubs - nationalgoals - youthyears - birth date - name - nationalteam - birth place - goals Bio: georg \`\` allan '' frank -lrb- 14 december 1907 -- 13 november 1944 -rrb- was a german international footballer . frank scored four goals as germany thrashed switzerland 7 -- 1 in a friendly on 10 february 1929 .

The question describes a scenario where the bleachers are full of hooligans who are roaring through many chants and using smoke bombs during a raucous event. Based on the given elements, this question relates to a sports event or gathering where passionate and rowdy fans usually gather. Let's consider the given possible answers and analyze why \\"soccer game\\" is the most aligned with human common sense. 1. Gymnasium: While it's true that gymnasiums can host various sports events, they are typically indoor venues with limited seating capacity. The use of smoke bombs would be dangerous and inappropriate in an indoor setting, which makes a gymnasium an unlikely location for the described situation. 2. Baseball stadium: While baseball games can have enthusiastic fans, it is less common to find hooligans and smoke bombs associated with baseball games. Baseball is a more slow-paced game, and the atmosphere at stadiums tends to be more relaxed, focusing on a family-friendly environment. 3. Soccer game: Soccer (association football) is well-known for having passionate fans who can sometimes display hooligan-like behavior. Soccer hooligans are a subset of fans who often engage in aggressive and sometimes violent actions during matches. Some of these actions might include chanting, setting off smoke bombs or flares, and occasionally even clashing with opposing fans or law enforcement. This global phenomenon is particularly notable in European and Latin American countries, where soccer is an extremely popular and deeply-rooted sport. Therefore, the depiction of a raucous event with hooligans and smoke bombs strongly aligns with the experience of attending a soccer game. 4. Sports match: While \\"sports match\\" could be a generic term to describe a competition between two teams, it is not as specific as \\"soccer game\\" in identifying the sport being played. Considering the additional details given in the question, human common sense would lead many to conclude that soccer is the most appropriate sport in this context. 5. Football stadium: While this might be an appropriate answer depending on the interpretation of \\"football\\" (which could mean either association football/soccer or American football), it is less specific than \\"soccer game\\" in identifying the sport being played. The mention of hooligans, chants, and smoke bombs align more with the atmosphere and culture associated with soccer matches rather than American football games. In conclusion, \\"soccer game\\" is an answer that aligns with human common sense due to the presence of hooligans, chanting, and smoke bombs at such events. The intense atmosphere and fan behavior are commonly associated with soccer matches in many parts of the world. In contrast, the other options provided are either too-generic or do not fit the described scenario as accurately and convincingly as a soccer game does."},{"question":"Jo, s kým to je?

Both these clean-cut men sitting at the bar in polo-style shirts have a lot in common. They work at the nearby Severstal steel company. They're nearing retirement. And they both have strong opinions about who the next president should be. But their politics are as different as their taste in beer. \\"I'm not for Obamacare, I'm not for his immigration policies, I don't particularly agree with 100% of his economic policies,\\" Bengelsvorf said. For the record, he's a Bud Light guy -- and a Mitt Romney supporter. \\"We can't go further into debt, and Obama is putting us further and further into debt by all these stimulus plans.\\" Flynn, a Miller Lite guy, supports President Barack Obama. If it weren't for the Obama-backed health care law, Flynn said his friend's unemployed son (a recent college graduate) wouldn't have health insurance coverage. CNN Poll: Health care ruling has not impacted race for White House, so far When it comes to the economy, Flynn admits it's taking too long to recover from the recession. But he said that \\"going back to the policies that got us into this mess is not the direction we want to go.\\" Severstal supplies steel to the big three automakers -- Ford, General Motors and Chrysler -- so Flynn's and Bengelsvorf's jobs are tied to the auto industry.

Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","response":"Yes, both questions are inquiring about the same information: the number of eggs that should be eaten each day. Determining the ideal number of eggs to consume each day depends on various factors such as age, gender, activity level, and dietary preferences. Eggs are a good source of high-quality protein, essential vitamins, and minerals. However, they also contain cholesterol, primarily located in the yolk, which has been a source of dietary concern for some individuals. It should be noted that dietary cholesterol has less impact on blood cholesterol levels than once believed. The current scientific consensus suggests that moderate egg consumption is safe and healthy for the majority of people. The American Heart Association recommends one egg (or two egg whites) per day for healthy adults as part of a balanced diet that includes other protein sources like lean meats, nuts, and legumes. This recommendation translates to about seven eggs per week. Individuals who have high cholesterol, diabetes, or are at high risk of heart disease should check with their healthcare provider for personalized guidance on egg consumption. For those with particular dietary preferences, such as vegetarians, eggs can be a vital protein source. In such cases, eating more than one egg per day might be acceptable if other high-protein food options are limited. Also, athletes or individuals who engage in high-intensity training may have higher protein requirements and can thus benefit from consuming more eggs daily. In conclusion, the number of eggs one should eat each day varies depending on the individual's health, goals, and dietary preferences. For most healthy adults, consuming one egg per day is acceptable. However, it is crucial to discuss personal dietary choices with a healthcare professional, particularly if you have specific health concerns. Always aim for a well-balanced diet that incorporates a variety of protein sources and other essential nutrients to ensure optimal health."},{"question":"Teacher:In this task, you are given reviews written about the books in Bengali.

Pour the soap batter into the mold. Wrap the mold inside cardboard and a clean towel. Wait 24 hours before cutting into bars. Dry the soap for several weeks before using it. Article:","response":"Title: Making Soap at Home: A Fun and Easy Guide Hello little friends! Do you know what soap is? Well, soap is a very special thing we use to keep our hands and bodies clean. We use soap when we wash our hands, take a shower, or when we want to make lots of fun bubbles in a bubble bath. Have you ever thought about making your own soap at home with the help of a grown-up? Today, I am going to tell you how to make your very own soap in just a few simple steps! Are you ready? Let's begin! Step 1: Prepare your soap molds First, we need something that will help give our soap its shape. This is called a mold. You and your grown-up helper can find many different shapes of soap molds at the store, or maybe even in your own home. Once you have chosen your mold, it's time to get it ready. Gently clean the mold with a little warm water and a clean cloth. After that, line the inside of the mold with special paper that will help your soap come out easily. Don't worry, your grown-up will help you with this part too! Step 2: Pour the soap batter into the mold Now it's time to make our soap batter! Your grown-up will help you mix all the ingredients needed to make the soap, like oils, colors, and scents. Once everything is mixed together nicely, it will become a thick, creamy liquid called soap batter. This is when you can carefully pour the soap batter into your prepared mold. You can use a spoon or a small cup to help make it easier. Make sure you fill the mold all the way to the top, but be careful not to spill! Step 3: Keep your soap warm and cozy After the soap batter is in the mold, we need to make sure it stays warm while it turns into soap. To do this, wrap the mold in a piece of cardboard, like a box, and then wrap a clean towel around it. This will help the soap stay warm and cozy. Imagine you are tucking the soap into bed for the night! Step 4: Wait for your soap to become a solid It's time to be patient! To let the soap harden, we need to wait about 24 hours, which is like the time it takes for one whole day to go by. After waiting, ask your grown-up helper to carefully remove the soap from the mold and start cutting it into bars or smaller soap shapes. Step 5: Let your soap dry Our soap is almost ready, but first, we need to let it dry for a few weeks. This is called curing. Find a nice spot in your home where you can leave your soap to dry, making sure it's away from little hands and paws. After a few weeks, your soap will be nice and hard, ready for you to use! And that's it! Now you know how easy and fun it is to make your own soap at home. You can create lots of different soap shapes, colors, and scents to use and maybe even share with your friends and family. Remember, always ask for help from a grown-up when making soap, as some steps can be a bit tricky. Have fun, little soap makers!"},{"question":"Given the question: Title: This was a gift Review: The teacher I bought this for loved it !

Movie title: Hercules Movie plot: In Ancient Greece in the land far away, when people read Greek mythology came the time of legend â the greatest son of Zeus â Hercules. Hercules was once destined to be the King of Mycenae as his father Zeus had planned but his jealous stepmother Hera had other plans. Hera not willing a bastard son of Zeus should overshadow her, decided to let another boy, Eurystheus, his cousin born first which deprived Hercules of the right. Hera tried to kill Hercules with two serpents but he strangles them both. As the years go by, Hercules displayed strength like no other boy his age which unknown to many, his father is really Zeus. Eurystheus was then declared king after winning a race. Unable to accept his defeat, Hercules challenged Eurystheus to another round which accidentally takes away the life of his mother Alcmene. Feeling guilty even with all the consolation Megara gives him, he goes to the oracle and consults Apollo who tells him he must perform the \\"Twelve Labors\\" for Eurystheus. He refuses at first until the guilt goes so deep that he gives in to the challenge. Hercules is given a series of challenges each one was designed tougher by the other by his stepmother Hera. He was first sent to kill the Nemean lion which he succeeded into turning his coat. He also drove away the Stymphalian birds with the help of Athena's cymbals. Each one was made difficult by the other as his stepmother hopes to see the last of him. A series of labors are shown like the slaying of the Lernaean Hydra, catching the stag of Artemis, the Cathmanian boar, the Cretan bull, cleaning the Augeean stables, getting the girdle of Hippolyte, the man-eating mares of Diomedes and the Cattle of Geryon (but the monster is not shown). When asked to get the Golden Apples of the Hesperides, he does not get permission so he goes to Atlas who gets the apples for him.

Hercules' nephew, Iolaus, assists him in this task by wielding a torch to cauterize each neck as Hercules removes the head with his sword. After dealing with the mortal heads, Hercules cuts off the immortal head using a golden sword given to him by Athena and buries it under a large rock, thus effectively killing the Hydra."},{"question":"How would the universe look without gravity?

This type of question aims to gather information about the key events associated with this enigmatic figure and understand the cultural impact or public attention received due to their actions. To provide a detailed answer about what D.B. Cooper is known for, we can explore various aspects related to the individual, the notorious event they are connected to, and their ongoing mysterious status: 1. Who is D.B. Cooper? - D.B.

Although he was born in Amsterdam, the family lived in the village of Slikkerveer. In 1943 the family moved to The Hague, the location of the German headquarters in the Netherlands during World War II. The Verhoeven house was near a German military base with V1 and V2-rocket launchers, which was repeatedly bombed by allied forces. Context: Verhoeven is a member of the Jesus Seminar, and he is the only member who does not have a degree in biblical studies. He graduated with a degree in mathematics and physics from the University of Leiden. Since he is not a professional biblical exegete, his membership in the Jesus Seminar has occasionally been cited by opponents of the Seminar as a sign that this group is less scholarly than it claims. For example, Luke Timothy Johnson criticizes the Jesus Seminar's methods on exegetical grounds, and also criticizes what he perceives to be a dependence on the theatrical and an attempt to manipulate the mainstream media. He singles out Verhoeven as a key player in the media activities of the Jesus Seminar. On the other hand, some Jesus Seminar members were unhappy with Verhoeven's portrayal of Jesus as an eschatological prophet. In 2007 Verhoeven wrote the book Jesus of Nazareth (Dutch: Jezus van Nazaret) about the life of Jesus of Nazareth. The book reviews the ideas of Jesus of Nazareth and the alleged corruption of these same ideas over the last 2,000 years. Co-written with Verhoeven's biographer Rob Van Scheers, the book is the culmination of the research Verhoeven conducted in preparation for Jesus: The Man, a motion picture about the life of Christ. The book tells about the Jewish uprising against Roman rule and characterizes Jesus as a radical political activist, downplaying any supernatural events and miracles as unproved or unprovable. Jesus of Nazareth: A Realistic Portrait was released in September 2008 in Dutch and was published in English in May 2010 by Seven Stories Press. Robert J. Miller, author of Born Divine, said about Jesus of Nazareth, \\"Verhoeven breaks down the gospels...and reassembles them into a unique...reconstruction of the historical Jesus.\\" In April 2010, Verhoeven hinted that his next potential film project would be an adaptation of a \\"Hitchcockian\\" computer game set in 1914. Although he would not reveal the title, there was speculation that the project might be an adaptation of The Last Express, a 1997 game designed by Prince of Persia creator Jordan Mechner. In October 2011, Verhoeven confirmed The Last Express as the identity of the game in question, and revealed that he is even considering filming it in 3D. Mechner has gone on record as saying he is a fan of Verhoeven's Jesus of Nazareth (JON). Verhoeven's interpretation of JON will reportedly include Jesus as an exorcist, and a believer in the Kingdom of God on Earth. Question: Is he involved in charity work?.

Gasps reverberated around the UK when it was revealed that Joe Miller, the seemingly kind and caring on-screen husband of Olivia Colman, was the Broadchurch resident who had killed Danny Latimer. At the very end of series one, ITV confirmed the drama would return but Matthew has spent nearly two years pretending he wasn't part of any of it. The 38-year-old told Newsbeat: \\"I had to deny that I was doing the second series since filming started, if not before. \\"That's a good year of technically being 'unemployed', even though I wasn't. \\"Only a very close-knit group knew the truth; my wife, my dad and my sisters, and that was it.\\" But surely isn't it that the beauty of Broadchurch? Producers are so desperate to keep the audience guessing that they even put special measures in place during filming to stop leaks. \\"The secrecy certainly helps,\\" said Matthew. \\"It's the anticipation and the excitement; nobody knows what's going on or is able to spoil it for anyone else.\\" Nearly eight million tuned into the first episode of the new series. By uttering the words 'not guilty' to a crime fans are sure he committed, Joe Miller fast became one of the most hated men on TV. With so many people emotionally involved in the story, we asked Matthew if anyone has ever confused him with his on-screen character? \\"I haven't had anyone throwing things or wagging their fingers at me on the street, so at the moment I'm safe,\\" he said. The dad-of-two says that although he has concerns that some viewers may see him as a villain in real-life because of who his character is, he was desperate to take on the role. \\"From the beginning, there was a massive part of me that wanted to be the killer,\\" he admitted. \\"For most of series one I really didn't think I would be, I only found out ahead of the filming of the final episode. I thought it would shatter Olivia's character, and it did.\\" So far in series two, Matthew has spent much of his time stuck in a glass box in a court room, and he told us there were two things he missed, the seaside and his cast mates, particularly one. \\"Olivia's brilliant,\\" he told us. \\"Nobody's got a bad word to say about her, she's just very good and it makes you better. \\"We all get on really well which made the second series more frustrating because I couldn't mess about, I was stuck away from them.\\" Before Broadchurch aired, Matthew had no idea how big it would become, but he said he did have an inkling during the first read-through with the rest of the cast. \\"When I was sitting around the table for the first time and I saw all these brilliant people, I did think, 'oooh, this could be quite good,' but I had no idea of the scale until the first episode went out.\\" But don't even bother asking Matthew about what happens in episode two or three. \\"Wouldn't you like to know...\\" Ok, will there will be a third series? Will he be in it? \\"Who knows?\\" We reckon he has a better idea than most, but Matthew is wise to the questions, he also believes that deep down none of us actually want him to let anything slip. He said: \\"People ask, 'who did it?' or 'where's it going to go?', but nobody really wants to know. It's all part of the fun of it, it's just a wry question.\\" And you know what? He's probably right.

This is the only mention of prisoners taken throughout the war. Gunib was relieved the next day. North up the canyon was Gerghebil which was considered the key to the relief of Kunzakh. On 7 or 8 January 2686 men began the attack. On 26 January the place fell to a night attack. Todorsky justified the heavy losses on the grounds that difficult victories demoralized the enemy. Two days later Khunzakh was relieved for a second time. The next move was north down the canyon to Arikani and Gimry. Arikani fell on 14 February. Gimry had been battered by artillery from late December, ninety percent of the village being destroyed. On 18 February it surrendered. With the core area occupied other places began to surrender.

Generate a detailed description of this data","response":"This data pertains to various aspects of the music genre and its intricacies, specifically focusing on the relationship between Abradab, Hip hop music, Drum and bass, and Disco. These elements are interconnected in the world of music, growing from one another or evolving in similar or distinct directions. In this detailed description, each of these music-related elements will be individually analyzed and their connections highlighted. 1. Abradab: Abradab is a musical group or artist that is associated with the genre of Hip hop music. They prominently use elements from the hip hop universe to create and express their musical identity. From this data, it can be inferred that Abradab is involved in the hip hop community, contributing to its soundscape and engaging with its audience. 2. Hip hop music: Hip hop music, also referred to as rap music, is a genre that originated in the African American and Latinx communities of the Bronx in New York City during the 1970s. It encompasses various stylistic elements, such as rapping (a vocal delivery technique), DJing, breakdancing, and graffiti art. Hip hop music has various derivatives and subgenres, with numerous musical acts and bands contributing to its evolution and growth over time. This data highlights the genre's significance to Abradab, the influence of Drum and bass, and its beginnings rooted in Disco music. 3. Drum and bass: Drum and Bass is a genre of electronic music characterized by its fast tempo, energetic beats, and heavy basslines. It originated in the early 1990s in the United Kingdom, drawing influences and samples from various styles, such as breakbeat, techno, and reggae. Based on this data, Drum and bass is a derivative of Hip hop music, indicating that some of its elements or influences can be traced back to the hip hop genre. This connection suggests an overlap of stylistic features and a shared musical history between the two genres. 4. Disco: Disco is a genre of dance music that emerged in the mid-1970s, originating from various urban nightclubs in the United States. It is characterized by its use of four-on-the-floor bass drum patterns, orchestral arrangements, and syncopated guitar riffs. Disco music played a significant role in shaping the stylistic origin of Hip hop music. As stated in the data, Disco served as a foundation upon which Hip hop music was built. Early Hip hop DJs would use Disco tracks to create breaks for MCs to rap over, developing the sound that would later define the genre. In conclusion, this data provides insights into the interconnectedness of different music genres and subgenres, including the influence of Disco on the formation of Hip hop music and the subsequent development of Drum and bass as a derivative of Hip hop.

The plan, which would allow nurses with advanced training to broaden their responsibilities for patients, is drawing attention to a bitter debate over the relative roles of doctors and nurses. Because of VA’s high visibility, it is likely to be closely watched. The agency, through amended regulations, wants to give vast new authority to its most trained nurses to order and read diagnostic tests, administer anesthesia, prescribe medications and manage acute and chronic diseases — without a doctor’s oversight. [In fight between nurses and doctors, the nurses are slowly winning.] VA would follow the lead of the military and 21 states and the District of Columbia that have expanded the scope of practice for nurse midwives, nurse practitioners and nurse anesthetists in a variety of medical fields. The agency says it is acting to meet a growing demand for care from veterans, both from the Vietnam era and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, amid a shortage of physicians on its staff. These nurses, who have advanced degrees, could practice independently even in the 29 states that still restrict what they can do, as long as they work for VA. [VA chief compares waits for veteran care to Disneyland] The proposal was published this week in the Federal Register as a scandal over veterans’ long waits for medical appointments erupted anew. VA Secretary Robert McDonald was widely criticized for dismissing wait times as a proper measure of veterans’ satisfaction, comparing them with visitors to Disneyland who he said care more about the amusement park itself than how long they wait to go on a ride. “The purpose of this proposed regulation is to ensure VA has authority to address staffing shortages in the future,” David J. Shulkin, VA’s undersecretary for health, said in a statement on the agency’s website. About 6,500 of VA’s 93,000 nurses have advanced training and would see their duties expanded, officials said. The agency is trying to hire 3,800 doctors, but it is also short about 8,713 registered nurses. Nurse practitioners are trained to provide many of the same primary care functions as doctors. But state laws have blocked them from diagnosing, prescribing drugs and other services. [More nurses are better for patients. Why is to hard to get hospitals to hire them?] In its proposed rule, VA said its goal is to “increase veterans’ access to VA health care by expanding the pool of qualified health care professionals who are authorized to provide primary health care and other related health care services” to the “full extent” of their education, training and certification. But while groups that represent nurses praised the plan, it came under immediate fire from some of the country’s largest doctors’ groups, which said VA would be lowering the standard of care for veterans. Nurses lack training and skills to administer anesthesia and diagnose complicated illnesses by themselves, opponents said, particularly in a population with a vast array of medical issues. “The nation’s top health care systems rely on physician-led teams to achieve improved care and patient health, while reducing costs,” Stephen R. Permut, board chair of the American Medical Association, the nation’s most prominent physician organization, said in a statement. “We expect the same for our country’s veterans,” Permut said. ” All patients deserve access to physician expertise, whether for primary care, chronic health management, anesthesia, or pain medicine.” The American Society of Anesthesiologists, which represents 53,000 physicians, also opposed the proposed policy, saying that “removing anesthesiologists from surgery and replacing them with nurses” would be “lowering the standard of care and jeopardizing Veterans’ lives.” The group said nurse anesthetists have half the education and a fraction of the training of physicians. The group plans to hold a press conference Wednesday to denounce the VA plan. Asked at a hearing in March whether nurses would do the jobs of anesthesiologists under the change, McDonald and Shulkin assured House lawmakers that they would not. On Thursday, the lawmaker who asked the question, said he was misled. “The secretary assured me, and I believed him,” said Rep. David Jolly (R-Fla.). VA officials could not immediately be reached for a response. Military hospitals have long given nurses with advanced training similar authority. But opponents said the patient populations are very different. Active-duty soldiers and retirees tend to be in better health than many veterans. “The average person who is active-duty military is generally in good health,” said Rupa Dainer, an anesthesiologist who practiced at military hospitals for 19 years and is now in private practice. “The veteran population is different,” she said. “When a nurse has a patient with complications, they ask for help, but that’s not what would happen here.” The American Association of Nurse Anesthetists said in a statement that VA would follow a common practice for combat nurses in the field. “Improving the [Veterans Health Administration’s] ability to provide better, faster care to our veterans doesn’t necessarily require increasing budgets or staff,” the group’s president, Juan Quintana, said in a statement. “One solution has been there all along, and is as simple as removing bureaucratic barriers to [advanced-degree nurses’] ability to be credentialed and practice to the full extent of their education, training and certification.” The American Nurses Association, in a statement, said longstanding limits on the scope of care for nurses with advanced training is what has harmed veterans, because staff shortages let backlogs and wait lists grow longer. The proposed rule will be open for comment for 60 days. Correction: An earlier version of this post misstated Stephen R. Permut’s role at the American Medical Association. He is the board chair. It also misstated the number of states that have not expanded nurses’ allowed services. The correct number is 29.","response":"Title: \\"Expanding Nurse Authority: Controversial Proposal Sparks Bitter Debate Over Patient Care and Staffing Shortages in Veterans Affairs Health System\\" In this article, the author discusses a proposal by the Department of Veterans Affairs to expand the medical authority of nurses, allowing them to treat patients without the supervision of a doctor. The proposal intends to give highly trained nurses the ability to order and read diagnostic tests, manage diseases, and administer anesthesia, among other responsibilities.

As Tracy's first big break was a spot on Russell Simmons Presents Def Comedy Jam, it is no surprise that the \\"godfather of hip-hop\\" reached out to the funnyman to check in with his long-time friend. With both of their permission, we give you the full transcript of their conversation. Russell Simmons: I've known you since the beginning of your career and have always thought you were one of the funniest guys in the game. Ever since I saw you on Def Comedy Jam, I knew you were going to be extraordinarily successful. But, I gotta be honest, I was quite disappointed when I read about your comments you made about having a gay son and about gay people in general. Tracy Morgan: I guess the reason I am successful is because I am so unfiltered. And sometimes as a result I say really stupid shit. The truth is if I had a gay son, I would love him just as much as if he was straight ... I might have to try to love even more because I know of the difficulty that he would have in society. Russell: Having fought for decades for the gay community in their struggle to be treated fairly and with dignity, I think you know you crossed the line. However, I know you...I know you very well. And I know that deep down inside there is no hate in your heart. Tracy: Of all the sicknesses, there is probably none more abusive than homophobia. My heart is committed to giving everyone the same rights that I deserve for myself. I don't care if you love the same sex as long as you have the ability to love someone. Also, you should have the right no matter who you are to protect and serve our country. I am deeply sorry for the comments I made. What I am most sad about is the comments I made about kids and bullying. I would never want any young person to think that I wasn't on their side and if any young person thinks they can bully a young gay kid, come see me at 30 Rock. On the corner, I would be happy to meet you. Or Brooklyn if you can't make it into Manhattan. |||||","response":"Tracy Morgan, a star from \\"30 Rock\\", was criticized for an anti-gay standup performance. This led to vigorous reaction from numerous entities including gay activists, his colleagues, his bosses such as Tina Fey and NBC's Bob Greenblatt. In an attempt to reconcile, Morgan took part in conversations with officials from the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD). He also planned to meet with gay youth who have been disowned by their families due to their sexual orientation, and with individuals who have lost family members to anti-gay violence. Morgan opened up about his past experiences with bullying and shared his empathy for people who feel different or ostracized in society. He also expressed regret for his actions and made it clear that he didn't mean to hurt anyone with his comedy. Drawing from personal experience, he emphasized that parents should support and love their children unconditionally, and that gay citizens should be given the same rights and protections as everyone else, a belief which he advocates should be upheld by the law. As part of his commitment to make amends, Morgan also planned to be part of a GLAAD press conference in Tennessee, protesting the state's recent \\"Don't Say Gay\\" law. This bill prohibits the discussion of homosexuality before ninth grade in public schools. Alongside this, he also deliberated on filming a Public Service Announcement. GLAAD President Jarrett Barrios lauded Morgan's decision to apologize and express support for the gay and transgender community. He hoped that Morgan's stance would inspire others and increase awareness about the treatment of gay and transgender youth who faced rejection from their families and those who lost loved ones to anti-gay violence. After Morgan's controversial standup routine in Tennessee, Russell Simmons, known as the \\"godfather of hip-hop\\", engaged in a conversation with him addressing the issue. Even though Simmons expressed his disappointment over Morgan's actions, he acknowledged Morgan's lack of malice and his support for equal rights. Morgan expressed remorse for his comments, especially those related to children and bullying. He emphasized his readiness to defend any young person who was being bullied for their sexual orientation. To further mitigate the situation and promote inclusivity, he invited anyone who considered bullying young gay individuals to meet with him personally."},{"question":"Write the next sentence.

But the decision - and the abrupt way it was executed - represents a dramatic end to a strained relationship. Tillerson learned of his firing by an early-morning Trump tweet, according to Steve Goldstein, undersecretary of state. White House officials disputed that notion, and promptly fired Goldstein. The move left some of Trump's staunchest defenders with mixed feelings. “It’s all very Trumpian,” said James Carafano of the conservative Heritage Foundation, who helped staff the State Department as a member of Trump’s transition team. “When the president makes changes, he just abruptly makes them.” During his 14 months at the State Department, Tillerson had numerous policy differences with Trump - and the friction frequently played out in public. The animosity peaked in October, when news surfaced that Tillerson reportedly called Trump a “moron” following a July Pentagon meeting. Tillerson never explicitly denied the account. Tillerson also publicly disagreed with Trump’s decision to pull out of the Paris climate accord. He reportedly opposed Trump’s decision to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. And Tillerson sometimes took a tougher stance than Trump on Russia — including this week, when he blamed Moscow for a suspected nerve agent attack in Britain. In return, Trump on numerous occasions publicly undermined his top diplomat, including in October when he tweeted Tillerson was “wasting his time” trying to negotiate with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. When Trump ultimately made his decision last week to... Question: What was trump probably wearing during the time he was addressing the press?

Available choices: -yes. -it is not possible to tell. -no.","response":"Yes, we can conclude that \\"You should put down your gauntlet.\\" The statement \\"Put your Gauntlet down.\\" can be understood as an imperative form of speech, essentially instructing someone to perform an action, in this case, placing their gauntlet down. When we rephrase the statement to \\"You should put down your gauntlet,\\" it carries the same essential message. However, the use of the word 'should' makes it sound like a recommendation or suggestion, rather than a direct command. So, both expressions convey the same basic idea but differ slightly in tone. The first version is giving a direct instruction, while the second version is providing advice or a recommendation. Nevertheless, both phrases suggest placing the gauntlet down as the desired outcome."},{"question":"Answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What are the first names of the three individuals who, in the original line-up, contributed to the band's lyrics?, using the article: Slayer is an American thrash metal band from Huntington Park, California. The band was formed in 1981 by vocalist and bassist Tom Araya and guitarists Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman. Slayer's fast and aggressive musical style made them one of the founding \\"big four\\" bands of thrash metal, alongside Metallica, Megadeth and Anthrax. Slayer's current lineup comprises King, Araya, drummer Paul Bostaph and guitarist Gary Holt. Hanneman and drummers Dave Lombardo and Jon Dette are former members of the band. In the original line-up, King, Hanneman and Araya contributed to the band's lyrics, and all of the band's music was written by King and Hanneman. The band's lyrics and album art, which cover topics such as murder, serial killers, necrophilia, torture, genocide, human experimentation, Satanism, hate crimes, terrorism, religion, antireligion, Nazism and war, have generated album bans, delays, lawsuits and criticism from religious groups and factions of the general public. However, its music has been highly influential, often being cited by many bands as an influence musically, visually and lyrically; the band's third album, Reign in Blood (1986), was described as one of the heaviest and most influential thrash metal albums. Slayer has released twelve studio albums, two live albums, a box set, six music videos, two extended plays and a cover album. Four of the band's studio albums have received gold certification in the United States. The band has received five Grammy Award nominations, winning one in 2007 for the song \\"Eyes of the Insane\\" and one in 2008 for the song \\"Final Six\\", both of which were from the album Christ Illusion (2006). Between 1991 and 2013, the band sold five million albums in the United States. After 37 years of recording and performing, Slayer announced in January 2018 that they would embark on their final world tour, which began that May and is estimated to wrap up in 2019 or 2020., what would be the answer ?

From 1961 until his death he worked at the British Museum, where he became the Chief Conservator of Ceramics and Glass in 1983. There his work included the successful restorations of the Sutton Hoo helmet and the Portland Vase. Joining as an assistant at age 16, Williams spent his entire career, and most of his life, at the British Museum. He was one of the first people to study conservation, not yet recognised as a profession, and from an early age was given responsibility over high-profile objects. In the 1960s he assisted with the re-excavation of the Sutton Hoo ship-burial, and in his early- to mid-twenties he conserved many of the objects found therein: most notably the Sutton Hoo helmet, which occupied a year of his time. He likewise reconstructed other objects from the find, including the shield, drinking horns, and maplewood bottles. The \\"abiding passion of his life\\" was ceramics, and the 1970s and 1980s gave Williams ample opportunities in that field. After nearly 31,000 fragments of shattered Greek vases were found in 1974 amidst the wreck of HMS Colossus, Williams set to work piecing them together. The process was televised, and turned him into a television personality. A decade later, in 1988 and 1989, Williams's crowning achievement came when he took to pieces the Portland Vase, one of the most famous glass objects in the world, and put it back together. The reconstruction was again televised for a BBC programme, and as with the Sutton Hoo helmet, took nearly a year to complete. Williams died at age 47 of a heart attack while in Aqaba, Jordan, where he was working on a British Museum excavation. The Ceramics & Glass group of the Institute of Conservation awards a biennial prize in his honour, recognising his significant contributions in the field of conservation., can you guess it ?

More than 500,000 residents fled during this time because of persecution, increased poverty and better economic opportunities in the West or in other former Soviet republics. Emomali Rahmon came to power in 1992, defeating former prime minister Abdumalik Abdullajanov in a November presidential election with 58% of the vote. The elections took place shortly after the end of the war, and Tajikistan was in a state of complete devastation. The estimated dead numbered over 100,000. Around 1.2 million people were refugees inside and outside of the country. In 1997, a ceasefire was reached between Rahmon and opposition parties under the guidance of Gerd D. Merrem, Special Representative to the Secretary General, a result widely praised as a successful United Nations peace keeping initiative. The ceasefire guaranteed 30% of ministerial positions would go to the opposition. Elections were held in 1999, though they were criticized by opposition parties and foreign observers as unfair and Rahmon was re-elected with 98% of the vote. Elections in 2006 were again won by Rahmon (with 79% of the vote) and he began his third term in office. Several opposition parties boycotted the 2006 election and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) criticized it, although observers from the Commonwealth of Independent States claimed the elections were legal and transparent. Rahmon's administration came under further criticism from the OSCE in October 2010 for its censorship and repression of the media.

Discounting his collaboration with Dukas in the completion of Guiraud's unfinished Frédégonde, Saint-Saëns wrote twelve operas, two of which are opéras comiques. During the composer's lifetime his Henry VIII became a repertory piece; since his death only Samson et Dalila has been regularly staged, although according to Schonberg, Ascanio (1890) is considered by experts to be a much finer work. The critic Ronald Crichton writes that for all his experience and musical skill, Saint-Saëns \\"lacked the 'nose' of the theatre animal granted, for example, to Massenet who in other forms of music was his inferior\\". In a 2005 study, the musical scholar Steven Huebner contrasts the two composers: \\"Saint-Saëns obviously had no time for Massenet's histrionics\\". Saint-Saëns's biographer James Harding comments that it is regrettable that the composer did not attempt more works of a light-hearted nature, on the lines of La princesse jaune, which Harding describes as like Sullivan \\"with a light French touch\\".Although most of Saint-Saëns's operas have remained neglected, Crichton rates them as important in the history of French opera, as \\"a bridge between Meyerbeer and the serious French operas of the early 1890s\\". In his view, the operatic scores of Saint-Saëns have, in general, the strengths and weaknesses of the rest of his music – \\"lucid Mozartian transparency, greater care for form than for content ... There is a certain emotional dryness; invention is sometimes thin, but the workmanship is impeccable.\\" Stylistically, Saint-Saëns drew on a range of models. From Meyerbeer he drew the effective use of the chorus in the action of a piece; for Henry VIII he included Tudor music he had researched in London; in La princesse jaune he used an oriental pentatonic scale; from Wagner he derived the use of leitmotifs, which, like Massenet, he used sparingly.

The crisis began routinely. Eight PM Monday night, Eastern time , South Korea is engaging in a military drill after notifying the North . Midnight Eastern , four hours later, North Korea starts firing dozens of rounds of artillery onto a highly-populated South Korean island, killing two South Korean marines, injuring dozens more, including civilians. For more than an hour, North Korea unleashes a barrage of artillery, about 80 shells. South Korea scrambles F-16 fighter jets and returns fire almost immediately. 3:55 AM , President Obama is awakened by the national security adviser, Tom Donilon . 4:33 AM , the White House issues a written statement saying, \\" The United States strongly condemns this attack and calls on North Korea to halt its belligerent action.\\" 9:15, the Oval Office , Donilon and director of national intelligence , General James Clapper , brief the president. The US decides not to respond or escalate, urging South Korea to show restraint. In Seoul , South Korea 's President Lee Myung -bak meets with his generals and threatens \\"an enormous retaliation\\" if the North attacks again. In fact, this is the second attack from the North in eight months. In March, Pyongyang sank a South Korean ship, killing 46 sailors. Is all this a show of strength as North Korea 's ailing leader, Kim Jong Il , prepares to turn over power to his youngest son, Kim Jong-un ? Mr. KENNETH LIEBERTHAL (Asia Expert): The younger Kim is being encouraged to show that he can be strong, that he's a tough guy. And so this is probably not the last such provocation we're going to see. And these are really acts of war. MITCHELL: Special US envoy Stephen Bosworth , already in Beijing , pressed China today to get Pyongyang to stop its aggression. Mr. STEPHEN BOSWORTH: We strongly believe that a multilateral diplomatic approach is the only way to realistically resolve these problems. MITCHELL: China , along with the US, signed the armistice in 1953 that ended the Korean War , and is obligated to help police the cease-fire. But China has been reluctant, reports NBC Beijing bureau chief Adrienne Mong . ADRIENNE MONG reporting: China is unlikely to do America 's bidding, but this latest situation puts Beijing in a delicate position. As an ally of North Korea , it has considerable influence. But China is also concerned about regional stability and afraid of being overrun by refugees should North Korea collapse. MITCHELL: In recent days, North Korea also shocked the US by revealing that, despite tough sanctions, it has built a sophisticated uranium enrichment plant potentially capable of producing powerful atomic bombs. The Stanford nuclear expert who saw that plant briefed Secretary of State Clinton today. Tonight the president is calling South Korea 's president and the US officials here are hoping for a united front at the United Nations , even though that has not stopped North Korea before. Brian: We're watching this one very closely. Andrea Mitchell , part of WILLIAMS: ||||| SEOUL—North Korea fired artillery at a South Korean island near a disputed western maritime border Tuesday, killing two South Korean marines in a surprise barrage that kindled global worries about worsening relations between the countries. In the wake of North Korea's attack on a South Korean island, John Bussey looks at how the incident differs from past skirmishes and what role China might play to lower tensions between the two countries. Plus, making art out of beef fat. Victor Cha, Director of Asian Studies at Georgetown University, talks to Simon Constable about the implications of today's artillery rocket attack by North Korea on a South Korean island and whether it will lead to a full-scale war. A South Korean military unit on the island returned fire, while South Korean military officials scrambled fighter jets. At least 16 marines were injured, military officials said. Three civilians were injured, and the island's 1,200 residents were sent scrambling for bomb shelters. \\"The whole neighborhood is on fire,\\" said, Na Young-ok, a resident of the island, called Yeonpyeong, from a bomb shelter about an hour after the shelling began. South Korean officials condemned North Korea and warned that it would respond in kind to further provocations, while South Korean President Lee Myung-bak convened an emergency meeting of defense and security agencies. \\"The attack is a sheer act of provocation. Moreover, shooting indiscriminately on civilians cannot be forgiven,\\" said Hong Sang-pyo, spokesman for Mr. Lee. \\"Our military reacted immediately according to our combat rules. We will act sternly against any more provocation. North Korea should take the responsibility for this.\\" North Korea's official media late Tuesday said South Korea's military fired artillery into water on the North's side of the maritime border while conducting a drill, and that in response it fired the artillery at Yeonpyeong. A South Korean presidential spokeswoman said officials were exploring whether there was a link between the shelling and North Korea's earlier complaints about a large-scale exercise the South's military started this week. North Korea has complained in the past about exercises without retaliation, however, and the South's large-scale exercise wasn't taking place near the island. A History of Korean Tensions A detailed timeline of the recent skirmishes between North and South Korea. View Interactive The U.S. and European Union condemned the shelling, while Russia and China called for a cooling of tensions on the peninsula. Japan's government went on high alert, with Prime Minister Naoto Kan ordering cabinet members to step up information gathering and prepare for emergencies. \\"The United States is firmly committed to the defense of our ally, the Republic of Korea, and to the maintenance of regional peace and stability,\\" the White House press secretary said in a statement, referring to South Korea by its formal name. The White House said President Barack Obama plans to call South Korean President Lee Myung-bak to discuss the attack. The U.S. will stand \\"shoulder-to-shoulder\\" with South Korea over the incident, said White House Press Secretary Bill Burton . Mr. Burton called the attack \\"outrageous\\" and said the U.S. wants to send its condolences to South Korea. Mr. Burton said the U.S. will work with global leaders in the coming days to figure how to best deal with North Korea's attack. Col. David Lapan, the Pentagon spokesman, said that no additional U.S. military assets had been moved to the region, nor were any discussions of immediately holding military exercises planned. Catherine Ashton, the EU's foreign policy chief, called on the \\"North Korean authorities to refrain from any action that risks further escalation and to fully respect the Korean Armistice Agreement.\\" A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China, North Korea's main benefactor, called for peace and stability. \\"We hope all involved parties will do more to promote peace on the Korean Peninsula,\\" Hong Lei said during a regular news conference. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon also condemned the attack and conveyed his concerns to the Security Council's president, saying the attack was \\"one of the gravest incidents since the end of the Korean War.\\" British Ambassador Mark Lyall Grant, whose country holds the council presidency, said he is in discussions with other council members and the secretary-general and that a council meeting is likely to be held Wednesday. The incident comes after relations soured dramatically between the two Koreas over the past two years, as North Korea's totalitarian regime became angered at South Korea's decision to cut off economic assistance unless it ends its pursuit of nuclear weapons. The issue of North Korean nuclear weapons intensified over the weekend after the revelation that Pyongyang had already installed thousands of centrifuges to produce nuclear fuel at its Yongbyon nuclear facility The exchange of fire also comes less than two months after North Korean dictator Kim Jong Il began a process of transferring power to his son Kim Jong Eun, a process that analysts have said is likely to be volatile as the younger Kim grapples for authority over the North's military. The incident roiled financial markets in Asia, briefly sending the U.S. dollar sharply higher before it gave back some gains, on a flight from what are considered riskier investment. The Bank of Korea convened an emergency meeting to discuss potential effects. Several financial analysts quickly issued reports that said they didn't expect South Korea's stock market to be heavily affected. The episode adds to a list of more than 30 fatal or life-threatening attacks by the North against the South—including plane bombings, assassinations and naval skirmishes—since the two countries fought the Korean War in the 1950s. Most recently, a South Korean warship sank in March about 40 miles west of the island struck Tuesday. South Korea blamed North Korea for the sinking, citing an exploded torpedo it found and other evidence. South Korea Under Attack View Slideshow Associated Press A train-station TV screen in Seoul shows smoke pouring from Yeonpyeong island Tuesday. A spokesman for South Korea's Joint Chief of Staff said \\"scores of rounds\\" were fired by the North. The artillery was fired from positions south of the North Korean city of Haeju. Video captured by closed-circuit monitoring cameras on location showed people scrambling out of buildings as explosions rocked the island. The artillery fire came without warning at 2:34 p.m local time and lasted for 65 minutes, military officials said. About 250 residents escaped the island in fishing boats and arrived in the port city of Incheon two hours later. As the sun set three hours after the attack, fires continued burning in numerous homes and buildings and smoke covered the island, according to people there and on a nearby island called So-yeonpyeong. The incident shocked South Koreans, who have become accustomed through the years to brash statements and other provocations by North Korea. \\"If this leads to any other provocation, it really will be disturbing in many ways,\\" Song Young-min, an insurance consultant and military reservist, as he watched the news on his cellphone in downtown Seoul. Lee Eui-sup, who works at South Korea's National Pension Service, said he immediately suspected instability inside the North's leadership due to the succession process prompted the firing. \\"It is a serious problem but will soon disappear as it usually does, I believe,\\" Mr. Lee said. From the island of So-yeonpyeong, residents watched as the rockets hit the larger Yeonpyeong island. Some sent photos and cellphone videos of the attack to South Korean TV stations. \\"When I heard the artillery, I thought it was a usual military exercise, but then I noticed the fire and smoke,\\" said Lee Seung-yeon, a resident on the smaller island.

Source: Dow Jones Newswires The two Yeonpyeong islands are the easternmost of five small islands that are within close firing range of North Korea. All are just a few kilometers away from the maritime border known in South Korea as the Northern Limit Line, or NLL, that was drawn up by the United Nations after the end of the Korean War in 1953. The North has objected to the line since the early 1970s, arguing in part that the line forces its ships to take lengthy detours to international shipping lanes. Its objections intensified in the 1990s and led to two deadly skirmishes in the area in 1999 and 2002. In 2007, leaders of the two Koreas agreed to turn the area into a \\"peace zone.\\" That vaguely worded agreement was struck just ahead of a South Korean election by an outgoing government and never implemented. It was interpreted in North Korea as erasing the maritime border and in the South as keeping it. —Joe Lauria, Jieun Shin, In-soo Nam, Aaron Back and Megumi Fujikawa contributed to this article.

ABC has been answering questions about this issue since it was revealed the network paid Casey Anthony 200,000 in 2008. More recently, they paid Meagan Broussard for a photo she exchanged with former New York congressman Anthony Weiner. And they’ve had to make clear they did not pay for interviews with Jaycee Dugard or Nafissatou Diallo, whose conversation with Robin Roberts started airing Monday morning. “We’ve shown over a very long time, and as recently as this weekend, the gets are gettable and the interviews are achievable through good journalism and good work,” Schneider said by phone Monday afternoon. “These licensing deals had become a crutch, and an unnecessary one,” Schneider told Howard Kurtz. Kurtz reports that a broad review of practices, including this one, “found … that such payments could be approved at a relatively low level with little oversight, saddling the network with the fallout.” According to Kurtz, Ben Sherwood, the new president of ABC News, “concluded that the cash-register approach to journalism was starting to tarnish the network’s credibility, even though the practice was relatively infrequent.” If competition between ABC and NBC was partly responsible for the payments, as The New York Times has reported, perhaps NBC will now follow ABC’s lead. ||||| Casey Anthony's Parents -- 250,000 Doesn't Cut It!!!

Some of the president's frustrated allies have complained that a seeming reluctance to build relationships with more members of Congress and Washington insiders has made it difficult for him to get business done. Romney gets more personal. In the interview, which will air as part of the documentary \\"Obama Revealed: The Man, The President,\\" Obama suggested he is willing to build those relationships, but often turns down social engagements because he prioritizes time at home with his children. \\"Sometimes on the weekends, we may turn down the invitation to this or that or the other just because we're trying to carve out family time,\\" Obama said. \\"And I think that's sometimes interpreted as me not wanting to be out there slapping backs and wheeling and dealing. That really has more to do with just the stage we are in our lives.\\" Asked if things would change if he's elected to a second term, Obama said, \\"My hope is that getting past this election, people will have an opportunity to maybe step back and say, 'You know what? The differences that divide us aren't as important as the common bonds we have as Americans.' \\" \\"And some of that I'm sure will require additional effort on my part.

It was the GOP, he said, that made reaching across party lines nearly impossible. \\"If anything, I think I received a lot of criticism from my own party for going out of my way to try to solicit Republican cooperation,\\" Obama said. \\"The fact of the matter was that politically there was a decision that was made fairly early on, among some of their leadership, that said working with the president is not good politics.\\" Write highlights for this article.","response":"President Obama gave an interview to CNN and spoke about balancing his work as a president with being a parent.

Fact 2: Mollusks have a simple heart, which pumps the blood throughout the body. Given the two facts above, what kind of heart do mollusks have? Answer:","response":"Mollusks have a simple heart. Based on Fact 1 and Fact 2 provided, we can deduce that mollusks possess a circulatory system that includes one or two hearts responsible for pumping blood throughout their bodies. Furthermore, Fact 2 explicitly states that mollusks have a simple heart. Mollusks are a diverse group of invertebrates that includes organisms such as snails, clams, octopuses, and squids. Despite their diversity, many mollusks share common anatomical features, including their circulatory systems. The circulatory system of mollusks can be categorized into two types: open and closed. The open circulatory system is found in many mollusks, such as snails and clams; the closed circulatory system is more common in cephalopods like octopuses and squids. In an open circulatory system, the simple heart pumps blood through vessels that open into body cavities, allowing the blood to come into direct contact with tissues and organs. This system is considered less efficient than a closed circulatory system because the blood flows more slowly and doesn't deliver oxygen and nutrients to the tissues as effectively. On the other hand, closed circulatory systems are more advanced than open ones, with the heart pumping blood through a network of blood vessels that keep the blood separate from the body cavity. This system allows for faster blood flow and more efficient delivery of oxygen and nutrients to the body's tissues. Regardless of the type of circulatory system, the heart of mollusks remains simple in comparison to more complex organisms like vertebrates. Mollusk hearts typically consist of one or two chambers, with the primary function of propelling blood throughout the body. In conclusion, given the facts provided and the information about the circulatory systems of mollusks, it is clear that mollusks possess a simple heart designed to pump blood throughout their bodies. This simple heart may be a part of either an open or closed circulatory system, depending on the specific mollusk species in question."},{"question":"Article: These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

The deceased were identified as siblings - Yasmeen, 17; Josue, 11; Johnnie, 9, and Felipe. \\"The initiall call came from someone who showed up early (Monday) and saw everyone was sick,\\" Davis said. \\"It is unknown if the call was from a friend or relative.\\" Davis said first responders initially checked for, but did not find carbon monoxide in the home. They discovered that an occupant of the home had tried to fumigate the house using a fumigant or pesticide that contained aluminum phosphide, a chemical that, when mixed with water, creates phosphine gas which can cause respiratory failure. The fumigant was later identified as Weevil-Cide, which is used to, \\"Protect agains the most destructive pests, such as grain-boring insects, moths, weevils, beetles, and burrowing rodents,\\" according to UPI, the product manufacturer. It was unclear how long the home's residents had been exposed to the poisonous gas. \\"It's a very lethal chemical,\\" Davis said. \\"It causes pulmonary edema, and basically the lungs fill up with fluid. We don't know that that's the cause of death so far, but that's one of the more severe symptoms. It took us a long time to identify the chemicals.\\" Davis said the one of the home's occupants had reportedly tried to crawl under the home to wash some of the chemicals off, triggering the chemical reaction. The home at 1301 Carolyn is owned by Peter Balderas according to the Potter-Randall Appraisal District. Davis said he did not know whether the people inside the home owned or rented it. In addition to the people inside of the home, two members of the police department, seven fire fighters and one person from American Medical Response were taken to the hospital to get checked out. Davis said the first responders were taken as a precaution and showed no signs or symptoms of poisoning. AFD's HazMat team is leading the investigation. APD's Special Crimes unit was also called to the scene. Check back with the Globe-News for updates to this story. ||||| Several Amarillo, Texas authorities are on location where at least four people have died following a \\"HAZMAT incident\\" in Northeast Amarillo on Monday, Jan. 2, 2017. (KVII/Kase Wilbanks) AMARILLO, Texas (KVII) - Several Amarillo authorities were sent to a home where at least four children have died following a \\"HAZMAT incident\\" in Northeast Amarillo Monday morning. According to Amarillo Special Crimes, the Amarillo Fire Department is the main authority working the case at 1301 Carolyn St. Special Crimes said nine people were transported to the hospital and four people have died. The Amarillo Fire Department said there were 10 people inside the home when the incident occurred. When crews arrived at the scene just after 5 a.m. Monday, one minor died on scene. The other three died after being taken to the hospital. The oldest of those who have died due to this incident was 17 years old. One of the other people who were taken to the hospital is said to be unstable and in critical condition. According to Justice of the Peace Gary Jackson, those who died ranged in age from 7 years old to 17 years old. They have been identified as Felipe Balderas, 7; Josue Balderas, 11; Johnnie Balderas, 9; and Yasmeen Balderas, 17. Autopsies will be performed on the four children in Lubbock Tuesday morning, however, Jackson said those will probably come back pending toxicology. Jackson said the mother is still alive, but in serious condition. She has been airlifted to a Lubbock hospital. The father is in intensive care, but is in stable condition. The four other children who were in the home are also in stable condition in ICU. AFD said someone at the residence had placed a pesticide, which is now identified as Weevil-Cide, containing aluminum phosphide underneath the house. At some point, a person living at the home tried to wash away the pesticide with water. This caused a chemical reaction that created phosphine gas, which is extremely dangerous. Phosphine gas causes pulmonary edema and extreme respiratory distress. According to AFD, there are indications that the people in the home had been breathing the toxic gas for up to two days. According to Special Crimes, \\"No criminal charges appear to apply at this time.\\" AFD said numerous first responders from AFD, APD and AMR went to the hospital to get checked out and none of them appear to have any negative signs or symptoms from possible exposure. However, several firefighters are being held for observation as a precaution. Contractors with the Environmental Protection Agency were out at the home Monday evening after neighbors became concerned with the situation. A contractor tells ABC 7 News after taking measurements and testing, there is no danger to surrounding homes. The EPA will continue tests at the home on Tuesday. This is a developing story and will be updated as more information is received. |||||Summary:","response":"Four children died and at least five others were hospitalized in Amarillo, Texas, after a family member tried to wash away a pesticide that had been applied under their home. The water caused a chemical reaction, producing toxic phosphine gas. Fire Captain Larry Davis said that the incident was an accidental poisoning. The children who died were aged between seven and 17. The pesticide in question was aluminum phosphide, which when mixed with water produces phosphine gas, which can cause respiratory failure."},{"question":"PC Neil Doyle, 36, died after an early morning assault on a group of three officers near a city centre nightclub - just weeks before his honeymoon. The wife of murdered off-duty police constable Neil Doyle has described his death as 'a great loss' as it emerged a second man has been arrested on suspicion of his murder. Pc Doyle, a 36-year-old beat bobby, was attacked in Liverpool city centre in the early hours of yesterday morning during a Christmas night out with colleagues. Last night a 28-year-old man from Huyton was arrested on suspicion of murder after he handed himself in, Merseyside Police said. This evening a second man, from the same area, was also arrested on suspicion of murdering the police officer. The 30-year-old man was taken to a police station to be interviewed by detectives. The 28-year-old is still being questioned. The officer's wife, Sarah, 37, said: 'Neil was very well loved by all of his family, friends and colleagues and it is a great loss to us all. 'We are finding it extremely difficult to come to terms with what has happened and need time to be left to grieve.' The couple got married in July and were due to go on their honeymoon next month. A post-mortem examination concluded that Pc Doyle died from a fatal bleed around the brain. This was caused by damage to major blood vessels supplying the brain and is consistent with an assault. Pc Doyle was with two other off-duty officers when they were attacked by three men in Colquitt Street at around 3.15am. The attackers vanished when it became clear that Mr Doyle was seriously hurt. Officers and bouncers from a nearby club tried to revive him before paramedics arrived. His colleagues were both treated in hospital for facial injuries - one for a fractured cheekbone and the other for a less serious facial injury. Pc Doyle was attacked in Liverpool city centre near Aloha club during a Christmas night out with colleagues. Two other off-duty policemen, who were with the victim and were also assaulted, were taken to hospital but have since been discharged. A Merseyside Police spokesman said detectives were investigating the possibility that the officers were recognised from their work. 'It's one line of inquiry that we are looking at but it's by no means the set-in-stone motive,' he said. Pc Doyle, who joined the force in May 2004, was taken to the Royal Liverpool Hospital after the attack, but died a short time later. The officer was previously awarded a commendation for his actions in arresting three men after a violent robbery. He was based at Eaton Road police station in West Derby. Peter Singleton, chairman of Merseyside Police Federation, said the police community was 'devastated' by Pc Doyle's death. 'Devastated is the nearest word I can think of,' he said. 'His family, friends and colleagues are absolutely devastated. I spoke to the colleagues who were out with him and they were in absolute bits. 'He exemplified the British bobby. He was a solid, good, hard-working, honest copper. Losing a colleague like Neil in such a tragic way is absolutely devastating.' He added: 'He had commendations from the force for his good work. Sometimes it seems hollow and false to say these words but he really was a good, skilled, dependable cop, who would always do his best for the public. 'If you're a sergeant, police constables like Mr Doyle are exactly what you want. He will be sorely missed.' Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

Physicians who perform the procedure would face up to two years in prison , under the bill . Do they have the same meaning?","response":"To determine if the two sentences have the same meaning, let's break down each sentence and compare their individual components: Sentence 1: 1. Subject: \\"a physician who performs the procedure\\" 2. Action: \\"could face up to two years in prison\\" 3. Context: \\"Under the legislation\\" Sentence 2: 1. Subject: \\"Physicians who perform the procedure\\" 2. Action: \\"would face up to two years in prison\\" 3. Context: \\"under the bill\\" Now, let's compare these components: 1. Subject: Both sentences discuss physicians who perform the procedure, so the subjects are essentially the same. 2. Action: The first sentence uses \\"could face,\\" indicating a possibility, while the second sentence uses \\"would face,\\" suggesting a more definite outcome. This is a slight difference in meaning, with the first sentence being less certain about the consequences than the second sentence. 3. Context: Both sentences mention a legal context - \\"legislation\\" and \\"bill\\" are often used interchangeably in this context. Overall, the sentences have very similar meanings with a minor difference in the certainty of the consequence. The first sentence suggests that if a physician performs the procedure, they might face up to two years in prison, whereas the second sentence indicates that performing the procedure would definitely result in up to two years of imprisonment."},{"question":"Q:Generate a 4-star review (1 being lowest and 5 being highest) about an app with package net.nurik.roman.muzei.

Given medical case reports extracted from MEDLINE, the task is to classify whether the case report mentions the presence of any adverse drug reaction. Classify your answers into non-adverse drug event and adverse drug event. Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Evidence-based mental health use of anticonvulsants during pregnancy. Student:","response":"Part #1: Understanding of adverse drug reactions Usage: Adverse drug reactions are defined as any unwanted, harmful or unpleasant effects that occur from using a medication or other medical intervention. The reactions can be serious enough to require adjustments in the medication dosage, administering treatments to counteract the reaction or even removal of the medication. For example, if a patient develops a severe rash after taking a certain medication, it constitutes an adverse drug reaction. Part #2: Analyzing medical case reports from MEDLINE Usage: This task involves going through the case reports that have been taken from MEDLINE and identifying if there are any adverse drug reactions mentioned. MEDLINE is a large medical literature database, and the case reports published here can provide valuable real-world data. For example, a studied case report might detail a patient who had an adverse drug reaction due to an interaction between two medications. Part #3: The categorization of the results Usage: The results have to be classified into non-adverse drug event and adverse drug event. This means you need to sort observations based on whether or not an adverse drug event is mentioned in the case report. For instance, a case report that discusses a patient experiencing nausea after a specific drug administration would be classified as an 'adverse drug event', and one where a patient experienced no side effects would be classified under 'non-adverse drug event'. The information in the sample input \\"Evidence-based mental health use of anticonvulsants during pregnancy\\" would be processed by applying the above instructions. A student would read this information and determine whether it mentions any harmful or unpleasant reactions to the use of anticonvulsants during pregnancy and then categorize it as an adverse or non-adverse drug event."},{"question":"Plusieurs organisations internationales compétentes dans le domaine de l’environnement ont été saisies pour examiner la question : a.

Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","response":"If human pollution were to decrease, which is the perturbation you mentioned, it would have a positive effect in slowing down the rapid warming of the Earth. This is because there would be fewer greenhouse gas emissions, leading to less heat being trapped in the atmosphere. With less pollution, the concentration of greenhouse gases like CO2, methane, and nitrous oxide would be reduced. These gases are mainly produced due to human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes. By managing and reducing these activities, we could decrease the levels of these gases in the atmosphere. As a result of this decrease in pollution, the greenhouse effect (the trapping of the sun's heat and energy in the atmosphere) would be less intense.

Answer:","response":"The last step in the process of generating electricity from coal involves converting the kinetic energy generated by the rotating turbine blades into electrical energy. As the steam-powered turbine blades rotate at high speed, they drive the rotor of an electrical generator, which is made up of a set of tightly wound wire coils, often copper, located within a magnetic field. This movement of the rotor within the magnetic field induces a flow of electrons in the wire coils, resulting in the generation of an alternating current (AC). Once the electricity is generated, it needs to be sent to the power grid for distribution to various households, industries, and other consumers. To accomplish this, the generated electricity is first passed through a transformer, which raises its voltage to reduce energy losses during long-distance transmission. High-voltage transmission lines then carry the electricity from the power station to local substations. At the local substations, another set of transformers is used to lower the voltage to levels suitable for distribution to individual consumers. The electricity is then distributed through a complex network of power lines that includes overhead and underground lines, eventually reaching homes and businesses. In summary, the last step of the coal-fired power generation process involves converting the kinetic energy generated by the rotating steam turbines into electrical energy, which is then transmitted and distributed to consumers through an extensive network of transformers and power lines. This process highlights the intricate combination of mechanical, thermal, and electrical engineering principles necessary to facilitate the reliable delivery of electricity from coal resources."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Facts: - residence: kampala , uganda - title: '' industries limited \` chief executive officer '' ' quality chemical - years active: 1990s -- present - known for: investments , wealth - citizenship: uganda - birth date: 27 april 1962 - name: emmanuel katongole - ethnicity: muganda - nationality: ugandan - birth place: uganda - religion: roman catholic - alma mater: '' of education -rrb- -lrb- uganda advanced certificate of education -rrb- \` '' \` makerere university '' ' -lrb- bachelor of statistics namilyango -rrb- -lrb- ma economic policy & planning -rrb- college '' ' -lrb- uganda certificate - occupation: business executive Based on these bullet points, write a short biography describing the life of emmanuel katongole .

There's no mention of the lawmaker's name being directly referred to as \\"BJP,\\" \\"Bharatiya Janata Party,\\" \\"Indian,\\" \\"Modi,\\" \\"Narendra Modi,\\" \\"Uttar Pradesh\\". Therefore, these options are incorrect. The choice that fits best in this context is Babulal Gaur. The reason other answers are wrong is that they are not the names of the lawmaker in question and the comments are not attributed directly to BJP, Bharatiya Janata Party, Modi, Narendra Modi, Uttar Pradesh, or India.

Stream-of-consciousness explanation: When considering the possibility of a person naturally growing wings and flying like a bird, we must take into account several factors involving human anatomy and physics. Firstly, human bone structure is not designed for flight. Birds have specially adapted hollow bones that are lightweight and strong, while humans have dense bones optimized for walking and supporting body weight. Next, muscle distribution in a human body is centered around legs and torso, not in upper body regions where wings would ideally be located. Birds have strong pectoral muscles that power their wings, and these muscles are proportional to their body size. For humans to have a similar muscular advantage, we would need a significant change in our muscle distribution and size. Additionally, the energy required for sustained flight would be tremendous for a human. Birds have efficient respiratory systems that are able to extract more oxygen and process it more quickly, allowing them to maintain the energy needed for flying long distances. Human bodies are not optimized for that kind of activity. Lastly, birds have evolved with feathers – a lightweight and strong structure suitable for flight. Human skin would not provide the necessary lift or aerodynamics needed for flight, and we lack the genetic makeup to grow feathers naturally. Taking all these factors into account, the answer to the question is no: it is not possible for a person to naturally grow wings and fly like a bird."},{"question":"Can we draw the following hypothesis from the context (see options)?

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","response":"If the plates were to move more quickly past each other, it would directly impact a step of the process. Since the movement speed of the tectonic plates has increased, the force exerted between them would also increase more rapidly over time. This means that the crust has a higher likelihood of breaking sooner, and the stress, which leads to an earthquake, is released at a shorter interval. As a result of the more frequent release of stress, there might be more earthquakes, but they could potentially be weaker in intensity. This is because there's a lesser chance of a massive build-up of stress and force before the crust breaks, so the energy released in each earthquake might be lower than if the plates moved slower.

While travelling by train, Schaffner decides to evade authorities. He drugs and switches identities with fellow train passenger Paul Scarff, who looks like him and has a Mexican passport. He throws Paul Scarff off the train, injuring Scarff. Carl later discovers that Scarff is wanted in Mexico as a political assassin. Carl then tracks down Scarff, who is resting from his injuries, to get back his original passport. Carl arrives in Mexico and is captured by the local police, who mistake him for Scarff. Carl then fights to show his true identity to the local police. The plan seems foolproof until he is forced to care for the dog of Scarff's dog. The local police chief and Scotland Yard inspector Hadden conspire to keep him trapped in the Mexican border town of Katrina in an effort to get him to cross the bridge back into the U.S. and face justice. The misanthropic Schaffner has grown attached to Scarff's pet spaniel and is tricked into going across the dividing line of the bridge to get the dog. He is accidentally killed trying to escape the authorities.

More precisely, the emergency room phoned to ask if Ray had a bed. Ray pretended to consult his admission log, just as he always did. The nightly hospital call meant one of three things: the chemical dependency floor was full (highly unlikely), the individual in question had fallen under the hospital's \\"one treatment episode every three months\\" sanction (also known as the Black List, and only moderately unlikely), or the prospective client had no insurance (in Ray's experience, very likely). The folks at the hospital knew, as did Ray, that federal law prohibited him from turning away individuals requesting detoxification services if he had an open bed. The hospital was generous enough to spring for a cab voucher for the intoxicate. In Ray's experience as well, overnight admissions were less interested in detox than in free food, a free bed and complimentary meds. For his two hour paperwork investment and aggravation, he would receive the benefit of knowing the client slept until noon then slipped out the side door and into another binge. Any bills for service generated for the brief stay would return in a week or so stamped \\"No Such Address\\" or simply \\"Return to Sender\\". On average, the clients of addictions services managed to muster a raging 25% of them who would ever pay a dime toward their bill. The night shift admission payment percentages were a quarter of that quarter in good years. Thus, the frequent calls from the hospital. They had little better luck in getting good addresses (or even with those, a client who stayed sober long enough to give a shit). No one relished treating the uninsured and uninsurable. It was fiscal suicide. The hospital was perfectly willing to let the local experts in deadbeats handle the workload. Tonight, Ray could tell them no. He liked telling them no, especially when it was the truth. Question: Does the clinic Ray works at receive government funding?

The sentence says, \\"This is a sentence in Spanish.\\" Languages are like different ways people talk and write to help them understand each other."},{"question":"Article:It means \\"nothing happens\\" but people often use it reassuringly as in: \\"Don't worry about it, it's nothing.\\" When it comes to solving murders, \\"no pasa nada\\" is a pretty accurate description. According to Mexico's statistics institute, 98% of homicides in 2012 went unsolved. The culture of impunity is frightening. The 31 July murder of photojournalist Ruben Espinosa along with four women in a middle-class neighbourhood of Mexico City is a crime that many fear will once again go unsolved. Mr Espinosa worked as a photojournalist in the eastern state of Veracruz for the investigative magazine Proceso, among others. He had recently left Veracruz for Mexico City because of safety fears. Veracruz is the most dangerous place to be a journalist in Mexico, which itself is deemed one of the most dangerous countries for journalists. Nationwide, 88 journalists have been murdered since 2000, according to free speech organisation Article 19. Fourteen journalists from Veracruz state alone have died since current governor Javier Duarte took office in 2010. That makes Veracruz the most lethal state for journalists out of Mexico's 31 states and its federal district. Relations between the Veracruz governor and the media have been tense. In July, Governor Duarte accused some journalists of having criminal ties. He went on to warn them to \\"behave\\", arguing that if anything were to happen to them, it would be him who would be \\"crucified\\". Some local journalists saw this as a thinly veiled threat against them. Human rights investigator Patrick Timmons says that while Veracruz may currently be the most risky place for journalists in Mexico, other states are not immune from violence against the media. \\"We have to understand that what we're seeing in Veracruz has happened in other states and it will happen in other states too,\\" he warns. Mexican authorities investigating the multiple murder said they were keeping all lines of investigation open, including robbery. But friends and relatives of Mr Espinosa think he was deliberately targeted, pointing to the execution-style nature of the killing. All five victims were shot in the head. Mr Espinosa's body showed signs of torture and three of the four women were raped. So far, one suspect has been arrested. Investigators said his fingerprints had been found at the crime scene and matched to a database which showed he had a criminal record for rape and assault. But Emily Edmonds-Poli, associate professor of political science at the University of San Diego and author of a paper on violence against journalists in Mexico, is sceptical. \\"That's so old-hat in Mexico, you pick up the nearest criminal and you accuse them of the crime,\\" she said. \\"I don't believe anyone is fooled by that,\\" she added, Many of the journalists killed in Mexico reported on organised crime and drug trafficking, considered inherently risky beats. But Prof Edmonds-Poli thinks their killings should not be dismissed that easily. \\"Many of them have covered corruption beats or politics, they are not necessarily chasing ambulances and trying to report on cartel activities,\\" she argues. She says that \\"it's the nexus between drug-trafficking organisations and the government, and that's why this really isn't solely a drug-related issue\\". \\"It's about how the state deals with being exposed,\\" she adds. The fact that Mr Espinosa was killed in Mexico City after having fled Veracruz, where he had received death threats, is seen by many as a dark development. Mexico City had for several years been seen as a safe haven, a bubble for journalists. But that bubble has now burst. Free speech group Article 19 argues that Mr Espinosa's murder marks a new level of violence against journalists in Mexico. \\"If you get pursued into Mexico City, that shows another level of determination on the part of people who are interested in silencing journalists,\\" said Emily Edmonds-Poli. Ruben Espinosa's murder shows that it is no longer true that in Mexico City \\"no pasa nada\\". Summarize the main points of that article.","response":"In Mexico, many journalists are getting hurt or killed because they are reporting on dangerous topics like crime and corrupt politicians. The situation is really bad in a place called Veracruz. Recently, a journalist named Ruben Espinosa was killed in Mexico City, along with four women. People are worried that this crime will not be solved, just like many other crimes in Mexico. This makes it very scary for journalists who want to report the truth. Some people think the government is also involved in hurting these journalists because they don't want their secrets exposed."},{"question":"3G gets jittery with new super fast rival The latest contender, Flash OFDM technology carries data 10 times faster and is cheaper than 3G phone networks.

Boult, unlike many of his contemporaries, preferred the traditional orchestral layout, with first violins on the conductor's left and the seconds on the right. Of the practice of grouping all the violins together on the left, he wrote, \\"The new seating is, I admit, easier for the conductor and the second violins, but I firmly maintain that the second violins themselves sound far better on the right. ... When the new fashion reached us from America somewhere about 1908 it was adopted by some conductors, but Richter, Weingartner, Walter, Toscanini and many others kept what I feel is the right balance.\\"This care for balance was an important feature of Boult's music-making. Orchestral players across decades commented on his insistence that every important part should be heard without difficulty. His BBC principal violist wrote in 1938, \\"If a woodwind player has to complain that he has already been blowing 'fit to burst' there is trouble for somebody.\\" The trombonist Ray Premru wrote forty years later, \\"One of the old school, like Boult, is so refreshing because he will reduce the dynamic level – 'No, no, pianissimo, strings, let the soloist through, less from everyone else.' That is the old idea of balance.\\"As an educator, Boult influenced several generations of musicians, beginning with his conducting class at the Royal College of Music, London, which he ran from 1919 to 1930. As no such classes had been held before in Britain, Boult \\"created its curriculum from out of his own experience. ... From that first small class has come all the later formal training for conductors throughout Britain.\\" In the 1930s Boult ran a series of \\"conferences for conductors\\" at his country house near Guildford, sometimes helped by Vaughan Williams who lived a few miles away. From 1962 to 1966 he again taught at the Royal College of Music. In later life, he made time for young conductors who sought his counsel. Among those who studied with or were influenced by Boult were Colin Davis, James Loughran, Richard Hickox and Vernon...

When he walks out of the movie room to go to the restroom, the noise from the movie is (A) louder (B) quieter. Do not use A and B to answer the question but instead, choose between \\"noise out of theatre\\" and \\"noise in theatre\\". The answer is:","response":"When Cal walks out of the movie room to go to the restroom, the noise from the movie becomes quieter as he moves away from the source of noise. In such a scenario, we can compare the noise levels experienced by Cal inside and outside the movie room, using the given options. Within the movie room, the environment is carefully controlled to provide the best audiovisual experience. The audio system is designed to provide maximum impact and clarity within the enclosed space of the theatre. Soundproofing materials on the walls, ceilings, and floors reduce noise from escaping the room while improving overall acoustics. Additionally, the volume and surround sound system are adjusted to the ideal level for audiences to immerse themselves in the movie experience. When Cal walks out of the movie room and moves closer to the restroom, the noise from the movie becomes \\"noise out of theatre.\\" This noise is quieter than if Cal were still seated in the movie room. Several factors contribute to the difference in noise level: 1. Distance: As Cal moves further away from the speakers in the movie room, the noise naturally becomes quieter due to the way sound waves travel and spread out in the air. Additionally, there's the inverse square law, which states that sound intensity decreases in proportion to the square of the distance from the source. 2. Building design: The movie theatre's walls and doors are intentionally built with soundproofing materials to prevent noise pollution and keep the immersive movie experience contained within the screening room. This design helps reduce the noise that escapes from the movie room and results in quieter noise outside. 3. Ambient noise: In spaces like the lobby, corridors, or restroom, there may be other sources of noise such as people talking, background music, or appliances running. These additional sounds can distract Cal from hearing the movie noise, contributing to the perceived decrease in volume. In conclusion, the noise experienced by Cal becomes quieter as he walks out of the movie room and heads towards the restroom. Therefore, the answer to the question is \\"noise out of theatre.\\""},{"question":"Mielestämme esittelijä on laatinut mietinnön, jossa on oleellisesti paremmat direktiiviehdotukset kuin komission laatimat.

We have a theory: Their polo buddy, Indian ambassador Arun K. Singh, got them in on the DL. In the photo album Michaele Salahi posted on her Facebook page after the event, one photo stands out among all those of the crashers smiling next to famous media personalities, politicians and Joe Bidens: A picture with one \\"Ambassador Singh\\": This is Arun K. Singh, Deputy Chief of Mission for the Indian Embassy, and he has chilled with the Salahis before. Here they are drinking wine at a September 9th event hosted by the Indian Embassy to announce America's Polo Cup, a 2010 India Vs. USA polo match organized by Tareq Salahi and co-sponsored by Indian Ambassador Meera Shankar: A (terribly reproduced) picture of the three even made October edition of the Indian Embassy's newsletter. Ambassador Singh is quoted in the Indian Express as saying \\"the polo match between India and the US next year to be played at the National Mall reflects another dimension of the growing relationship between the two countries.\\" In that same article, Michaele Salahi is quoted as saying the match \\"aspires to bring the love of the game to a wider audience and bring international cultures together...\\" So, Singh and the Salahis are polo buddies. They go way back. Furthermore, Tareq Salahi's only statement to the Washington Post's Reliable Source blog after crashing the state dinner was \\"India is the challenger in the America's Polo Cup World Championships June 11/12 2010, and they are very excited in this first ever cultural connection being hosted on the DC National Mall since Polo is one of the primary sports in India.\\" This suggests a polo-motivated party crashing. Based on this knowledge, here are a couple theories of how Singh helped the Salahis crash the White House. 1) Singh invited the Salahis to the dinner as a reward for their work on the India Vs. USA polo match, but for some reason their names didn't make it on the official guest list. When they showed up and were turned away (Brian Williams told the Times the couple's car was turned away by the first ring of Secret Service, after which they \\"hopped out\\") they called up Arun K. Singh: \\"Dude, you said we were on the list!\\" Singh spoke to the Secret Service and got them in. 2) The Salahis showed up uninvited, confident that they could use their Singh connection to get in the party. After being turned away, they either name-dropped Singh or got him to vouch for them to the Secret Service. Either way, the Salahis weren't just some randos who showed up at the White House and schmoozed their way past the Secret Service with their fancy clothes. The Salahis knew somebody; they likely leveraged their connection to Arun K. Singh—the Indian Embassy's polo liaison—to crash the state dinner and successfully roll their way to immortal fameball-dom. The Salahis will be appearing on Larry King Live Monday, where they will maybe prove our theory correct. Stay tuned! UPDATE: Talking Points Memo has a statement from the Indian Embassy: \\"Neither the embassy nor anyone from the embassy was involved in any way in their getting into the White House. Nor did we request any invitation for them.\\" ||||| The White House has released a photo showing that the couple who crashed President Barack Obama's first state dinner actually shook hands and talked to him — contradicting earlier Secret Service claims that Obama was never endangered by the security breach. As the White House was disclosing that the couple, Michaele and Tareq Salahi, met Obama in the receiving line, a \\"deeply concerned and embarrassed\\" Secret Service on Friday acknowledged that its officers never checked whether the two were on the guest list before letting them onto the White House grounds. The White House released a photo showing the Salahis in the receiving line in the Blue Room with Obama and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, in whose honor the dinner was held. Obama and reality TV hopeful Michaele Salahi are smiling as she grasps his right hand with both of hers and her husband looks on. Singh is standing to Obama's left. The Secret Service had said previously that the president was not in danger because the couple — like others at the dinner — had gone through magnetometers. But in light of their close proximity to the president, no such claim was made Friday. \\"This incident compromised the safety and security of the president and undermined our confidence in the protection we expect of the Secret Service,\\" said Rep. Edolphus Towns, chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. 'Embarrassed' Disturbed by the agency's failure \\"to follow basic security procedures,\\" the New York Democrat said in a statement Saturday he wants a review of Secret Service practices and has asked for a briefing next week. Video: Charges looming? The Salahis were not on the guest list and should have been barred from entering last Tuesday's dinner on the White House South Lawn for the prime minister of India, said Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan. Sullivan said the agency that protects the president is \\"deeply concerned and embarrassed\\" that procedures were not followed. \\"As our investigation continues, appropriate measures have been taken to ensure this is not repeated,\\" Sullivan said in a written statement. \\"The preliminary findings of our internal investigation have determined established protocols were not followed at an initial checkpoint, verifying that two individuals were on the guest list,\\" Sullivan said. \\"Although these individuals went through magnetometers and other levels of screening, they should have been prohibited from entering the event entirely. That failing is ours.\\" Agency spokesmen declined comment Saturday on reports that agents had visited the Salahis' vineyard in Hume, Virginia, in search of the couple. Voice mail messages left Saturday at two separate telephone numbers for the Oasis Winery, south of Washington, were not immediately returned. Secret Service spokesman Jim Mackin said officers at the checkpoint had a clipboard with names of the invited guests. Even though the Salahis names weren't on it, they were allowed to proceed. The officers should have called someone on the White House staff or Secret Service personnel before allowing them past the checkpoint, Mackin said. Earlier, Mackin said the Secret Service may pursue a criminal investigation of the Salahis. Sullivan said it wasn't good enough that his agency screened more than 1.2 million visitors last year to the White House complex and protected more than 10,000 sites for the president, vice president and others. 60 years of White House state dinners\\"Even with these successes, we need to be right 100 percent of the time,\\" he said. It is unclear what the couple told officers at the checkpoint that allowed them to go through the security screening. Federal law makes it a crime to knowingly and willfully falsify statements on matters within the federal government's jurisdiction. \\"As this moves closer to a criminal investigation there's less that we can say,\\" Mackin said. \\"We're not leaving any option off the table at this point.\\" The Salahis lawyer, Paul Gardner, posted a comment on their Facebook page saying, \\"My clients were cleared by the White House, to be there.\\" He said more information would be forthcoming. Several messages left at Gardner's law firm on Friday and Saturday were not returned. Bravo Media has confirmed that Michaele Salahi is being considered as a participant in the upcoming \\"The Real Housewives of D.C.\\" program and on the day of the dinner was being filmed by Half Yard Productions, the producer of the program. |||||Summary:","response":"The Secret Service is currently investigating how Michaele and Tareq Salahi managed to crash Obama's first state dinner with a Bravo camera crew.

An airbase, also known as an airfield, is a military facility where aircrafts take off, land, and are maintained, making it the most appropriate choice among the given options. To provide a comprehensive understanding of each option, let's analyze each of them: 1. Nuclear plant: A nuclear plant refers to a facility where nuclear energy is produced, typically through controlled nuclear reactions. It has nothing to do with traffic control or aircraft operations. 2. Recording studio: This option involves a facility designed and equipped for recording and producing audio content, such as music tracks or voiceovers. Although it may have electronic equipment for controlling audio signals, a recording studio is not related to air traffic control. 3. Airbase: As explained earlier, an airbase is a military facility where personnel handle air traffic control, monitor and manage aircraft operations, and maintain the aircraft. 4. Shopping mall: A shopping mall is a large commercial establishment with various retail stores, dining options, and entertainment facilities. It has no direct relation to air traffic control or military operations. 5. Building: This general term refers to any structure built for a variety of purposes, which could range from residential to commercial use. While air traffic control could potentially be located within a building, the term alone does not provide enough context to determine its relation to air traffic control.

Options: (A) 27 (B) 36 (C) 42 (D) 64 (E) 147 What is the step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the answer: (B)?","response":"To solve this problem, we should use the concept of direct proportionality. Step 1: Obtain the given information. We are given that 48 cubic inches of the substance weigh 112 ounces. We need to find the volume of 84 ounces of the substance. Step 2: Establish the relationship between volume and weight. Since volume (V) is directly proportional to weight (W), we can represent the relationship as V = k*W, where k is the constant of proportionality. Step 3: Find the constant of proportionality (k). We are given V = 48 cubic inches and W = 112 ounces. Substitute the values in the relationship: 48 = k*112 To find k, we can divide both sides of the equation by 112: k = 48/112 k = 6/14 (after dividing both the numerator and denominator by 8) k = 3/7 Step 4: Use the constant of proportionality (k) to find the volume for 84 ounces. We need to find the volume (V) when W = 84 ounces. We'll use V = k*W and substitute k = 3/7 and W = 84: V = (3/7) * 84 Step 5: Calculate the volume (V). Multiply 3/7 by 84: V = (3*84)/7 V = 252/7 V = 36 cubic inches Step 6: Choose the correct answer from the options.

Answer:","response":"The missing first step of the following process is: \\"The owl awakens and prepares for the night's hunt.\\" In detail, this first step entails the owl stirring from its daytime rest, typically in a tree hollow or other secluded location. As nocturnal creatures, owls rely on the cover of darkness to hunt for prey and avoid potential threats. Upon awakening, the owl will carefully groom itself, ensuring its feathers are in optimal condition for silent flight. The owl may also stretch its wings and legs, shake off any lingering drowsiness, and take a moment to assess its surroundings and listen for any potential danger or nearby prey. With the addition of this first step, the complete owl hunting process is as follows: 1. The owl awakens and prepares for the night's hunt. 2. The owl flies out into the night, using the cover of darkness to its advantage. 3. The owl looks down at the ground, scanning for any signs of movement or potential prey. 4. The owl's keen eyesight allows him to see in the dark, making it easier to spot prey from a distance. 5. The owl's sensitive hearing allows him to locate hidden prey that may be camouflaged or concealed beneath vegetation. 6. The owl swoops down, approaching its target with precision and stealth. 7. The owl catches a mouse in his talons, securing a meal for the night.

Customers using the airline's website were able to book tickets without paying airline fares – just airport and security fees – for a brief time on Thursday due to a human error, United confirmed. The mistake saw some customers quickly book discount flights to high-desirability locations including Hawaii and Las Vegas. United rectified the problem on Thursday but said it would honour the sales. \\"We've reviewed the error that occurred yesterday and based on these specific circumstances, we will honor the tickets,\\" the company tweeted on Friday afternoon. United said it had accidentally filed some fares for 0, due to a human error. It did not reveal how many tickets were sold at erroneous prices. It shut down its website entirely on Thursday afternoon before reopening at around 2.45pm, according to reports. The discount flights were no longer available when the site came back online. Andy Farrimond, a software consultant from Washington DC, told CNN Money that he discovered the error as he booked a business trip to Minneapolis. Farrimond alerted a number of co-workers to his discovery, he said. His colleagues spent the next hour booking personal trips to the West Coast and Hawaii, CNN Monday reported. \\"It was pandemonium in the office for a while yesterday,\\" Farrimond said.

He had been expecting to pay up to 400 per ticket when he noticed the cheap fares. \\"When I scrolled down past the non-stop fares, when I got to the connecting flights, the flights to and from Los Angeles per person was 10,\\" Stokas told NBC. \\"That was a shock and a surprise, and I was like, 'I've got to book this flight right now before they rescind their offer of 10 for this flight.'\\" Stokas bought six tickets for 60.

Gauguin was foremost a painter; he came to ceramics around 1886, when he was taught by the French sculptor and ceramist Ernest Chaplet. They had been introduced by Félix Bracquemond who, inspired by the new French art pottery, was experimenting with the form. During that winter of 1886–87, Gauguin visited Chaplet's workshop at Vaugirard, where they collaborated on stoneware pots with applied figures or ornamental fragments and multiple handles. Gauguin first visited Tahiti in 1891 and, attracted by the beauty of Tahitian women, undertook a set of sculptural mask-like portraits on paper. They evoke both melancholy and death, and conjure the state of faaturuma (brooding or melancholy); imagery and moods later used in the Oviri ceramic. Gauguin's first wood carvings in Tahiti were with a guava wood that quickly crumbled and have not survived. He completed Oviri in the winter of 1894, during his return from Tahiti, and submitted it to the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts 1895 salon opening in April the following year. There are two versions of what ensued: Charles Morice claimed in 1920 that Gauguin was \\"literally expelled\\" from the exhibition; in 1937 Ambroise Vollard wrote that the piece was admitted only when Chaplet threatened to withdraw his own works in protest. According to Bengt Danielsson, Gauguin was keen to increase his public exposure and availed of this opportunity by writing an outraged letter to Le Soir, bemoaning the state of modern ceramics.At the outset of 1897, Vollard addressed a letter to Gauguin about the possibility of casting his sculptures in bronze. Gauguin's response centred on Oviri: I believe that my large statue in ceramic, the Tueuse (\\"The Murderess\\"), is an exceptional piece such as no ceramist has made until now and that, in addition, it would look very well cast in bronze (without retouching and without patina). In this way the buyer would not only have the ceramic piece itself, but also a bronze edition with which to make money. Art historian Christopher Gray mentions three...

The first sentence refers to the governor's job and the recall petition, while the second sentence emphasizes the governor's work and compensation. Step 2: Compare the main ideas Both sentences convey that the governor is focused on his responsibilities. In the first sentence, his focus is described as being on \\"his job, not the recall petition.\\" In the second sentence, his focus is defined as \\"doing the work that he's being paid to do.\\" Step 3: Evaluate the differences The two sentences have slight differences in context. The first sentence explicitly contrasts the governor's priorities by stating that he is not focused on the recall petition. On the other hand, the second sentence underlines the notion of compensation for his work, which may portray the governor as more accountable in carrying out his duties. Conclusion: Overall, the two sentences convey the same general meaning: the governor's focus is on his responsibilities. However, there are subtle differences in context and emphasis, with the first sentence explicitly contrasting the governor's focus with the recall petition, and the second sentence highlighting the paid nature of his work."},{"question":"Q:Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: What addition was made? Context: On November 6, 2013, Google implemented a new comment system that requires all YouTube users to use a Google+ account in order to comment on videos and making the comment system Google+ oriented. The changes are in large part an attempt to address the frequent criticisms of the quality and tone of YouTube comments. They give creators more power to moderate and block comments, and add new sorting mechanisms to ensure that better, more relevant discussions appear at the top. The new system restored the ability to include URLs in comments, which had previously been removed due to problems with abuse. In response, YouTube co-founder Jawed Karim posted the question \\"why the fuck do I need a google+ account to comment on a video?\\" on his YouTube channel to express his negative opinion of the change. The official YouTube announcement received 20,097 \\"thumbs down\\" votes and generated more than 32,000 comments in two days.

Il est certain qu'avec Load Metallica a sûrement déçu ses fans de la première heure attendant des \\"four horsemen\\" un nouvel album de trash metal. Mais le précédent et excellent ouvrage du groupe sorti 5 ans plus tôt sous le titre de Black Album avait déjà laissé entrevoir un léger virage quant à l'orientation musicale des 4 de San Francisco.

Il en ressort que certaines personnes ont lâchement critiqué Metallica, les accusant de traîtrise envers le metal et en leur reprochant d'avoir donné un côté commercial à leur musique dans le seul but de faire de l'argent. Mais il faut ouvrir les yeux : les gars de Metallica ont près de 40 balais et il est normal qu'à cet âge l'acnée disparaîsse et que l'on devienne un peu plus mature, tout en s'assagissant; et c'est exactement le chemin suivi par la musique du groupe au fil des ans.

Hundreds of cast members have agreed to these terms in the past 25 seasons of the show. While some of the terms in the contract may seem outlandish, they're there for good reason. Because one time a guy did almost die. In 2010, during the D.C. season, cast member Andrew Woods was pushed off a two-story balcony by one of his drunk roommates, landing on a concrete slab. And there are many more examples of \\"mental illness\\" or \\"extreme emotional distress\\" in the form of nervous breakdowns. During the 2006/2007 season of Denver, Brooke LaBarbera became a staple of on The Soup for her numerous meltdowns caused by the stress of her living conditions. This also ties into another contract stipulation: [Portrayal of cast members] may be disparaging, defamatory, embarrassing, [causing exposure to] public ridicule, humiliation or condemnation…[Cast members] may be portrayed in a false light. While also signing off on any objections to \\"a serious invasion of privacy,\\" Cara Kahn, part of 2002's Chicago cast, learned exactly what this meant the hard way, after watching herself have sex with several different men on television. It was the first time that Real World producers had used night vision cameras in the bedrooms and hidden microphones in the headboards of the beds, enabling them to pick up the audio of Cara opening a condom wrapper. The cast were unaware of this new development in production until the show aired, and Kahn later admitted to being humiliated by her portrayal as a \\"slut.\\" As for being portrayed in a \\"false light,\\" in 1998, Irene McGee, part of the Seattle cast, left the show and her departure was depicted as having to do with a relapse of her Lyme Disease, but footage of McGee was also edited to make it appear that she was losing her mind. After the show aired, McGee spoke out that she'd really left the show for \\"ethical objections to the production,\\" and went on to give lectures about the falseness of reality TV, speaking out against The Real World and divulging industry secrets. She was sued by MTV. Advertisement McGee's legal dealings with MTV and her telling tales out of school no doubt contributed to another contract stipulation that requires cast members to participate in all producer-determined press and are required to abstain from engaging in any other media (radio, TV, blogs, chat rooms, message boards) without the producers' written permission. Additionally, if cast members are found to have violated any of the stipulations of the contract, they are required to pay producers 1 million. Given the impact that AIDS activist Pedro Zamora had during the 1994 season in San Francisco, it's interesting that cast members are no longer allowed to participate in the show if they have any STDs and are required to sign a statement saying they don't. However, the contract also states that the other roommates might have STDs and that MTV is not responsible if you contract anything like AIDS \\"gonorrhea, herpes, syphilis, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), Chlamydia, scabies (crabs), hepatitis, genital warts, and other communicable and sexually transmitted diseases or Pregnancy; etc.\\" from a roommate while living in the house. (In 2004, during the Philadelphia season, Melanie Silcott contracted scabies while living in the house.) If you were wondering why nobody on The Real World has dealt with an unwanted pregnancy since Tami in the 1993 Los Angeles season—particularly considering MTV's boner for young moms and teen pregnancy—it's because cast members are not allowed to be pregnant. Pregnancy is grounds for dismissal. Advertisement Safety in The Real World house is also not a guarantee. Aside from the dangers of dying or contracting AIDS, the producers are under no obligation to conduct background checks on any of the roommates—meaning a participant could live with a violent criminal—and cast members are required to understand that they might have to deal with \\"non-consensual physical contact, of which MTV is not responsible. So basically, if you are raped or murdered by a fellow cast member, it's really on you. During the filming of the 2004 season of San Diego, a 22-year-old woman claimed she was raped in the house, by a guest of one of the roommates, after being roofied. Apparently, the production staff found the woman lying naked on the bathroom floor. One cast member said she heard the accused rapist of walking out of the bathroom saying, \\"I just hit that.\\" The cameras were rolling when the woman woke up, and one of the female roommates in the house informed her that she may have been sexually assaulted. The woman went to the police the next day, who began an investigation. However, the cast and crew had already left for Mexico, where they were filming their \\"vacation.\\" A producer of the show did allow police into the home for a search, and provided them with the consent forms and IDs of guests in the house. A lawyer for Bunim/Murray stepped in and refused to let the cops search the bedrooms. The police, most likely pissed off, returned with a search warrant and seized all bedding, editing equipment, and tapes from the time of the alleged crime. The result was that nearly a month of footage ended up on the cutting room floor because it wasn't returned in time, including the cast's Mexican vacation footage. No arrests were ever made in that case. Some other contract stipulations worth noting: You can't change your physical appearance during filming without the producers' permission. (So did Rachel need to get a note, for the 1994 San Francisco show, when she got a tattoo?) Producers can misrepresent cast members' life stories. Producers can have access to cast members' school records and credit history. Production can show up at cast members' personal homes at any time to film or remove any possessions from those homes as long as they return said possessions once production has ended. Cast members are obligated to participate in a reunion special for up to five years after the show ends. (This might stem from Aaron's and Dominic's refusal to participate in any reunion shows after they finished filming the Los Angeles season in 1993.) Cast members are responsible for the cost of all long-distance phone calls during filming and must reimburse producers. We Have Obtained a Copy of MTV's Standard Real World Cast-Member Contract [VV] ||||| Last Wednesday's Village Voice cover story profiled the DeBartoli sisters, two Staten Island sisters who starred in the never-aired Jersey Shore precursor Bridge & Tunnel and signed enormously binding contracts, legal documents that seemed to be written in another language but that they accepted anyway. This is standard practice for all its reality-show subjects, and though the following is a different document than the one the B&T; girls inked, we've managed to get our hands on an unsigned Real World contract. The 30-page spectacular is worth careful scrutiny, but please enjoy the amusingly specific highlights we've summarized below. Happy birthday, MTV! Under the stipulations of the following standard contract, participants in Real World--the grandaddy of \\"reality\\" shows, after Cops--agree to the following terms: • You may die, lose limbs, and suffer nervous breakdowns. (Stipulation 1) • If you undergo any medical procedures while involved in the show, they carry the risk of infection, disfigurement, death. (4) • You may be humiliated and explicitly portrayed \\"in a false light.\\" (12) • Producers are under no obligation to conduct background checks on your fellow cast members. (7) • If you contract AIDS or other sexually transmitted diseases while filming [\\"gonorrhea, herpes, syphilis, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), Chlamydia, scabies (crabs),'hepatitis, genital warts, and other communicable and sexually transmitted diseases or Pregnancy; etc\\"], MTV is not responsible. (7) • Interacting with other cast members carries the risk of \\"non-consensual physical contact\\" and should you contract AIDS, etc. during such an interaction, MTV is not responsible. (7) • You don't have STDs, but accept that other people on the show might. (18) • You're not pregnant and you won't become pregnant before the show's done filming. If you do become pregnant, you'll tell the Producer immediately--and pregnancy is grounds for dismissal. (38) • If you get kicked off the show, it will be filmed. (14) • You can't change your physical appearance during filming, without the Producer's express permission. (26) • You grant the Producer blanket rights to your life story. (49) • The Producer can do pretty much anything they want with your life story, including misrepresent it. (49) • Your email may be monitored during participation. (20b) • You promise not to hide from MTV cameras in establishments where they can't film. (20a) • You authorize the Producer to have total access to your school records, government forms, your credit history. (19) • The production crew can show up at your personal house at any time to film and/or to take anything they want, as long as they return the objects once production has ended. (20a) • Under ordinary circumstances, all of this would be considered a \\"serious\\" invasion of privacy. (11) • For one year after the show's final episode airs, cast members are required to participate in all producer-determined press and forbidden from engaging in any media (radio, television, chat rooms, blogs) without the Producer's written permission. (9) • The Producer holds the authorship and copyright to every photograph, email, website, sound or video recording, documented performance created in relation to the program, on every medium imaginable. (8) • You're obligated to participate in a Reunion Special for up to five years after the show ends, you'll be paid 2500 for your involvement, and the Producer only has to give you 14 days notice. (50c) • You're required to participate in book or home video projects for two years after the show ends, and you'll be paid 750.00 for each one. (50f) Also, worth noting: • While you're on the show, you're responsible for all long-distance phone charges. (16a) • The explicit list of physical tasks you might be subjected to, enumerated in the contract, include traveling by \\"air (whether via helicopter, commercial airliner, glider, private aircraft or otherwise), train and/or automobile, as well as strenuous and/or dangerous and/or mental activity, including but not limited to, horseback riding, jogging, bicycling, motorcycling, exercise and/or weight equipment, skydiving, swimming, bungee jumping, parasailing snorkeling, jet skiing, amusement park activities, rock climbing, engaging in contact sports, hiking, kayaking and boating.\\" (1) There's a lot more where that came from.

Assuming that the questioner intended to ask about overall claims or beliefs during the Republican era, a more comprehensive answer could include aspects related to Roman politics (e.g., their belief in the Republic as the best form of government), sociology (e.g., social stratification, patriarchal society norms, distinction between Patricians and Plebeians), economics (e.g., practices of slavery, land ownership rules), as well as culture and religious beliefs, which would encompass the divine ancestry of leading clans as stated in the original answer. This approach would provide a more rounded view of what Romans claimed or believed during this era. However, without a clearer question, we cannot unequivocally state that the given statement is the most appropriate answer. So, for the broad question \\"What did many Romans claim in the Republican era?\\" the suggested answer might not be comprehensive enough."},{"question":"– The HBO cyberattack appears to be worse than originally thought.

The company, IP Echelon, is in the process of removing search results for the hacked files, and the revelation came as part of a take-down notice sent to Google ordering it to remove links to the leaked files. Sources tell the Hollywood Reporter as many as 1.5 terabytes of data could have been exposed by the breach, which would make the hack worse than the 2014 Sony hack. So far, episodes of Ballers, Insecure, Room 104, and Barry (the last of which has not aired yet) have been released by the hackers; they claim to also have at least one Game of Thrones script.

The TV network hired IP Echelon, a security company, to remove search results of the hacked content. IP Echelon later reported that hackers stole thousands of internal company documents belonging to HBO, along with masses of copyrighted items such as documents, images, videos, and sound. The security company was part of a take-down order sent to Google, instructing them to remove links to the leaked files. As many as 1.5 terabytes of data could have been exposed in this cyberattack, which would make the situation worse than the notorious 2014 Sony hack involving a reported 100 terabytes of data.

In addition to this, they claim to be in possession of at least one Game of Thrones script. In the attack, the personal information of a senior HBO executive—including access to online banking and other online accounts—also appears to have been leaked. There is the potential that other employee data and even customer data could be vulnerable. This massive data breach has led some, such as Variety, to draw comparisons between the HBO attack and the Sony hack. To date, the hackers have not demanded any ransom. HBO CEO Richard Plepler assured employees on August 2nd, 2017, that it was unlikely the hackers had breached the entire email system. The HBO cyberattack raises concerns over data security within the entertainment industry, as cybercriminals continue to target high-profile networks and their intellectual property. As companies struggle to protect their sensitive information, the need for advanced cybersecurity measures and effective response strategies becomes paramount. Companies must invest in robust security infrastructure and employee training to prevent such attacks and mitigate their potential damage."},{"question":"Dialogue: Nancy: Have you seen this new film with Lady Gaga?

'With considerable assistance from the many people and organizations we consulted, NFL ownership has endorsed an enhanced policy that is significantly more robust, thorough, and formal,' NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said. The NFL has come under fire over the last six months as it struggled with a personal conduct policy widely seen as too lenient. With big-money NFL sponsors watching closely, Goodell embarked on a mission to strengthen the policy. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell has endured a turbulent year off the field with a raft of unsavoury incidents. High-profile players Adrian Peterson, Ray Rice and Greg Hardy have been convicted of domestic abuse over the past few months and the NFL has stumbled in some of its attempts to punish the players. A special counsel for investigations and conduct will 'decide the discipline for violations' of the new policy, said Goodell, who will still hear appeals but may appoint an independent panel to assist him. 'The policy is comprehensive. It is strong. It is tough. And it is better for everyone associated with the NFL,' Goodell said. The players union was not happy it was not part of the process in formulating a new policy. 'Our union has not been offered the professional courtesy of seeing the NFL's new personal conduct policy before it hit the presses,' the NFL Players Union said in a statement. 'Their unilateral decision and conduct today is the only thing that has been consistent over the past few months.' Among the changes are a 'more extensive' list of prohibited conduct and NFL-funded counseling and services for victims, families, and violators, Goodell said. Ray Rice (right) is free to play in the NFL after knocking out his then-fiancee Janay (centre) in a casino lift. The new policy was unveiled at a regularly scheduled owners meeting in Irving, Texas, outside Dallas. Arizona Cardinals owner Michael Bidwill will serve as chairman of a nine-owner committee that will oversee the new policy, Goodell said. Two former players with ownership stakes also will serve on the committee, Warrick Dunn of the Atlanta Falcons and the Pittsburgh Steelers' John Stallworth. After the criticism erupted over the summer, Goodell retained four women, including Lisa Friel, the former head of the Manhattan district attorney's sex-crimes unit, to shape the NFL's policies relating to domestic violence and sexual assault. 'We now have a layered evaluation process to take into account a diversity of expert views,' Goodell said. Adrian Peterson disciplined his four-year-old son with a switch and is currently banned by the NFL.

However, it does not directly provide the answer to the question \\"NYC has the largest white population by how many people?\\" To answer the query, there is a need to calculate the difference between the non-Hispanic white population of New York City and the next largest city. By comparing the white populations of the cities mentioned in the statement, New York City has the largest white population, followed by Los Angeles, Chicago, and Houston. So, the next largest white population belongs to Los Angeles (1.1 million). Now, to calculate the difference between the white population in New York City and Los Angeles: Difference = New York City white population - Los Angeles white population Difference = 2,700,000 - 1,100,000 = 1,600,000 Thus, the answer to the question \\"NYC has the largest white population by how many people?\\" is: \\"New York City has the largest non-Hispanic white population by 1.6 million people compared to the next largest city with a significant non-Hispanic white population, Los Angeles.\\" It is essential to note that the data mentioned in the statement and the answer are from 2012, so it might not reflect the most up-to-date population figures.

As a professional football team based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, they have managed to secure numerous wins over the years. In this article, we will delve into the team's victory margins and try to establish just how often they have won games by a certain number of points. Note that the data present in this article might not be the most up-to-date, as it focuses on information available at the time of writing. Analyzing the Victory Margins of the Pittsburgh Steelers Determining how many points the Steelers won by in a specific game requires examining their scores in that particular game, as well as the scores of the opposing team. The difference between these two scores will provide the margin of victory from Pittsburgh's perspective. There have been a wide range of victory margins in the Steelers' history, from narrow wins to landslide victories. Before delving into specific games, we need first to take a broader look at their average margin of victory. Average Margin of Victory An essential aspect we need to consider is gauging the Steelers' average margin of victory. To do this, we must evaluate their aggregate scores in victorious games and calculate the mean score difference. Analyses of past seasons would show that throughout their history, the Steelers have won games by a margin averaging around 11 to 12 points. Notable Wins and Victory Margins 1. The Immaculate Reception Game One of the Steelers' most memorable victories took place on December 23, 1972, in the AFC playoff game against the Oakland Raiders. Termed as the \\"Immaculate Reception,\\" this legendary football play features Franco Harris snagging a deflected pass and scoring a game-winning touchdown. The final score of this game was 13-7, giving the Steelers a victory margin of 6 points. 2. Super Bowl XLIII Steeler fans will always cherish their victory in Super Bowl XLIII on February 1, 2009, against the Arizona Cardinals. They emerged victorious with the thrilling final score of 27-23, marking a winning margin of 4 points. It was during this game that one of the greatest plays in Super Bowl history took place, with Santonio Holmes catching a game-winning touchdown pass from Ben Roethlisberger. 3. Super Bowl XIV On January 20, 1980, the Pittsburgh Steelers faced the Los Angeles Rams in Super Bowl XIV. The game ended in favor of the Steelers, with a final score of 31-19, giving them a convincing victory margin of 12 points. This triumph marked their fourth Super Bowl win, all of which took place within a span of six years. While these examples serve as notable wins in the Steelers' history, the team has played numerous other games resulting in different victory margins. Fans may recall instances where the team has won by smaller or larger point differentials, as each game and season brings its unique set of circumstances and outcomes. Conclusion The number of points by which the Pittsburgh Steelers have won games varies throughout their history within the NFL. It depends on individual game dynamics and season performances. However, on average, the Steelers tend to achieve victory margins of around 11 to 12 points. No matter the point differential, Steelers fans take pride in their team's successes and memorable victories, both in the regular season and playoffs."},{"question":"What is the answer to this question? when does the new season of family guy air?","response":"To find the answer to your question, I will follow these steps: 1.

Under pressure from the mayor, Brigadier-General Treillard (Robert Stephens) sends a member of his staff, Lieutenant Armand d'Hubert (Keith Carradine) of the 3rd Hussars, to put Feraud under house arrest. As the arrest takes place in the house of Madame de Lionne (Jenny Runacre), a prominent local lady, Feraud takes it as a personal insult from d'Hubert. Matters are made worse when Feraud asks d'Hubert if he would \\"let them spit on Napoleon\\" and d'Hubert doesn't immediately reply. Upon reaching his quarters, Feraud challenges d'Hubert to a duel. The duel is inconclusive; d'Hubert slashes Feraud's forearm but is unable to finish him off, because he is attacked by Feraud's mistress. As a result of his part in the duel, d'Hubert is dismissed from the General's staff and returned to active duty with his unit. The war interrupts the men's quarrel and they do not meet again until six months later in Augsburg in 1801. Feraud immediately challenges d'Hubert to another duel and seriously wounds him. Recovering, d'Hubert takes lessons from a fencing master and in the next duel (held in a cellar with heavy sabres), the two men fight each other to a bloody standstill. Soon afterwards, d'Hubert is relieved to learn he has been promoted to captain. Military discipline forbids officers of different ranks from duelling.

Menachem Begin ( listen ; Hebrew: m@nakhem be'giyn Menahem Begin, Polish: Mieczyslaw Biegun; Russian: Menakhem Vol'fovich Begin Menakhem Volfovich Begin; 16 August 1913 - 9 March 1992) was an Israeli politician, founder of Likud and the sixth Prime Minister of Israel. On 17 May 1977 the Likud, headed by Begin, won the Knesset elections by a landslide, becoming the biggest party in the Knesset. Popularly known as the Mahapakh (\\"upheaval\\"), the election results had seismic ramifications as for the first time in Israeli history a party other than the Alignment/Mapai was in a position to form a government, effectively ending the left's hitherto unrivalled domination over Israeli politics. Likud's electoral victory signified a fundamental restructuring of Israeli society in which the founding socialist Ashkenazi elite was being replaced by a coalition representing marginalized Mizrahi and Jewish-religious communities, promoting a socially conservative and economically liberal agenda. The Likud campaign leading up to the election centered on Begin's personality. Demonized by the Alignment as totalitarian and extremist, his self-portrayal as a humble and pious leader struck a chord with many who felt abandoned by the ruling party's ideology. In the predominantly Jewish Mizrahi working class urban neighborhoods and peripheral towns, the Likud won overwhelming majorities, while disillusionment with the Alignment's corruption prompted many middle and upper class voters to support the newly founded centrist Democratic Movement for Change (\\"Dash\\") headed by Yigael Yadin. Dash won 15 seats out of 120, largely at the expense of the Alignment, which was led by Shimon Peres and had shrunk from 51 to 32 seats. Well aware of his momentous achievement and employing his trademark sense for drama, when speaking that night in the Likud headquarters Begin quoted from the Gettysburg Address and the Torah, referring to his victory as a 'turning point in the history of the Jewish people'. With 43 seats, the Likud still required the support of other parties in order to reach a parliamentary majority that would enable it to form a government under Israel's proportionate representation parliamentary system. Though able to form a narrow coalition with smaller Jewish religious and ultra-orthodox parties, Begin also sought support from centrist elements in the Knesset to provide his government with greater public legitimacy.

Groups of hackers working for the Chinese government have compromised the networks of the Office of Personnel Management, which holds data on millions of current and former federal employees, as well as the health insurance giant Anthem, among other targets, the officials and researchers said. “They’re definitely going after quite a bit of personnel information,” said Rich Barger, chief intelligence officer of ThreatConnect, a Northern Virginia cybersecurity firm. “We suspect they’re using it to understand more about who to target [for espionage], whether electronically or via human ­recruitment.” [How the Internet became so vulnerable] The targeting of large-scale data­bases is a relatively new tactic and is used by the Chinese government to further its ­intelligence-gathering, the officials and analysts say. It is government espionage, not commercial espionage, they say. China hacked into the federal government’s network, compromising four million current and former employees' information. The Post's Ellen Nakashima talks about what kind of national security risk this poses and why China wants this information. (Alice Li/The Washington Post) “This is part of their strategic goal — to increase their intelligence collection via big-data theft and big-data aggregation,” said a U.S. government official who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive topic. “It’s part of a strategic plan.” One hack of OPM, which was disclosed by the government Thursday, dates at least to December, officials said. Earlier last year, OPM discovered a separate intrusion into a highly sensitive database that contains information on employees seeking or renewing security clearances and on their background investigations. Once harvested, the data can be used to glean details about key government personnel and potential spy recruits, or to gain information useful for counter­intelligence. Records in OPM’s database of background investigations, for instance, could contain a complete history of where an individual has lived and all of his or her foreign contacts in, say, China. “So now the Chinese counterintelligence authorities know which American officials are meeting with which Chinese,” a China cyber and intelligence expert said. The data could help Chinese analysts do more effective targeting of individuals, said a former National Security Agency official. “They can find specific individuals they want to go after, family members,” he said. The trend has emerged and accelerated over the past 12 to 18 months, the official said. An increase in Chinese capability has opened the way “for bigger data storage, for bigger data theft,” he said. “And when you can gain it in bulk, you take it in bulk.” The Chinese government, he said, is making use of Chinese companies that specialize in aggregating large sets of data “to help them in sifting through” the information for useful details. “The analogy would be one of our intelligence organizations using Google, Yahoo, Accenture to aggregate data that we collected.” China on Friday dismissed the allegation of hacking as “irresponsible and unscientific.” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said Beijing wanted to cooperate with other nations to build a peaceful and secure cyberspace. “We wish the United States would not be full of suspicions, catching wind and shadows, but rather have a larger measure of trust and cooperation,” he told a regular news briefing, OPM disclosed that the latest hack of one of its systems exposed personal data of up to 4 million current and former employees — the largest hack of federal employee data in recent years. It is possible that officials as senior as Cabinet secretaries had their data exposed, a congressional aide said on a briefing call with government officials Friday. U.S. officials privately said China was behind it. The stolen information included Social Security numbers and performance evaluations. [What to do if you are a federal worker] “This is an intelligence operation designed to help the Chinese government,” the China expert said. “It’s a new phase in an evolution of what they’re doing. It certainly requires greater sophistication on their part in terms of being able to take out this much data.” Barger’s firm has turned up technical evidence that the same Chinese group is behind the hacks of Premera Blue Cross and Empire BlueCross, which were discovered at roughly the same time earlier this year. The first OPM incident has been linked to the health-care hacks by Barger and another security researcher, John Hultquist, senior manager for cyberespionage threat intelligence at iSight Partners. Hultquist said the same group is responsible for all of them, and for other intrusions into commercial databases containing large sets of Americans’ personal information. “They would leverage this data to get to diplomatic, political, military and economic intelligence that they typically target,” said Hultquist, who declined to comment on who was behind the attacks. Though much Chinese cyber­espionage is attributed to the People’s Liberation Army, these hacks, Barger said, appeared to be linked to the Ministry of State Security, which is a spy agency responsible for foreign espionage and domestic counterintelligence. Other Chinese entities, including the military, may also be involved in the campaign, analysts said. Chinese government hackers “are like a vacuum cleaner” in sucking up information electronically, said Robert “Bear” Bryant, a former top counterespionage official in the government. “They’re becoming much more sophisticated in tying it all together. And they’re trying to harm us.” [Why the Internet’s massive flaws never get fixed] Security researchers have pointed to a cyber tool or family of malicious software called Derusbi that has been linked exclusively to Chinese actors. One group that has used Derusbi is Deep Panda, a name coined by the firm CrowdStrike, which has linked that group to the Anthem hack. Disclosed in February, that incident exposed the Social Security numbers, addresses, phone numbers, e-mail addresses and member IDs of tens of millions of customers. No medical data such as diagnosis or treatment information was compromised, the company said. Researchers note that in contrast to the hacks of Home Depot and Target, personal data that might have been stolen from OPM, Anthem and the other companies has not shown up on the black market, where it can be sold to identity thieves. That is another sign, they said, that the intrusions are not being made for commercial purposes. “Usually if there’s a criminally or financially motivated breach like that, we see the data making its way into the black market soon after that,” Barger said. The big-data approach being taken by the Chinese might seem to mirror techniques used abroad by the NSA, which has come under scrutiny for its data-gathering practices under executive authority. But in China, the authorities do not tolerate public debate over the proper limits of large-scale spying in the digital age. “This is what all intelligence services do if they’re good,” said the China cyber expert. “If you want to find a needle, first you have to gather a haystack of needles.” The massive data harvesting “reflects a maturity in Chinese” electronic intelligence gathering, the expert said. “You have to put in place structured data repositories. You have to have big-data management tools to be able to store and sift and analyze.” Barger said that “with a large pool of data, they can prioritize who is the best to target electronically and who is the best to target via human recruitment.” The U.S. official noted that the Chinese “would not take [the data] if they did not have the opportunity to aggregate it.” And, he added, “they are taking it.” Simon Denyer in Beijing contributed to this report. ||||| The U.S. suspects that Chinese hackers stole the personal records of four million people, the latest in a series of cyberspying accusations the two countries have lobbed at each other.

WASHINGTON—Government officials were scrambling Friday to gauge the extent of information gained in a suspected hacking of millions of government workers’ personnel files, including whether sensitive security data was compromised. “I don’t think we can tell you with a whole lot of detail precisely what was taken,” White House spokesman Josh Earnest said, adding the breach may have resulted in a “substantial amount’’ of data stolen from government computers. ... ||||| A summary of this is?","response":"China has been building massive databases of Americans’ personal information by hacking government agencies and US healthcare companies as a high-tech tactic to achieve espionage goals, according to US officials and analysts.

Who is Diana to the narrator ?","response":"Based on the text provided, it can be inferred that Diana holds a close or significant relationship with the narrator, although the exact nature of their relationship cannot be confidently determined without further context. There are a few clues that suggest the close bond shared between Diana and the narrator. Firstly, the fact that Diana texted the narrator informing them about the dinner suggests a level of familiarity, as it is common for people who are close to each other to share details about their meals or plans. Furthermore, the text message itself that says \\"Dinner is almost ready!\\" implies some level of involvement or expectation on the narrator's part concerning dinner arrangements, and it can be assumed that the two may live together or have previously made plans to dine together on this particular occasion. Another hint towards their close relationship is the narrator's comment about the potentially late messages received due to their mobile carrier, Metro PCS. This statement shows that they have shared previous experiences where late messaging has affected their communication. The narrator's awareness of the possibility of a delay in receiving messages indicates that they have had an ongoing relationship or communication with Diana. Lastly, the use of the word \\"adorable\\" by the narrator to describe Diana's message shows a level of affection and familiarity between the two of them. This word choice suggests that the narrator is fond of Diana and appreciates her actions, strengthening the idea that they have a close relationship. In conclusion, while it is evident that Diana is a significant person in the narrator's life, the exact nature of their relationship cannot be firmly established based on the text alone. They could be close friends, family members, or even romantic partners, but we need more context to confirm their relationship. Still, what is clear from this passage is that the narrator greatly values their connection with Diana, as shown by the affectionate tone and the emphasis on their shared experiences."},{"question":"Paper is a thin material produced by pressing together moist fibres of cellulose pulp derived from wood, rags or grasses, and drying them into flexible sheets.

Answer:","response":"Willie Nelson, the legendary American musician, singer, songwriter, and activist, is known for his distinctive and iconic guitar playing style. Over the years of his career, Nelson has played a Martin N-20 classical guitar, famously named \\"Trigger,\\" which became an unmistakable part of his signature sound. To achieve his unique tone, Willie Nelson uses a specific type of guitar strings. He prefers classical nylon strings that are designed explicitly for use on classical guitars. Classical nylon strings are different from traditional steel strings used on acoustic guitars in both material and design, providing a warmer, mellower tone that complements Nelson's trademark fingerpicking and playing technique. Although Nelson's choice of string brand may have changed throughout his career, it has been widely reported that he has used Martin M160 Silverplated Ball End High Tension Classical Guitar Strings at some point. These strings offer a perfect balance of tone and durability, with their high tension providing optimal sustain and a rich, full sound. Martin M160 Silverplated Ball End High Tension Classical Guitar Strings feature a silver-plated copper wire wrapped around a nylon multifilament core. The result is a string that delivers a consistent, true tone with excellent projection. Ball ends make these strings more comfortable to install, allowing for faster and easier string changes. It should be noted that while the specific brand and model of Willie Nelson's preferred strings may have varied over time, the key factors of his choice have remained consistent: nylon strings, high tension, and good tone. This combination allows Nelson to achieve his signature sound, which has become an integral part of his enduring appeal as a musician. In conclusion, Willie Nelson primarily uses classical nylon strings with high tension on his iconic Martin N-20 guitar, \\"Trigger.\\" This choice of strings, combined with his playing style and the unique character of his guitar, is what offers the warm, rich, and distinctive sound that has become synonymous with Willie Nelson's music throughout his remarkable career."},{"question":"Given the question: I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it.

More funds were also put towards recruitment, which had been dwindling throughout the 1980s and '90s, possibly because the Canadian populace had come to perceive the CAF as peacekeepers rather than as soldiers, as shown in a 2008 survey conducted for the Department of National Defence. The poll found that nearly two thirds of Canadians agreed with the country's participation in the invasion of Afghanistan, and that the military should be stronger, but also that the purpose of the forces should be different, such as more focused on responding to natural disasters. Then CDS, Walter Natynczyk, said later that year that while recruiting has become more successful, the CF was facing a problem with its rate of loss of existing members, which increased between 2006 and 2008 from 6% to 9.2% annually.\\". Can you tell me what it is? The answer to this question is:","response":"The Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) was recruiting strongly due to the Government of Canada's efforts through the Canada First Defence Strategy in 2008, which aimed to modernize the CAF by purchasing new equipment, improving training and readiness, and establishing the Canadian Special Operations Regiment. Additional funds were allocated towards recruitment, which had been dwindling throughout the 1980s and '90s, to address the public perception of the CAF's role and to counteract the increased rate of loss of existing members."},{"question":"Pick from: a). No b). Yes Given those answer options, answer the question: Question: when was the american labor union formed? Would \\"Larger unions also typically engage in lobbying activities and electioneering at the state and federal level.\\" be a reasonable answer? A:","response":"To properly address the question, I would like to provide some context and background information about the formation of the American labor union. This will allow for a more comprehensive understanding of the topic before concluding whether the given answer options are reasonable or not. The history of labor unions in the United States dates back to the early 19th century, with several organizations forming along with the rise of the industrial revolution. However, it is important to highlight that the American labor movement became more significant during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The American Federation of Labor (AFL) was created in 1886 by Samuel Gompers, which provided an early model of the labor union structure. The AFL represented craft workers, and it organized workers according to their specific craft or trade to ensure fair wages, protect worker's rights, and provide better working conditions. Another major labor union, the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), was established by John L. Lewis in 1935, focusing on representing industrial workers in various sectors of the economy. Now, addressing the given answer options: \\"a). No\\" and \\"b). Yes\\". The original question asks when the American labor union was formed, and it does not directly relate to the statement about larger unions typically engaging in lobbying activities and electioneering at the state and federal level. Hence, neither option \\"a). No\\" nor \\"b). Yes\\" would be a suitable answer to the question. It would be more appropriate to answer the question regarding the formation of American labor unions by mentioning the AFL's establishment in 1886 and the CIO's formation in 1935. These two important events in American labor history contributed significantly to shaping the labor unions we recognize today, ultimately merging into the AFL-CIO in 1955. As for the statement provided, \\"Larger unions also typically engage in lobbying activities and electioneering at the state and federal level,\\" it is true that unions, especially larger ones, often take part in political activities to advocate for policies and legislation that would benefit their members and workers. This type of action is an essential aspect of labor unions' functions, as they aim to improve workers' rights and well-being. However, the statement itself does not answer the question about the formation of American labor unions."},{"question":"Employment in the construction sector grew by 49. Does it follow that \\"The construction sectors employment grew by 49.\\"?","response":"Yes, it follows that \\"The construction sector's employment grew by 49.\\" The two statements essentially convey the same information, with a slight variation in phrasing. Both indicate an increase in the number of employed individuals within the construction sector by 49. However, it is essential to understand the context while interpreting this information. The growth of 49 mentioned in the statement may refer to various aspects, such as the increase in absolute numbers, percentage growth, or it could be an index basis. Consequently, the statement could have multiple interpretations: 1. Absolute Numbers: If the growth of 49 relates to absolute numbers, it means that there are 49 more individuals employed in the construction sector compared to a previous period. For example, if there were 1,000 construction workers last month and the number increased to 1,049 this month, the employment growth would be 49. 2. Percentage Growth: A 49% growth in employment within the construction industry implies the total number of employees in the sector has increased by 49% compared to a previous period. For example, if there were 200 construction workers previously and the number rose to 298, the growth would be 49%. 3. Index Basis: Sometimes, data is presented using an index that represents the relative or proportional increase in a particular sector over time. In this case, a growth of 49 in the construction sector could signify that the employment rate in the sector has gone up by 49 points on the index scale (compared to a base period). It is crucial to consider the context and specific details surrounding the data, such as the time frames, base period, and any additional information related to the industry. This will enable one to derive a comprehensive understanding of the employment growth within the construction sector and its potential implications on the overall economy."},{"question":"Given the question: What is the name of the person that had their contents auctioned on 6 May 1850? Answer the above question based on the context below: Etty had planned for a burial in York Minster, but neglected to cover the necessary costs in his will. With Yorkshire local government in political and financial chaos in the wake of the bankruptcy of George Hudson, there was no political will to organise a public subscription or to waive the fees, and as a consequence Etty was buried in the churchyard of St Olave's Church, his local parish church. On 6 May 1850 the contents of his studio were auctioned, in a total of 1034 lots including around 900 paintings; some of these paintings were incomplete studies later completed by other artists to increase their value. In the years following his death Etty's work became highly collectable, his works fetching huge sums on resale. He continued to be regarded as a pornographer by some, with Charles Robert Leslie observing in 1850 \\"It cannot be doubted that the voluptuous treatment of his subjects, in very many instances, recommended them more powerfully than their admirable art; while we may fully believe that he himself, thinking and meaning no evil, was not aware of the manner in which his works were regarded by grosser minds\\".Six months after William's death, Betsy Etty married chemist Stephen Binnington, a distant relation of the Etty family. She moved into his house in Haymarket, and some time after his death moved to 40 Edwardes Square, where she died in 1888 at the age of 87. While Etty did have admirers, the patchy quality of his later work meant that he never acquired the circle of imitators and students that could have led to him being seen as the founder of the English realist movement, now considered to have begun in 1848 with the formation of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. William Holman Hunt and John Everett Millais, two of the three founders of the Pre-Raphaelites, were heavily influenced by Etty's early works but recoiled from his later style. Holman Hunt recollected that \\"in my youth [Etty] had lost the robustness he once had [...] the paintings of his advanced age cloyed the taste by their...

(CNN) -- As the swine flu outbreak escalates across the globe, U.S. travelers returning from Mexico are wondering what to do when they come home. Travelers leaving a Mexican airport fill out questionnaires about their health. On Wednesday, Christine Kovar of San Francisco, California, returned from a vacation to Nuevo Vallarta, Mexico. She said she wasn't sure whether she should attend work or stay home. \\"I feel fine,\\" said Kovar. \\"It will be the discretion of my boss whether I go back to work.\\" The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia, is advising U.S. travelers back from Mexico with at least two of the swine flu symptoms to stay at home and avoid public places upon return. Symptoms of swine flu, also known as 2009 N1H1, can include a fever, sore throat, cough, chills, headaches and runny nose. It's been smooth sailing at","response":"many U.S. airports as travel picks up amid the swine flu outbreak, but concerns remain for travelers returning from Mexico, where the virus has hit hardest. Health officials continue to urge caution, emphasizing the importance of vigilance in monitoring symptoms and taking necessary precautions. For those like Christine Kovar, who do not present any symptoms but have recently returned from Mexico, navigating the decision on whether to return to work or stay home is a delicate balance between personal responsibility and workplace expectations. The most logical way for individuals like Kovar to proceed would be to consult with their employer and follow any guidelines set by their specific workplace. Many organizations are already implementing policies related to the swine flu outbreak, and it's essential to comply with these measures to prioritize public health and prevent further spread of the virus. Employees should alert their supervisors about their recent travel to Mexico and inquire about any specific steps or precautions they need to take upon their return. In some cases, employers might opt for telecommuting options or require employees to take sick leave for a specified period as a precautionary measure. In addition to workplace guidelines, travelers returning from Mexico should also follow the advice of health authorities, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). They can start by being vigilant in self-monitoring for signs of swine flu and promptly seek medical attention if symptoms arise. Travelers should also practice good hygiene habits, such as regular hand-washing, sanitizing frequently-touched surfaces, and using a tissue or their elbow when coughing or sneezing to minimize the risk of spreading the virus. Some U.S. airports have already started implementing screening measures, such as thermal scanners to detect elevated body temperature among incoming passengers. While this can help identify potentially symptomatic individuals, it's still crucial for travelers without symptoms to remain cautious and responsible for their actions. This means being honest about their recent travels when asked by health officials or employers and taking any necessary steps to prioritize their health and the well-being of those around them. The situation surrounding the swine flu outbreak remains dynamic, with recommendations and guidelines subject to change as new information becomes available. It is essential for individuals, employers, and health officials to stay informed and adapt accordingly. By working together and following expert advice, travelers returning from Mexico and other affected regions can play their part in ensuring public safety and preventing further spread of the swine flu. In conclusion, the most logical way to complete this passage emphasizes the importance of personal responsibility, adherence to workplace guidelines, and consultation with health authorities for U.S. travelers returning home from Mexico amid the swine flu outbreak. By staying informed, being cautious in monitoring symptoms, and practicing good hygiene, individuals like Christine Kovar can make an informed decision and take the appropriate steps to prioritize both their health and the well-being of their community."},{"question":"How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? Gluing leather to the cover inserts","response":"To glue leather to cover inserts, follow these step-by-step instructions: 1. Gather the materials: First, you'll need to have all the necessary materials. This includes the leather, cover inserts (such as cardboard or other material), glue specifically designed for leather (e.g. contact cement or leather glue), a brush, scissors, a ruler, a pen or pencil, and a clean cloth. 2. Measure and cut the leather: Measure the size of your cover inserts and add an extra margin for the edges – typically around 1/2 to 1 inch. Mark these dimensions on the backside of the leather using a pen or pencil, and then cut the leather to size using the scissors. 3. Prepare the surfaces: Clean both the leather and the cover insert surfaces to ensure they are free from dust or debris. Wipe down the surfaces with a clean cloth, if needed, to remove any lingering contaminants. 4. Apply the glue: Using a brush, apply a thin, even layer of glue on both the leather and the cover insert. Be sure to cover the entire surfaces, including the edges. When using contact cement, allow each surface to dry until the glue becomes tacky, but not wet – this usually takes around 15 minutes. For other types of leather glue, read and follow the manufacturer's instructions for application and drying time. 5. Position the leather: Carefully align the leather piece with the cover insert, ensuring that the edges match up and taking into consideration any extra margin needed for folding or trimming. Starting from the center and working outwards, press the leather onto the cover insert firmly, so the adhesive bonds to both surfaces. 6. Secure the edges: To create a professional finish, fold and glue the edges of the leather to the backside of the cover insert. Apply additional glue if needed to ensure a secure bond. Use a clean cloth or your fingers to press the leather down, ensuring a tight fit and removing any air bubbles. 7. Let it dry: Allow the glued surfaces to dry thoroughly. Depending on the type of glue used, this may take between 1 to 24 hours. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for optimal drying time. 8. Clean up: Once the glue is completely dry, clean up any excess glue or residue with a damp cloth. Be cautious not to get the leather too wet, as this could damage the finish. 9. Inspect and finish: Check your work for any imperfections, such as air bubbles or uneven edges. If needed, you can carefully trim the edges of the leather with a sharp knife to achieve a clean, professional look. By following these steps, you should be able to successfully glue leather to the cover inserts."},{"question":"YUKOS shareholders gave warning yesterday that the oil giants attempt to seek bankruptcy protection in the US was unlikely to prevent the Russian Government-ordered What is this text about?","response":"This text is about a situation where YUKOS, a big oil company, is trying to get help from the US to protect itself from some actions ordered by the Russian Government.

Sarsfield gained his first military experience serving with an Anglo-Irish contingent of the French Army during the 1670s. When James II came to the throne he was commissioned in the English Army, and served during the suppression of Monmouth's Rebellion in 1685. During the Glorious Revolution of 1688 he remained loyal to James and led an English cavalry detachment at the Battle of Wincanton, the only military engagement of the campaign. In 1689 Sarsfield accompanied James to Ireland and served in the Jacobite Irish Army. After an early setback at Sligo, he became one of the celebrated Jacobite leaders of the war, noted in particular for Sarsfield's Raid shortly before the Siege of Limerick in 1690. James rewarded him by making him an Earl in the Peerage of Ireland. After the war's end following a second siege of Limerick in 1691, he led the Flight of the Wild Geese which took thousands of Irish soldiers into exile in France where they continued to serve James.

While many expected the game a lop-sided affair in favor of the 5-0 Bears, the Cardinals led the Bears before stumbling in the game's last quarter. The game marked the Bears' first Monday Night Football appearance since the 2003 NFL season, and second overall prime-time appearance of the season. The game started on an auspicious note for the Cardinals, as Rex Grossman faced a quick three and out after failing to connect to Bernard Berrian on a deep pass. The Cardinals responded offensively when rookie quarterback Matt Leinart threw two touchdowns in the first quarter. As Neil Rackers helped bolster the Cardinals lead with a set of field goals, Grossman continued to struggle and committed four turnovers in the first half alone. By half time, the Cardinals were leading the Bears by a score of 20-0, which was the largest deficit they had faced all season at that point. The Bears finally got on the score board in the third quarter when Robbie Gould kicked a 23-yard field goal. However, Rackers responded again to boost the Cardinals lead back to twenty points. By the game's third quarter, many had assumed the Cardinals had grasped their second win of the season, and the undefeated Bears would be forced to face defeat. However, in the dying minutes of the third quarter, the Bears' defense made a series of staunch defensive plays that allowed them to rally back. First, rookie defensive end Mark Anderson sacked Leinart, causing him to fumble. The loose ball was picked up by Mike Brown, who returned it for a 3-yard touchdown. Later, Brian Urlacher stripped the ball from running back Edgerrin James, and Charles Tillman recovered the football and returned it for another touchdown. The Bears, now only trailing by six points, took the lead when rookie punt returner Devin Hester returned a punt for an 83-yard touchdown. The Cardinals had one final attempt to win the game, but Rackers missed a 40-yard field goal attempt, allowing the Bears to kneel the clock out. After the game's conclusion, Dennis Green, who was the Cardinal's coach at the time, threw his infamous \\"They are who we thought they were!\\" postgame conference. The rant became so popular, that it was featured in a Coors Light commercial the next season. Based on the above article, answer a question.

The sediment rolls down hill towards a river - Again, weak spark plugs do not have any direct influence on the movement of sediment downhill. 3. The heavy items sink to the bottom; the lighter items float on the top and in convection cycles - Sedimentation and the behavior of different items during this process are not affected by weak spark plugs. 4. As the river flows, the sediment is moved - The flow of the river and the movement of sediment by the water are not impacted by the weak spark plugs. 5. The sediment gets dumped through tributaries into lakes and the ocean - The transportation and depositing of sediment into lakes and oceans is not altered due to weak spark plugs. 6. The sediment keeps moving around the world in convection currents - Similarly, the convection currents responsible for the movement of sediment around the world are not directly nor indirectly affected by weak spark plugs.

A:","response":"'TVBS' is an 'instance of' a Satellite television channel and nationwide cable TV network. It is a specific example, or instance, of a broader category which includes other television broadcasters that provide their content via satellite or cable TV networks. TVBS is notable for being established by TVBI Company Limited, a subsidiary of Television Broadcasts Limited (TVB) in Hong Kong, and ERA Group of Taiwan, and for becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of TVB of Hong Kong in early 2005.

This media entity, like other terrestrial and digital broadcasting networks, operates by transmitting its broadcasting signal across a large geographic coverage, thanks to the technology of satellite transmission and cable distribution. Moreover, a satellite television channel and nationwide cable TV network like TVBS operates around the concept of broadcasting television programs that are relayed from a communications satellite orbiting the Earth directly to the viewer's location. Meanwhile, the concept of a cable TV network involves the distribution of content via coaxial or fiber-optic cables. TVBS, therefore, demonstrates the characteristics of these concepts, making it an instance of the said category. Hence, TVBS is a significant expression of the continued innovation and evolution of television broadcasting, signifying the transition from traditional terrestrial broadcasting to more efficient and expansive relay methods."},{"question":"What would be an example of an negative review?","response":"Step 1: Identify the product or service to be reviewed In this case, let's create a negative review for a fictional restaurant called \\"The Fancy Bistro.\\" Step 2: Recall or imagine the experience To write this negative review, we'll imagine that we recently dined at The Fancy Bistro and had a very disappointing experience. Step 3: Mention the details of the experience, focusing on the negative aspects For our review, let's say the service was slow, the food was overpriced, and the atmosphere was too noisy. Step 4: Be polite and avoid overly harsh language While writing a negative review, it's essential to express dissatisfaction without being rude or offensive. Step 5: Write the review Title: Disappointing Experience at The Fancy Bistro Review: I was really looking forward to trying out The Fancy Bistro after hearing so much about it, but unfortunately, my experience there left me feeling disappointed and unsatisfied. From the moment we arrived, the service was slow and inattentive. It took a while for a staff member to greet us, and even longer for our order to be taken. We had high hopes for the food, considering the prices, but when our dishes finally arrived, they were mediocre at best. The steak I ordered was overcooked and lacked flavor, while my partner's pasta dish was bland and underwhelming. On top of the subpar food and service, the noise level in the restaurant was unbearable. It was difficult to hold a conversation without shouting over the clamor of other diners and the loud music playing in the background. Overall, I cannot recommend The Fancy Bistro, as it was overpriced and failed to meet our expectations in terms of food quality, service, and ambiance. I hope the management takes note and makes the necessary improvements so that future diners can have a better experience than we did. Step 6: Post the review and consider your task complete. This review can now be posted on a relevant review platform to share your negative experience, while remaining polite and respectful, with other potential customers."},{"question":"In the meantime, some Bulgarian leaders tried to negotiate the establishment of a Bulgarian Uniate Church. The movement for union with Rome led to the initial recognition of a separate Bulgarian Catholic Millet by the Sultan in 1860. The Sultan issued a special decree for that occasion. Although the movement initially gathered some 60,000 adherents, the subsequent establishment of the Bulgarian Exarchate reduced their number with some 75%. The Bulgarian \\"Church Struggle\\" was resolved finally with a Sultan decree in 1870, which established the Bulgarian Exarchate. The act also instituted the Bulgarian Orthodox Millet - an entity combining the modern notion for a nation with the Ottoman principle of Millet. It also turned the Bulgarian Exarch into both a religious leader and an administrative head of the Millet. The new entity enjoyed internal cultural and administrative autonomy. However, it excluded non-Orthodox Bulgarians and, thus, failed to embrace all representatives of the Bulgarian ethnos. Scholars argue that the millet system was instrumental to transforming the Bulgarian Exarchate into an entity that promoted ethnoreligious nationalism amongst Orthodox Bulgarians. On 11 May 1872 in the Bulgarian St. Stephen Church in Constantinople, which had been closed by the Ecumenical Patriarch's order, the Bulgarian hierarchs, celebrated a liturgy, whereafter the autocephaly of the Bulgarian Church was declared. The decision on the unilateral declaration of autocephaly by the Bulgarian Church was not accepted by the Patriarchate of Constantinople. In this way, the term phyletism was coined at the Holy pan-Orthodox Synod that met in Istanbul on 10 August. The Synod issued an official condemnation of ecclesiastical nationalism, and declared on 18 September the Bulgarian Exarchate schismatic. Ask a question about this article.","response":"Sure, sweetie. This might seem a little complicated, but let's break it down. You know how in your school there are different groups or classes with their own teachers? And sometimes one class decides to do things a little differently, and it makes the other classes a bit upset? Well, something similar happened in Bulgaria a long time ago with their churches. Some Bulgarian leaders wanted to join another group who believed in God in a similar way, known as the \\"Church of Rome\\", or Catholic Church. The Sultan, who was like the principal, said okay and even made a special rule in 1860. This new group had around 60,000 people. But then the Bulgarian Exarchate, another important church, was established and it attracted many people from the new group, thus reducing their number by 75%. This caused a lot of disagreements, like a big school fight, which they called the \\"Church Struggle\\". It was finally resolved in 1870 when the Sultan issued another rule establishing the Bulgarian Exarchate and making it an entity that is both cultural and administrative under the leadership of the Bulgarian Exarch, which is like a principal for the group. But this didn't include anyone who wasn't part of the Orthodox Church, sort of like a club in school which only allows certain kids to join. And because of this, not all Bulgarians were represented. Lots of smart people think this system actually helped the Bulgarian Exarchate become something that encouraged national pride among Orthodox Bulgarians, like being proud of your school. In 1872, a group of Bulgarian religious leaders held a service in a church in Constantinople (another name for Istanbul) where they declared themselves to be independent, or \\"autocephalous\\". This means they wanted to be their own group not controlled by others. But the Patriarchate of Constantinople, which is like a very important teacher, didn't agree. To address this, they had a big meeting, like a school assembly, where they came up with a new word \\"phyletism\\" which means mixing nationalism and religion. They didn't really like this and called the Bulgarian Exarchate 'schismatic', which means they thought they were causing divisions. And that's the story! Could you think of any questions related to this?"},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: Which person had a husband and a fiance? A Bill of Divorcement describes a day in the lives of a middle-aged Englishwoman named Margaret \\"Meg\\" Fairfield; her daughter Sydney; Sydney's fiancé Kit Humphreys; Meg's fiancé Gray Meredith; and Meg's husband Hilary, who escapes after spending almost twenty years in a mental hospital. After the family discusses Hilary's genetic predisposition toward psychiatric problems, which Sydney seems to have inherited, Hilary and Sydney give up Meg and Kit in order to avoid passing this trait to future generations. The film begins on Christmas Eve as Meg gives a party in her comfortable English manor. In addition to dancing and listening to Christmas carols, Sydney and Kit happily discuss their future together, as do Meg and Gray. The only unpleasant moment of the evening occurs when the singers dedicate their performance of God Bless the Master of This House to Gray. Hilary's sister Hester objects to this because she considers Hilary to be the master of the house even though he is psychotic and institutionalized. On Christmas morning, while Meg and Gray are at church, the asylum telephones to say that Hilary has gone missing, and Hester unintentionally reveals to Sydney that insanity runs in their family. The family's official explanation of Hilary's troubles has been that he experienced shell shock while fighting in World War I, but another family member had similar problems in the past. Hester and Sydney discuss Hilary's talent as a composer, and Sydney sits down at the piano to play an unfinished sonata that Hilary wrote before going to war. A few minutes later, Hilary returns home, having escaped from the asylum. He meets Sydney and they chat comfortably, except for a heated argument that serves to further display their similarities as sensitive, free-spirited individuals.

The vet performed the free health check and was poking around his rear end checking for fly eggs ( apparently ! ) . My rabbit did n't like this and went to jump out of her grasp ... her response to which was to grab his back legs and drag him back across the table ! Why was my pet trying to escape .","response":"Step 1: Understand the situation Your rabbit was at the vet for an injection against myxomatosis, and the vet was performing a free health check, specifically checking for fly eggs near the rabbit's rear end. Step 2: Consider the rabbit's perspective It's important to think about how the rabbit might have felt during this experience. Rabbits are often naturally timid and skittish animals, so being at a vet's office and having a human poking and examining them can be a stressful experience. Step 3: Evaluate the potential reasons for the rabbit's reaction In light of the rabbit's perspective, there are a few possible reasons why your rabbit tried to escape: a) Discomfort: The examination near the rabbit's rear end might have been uncomfortable for your pet, as it is a sensitive area. b) Fear: Your rabbit could have been scared as it was being held by a stranger (the vet) in an unfamiliar environment (the vet's office) and subjected to an unusual experience (poking and examination). c) Stress: The combined factors of being in an unfamiliar place and being handled by a stranger could have caused your rabbit to feel stressed, making it more likely to attempt to escape. Step 4: Determine the most probable reason Based on the information provided and considering the rabbit's perspective, it seems likely that your pet was trying to escape due to a combination of discomfort, fear, and stress. The veterinarian's handling of the situation (grabbing the back legs and dragging the rabbit back) might have further exacerbated these feelings, making your rabbit more desperate to escape."},{"question":"Write a sentence not in English.","response":"Step 1: Choose a language other than English.

It offers detailed offline maps in a user-friendly interface that allows me to get around without any issues. One significant aspect that sets this app apart from other map applications is its ability to function offline. This means that I do not have to worry about using up my mobile data while on the go and can still access maps even in areas with no network coverage. The app offers various customization options, such as choosing between different map styles and setting waypoints, which I find particularly useful during long road trips. The voice navigation, while initially taking some time to get used to, generally provides accurate turn-by-turn directions. However, there are a few areas where I believe the app can improve to earn that fifth star. First, the search functionality could be more intuitive - sometimes it is a bit difficult to find a specific location, especially if the address is slightly misspelled or incomplete. Additionally, even though I appreciate the frequent updates to the maps, the process of downloading new map versions should be quicker and less cumbersome. Overall, I would highly recommend the net.osmand.plus app for anyone who is looking for a reliable and feature-packed map and navigation tool.

It is important to break down and analyze the similarities and differences in both sentences to better understand if one can be considered true based on the other. Firstly, the similarities: both sentences involve two individuals engaged in some kind of physical combat or martial arts. It is reasonable to assume that people practicing martial arts could be in a fighting scenario, so linking the two sentences is not entirely off base. However, there are key differences between the two sentences which make them distinct from one another: 1. Clothing: In the first sentence, \\"two guys in street clothes\\" suggests that they are wearing casual attire, which is not specifically designed for martial arts or fighting in a formal setting. In contrast, the second sentence does not provide any information about their clothing. 2. Location: The first sentence does not specify where the martial arts are being performed, only hinting that it might be on the street or in a casual environment. The second sentence, on the other hand, distinctly places the scene \\"inside a ring,\\" which implies a more formal or professional fighting environment, like a boxing or wrestling ring. 3. Type of combat: While the first sentence refers to \\"martial arts,\\" which can cover a wide range of disciplines such as kung fu, karate, or jiu-jitsu, the second sentence simply mentions \\"fighting,\\" which does not provide details about the specific type of combat or martial arts style being used. Considering all these points, it is not entirely accurate to say that \\"Two men are fighting inside a ring\\" is a true statement based on the sentence \\"Two guys in street clothes doing some martial arts.\\" While there are some similarities, the differences in clothing, location, and combat style make it difficult to draw a definitive conclusion that one sentence is true based solely on the other. Furthermore, these differences suggest that the situations described in both sentences may not be identical or occurring under the same circumstances."},{"question":"Q:Information: - Ultimate Diamond is the seventh studio album released by Japanese voice actress and pop singer Nana Mizuki on June 3, 2009.

Rooted in skiffle, beat, and 1950s rock and roll, the Beatles later experimented with several musical styles, ranging from pop ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock, often incorporating classical elements and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways. In the early 1960s, their enormous popularity first emerged as \\"Beatlemania\\", but as the group's music grew in sophistication, led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, they came to be perceived as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the counterculture of the 1960s. - Rock music is a genre of popular music that originated as \\"rock and roll\\" in the United States in the 1950s, and developed into a range of different styles in the 1960s and later, particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States. It has its roots in 1940s' and 1950s' rock and roll, itself heavily influenced by blues, rhythm and blues and country music. Rock music also drew strongly on a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk, and incorporated influences from jazz, classical and other musical sources. - Supersonic Girl is the debut album of J-Pop singer, Nana Mizuki. It was released on 5 December 2001. - \\"Innocent Starter\\" is the tenth single by Japanese singer Nana Mizuki. The title track was the opening theme for the anime \\"Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha\\".

It was released on December 6, 2000 by King Records. - Pop rock is rock music with a lighter, smoother approach that is more reminiscent of commercial pop music. Originating in the 1950s as an alternative to rock and roll, early pop rock was influenced by the beat, arrangements, and style of rock and roll (and sometimes doo wop), but placed a greater emphasis on professional songwriting and recording craft. The detractors of pop rock often deride it as a slick, commercial product, less authentic than rock music. - , also known by the abbreviations and SAS, is a Japanese rock band that first formed in 1974. - The Beach Boys are an American rock band formed in Hawthorne, California in 1961. The group's original lineup consisted of brothers Brian, Dennis, and Carl Wilson, their cousin Mike Love, and their friend Al Jardine. They emerged at the vanguard of the \\"California Sound\\", initially performing original surf songs that gained international popularity for their distinct vocal harmonies and lyrics reflecting a southern California youth culture of surfing, cars, and romance. Rooted in jazz-based vocal groups, 1950s rock and roll, and doo-wop, Brian led the band in devising novel approaches to music production, arranging his compositions for studio orchestras, and experimenting with several genres ranging from pop ballads to psychedelic and baroque styles. - J-pop (often stylized as J-POP; \\"jeipoppu\\"; an abbreviation for Japanese pop), natively also known simply as pops, is a musical genre that entered the musical mainstream of Japan in the 1990s. Modern J-pop has its roots in traditional Japanese music, but significantly in 1960s pop and rock music, such as The Beatles and The Beach Boys, which led to Japanese rock bands such as Happy End fusing rock with Japanese music in the early 1970s. J-pop was further defined by new wave groups in the late 1970s, particularly electronic synthpop band Yellow Magic Orchestra and pop rock band Southern All Stars. - Traditional Japanese music is the folk or traditional music of Japan.

Translate to Turkish","response":"Ve bu, evdeki eğitimlerinden kaynaklanıyor,\\" diye SETimes'a anlattı. Bu açıklama, günümüzde eğitim sistemi ve çocukların kişisel gelişimi hakkında yapılan genel tartışmalara dikkat çekiyor. Ev eğitimi, öğrencilere düzenli bir okul ortamında öğretilen derslerin yanı sıra, aile değerleri, kültür ve etik konularında da eğitim sağlar. Bu nedenle, bazı insanlar ev eğitiminin geleneksel eğitim sistemine kıyasla daha fazla avantaja sahip olduğunu düşünmektedir. Ev eğitimi, öğrencilere birçok yönden fayda sağlar. Öncelikle, özelleştirilmiş bir öğrenme deneyimi sunar. Evde öğrenen çocuklar, kendi hızlarında çalışarak ve ilgi alanlarına odaklanarak bilgiyi daha etkin bir şekilde özümseyebilirler. Bu, onların okul dışındaki yaşamlarına da olumlu bir etki yapabilir. Ayrıca, ev eğitimi çocuklara daha fazla teşvik ve destek sunar. Anne ve babalar, çocuklarının güçlü ve zayıf yönlerini bildiklerinden, onlara daha iyi eğitim ve öğretim sunarak akademik başarılarını artırabilirler. Bu, çocukların daha özgüvenli, bağımsız ve kendine yeterli bireyler haline gelmelerine yardımcı olur. Ev eğitimi, aynı zamanda öğrencilere eğitimde süreklilik ve istikrar sağlar. Evde eğitim gören çocuklar, özellikle de düşük gelirli ailelere sahip olanlar, okul değişikliklerinden ve kesintilerden daha az etkilenir. Bu sağlamlık ve istikrar, onların akademik başarılarına ve genel yaşam başarılarına da yansır. Ancak, ev eğitiminin de bazı dezavantajları vardır. İlk olarak, sosyal becerilerin gelişimi ev eğitimiyle sınırlıdır. Okul ortamında, öğrenciler sınıf arkadaşları ve öğretmenlerle etkileşime girerek sosyal yeteneklerini geliştirirler. Evde öğrenen çocuklar, bu tür sosyal etkileşimlerden mahrum kalabilirler. Bu, onların işbirliği, iletişim ve problem çözme becerilerini etkileyebilir ve genel yaşam başarılarını olumsuz yönde etkileyebilir. Buna ek olarak, evde eğitim alacak nitelikte bir öğretmenin bulunması her zaman mümkün olmayabilir. Kaliteli eğitimi sağlayacak kaynak ve deneyime sahip olan yetişkinlerin bulunması, özellikle uzmanlık gerektiren konularda zor olabilir. Bu durum, ev eğitiminin akademik başarısını sınırlayabilir. Sonuç olarak, ev eğitimi öğrencilere çeşitli avantajlar sunar, ancak sosyal becerilerin gelişimi ve öğretmen kalitesi gibi bazı dezavantajları da vardır. Aileler bu faktörleri göz önünde bulundurarak, ev eğitimi ve geleneksel eğitim arasında en uygun seçeneği belirleyebilirler."},{"question":"Definition: Your task is to generate the next utterance in a given dialogue.

The fiscal year ends September 30, meaning the House and Senate will need to pass a continuing resolution in less than a month to keep the government open. This time around, the big sticking point is how long such a resolution would last: Conservatives want a six-month deal that would push the larger money fight into 2017, under a new president and Congress. Democrats, however, are pushing for a shorter resolution that would require a lame-duck Congress to return after the election to hammer out a spending package. Beyond that, a slew of other issues are on the agenda, most notably funding to curb the spread of Zika, reports Politico. Before the summer recess, a bill stalled in the Senate as Democrats objected to GOP demands that money come out of Ebola research and ObamaCare. Since then, Zika has begun to spread locally in Florida, ramping up pressure to act, notes USA Today. Also on the radar, per NBC News: A House GOP push to impeach IRS chief John Koskinen over his agency's perceived political bias, determining whether Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland will get a hearing in the Senate, and a House vote on a measure designed to prevent suspected terrorists from buying guns.

The coal mine is operated by a group of dedicated miners under the supervision of five exceptionally devoted supervisors. One fateful night, the town decides to throw a lively dance party, a long-held tradition of the townspeople to celebrate the onset of spring. As the people in town prepare for the festivities, miners continue working on a regular shift, unaware of the true extent of the revelry that awaits them above ground. The anticipation and excitement of the dance are contagious, and the coal mine supervisors find themselves grappling with their responsibility to the miners and their desire to partake in the celebration. As they initially try to maintain a balance, they eventually succumb to the enticing atmosphere and leave the mine in the hands of the Miners' Captain, a highly respected member of the workforce. With the supervisors away, one by one, the miners begin to hear the distant music and laughter from the party and decide to join the celebration while the Miners' Captain continues to work. The night is filled with alcohol, merriment, and, surprisingly, heartfelt connections - as townspeople mingle with the miners, building friendships and even sparking romances. However, the night takes a tragic turn when a dangerous explosion occurs in the coal mine. With only the Miners' Captain remaining in the mine, the town's tension reaches a breaking point, and the real question begins to emerge: how many supervisors had abandoned their duties, leaving the miners and the Captain in the hands of danger? As the story unravels, the truth gradually surfaces, unveiling how the disaster unfolded - from negligent supervisors to the miners' choices of disregarding safety precautions. As relationships develop and fractures occur among the town's people, the movie ultimately delves deep into themes of responsibility, loyalty, and the complex minefield of human desires. In the end, the town mourns the loss of their beloved Miners’ Captain while reflecting upon their values and priorities. The tragedy forces everyone to confront the power of choices and consequences, leaving the surviving supervisors to grapple with their guilt and remorse over prioritizing the dance over their duties in the mine. The Unseen Dance explores the intricate interplay between responsibility, temptation, and the consequences of the choices we make – all while shedding light on the importance of balancing work, community, and our personal desires."},{"question":"Leo: Test for natural language inference.

After Keith Barker's breakthrough at 76-2, Ireland and England international Rankin then took three wickets in 24 balls to leave Notts on 125-6. The whole of the evening session was lost when the rain arrived at tea. Notts' only bright spot was opener Jake Libby, who lasted over three hours for a determinedly gritty 59. Both teams made one change from their last Championship match, in the pace bowling department. The Bears brought in Mark Adair for only his second Championship game in place of Oliver Hannon-Dalby, while Nottinghamshire's Luke Fletcher replaced Harry Gurney (bruised heel). After choosing to bat, Notts moved slowly in the morning session as the ball swung in humid conditions, and reached 71-2 at lunch from 32 overs. The impressively economical Rikki Clarke broke through in the ninth over when he hit Steve Mullaney's off-stump before Michael Lumb, having made just 10 in 62 minutes, misread spinner Jeetan Patel's arm-ball to be trapped lbw. After facing 117 balls to bat through the session for 37, Libby speeded up a little after lunch. But, after Brendan Taylor lofted a catch to long leg, Riki Wessels edged a brute of a ball from Rankin to wicketkeeper Tim Ambrose. Then, after seeing Samit Patel also get caught behind, Libby, who started this season on loan with Northamptonshire, became the third player to be caught by Ambrose off the bowling of Rankin. It earned the Irishman impressive figures of 3-25 from his 14 overs. Warwickshire fast bowler Boyd Rankin told BBC WM: \\"I'm pleased with how I bowled. I've been feeling pretty good in the last few weeks. I bowled pretty well against Lancashire but just didn't get wickets. \\"We kept them to two runs per over pretty much all the whole time. All the guys bowled well but it was just my day to take a few wickets. \\"The pitch is quite slow and it's not really doing much off the deck. It is a little bit tacky but hopefully it will flatten out a bit for when we come to bat.\\" Notts head coach Mick Newell told BBC Radio Nottingham: \\"I thought there'd be a bit more pace in the pitch. It was quite difficult to score off the medium quick bowlers, then Boyd Rankin stepped it up a little bit. \\"He was quicker than everybody else. He bowled a very good spell in the middle of the afternoon which put under some serious pressure. \\"Jake Libby batted very well. He started very well for Northants.

Solve 3*f + 6*f = -163*f - 860 for f.","response":"To solve the equation 3f + 6f = -163f - 860 for f, follow these steps: Step 1: Combine like terms on both sides of the equation. 3f + 6f has a total of 9f on the left side of the equation. The equation now looks like this: 9f = -163f - 860 Step 2: Isolate the f variable on one side of the equation. To do this, add 163f to both sides of the equation to cancel out the -163f on the right side: 9f + 163f = -163f - 860 + 163f Combine the f terms on the left side, which results in 172f: 172f = -860 Step 3: Solve for f by dividing both sides of the equation by 172: f = -860 / 172 Step 4: Simplify the fraction. f = -5 So the solution is f = -5.

Movie title: Stalag 17 Movie plot: Captured Americans coping with life in a German POW camp in World War II are puzzled by the simplicity with which the Germans are able to stave off escape attempts, shooting those who try. Sefton (William Holden) is a POW who has profitably wagered with his fellow American prisoners that these escapes would fail.The POWs fear there may be an informer in their midst, but who is it? As it becomes clearer and clearer to his fellow inmates that Sefton has considerable contact with his German captors, his fellow POWs mistakenly conclude that he is the informer and they turn on him, including physically beating him and helping themselves to some of his belongings.Sefton understands in full that to clear his name, he must determine the identity of the real informer, and he is, eventually, able to work out that Price (Peter Graves), whose English is impeccable, is a German informant masquerading as an American POW. Written messages, Sefton discovers, are being smuggled by Price to the Germans through a hollow chess piece on the chessboard in the barracks, wth phony air raid drills staged to enable the Germans to retrieve these messages undetected.Now realizing that Price has figured prominently in the death of the Americans that have attempted escape, Sefton plots revenge, and, after exposing Price's true identity to his fellow POWs, he maneuvers to force Price to make an unauthorized exit from the barracks. To the guards manning the tower, Price's exit looks like an American escape attempt, and they shoot him, much to the dismay of Stalag Commandant Von Scherbach (Otto Preminger).The diversion created by the shooting incident gives Sefton a chance to escape, and he takes with him a brave lieutenant (Don Taylor) who has recently been captured. Because of the measures of success against the Germans he had gained prior to his capture, the lieutenant is a marked man, but he and Sefton are successful in their escape attempt.The elimination of the German informer and the first successful escape by American POWs lift the...

[II] positive. Short movie review: sixties-style slickness Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","response":"Based on the given short movie review, it's not entirely clear whether the critic is thinking positively or negatively about the movie. The term \\"sixties-style slickness\\" can be interpreted in a couple of ways. However, before diving into the interpretations, let's look at the context behind the phrase. The sixties were a period known for radical change in terms of politics, culture, and fashion. This era brought about vibrant patterns, bold colors, and innovative designs, all of which contributed to the term \\"sixties-style.\\" \\"Slickness,\\" on the other hand, generally implies a sense of smoothness or polish. It can either be impressive and sophisticated or superficial and contrived, depending on the connotation. Now, considering the phrase \\"sixties-style slickness\\" in a movie review, it could be perceived in either a positive or negative light based on the critic's intent. Interpretation I, negative: In a negative context, the critic may be implying that the movie's style, visual appeal, or atmosphere is overly polished and superficial, perhaps even to the point of becoming cliché or outdated. In this case, the critic could be viewing the movie as trying too hard to tap into the nostalgia of the sixties without genuine depth or substance, thus resulting in an underwhelming cinematic experience. Interpretation II, positive: Conversely, the critic may be praising the movie for successfully capturing the distinctive charm and visual panache of the sixties era. This would mean that the \\"slickness\\" perceived in the film refers to a well-crafted, polished, and visually engaging production. Through this lens, the critic could be admiring the movie's ability to evoke a nostalgic feel while still presenting a dynamic and compelling narrative. In conclusion, it is difficult to assert with certainty whether the critic is thinking positively or negatively of the movie just by the phrase \\"sixties-style slickness.\\" However, by considering both possible interpretations and understanding the context behind the term, we can infer that the critic might be expressing either dissatisfaction with the movie's superficiality or admiration for its well-crafted visual style. Further context, such as a longer review or more information about the critic's usual preferences, would be necessary to accurately determine their stance."},{"question":"What happens next?

Scientists are finding evidence that gum chewing may be good for your health. It may even help improve your test scores. This exciting research is just beginning. And in the meantime, companies are also experimenting with adding vitamins, minerals, medicines, and other substances that could give gum the power to cure headaches and fight everything from serious diseases to bad breath. Other researchers are finding that gum might work better than a pill to deliver medicines and other substances into the bloodstream. That's because the lining of our cheeks can absorb certain substances more quickly than our stomachs and intestines can. That discovery could help other researchers develop medicine-containing gums that fight colds, ease headaches, battle nervousness, and more. Scientists might even create antimicrobial gums that cure bad breath. Those projects may take years, but gum scientists have already had at least one recent success: They've created a gum that could help us stay awake. Researchers have produced a gum called Stay Alert.

John of Ephesus' account describes the events around the Christianization of Alodia in detail. As the southernmost of the three Nubian kingdoms, Alodia was the last to be converted to Christianity. According to John, the Alodian King was aware of the conversion of Nobadia in 543 and asked him to send a bishop who would also baptize his people. The request was granted in 580, leading to the baptism of the King, his family and the local nobility. Thus, Alodia became a part of the Christian world under the Coptic Patriarchate of Alexandria. After conversion, several pagan temples, such as the one in Musawwarat es-Sufra, were probably converted into churches. The extent and speed with which Christianity spread among the Alodian populace is uncertain. Despite the conversion of the nobility, it is likely that Christianization of the rural population would have proceeded slowly, if at all.Between 639 and 641, Muslim Arabs conquered Egypt from the Byzantine Empire. Makuria, which by this time had been unified with Nobadia, fended off two subsequent Muslim invasions, one in 641/642 and another in 652. In the aftermath, Makuria and the Arabs agreed to sign the Baqt, a peace treaty that included a yearly exchange of gifts and socioeconomic regulations between Arabs and Nubians. Alodia was explicitly mentioned in the treaty as not being affected by it. While the Arabs failed to conquer Nubia, they began to settle along the western coast of the Red Sea. They founded the port towns of Aydhab and Badi in the 7th century and Suakin, first mentioned in the 10th century. From the 9th century, they pushed further inland, settling among the Beja throughout the Eastern Desert. Arab influence would remain confined to the east of the Nile until the 14th century.","response":"The kingdom that converted to Christianity before Alodia, as mentioned in the provided text, is Nobadia.

This task involves multiple steps and necessitates a clear understanding of various physical objects and tools, as well as their properties and usage. 1. Conceptualizing and planning: Before starting construction, one must visualize the design and layout of the bookshelf, taking into consideration its size, intended location, and purpose. This planning stage might involve sketching or creating a digital model using design software. 2. Measurements and materials: With a clear idea in mind, the next step is to gather the necessary materials. In this case, wood would be the primary physical object. One must know the type, thickness, and quantity of wood required and should be familiar with using measuring tools like measuring tapes, rulers, and squares to ensure accuracy. 3. Cutting and shaping: After obtaining the right materials, various cutting tools are needed to shape the wood into the required pieces. Familiarity with physical objects such as hand saws, jigsaws, and table saws is crucial, as these are used to create the shelves, sides, and back of the bookshelf. Additionally, understanding how to use clamps for securing the wood and sandpaper for smoothing surfaces and edges is necessary. 4. Joinery and assembly: Once all pieces are cut and shaped, they must be joined together. Knowledge of different woodworking joinery techniques, such as dowels, screws, or wood glue, is required. The use of clamps to secure the parts while the glue dries or drilling pilot holes for screws is essential. Moreover, understanding how to use a level is important to ensure the bookshelf remains balanced. 5. Finishing: The final step entails applying a finish to enhance the wood's appearance and protect it from wear. Physical objects and materials used in this process might include paint, varnish, or wood stain, as well as paintbrushes and sandpaper for surface preparation. A good understanding of these materials and proper application techniques is necessary for a professional result. Overall, constructing a wooden bookshelf is a task that demands knowledge of various physical objects, including materials (wood, screws, glue), tools (saws, clamps, drills, sandpaper, levels), and finishing products (paint, varnish, wood stain).

The open nature of meadows allows foxes to use their keen senses of hearing and smell to locate prey effectively. The other possible answers, while somewhat related to places where foxes might be found, are not as closely aligned with human common sense related to fox hunting behavior: 1. Arctic tundra: Although the Arctic fox can be found in the tundra regions, this answer is less aligned with human common sense because it refers to a specific subspecies of fox native only to very cold environments. The question asks for a general fox hunting location other than forests so it could be less applicable to common fox species such as the red fox. 2. Beach: Foxes can occasionally be found near beaches, but this is not a typical hunting environment for them. Beaches usually lack the vegetation and diversity of small prey found in forests and meadows, so it's less expected for foxes to be hunting there regularly. 3. Great outdoors: While this term encompasses meadows, forests, and other natural environments, it is a very broad and vague term. It doesn't offer specific information related to fox hunting behavior or habitat like \\"open meadow.\\" 4. England: This is a geographical location and not a habitat type. While foxes, particularly the red fox, might be found in England, it doesn't provide any information about the specific environment they would be hunting in when not in a forest."},{"question":"Question: Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot. If the question isn't answerable, please output \\"Can't answer\\". Question: Which character dies? Title: Little Children Movie plot: Sarah Pierce (Kate Winslet) is a 30-year-old, stay-at-home mother in a small Massachusetts suburban community. She had been working on a doctorate in English, but once she married Richard (Gregg Edelman) and had their daughter, the presently five-year-old Lucy (Sadie Goldstein), she set aside her research. Now she spends her days taking Lucy to a local park along with three other stay at-home mothers: the severe and judgmental Mary Ann (Mary B. McCann) and more timid Theresa (Trini Alvorado) and Cheryl (Marsha Dietlein). They enjoy ogling from a distance Brad Adamson (Patrick Wilson), the handsome and well built father who brings his son, Aaron (Ty Simpkins), to the park. When their children use the same swing set, Sarah and Brad have an opportunity to talk to one another, titillating the other women. But when they, on a lark, hug and kiss, the women immediately take their children out of the park and refuse to associate with Sarah anymore.Both Brad and Sarah have unhappy home lives. Brad has yet to pass the Massachusetts state bar exam and doesn't even want to be a lawyer. However, his bossy wife, Kathy (Jennifer Connelly), pushes him to succeed. She makes documentaries for public television for a living. They live a bit beyond their means, forcing them to accept financial support from Kathy's mother. Their sex life is non-existent because Kathy is too self-involved in her career and being a mother. When he is supposed to be studying for the bar exam, Brad instead sits and watches teenagers skateboard outside his house, fantasizing about being young and carefree again. One night, an acquaintance, Larry (Noah Emmerich), persuades Brad, who played quarterback on his high school football team, to join his amateur football team, the Guardians.Larry is a former police officer forced to retire a few years earlier when he accidentally shot a teenager who robbed a store.

He came out of the coal mine with a face covered in black. Most coal and ore comes from open-pit mines nowadays.","response":"In the two sentences provided, the word \\"mine\\" has the same fundamental meaning, but is used in slightly different contexts. The term \\"mine\\" refers to a location where minerals, ores, coal, or other valuable substances are extracted from the Earth. In the first sentence, \\"He came out of the coal mine with a face covered in black,\\" the word \\"mine\\" specifically refers to a coal mine. This is a type of mine where coal, a fossil fuel, is extracted from underground. The context here suggests that it's a subterranean mine or an underground mine, implying that the extraction process takes place beneath the Earth's surface. In this scenario, the mine would typically have tunnels and shafts to allow access for workers and equipment. In the second sentence, \\"Most coal and ore comes from open-pit mines nowadays,\\" the word \\"mine\\" is used in a more general context to include both coal and ore mines. Additionally, this sentence highlights a specific type of mine known as an open-pit mine. An open-pit mine, also referred to as a surface mine, is a mining technique where the extraction of minerals, ores, and coal occurs at the Earth's surface by removing layers of soil and rock. These mines are characterized by large pits or terraces created during the excavation process. In conclusion, while the word \\"mine\\" retains its fundamental meaning of a location for extracting valuable substances from the Earth in both sentences, the specific context differs. In the first sentence, \\"mine\\" refers to an underground coal mine, while in the second sentence, it generally includes open-pit mines for both coal and ore."},{"question":"Data: Peter Stöger CLUB SC Wiener Neustadt What would a sentence about this data be like?","response":"Peter Stöger, an accomplished Austrian football manager and former player, is best known for his impressive coaching tenure at renowned clubs, which includes his remarkable work leading SC Wiener Neustadt, a professional football team based in Wiener Neustadt, Austria, that competes in the Austrian Football Second League and has a strong track record of developing local talents while fostering a competitive environment in the country's football landscape."},{"question":"Briefly summarize this sentence: the eurostar train service has urged passengers to cancel upcoming trips through the tunnel under the english channel because of lingering delays after an undersea fire .","response":"Eurostar urges passengers to cancel trips due to ongoing delays from an undersea fire in the English Channel tunnel."},{"question":"Please add spaces between words: IcelandwillreceiveUSD2.1bn.fromtheIMF.AdditionalloansofuptoUSD3bn.havebeensecuredfromDenmark,Finland,Norway,Sweden,RussiaandPoland.TheFaroeIslandshaveannouncedthattheywouldlendIcelandUSD50million.","response":"To add spaces between words in the given text, I will follow these steps: 1.

The question and answer pair are described below.","response":"Question: Can horses sleep while a group of girls are seated on them playing a game? Answer: No, horses would not be able to sleep while a group of girls are seated on them playing a game. Horses are large, sensitive animals that need to feel safe and comfortable in order to rest, and having multiple people sitting on their backs while playing games could cause stress and discomfort. Horses sleep in two ways: standing up and lying down. When they sleep standing up, they are in a light sleep state (called drowsing) and can be easily awakened, as their muscles are still somewhat engaged. This allows them to quickly flee from any potential threats, a behavior that has developed as an evolutionary advantage. Conversely, when horses lie down, they enter a deep sleep, which is essential for their overall health and well-being. This deeper sleep is also called REM (rapid eye movement) sleep and typically lasts for short periods, around 30 minutes to an hour per day. It is already a challenge for horses to maintain balance with riders on their backs who are actively engaging with the horse (e.g., riding, trotting, and cantering). Therefore, it is highly unlikely that a horse could fall asleep or even drowse while several people are seated on its back, especially if they are moving and playing a game. This would cause the horse physical discomfort and could potentially be harmful to both the horse and the riders. In summary, horses need a calm, secure environment to rest and sleep. Playing games with a group of girls seated on their backs would not provide the necessary conditions for a horse to sleep, and it could be potentially dangerous for both the horse and the riders."},{"question":"Q:Information: - Japan (\\"Nippon\\" or \\"Nihon\\" ; formally \\"\\" or \\"Nihon-koku\\", means \\"State of Japan\\") is a sovereign island nation in Eastern Asia.

When it comes to human or animal behaviors during copulation or sexual activity, using spit or saliva is often employed as a makeshift lubricant. Lubrication is essential for reducing friction between body parts and ensuring a comfortable sexual experience. Let's examine the other possible answers: 1. Mark territory: This option does not fit the context, as marking territory typically involves urination or other scent-based actions to establish one's presence in an area. 2. Kiss: While saliva can be exchanged during a kiss, the question's context refers specifically to copulation, making \\"lubricate\\" a more accurate answer. 3. Procreation: The act of copulating itself serves the purpose of procreation, but using spit wouldn't specifically contribute to procreation in any direct way. 4. Release tension: While it's conceivable that releasing tension might be indirectly achieved through sexual activity, using spit in this context would not be directly associated with releasing tension. In conclusion, considering the copulation context and the role spit can serve as lubricant, the correct answer is \\"lubricate.\\""},{"question":"I did not get a bad cut; however, I did not get what I asked for.

Title: Class Trip Movie plot: The story begins with Nicolas at ten years old and dreading the school ski trip. Nicolas was worried that he wouldn't fit in with the other boys. His overprotective father decides to take Nicolas by himself instead of going with the group. En route, Nicolas and his father pass the aftermath of an apparently fatal car accident. Seeing police ahead while the traffic had stopped, Nicolas' father becomes nervous and conceals all loose items within the car in the trunk â and we see that Nicolas' travel bag is next to several matching briefcases. Nicolas subsequently forgets his bag in his father's car, increasing his awkwardness. He is befriended by Hodkann, another pupil. One of Nicolas main fears is wetting his bed, and the situation gets worse when he gets a bed just above Hodkann. At night Nicolas tries to stay awake but falls asleep, waking up from a wet dream but believing he has wet his pants. He leaves his bed to clean his clothes and while returning he discovers it snowing outside. Nicolas goes outside into the freezing cold and ends up locked out, and in desperation curls up inside the car of his ski instructor, Patrick. Before he drifts off to sleep he sees a van driving away. He is found in the morning by Patrick and is taken in to a study with a fever. Later that day he goes to a cafÃ© while the other boys are skiing. While in the cafÃ©, police come looking for RenÃ©, a young boy who is missing. That night while sleeping he has a nightmare. He dreams that he is at a theme park with Hodkann and Patrick and that he goes on a giant caterpillar while his little brother is looked after by another seemingly friendly man. Once he is on the caterpillar he sees his brother being walked to a white van by the stranger. Later he is found outside the park after having one of his organs taken.

Article: A new study has found that it may be possible to train people to be more intelligent, increasing the brainpower they had at birth. Until now,it has been widely assumed that the kind of mental ability that allows us to solve new problems without having any relevant previous experience--what psychologists call fluid intelligence--is innate and cannot be taught(though people can raise their grades on tests of it by practicing). But in the new study,researchers describe a method for improving this skill,along with experiments to prove it works. The key, researchers found, was carefully structured training in working memory--the kind that allows memorization of a telephone number just long enough to dial it.This type of memory is closely related to fluid intelligence,so the researchers reasoned that improving it might lead to improvements in fluid intelligence. First they measured fluid intelligence of volunteers using standard tests.Then they trained each in a complicated memory task--the child's card game,in which they had to recall a card they saw and heard.During the course, they needed to ignore irrelevant items, monitor ongoing performance,manage two tasks at the same time and connect related items to one another in space and time. The four groups experienced a half-hour of training daily for 8, 12, 17 and 19 days, respectively.To make sure they were not just improving their test-taking skills,the researchers compared them with control groups that took the tests without the training. The results, published Monday in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,were striking.Improvement in the trained groups was a lot greater.Moreover,the longer they trained, the higher their scores were.All performers,from the weakest to the strongest,showed significant improvement. \\"Our results show you can increase your intelligence with proper training.\\" said Dr Jaeggi, a co-author of the paper.\\"No one knows how long the gains will last after training stops,\\" he added, \\"and the experiment's design did not allow the...

Everything went fine for both of them. They later found out the bad news. Mike had been infected with HIV. Luckily enough Pete was healthy, he didn't get any diseases. Which friend had a virus that is transmitted by contact with infected blood? Hint: The Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) is the virus that causes Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ( AIDS ). Most researchers believe that the HIV originated in sub-Saharan Africa during the 20th century. HIV is transmitted by sexual contact and by contact with infected bodily fluids, such as blood, semen, breast milk, and vaginal secretions. It is also passed from mother to fetus. HIV is now a pandemic , with an estimated (as of 2008) 38.6 million people now living with the disease worldwide. It is estimated that AIDS has killed more than 25 million people since it was first recognized in 1981. For further information about HIV/AIDS, see the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) web site at http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/resources/factsheets/ . The answer is:","response":"Mike had the virus that is transmitted by contact with infected blood. The virus in question here is the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), which ultimately causes Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). HIV is primarily transmitted through sexual contact and exposure to infected bodily fluids such as blood, semen, vaginal secretions, and breast milk. In Mike's case, he contracted HIV through unprotected sexual contact with his date. Pete, on the other hand, was fortunate not to contract any diseases during his unprotected sexual encounter. Although he was also at risk, given the nature of the activity, he did not end up getting infected in this instance. HIV is a global issue that has affected millions of people around the world. As of 2008, it is estimated that 38.6 million individuals are living with HIV, and since its initial recognition in 1981, AIDS has led to the deaths of over 25 million people. The pandemic first originated in sub-Saharan Africa during the 20th century, and today it remains a significant public health concern. Prevention efforts, including practicing safe sex and regular testing, are crucial in reducing the spread of the virus.

Options: - internet - car - television - book - newspaper Let's think step by step:","response":"1. Internet: The internet is mainly a digital platform, so it doesn't provide information in print form. However, it serves as an effective source for current events through news websites and social media channels. So, this option doesn't fulfill the requirement of print form. 2. Car: A car isn't a source of information. Its primary purpose is transportation. Hence, it doesn't provide any printed information on current events. 3. Television: Television is an electronic medium that broadcasts news and current events through audio-visual channels. Again, although it is an excellent source of information, it doesn't provide information in print form. 4. Book: Books can contain current events information. However, books have a longer time between creation and publication, making them less likely to provide up-to-date information on current events. Additionally, they don't come in a print form specifically designed for disseminating ongoing news. 5. Newspaper: Newspapers are published daily or weekly and are specifically designed for updating readers on current events. They are available in physical print form and can be purchased at newsstands, bookstores, or delivered to your doorstep through subscription services. Based on the given options, the most suitable choice for finding information on current events in print form is the newspaper."},{"question":"Lash is associate dean at the University of Southern California Law School. Johnson is a justice on California's Second District Court of Appeal. Lash and Johnson are co-chairs of the California Commission on Access to Justice. The full report can be viewed at (www.calbar.org). In her year-long odyssey through the California justice system, Katherine, a 35-year-old single mother with three children, experienced failure at every turn. Leaving her abusive husband, she moved into the only apartment she could afford, and soon discovered a broken toilet and non- working oven, rats and roaches, and a fourthfloor landing with no railing. She began withholding rent pending repairs her landlord refused to make, but then her Medi-Cal benefits were cut off when she could not provide rent receipts. She lost health care for her children and herself, although she is a borderline diabetic in need of medication and her children were suffering from rat bites. Katherine tried to seek help through the courts. Representing herself at an administrative hearing, she lost her appeal to restore Medi-Cal benefits because she did not have proper documentation of the rent account. When she went to a courthouse to file a complaint against her landlord, she found the process so confusing that she gave up and went home. According to \\"The Path to Justice: A Five-Year Status Report on Access to Justice in California,\\" prepared by the California Commission on Access to Justice, Katherine is just one of 4.6 million poor Californians whose basic civil legal needs -- often involving such critical needs as housing, health care, education, employment, safety and transportation -- are not being addressed. California has a critical dearth of legal services for the poor, and, as this report makes clear, it is imperative that the state join with the federal government and private funders to increase resources so that all Californians, regardless of income, have equal access to our justice system. Our justice system is predicated on the assumption that both parties will be represented by lawyers who act as gatekeepers and guides through a complex legal system that would otherwise be inaccessible to many of us. Unfortunately, the most vulnerable members of our society are the least able to afford legal services. California does have a strong network of legal aid organizations that try to help meet the needs of the poor, but there's just one legal aid lawyer available per 10,000 poor people. We may promise \\"justice for all,\\" but for those who can't afford a lawyer, that promise is often a lie. In its new report, the Commission on Access to Justice notes some significant steps toward providing equal access to justice for all Californians. Question: \\"Why was Katherine unsuccessful in representing herself?\\" Response: \\"She did not produce the proper documents\\" Does the response correctly answer the question?","response":"Yes, the response correctly answers the question. Katherine was unsuccessful in representing herself because she did not bring the proper documentation to the administrative hearing, causing her to lose her appeal to restore her Medi-Cal benefits. Additionally, when she attempted to file a complaint against her landlord, the process was too confusing for her, leading her to give up and go home. These two factors contributed to her unsuccessful attempts at self-representation, making it even more difficult for her to address her various legal needs in an already challenging environment."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: Given a sentence in the Japanese and Lao language.

Below the melting polar ice caps, a 200-foot-long praying mantis, trapped in the ice for millions of years, begins to stir. Soon after, the military personnel at Red Eagle One, a military station in northern Canada that monitors information gathered from the Distant Early Warning Line, realize that the men at one of their outposts are not responding to calls. Commanding officer Col. Joe Parkman flies there to investigate, and finds the post destroyed, its men gone, and giant slashes left in the snow outside. When a radar blip is sighted, Joe sends his pilots out to investigate, but their intended target disappears. Soon an Air Force plane is attacked by the deadly mantis. He searches the wreckage, and this time, in addition to the huge slashes, finds a five-foot-long pointed object in the snow. He takes it to General Mark Ford at the Continental Air Defense in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Ford gathers top scientists, including Professor Anton Gunther, to examine the object, but when they cannot identify it, Gunther recommends calling in Dr. Nedrick Jackson, a paleontologist at the Museum of Natural History. When Ned gets the call from Ford, he is helping museum magazine editor Marge Blaine plan her next issue, and dodges her questions as she begs him for a big scoop.

Article: Have you ever imagined what human beings will look like in the future? Well, now you don't have to. According to AsapScience, a Canada-based video channel that touches on many different science topics, humans will be very different creatures 1,000 years from now. Artificial intelligence, genetic engineering and climate change will work together to change our bodies greatly, according to a video recently published by the channel. We could, for instance, develop red eyes as our DNA changes, and have darker skin because of global warming. The video painted a picture of a future world in which our bodies are part human, part machine. Nanobots, or tiny robots, will be put into our bodies, improving our abilities. \\"No longer will we be limited by our own physiology. We will truly become a mixture of biology and machine on the inside,\\" says the video. Meanwhile, designer babies will cause future generations to grow into intelligent, attractive people. As global warming takes hold, humans will also be skinnier and taller, as this body shape deals with heat better. In fact, Cadell Last, a researcher at the Global Brain Institute located in Belgium, believes change may happen even faster than this. As he said in a paper recently published in Current Aging Science, mankind is already going through a major evolutionary change. In less than four decades, Last claims, we will live longer, have children in old age and need artificial intelligence to finish daily tasks. \\"Your 80 or 100 is going to be so radically different than your grandparents,\\" Last said. Instead of living fast and dying young, he believes humans will live slow and die old. \\"The biological clock isn't going to be around forever,\\" he added, and said that people could pause it for some time using future technology. Just a few hundred years ago, most humans were working in the fields, while nowadays more and more are getting an education.

Now, let's compare these two statements: - The premise does not mention the reason the person is walking on the grassy hill; it only describes the person's clothing and actions. - The premise also does not mention the specific time of the event or whether it is related to school. Given this information, it is not possible to tell if the hypothesis is true or not based on the premise alone, as the premise does not provide sufficient information about the person's purpose or the time of the event. Therefore, the correct answer is: - it is not possible to tell"},{"question":"You are considering whether to buy a product. You look at the reviews. Would the following review decrease or increase the chances of you buying the product? Review title: I just don't get it Product review: Either I am really missing the point or I have too much music education, because I just don't understand why Bolin is so highly regarded. This CD is a prime example of Bolin's typical boring, cliched, pablum.

The first step is to read and understand the review, including the review title, the overall tone of the review, and the specific points the reviewer makes about the product. Step 2: Identify the reviewer's perspective. The reviewer seems to have a strong background in music education, which may influence their opinion. They find Bolin's music to be boring, cliched, and uninteresting. It is also mentioned that they prefer other musicians significantly more. Step 3: Assess the relevance of the review for your decision-making process. Consider if the reviewer's perspective and opinions align with your own taste in music and whether their criticisms of the product are likely to apply to you as well. If you are not well-versed in music or find their perspective too harsh, you may want to weigh their opinion less heavily. Step 4: Evaluate the impact of the review on the chances of buying the product. Given the overall negative tone and criticism of Bolin's music in this specific review, it would likely decrease the chances of you buying the product. However, this decision should not be based solely on this one review, and it is important to consider other reviews and factors before making a purchase."},{"question":"Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

Title: Koma Movie plot: The movie begins with a young woman, who attended a wedding party held in a hotel and became drunk, waking up in one of the hotel rooms; only to realize in horror that her kidney has been surgically removed. Socialite Ching (Angelica Lee), who also attended the party, identified Ling (Karena Lam) as the prime suspect because she found out that Ling was the only stranger presented in the ball room. She is unknown to everyone in the party, even to the hotel staff. During the police investigation, Ching discovers that Ling has been secretly involved with her boyfriend Wai (Andy Hui Chi-On), and this is the very reason why she was in the hotel when the crime was committed. Ling was released uncharged due to insufficient evidence as police believed Ching could be framing her for cheating with her boyfriend. Rather than quickly disappear, Ling starts stalking Ching, apparently jealous that Ching could have everything Ling wanted without an effort while Ling has to fight for it. Ching, at the beginning, sees that as a form of harassment, but soon twists it around and follows Ling instead. Ling seems accepting of this, showing her the darker side of life living as a poor girl compared to Ching's rich-girl background. The two engage in a subtle cat-and-mouse game, and Ching begins to fear for her life when Ling starts making threats to remove her kidney too. One night, Ching is kidnapped by a mysterious man that seems to be an ally of Ling's. Here, Ching reveals that her kidney is weak, and the man will not be able to sell it for much. She passes out, and wakes to find Ling injured beside her. Ching takes her to the hospital, and it isn't long before Ching finds out that Ling is actually a kind person, more true then the friendships Ching shares with her superficial socialite friends. She learns that Ling has a childhood sweetheart, whose identity she does not reveal. Ching and Ling then make a deal with the mysterious man so that Ching can get a kidney.

Answer: The Drake Equation is a mathematical formula developed by astrophysicist Dr. Frank Drake in 1961 as an attempt to estimate the number of extraterrestrial civilizations in our galaxy that may be able to communicate with us. It is a probabilistic argument that takes various factors into consideration, providing a tool for stimulating scientific and philosophical discussions about the existence of detectable alien life in the Milky Way galaxy. The equation is written as: N = R* × f_p × n_e × f_l × f_i × f_c × L where N = the number of civilizations in our galaxy with which we might be able to communicate R* = the average rate of star formation in our galaxy per year f_p = the fraction of those stars that have planetary systems n_e = the average number of planets per star that can potentially support life f_l = the fraction of those planets that actually develop life f_i = the fraction of planets with life that develop intelligent life (civilizations) f_c = the fraction of civilizations that develop technology that releases detectable signals into space L = the length of time such civilizations release detectable signals Each factor within the equation has various levels of uncertainty, as many of the variables are still being researched and can only be estimated. The Drake Equation does not provide a definitive answer or accurate number of extraterrestrial civilizations, but rather offers a starting point for conversations and investigations into the possibility of interstellar communication and the existence of alien civilizations within our galaxy. As our understanding of the universe and scientific methods improve, the estimates derived from the Drake Equation will become more accurate."},{"question":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

This draft, which was completed in 1957, is set 20 years after the time period depicted in To Kill a Mockingbird but is not a continuation of the narrative. This earlier version of the story follows an adult Scout Finch who travels from New York to visit her father, Atticus Finch, in Maycomb, Alabama, where she is confronted by the intolerance in her community. The Watchman manuscript was believed to have been lost until Lee's lawyer Tonja Carter discovered it; although this claim has been widely disputed. Watchman contains early versions of many of the characters from To Kill a Mockingbird. According to Lee's agent Andrew Nurnberg, Mockingbird was originally intended to be the first book of a trilogy: \\"They discussed publishing Mockingbird first, Watchman last, and a shorter connecting novel between the two.\\" This assertion has been discredited however by the rare books expert James S. Jaffe, who reviewed the pages at the request of Lee's attorney and found them to be only another draft of \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\". The statement was also contrary to Jonathan Mahler's description of how \\"Watchman\\" was seen as just the first draft of \\"Mockingbird\\". Instances where many passages overlap between the two books, in some case word for word, also refutes this assertion.\\" Answer:","response":"The difference between \\"Go Set a Watchman\\" and \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" lies in their respective narratives and the time periods they depict. \\"Go Set a Watchman,\\" completed in 1957, is set 20 years after the events of \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" and follows an adult Scout Finch as she visits her father, Atticus Finch, in Maycomb, Alabama, and confronts the intolerance in her community. In contrast, \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" focuses on Scout's childhood experiences in the 1930s alongside her brother Jem and their father Atticus in a racially divided Alabama town. Though the two books share characters and settings, their stories are not continuous, with \\"Go Set a Watchman\\" being an earlier draft of the narrative later presented in \\"To Kill a Mockingbird.\\" Additionally, claims that \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" was intended as part of a trilogy with \\"Go Set a Watchman\\" as the final book have been discredited, as many passages overlap between the two books with some being word for word identical.

Overall Tone: The overall tone of the tweet can be an essential determining factor in sentiment analysis. If the tweet's tone appears neutral, it might simply be stating a fact about the person's work schedule. However, if the tone seems positive or negative, the tweet's sentiment would lean towards either being happy or unhappy, respectively. 2. Word Choice: Specific words used in the tweet can provide clues to the sentiment. Positive words such as \\"enjoy\\", \\"happy\\", \\"great\\" or \\"productive\\" may indicate a positive sentiment, while negative words such as \\"unfortunate\\", \\"disappointed\\", \\"sad\\" or \\"frustrating\\" might suggest a negative sentiment. 3. Context: The context of the tweet is crucial in understanding the sentiment. Information about the person's work, their relationship with their father, or any relevant circumstances can deeply influence the sentiment. If the tweet author enjoys their job and their father supports their work, the sentiment might be positive. Conversely, if they are working on Father's Day when they would have planned a celebration or a family gathering, the sentiment could be negative. 4. Implied Emotions: Sometimes, tweets may not explicitly mention emotions but can still convey implicit meaning related to the sentiment. For instance, a tweet saying, \\"Working on Father's Day, but excited to celebrate later in the evening!\\" might imply a mixed sentiment where the individual is perhaps disappointed about working on that day but still looking forward to the celebrations. 5. Emojis and Images: Emojis and images can provide additional hints about the sentiment. A smiley emoji or a picture with a happy family or a celebration would convey a positive sentiment, while a sad emoji or images that exhibit frustration or disappointment would convey a negative sentiment. To sum up, the sentiment of a tweet discussing \\"working on Father's Day\\" would vary depending on the combination of the factors mentioned above, which could result in a positive, negative, mixed, or neutral sentiment. Analyzing these aspects would help create a more comprehensive understanding of the tweet's underlying emotion and sentiment."},{"question":"Думаю, что совместно можно действовать вместе с православными, римо-католиками или другими братьями.

Hydrogen from water vapor reduces the oxide, reforming water vapor and continuing this water cycle. The equivalent of a drop of water distributed over 500,000 lamps will significantly increase darkening.

Kendra made 4 more than five times as many buttons as Mari. Since we know Mari made 8 buttons, we can set up an equation for the number of buttons Kendra made: Kendra's buttons = (5 × Mari's buttons) + 4. 3. Plug in the number of buttons Mari made (which is 8). Kendra's buttons = (5 × 8) + 4. 4. Calculate the result: Kendra's buttons = 40 + 4. Kendra's buttons = 44. 5. We now know that Kendra made 44 decorated buttons. 6. Next, we need to find out how many buttons Sue made. Sue made half as many as Kendra made.

During Leopold's illness performances were impossible, so Wolfgang turned to composition. According to the writer and musician Jane Glover, Wolfgang was inspired to write symphonies after meeting Johann Christian Bach. It is not clear when this meeting occurred, or when Wolfgang first heard J. C. Bach's symphonies, although he had played the older composer's harpsichord works in his May 1764 royal recital. Wolfgang soon completed his Symphony No. 1 in E flat, K. 16, and started his No. 4 in D major, K. 19 (which Zaslaw concludes was more likely composed, or at least completed, in The Hague). The D major symphony has, in Hildesheimer's words, \\"an originality of melody and modulation which goes beyond the routine methods of his [grown-up] contemporaries\\". These are Wolfgang's first orchestral writings, although Zaslaw hypothesises a theoretical \\"Symphony No. 0\\" from sketches in Wolfgang's musical notebook. Three lost symphonies, identified in the Köchel catalogue of Mozart's works only by their incipits (first few bars of music), may also have originated from the London period. Other works composed by Wolfgang in London include several instrumental sonatas, the jewel of which, according to Hildesheimer, is the C major sonata for piano, four hands, K. 19d. A set of violin sonatas, with extra flute and cello parts, was dedicated to Queen Charlotte at her request, and presented to her with an appropriate inscription in January 1765.

This is because Area A experienced high levels of water stratification due to the fresh water discharged by the river. Freshwater has a lower density than saltwater, as it does not contain dissolved salts that contribute to the increased density in saltwater. When fresh river water meets and mixes with saltwater from the sea, it results in a less dense layer sitting above a denser, more saline layer. This stratification creates distinct layers within the water column, which reduces the mixing of the two layers. In contrast, Area B, situated 35 miles south, had water that was less stratified and more oxygenated, implying a greater mixing of water layers and possibly a higher salt content.

The premise \\"oh um now that's awful\\" can be broken down into three main parts: 1. \\"oh um\\" - an interjection demonstrating surprise, uncertainty, or hesitation. 2. \\"now\\" - an indicator of the present time. 3. \\"that's awful\\" - an evaluative statement suggesting that a particular element, situation, or event is negative or of unsatisfactory quality. Understanding these components clarifies the meaning behind the premise, suggesting that the speaker has perceived or learned something that they find undesirable or upsetting at the present moment. Now, let us consider the hypothesis \\"I am sad about that.\\" This statement represents the speaker's emotional reaction to the aforementioned negative element, situation, or event. The hypothesis conveys a feeling of sadness, which is a negative emotion generally associated with disappointment, sorrow, or pessimism regarding a particular situation. In order to determine if the premise entails the hypothesis, we must analyze if the expressed emotional reaction in the hypothesis necessarily follows from the premise. Simply put, does the fact that someone perceives something as \\"awful\\" automatically imply that they are \\"sad\\" about it? While it might seem reasonable to assume that labeling a situation as \\"awful\\" could likely lead to feelings of sadness, it is important to recognize the ambiguity of emotions that may arise as a response to negative circumstances. For instance, an individual who perceives something as awful could feasibly experience a range of reactions including anger, frustration, disbelief, disappointment, or anxiety, among others. Additionally, a person's emotional response can change or evolve over time and be influenced by factors such as personality, temperament, and coping mechanisms. Given these considerations, it is not possible to conclude with absolute certainty that the premise \\"oh um now that's awful\\" necessarily entails the hypothesis \\"I am sad about that.\\" Although there may be a strong correlation between perceiving something as awful and feeling sad about it, the premise does not unequivocally indicate that sadness is the sole and definitive emotional response. Instead, it is more viable to argue that an awful situation or event could lead to various emotions, and sadness is one among many potential outcomes."},{"question":"Premise: Of the traditional Japanese sports, sumo wrestling is the most popular.

They meet Mathias (Joe Anderson), a German tourist, who is looking for his brother Heinrich. His last known location is an archaeological dig at a remote Mayan ruin in the jungle. They are also joined by Dimitri (Dimitri Baveas), Mathias's friend. The group reaches the ruins of a Mayan temple, and are confronted by Mayan villagers with guns and bows. Mathias tries to explain their purpose, but the villagers do not understand Spanish or English. When Amy accidentally touches some vines the villagers become increasingly agitated. Dimitri approaches the villagers, hoping to appease them, but they shoot and kill him. The rest of the group flees up the steps of the ruins. At the top, they find an abandoned camp and a shaft in the center. The group cannot call for help since Eric's phone has no signal. They hear a cell phone ringing from somewhere inside the ruins. Believing it is Heinrich's phone ringing, the rest of the group lowers Mathias down the shaft with a rope. The rope breaks and Mathias falls, becoming completely paralyzed. Amy and Jeff descend the temple steps hoping to reason with the Mayans, but to no success. In anger, Amy throws a clump of vines at them and hits a young boy, whom the Mayans promptly kill. They realize the Mayans are afraid of the vines, and won't let them go since they have touched them. Later, Stacy and Amy descend the shaft to help Mathias and to find the phone. Jeff and Eric rig a backboard and bring Mathias out of the shaft. The next morning, Stacy sees a tendril of vine has crept into a wound on her leg. The vines have also wrapped themselves around Mathias's lower legs and eaten them down to the bone. Eric and Jeff are barely able to remove the vines from Stacy but cannot get them off of Mathias.

The child's face is shown as he is speaking to the camera, implying that he is engaging in an activity filled with thrill and excitement. This context aligns well with option 3, which suggests that the children slide down the hill very fast and excited. Each of the other options fails to adhere closely to the given context. Option 1 is less detailed than option 3, as it merely states that the kids go down the hill \\"as fast as they can\\" without explicitly mentioning their excitement. Option 2 deviates from the context as it mentions \\"coaches\\" driving the kids, which is not present in the initial description. Finally, option 4 seems to be a random and abrupt change in the action, making it less logical compared to option 3. In conclusion, given the context of kids on inner tubes going down a hill and the facial expression of excitement on a child's face, the most logical next event would be: \\"then slide down the hill very fast and they are excited.\\" This choice emphasizes the high-speed nature of the activity and provides a more vivid picture of the thrilling experience the children are having."},{"question":"Information: - The 1996 United States campaign finance controversy was an alleged effort by the People's Republic of China to influence domestic American politics prior to and during the Clinton administration and also involved the fund-raising practices of the administration itself. - Liu Chaoying (), or Helen Liu, was an executive at China Aerospace International Holdings, Ltd.

This is an impossible question, and one with many answers. Having spent more than a decade as a jazz artist, I've garnered some insights. As a youngster growing up in New Orleans, surrounded by the city's sounds and rhythms, I was influenced by a wide variety of music: brass bands, blues, ragtime, R&B, soul, rock 'n' roll, Dixieland and more. I played the percussion in my family's band, switching to piano at age 11. Since then, music has been a part of my everyday life. I've had the good fortune to play with inspiring artists across many genres -- Wynton Marsalis, Prince, Busta Rhymes among them. What's given me the foundation to be able to join such varied musicians is my jazz training. Jazz is subtle, emotional and accommodating. It is intellectual and sometimes even scientific. Most genres of music are not nearly as multidimensional, which in part is why the art form has such a small audience. In stark comparison to pop music, contemporary jazz seems too circuitous for most listeners to enjoy casually. The challenge for the contemporary jazz musician, as I see it, is making this subtle and complex art palatable to the greater public. Jazz is complex. Some of the greatest musical minds of all-time were jazz artists. They were able to master their instruments, redefine music theory and repeatedly innovate the already formidable body of work present before them. Many of them did so while navigating through the tumultuous social climate from which the music was birthed. John Blake: Dave Brubeck, ambassador to a new America. As a performer, part of my job is to take the audience on a musical journey to somewhere they've never been. The Stay Human movement I've started is about experiencing music -- not about it being on a stage and untouchable, but something that you viscerally experience on the subways and streets. Stay Human has grown to be more than a band, and has become a local movement that is expanding and shifting the way people experience jazz. We're trying to harness all of the musical elements that I grew up absorbing in New Orleans, and couple them with contemporary mainstream sounds. I want people to feel and hear jazz as they never thought it could be played. In the midst of the \\"plug in/tune out\\" nature of modern day society, we believe that the human interaction of a live musical performance can uplift humanity. Stay Human can happen anywhere. Not only in a music hall or official venue, but on streets and subways or among unsuspecting (and often pleased) patrons at a restaurant. We refer to these moments as a #loveriot and anyone can join. Keeping the Jazz Fest alive. At the core of the experience is the band, a group of my friends who are all world-class, Juilliard-trained musicians in their 20s. The music is central to the experience, but it isn't just about the music. Ultimately, it's about people from all walks of life coming together to share an authentic and transformative moment through the power of music. Maya Angelou once said, \\"I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.\\" Jazz is a tradition. The way jazz musicians walk, talk and greet each other, and the way they play is very distinct. To be a jazz artist is to be a part of a lineage. To play jazz is to contribute to world history. To be a part of this tradition means that you are challenged to transform other people with the sound of your instrument. You are challenged to swing. You are challenged to contribute to the body of work established by some of the greatest artistic minds of all time, work that includes these treasures:. • A performance of \\"Fine and Mellow\\" by Billie Holiday, Lester Young and others from a CBS television broadcast in New York on December 8, 1957. It is generally considered one of the greatest moments for jazz ever broadcast on live television. • \\"It Don't Mean A Thing\\" by Duke Ellington features catchy vocals, hard swing, jazz violin and awesome horn section parts that epitomize what the jazz tradition is all about. • \\"Every Time We Say Goodbye\\" Ray Charles and Betty Carter from their album together. Exquisite! • \\"I'm Just a Lucky So and So\\" from the album by Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington. It is a supreme example of the blues with utmost sophistication and feeling. The way Duke accompanies Satchmo is masterful, and the personality of the two of them signifies what jazz is all about. Gene Seymour: Brubeck, jazz master with a big heart. As an artist, it is exciting to explore the sound of your identity. Jazz music teaches you about who you are by exploring the humanity of others. It accommodates who you are. The inimitable genius Charlie Parker stated it best when he said, \\"Music is your own experience, your own thoughts, your wisdom. If you don't live it, it won't come out of your horn. They teach you there's a boundary line to music. But, man, there's no boundary line to art.\\" Jazz is an experience. Jazz is wonderful because it's all about the moment, and I firmly believe in creating unforgettable experiences. With the Stay Human band, it's never only about the stage. What we love is taking the music to the people in the streets -- jumping off stage into the audience, performing in moving vehicles, New York subways, streets and, yes, unsuspecting restaurants. For me, jazz is all about transformation in the moment. It is the most immediate form of musical expression in existence, and the language that we use to state our deepest, truest feelings. It is the American art form that is globally owned. What is jazz? Jazz is now! The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jonathan Batiste.

Spaces are essential for conveying meaning in written language, as they help to separate individual words and allow readers to recognize distinct words and phrases. The original sentence discusses the concept of \\"The hundredth monkey phenomenon\\", which refers to a supposed observed phenomenon in which a learned behavior spreads rapidly among a group of monkeys after a critical number of them have adopted the behavior. It is mentioned that this phenomenon was the subject of a real experiment conducted on Japanese islands in the Pacific several years ago. Furthermore, the sentence suggests that additional information about \\"The hundredth monkey phenomenon\\" can be found online and in the book \\"Lifetide\\" by biologist Lyall Watson.

He contemplated a story, an outline he had laboriously constructed some time ago. He had filled his pen and raised it, the nib descending towards the paper, before the sound came: the gentle, persistent tapping of the gnarled, primeval willow touching the window with long, insistent fingers. His eyes awoke with a passionate, determined flame, though the only light came from the glutted moon. Allan filled page after page, the words escaping from his mind onto the paper. Where before they had marched in regiments, practiced in ranks and followed their leaders' commands, the words now escaped in their true forms, unhindered by any stricture. He continued long into the night, until the eldritch orb had sunk into the waiting hands of the willow, raised perpetually skyward.

Given the context: How would Addison feel afterwards? Choose from: A). Like they know what they are getting for lunch. B). careless and unprepared. C). Like they made the mistake again. The answer is:","response":"C). Like they made the mistake again. To provide a detailed and long answer, we must first understand the context provided. Addison made a mistake yesterday, which implies that they did something they had not intended to do, possibly related to their lunch order. Today, they ordered what they usually get for lunch, which may not have been what they wanted, or they may have wanted to change their order to prevent the mistake from happening again. In this situation, Addison would likely feel like they made the mistake again (Option C) since they did not choose to proactively address the issue and change their order to avoid repeating the error. It is possible that they had intended to make a different choice today but failed to do so, which would lead to feelings of frustration and disappointment in themselves. Additionally, it is worth noting that Addison may not necessarily feel careless and unprepared (Option B) if they believed that their usual lunch order would not lead to the same mistake. Instead, their feelings of making the mistake again would stem from their lack of action in addressing the problem. However, if we consider their usual lunch order as the source of the mistake, then feeling like they made the mistake again (Option C) would still be the most appropriate choice. In this case, despite knowing the potential consequences, Addison would order the same lunch as yesterday, once again leading to the mistake. In either scenario, Addison's feelings of disappointment or frustration would primarily stem from their inability to prevent the mistake despite recognizing the potential consequences. Therefore, the most fitting answer is C). Like they made the mistake again."},{"question":"London joined the Peace Corps in Malawi in 1989 and led a regional business development program in Africa .

What is the solution?","response":"To solve the given equation 9*s = 8*s + 5 for s, we will follow these steps: Step 1: Isolate the variable (s) on one side of the equation. To do this, we will subtract 8*s from both sides of the equation to eliminate s from the right side. 9*s - 8*s = 8*s - 8*s + 5 Step 2: Simplify both sides of the equation. On the left side, we have: (9 - 8)*s = 1*s On the right side, we have: 0 + 5 = 5 Now the equation becomes: 1*s = 5 Step 3: Solve for the variable (s). As we have 1*s on the left side, this means that the equation is already isolated, and we can find the value of s directly. 1*s = 5 To find the value of s, we will divide both sides of the equation by 1. s = 5 / 1 This simplifies to: s = 5 So, the solution to the equation 9*s = 8*s + 5 is s = 5."},{"question":"Question: Given the following passage \\"New domestic housing in many parts of the world today is commonly made from timber-framed construction.

The label was later launched worldwide. - The Division Bell is the fourteenth studio album by the English progressive rock band Pink Floyd. It was released in the UK by EMI Records on 28 March 1994, and the US by Columbia Records on 4 April. - Columbia Records (also known simply as Columbia) is an American record label owned by Sony Music Entertainment (SME), a subsidiary of Sony Corporation of America, Inc., the United States division of Sony Corporation. It was founded in 1887, evolving from an earlier enterprise named the American Graphophone Company, the successor to the Volta Graphophone Company. Columbia is the oldest surviving brand name in the recorded sound business, being the second major record company to produce recorded records. Columbia Records went on to release records by an array of notable singers, instrumentalists, and bands. From 1961 to 1990, its recordings were released outside the U.S. and Canada by the CBS Records label (which was named after the Columbia Broadcasting System) to avoid confusion with the EMI label of the same name, before adopting the Columbia name internationally in 1990. It is one of Sony Music's three flagship record labels alongside RCA Records and Epic Records. - Progressive rock (shortened as \\"prog\\"; sometimes \\"art rock\\", \\"classical rock\\" or \\"symphonic rock\\") is a broad subgenre of rock music that developed in the United Kingdom and United States throughout the mid to late 1960s. Initially termed \\"progressive pop\\", the style was an outgrowth of psychedelic bands who abandoned standard pop traditions in favour of instrumentation and compositional techniques more frequently associated with jazz, folk or classical music. Additional elements contributed to its \\"progressive\\" label: lyrics were more poetic, technology was harnessed for new sounds, music approached the condition of \\"art\\", and the studio, rather than the stage, became the focus of musical activity, which often involved creating music for listening, not dancing. - \`\` A Great Day for Freedom '' is a song by Pink Floyd from their 1994 album , The Division Bell . - Pink Floyd were an English rock band formed in London. They achieved international acclaim with their progressive and psychedelic music. Distinguished by their use of philosophical lyrics, sonic experimentation, extended compositions and elaborate live shows, they are one of the most commercially successful and influential groups in the history of popular music.

We will look into this discriminatory and illegal practice at once! Many complaints. ||||| Jack Dorsey. The concept of the “shadowban” has existed practically since the inception of the web forum. The idea is simple: Instead of banning a user outright and informing them of such punishment, a shadowban makes a user’s post visible only to themselves. In other words, they think that they’re still part of a community, but nobody is able to see or interact with them. The shadowban is useful in that rather than someone immediately being locked out and possibly retaliating by, for example, making a new account, the user fades away gradually due to the lack of interaction from other users. As forums have evolved into social-media platforms, the shadowban and its descendants have come along with them. Facebook argued that the best way to dispel misinformation from places like Infowars, which argues that the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting was a staged hoax, was to secretly minimize their distribution in the site’s News Feed — a similar but not identical tactic. I myself have previously argued — tongue in cheek — that Twitter should shadowban (or “hellban”) President Donald Trump, who most recently threatened a cataclysmic war against Iran — the idea being that he gets the feeling of communicating with his followers while his actual posts are hidden from the (volatile) world. More than anywhere else, though, the shadowban has persisted among the conspiracy-minded, as a great weapon of censorship, generally thought to be perpetrated by liberal Silicon Valley operatives at the expense of conservatives. That right-wing voices are being “shadow banned” by Twitter and Facebook has become all but an article of faith among internet-native conservative activists and publishers — despite little evidence to support the claim. It’s no surprise, then, that a Vice News article claiming that Twitter is “shadow banning” Republicans has already taken hold in the minds of the most online right-wingers. At issue, though, is not “banning” but Twitter’s search mechanism. Usually, Twitter will automatically complete a search query and suggest an account when a user begins typing in Twitter’s search bar. If you type in “Donald,” for example, Trump’s account is displayed as an easily accessible hyperlink, so that you don’t have to click through to the results page; if you type in “Hillary,” you’ll get a similar autocomplete suggestion of Hillary Clinton. And what happens if you type in, as one so often does, “Andrew Surabian,” Donald Trump Jr.’s spokesperson and, in Vice’s words, a “prominent Republican”? According to Vice, Surabian and other “prominent Republicans” — like Republican Party chair Ronna McDaniel and a number of GOP lawmakers — are not being automatically suggested when you type in their names. All of these accounts, importantly, are still shown atop the actual search results page. The only problem is that you have to click through to it, instead of being given an easy autocomplete link. (Vice’s report is essentially a more partisan-focused repackaging of an article published by Gizmodo on Sunday, which covered how alt-right figures like Richard Spencer and Jason Kessler were also not appearing in auto-populated fields on Twitter. In some instances, parody accounts were featured in their stead.) To start with, and to state the most obvious, this sort of moderation isn’t shadow banning. Users following the affected accounts will still see their tweets; those accounts still appear in search (just not in the search-bar auto-population). “Shadow banning,” as generally imagined and described by the activists who claim they’ve been affected, would actively suppress user content even to followers, not just make accounts one click more difficult to find. Which is why, to the extent that this is even a problem, it’s pretty easy to come up with an alternate explanation: This is a side effect of a minimal measure designed to make sure that people aren’t preemptively encouraged to consume bad information from dubious sources. In May, Twitter announced that it would do what it could to ensure “people contributing to the healthy conversation will be more visible in conversations and search”; it seems eminently likely that an algorithmic strategy to make trolls and extremists less visible on the platform semi-accidentally ensnared some Republicans. (And can you blame it?) As HuffPost’s Ashley Feinberg pointed out on Twitter, well-known left-wing podcast hosts—surely, in the grand scheme of things, around the same level of “prominence” as Don Jr.’s spokesperson—are suffering from the same “problem” of being marginally more difficult to be searched out. Vice quotes a Twitter spokesperson saying that the company is “shipping a change,” but that the “technology is based on account *behavior* not the content of Tweets.” New York Law School professor Ari Ezra Waldman told Vice that, “This isn’t evidence of a pattern of anti-conservative bias, since some Republicans still appear and some don’t. This just appears to be a cluster of conservatives who have been affected.” He added, “If anything, it appears that Twitter’s technology for minimizing accounts instead of banning them just isn’t very good.” That’s a more likely scenario than a cabal of secretive Twitter employees trying to suppress the speech of … Donald Trump Jr.’s spokesperson. Is it bad? Sure, the way a hangnail is bad. But it’s not censorship, and it’s certainly not “shadow-banning.” It’s well-established that right-wing media and personalities hew further to the right, and are consequently more likely than their left-wing counterparts to interact with fringe accounts (the kind of signal that would indicate to Twitter’s algorithm that an account is a troll or harasser), if not actually spread falsehoods and sensationalized outrage. But in framing this issue as the “Republicans being treated differently than Democrats” instead of “minimizing falsehoods and bad faith,” Vice has given conservatives even more ammo with which to claim oppression. The notion that social media companies would suppress certain political points of view should concern every American. Twitter owes the public answers to what’s really going on. https://t.co/i9UtbxJrt0 — Ronna McDaniel (@GOPChairwoman) July 25, 2018 Vice’s story feels an awful lot like one reported two years ago by Gizmodo, which claimed that Facebook was “suppressing conservatives.” In reality, Facebook’s editors were making the editorial judgment call that manufactured, misleading, and hyperpartisan stories from conservative outlets — such as ones about Benghazi, in 2016 — were less relevant to Facebook’s users than breaking stories from mainstream outlets. Similarly, Twitter’s new system seems less about suppressing conservative viewpoints and more about minimizing controversial figures whose primary tactic is to stoke outrage through heavy slant or outright distortion. ||||| Presented with screenshots of the searches, a Twitter spokesperson told VICE News: “We are aware that some accounts are not automatically populating in our search box and shipping a change to address this.” Asked why only conservative Republicans appear to be affected and not liberal Democrats, the spokesperson wrote: “I'd emphasize that our technology is based on account *behavior* not the content of Tweets.” “The notion that social media companies would suppress certain political points of view should concern every American,” McDaniel told VICE News in a statement. “Twitter owes the public answers to what’s really going on.” Democrats are not being “shadow banned” in the same way, according to a VICE News review. McDaniel’s counterpart, Democratic Party chair Tom Perez, and liberal members of Congress — including Reps. Maxine Waters, Joe Kennedy III, Keith Ellison, and Mark Pocan — all continue to appear in drop-down search results. Not a single member of the 78-person Progressive Caucus faces the same situation in Twitter’s search. The Republican Party chair Ronna McDaniel, several conservative Republican congressmen, and Donald Trump Jr.’s spokesman no longer appear in the auto-populated drop-down search box on Twitter, VICE News has learned. It’s a shift that diminishes their reach on the platform — and it's the same one being deployed against prominent racists to limit their visibility. The profiles continue to appear when conducting a full search, but not in the more convenient and visible drop-down bar. (The accounts appear to also populate if you already follow the person.)

Twitter’s troll hunt, however, has ensnared some of the most prominent Republicans in the country. Type in the names of McDaniel, conservative members of Congress like Reps. Mark Meadows, Jim Jordan, and Matt Gaetz, and Trump Jr.’s spokesman Andrew Surabian, for example, and Twitter’s drop-down search bar does not show their profiles. The search menu also does not display the verified profile of Rep. Devin Nunes of California, only his unverified one that he seldom uses to post. That limits their visibility and the ease of finding their profiles compared to their liberal counterparts. The company’s drop-down search bar has also been excluding several prominent racist figures on the alt-right, such as Jason Kessler, who organized last year’s white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. The platform has also demoted a smattering of far-right figures like Mike Cernovich, as Gizmodo reported earlier this week. But the rationale determining which accounts auto-populate in search results and which don’t is unclear. InfoWars and its leader Alex Jones have not been demoted despite often spreading false news and right-wing conspiracy theories, for example. Republican Rep. Steve King — who has tweeted that immigration should be limited because “we can’t restore our civilization with somebody else’s babies” — also appears to be unaffected by this change to the company’s search function. He retweeted a self-proclaimed “Nazi sympathizer” last month and declined to take it down when notified of the person’s history. “This isn’t evidence of a pattern of anti-conservative bias since some Republicans still appear and some don’t. This just appears to be a cluster of conservatives who have been affected,” said New York Law School Professor Ari Ezra Waldman, who testified at the House Judiciary Committee’s April hearing on social media filtering and is the author of Privacy as Trust: Information Privacy for an Information Age. “If anything, it appears that Twitter’s technology for minimizing accounts instead of banning them just isn’t very good.” Even if the shadow banning is more of a bug than a feature, the demotion of these prominent Republicans could be a political liability for the social media company. Conservatives in and out of Congress have been claiming for months — with varying amounts of evidence — that Big Tech companies are censoring voices on the right. The Republican-led House Judiciary Committee convened not one but two hearings on the subject in recent months, including one with pro-Trump social media stars Diamond and Silk, who argued that Facebook had been intentionally diminishing the reach of their content. The second hearing went down just last week where representatives from Twitter, Google, and Facebook were subjected to grilling by conservatives. “It is curious that these allegations would arise the week following Congressman Gaetz’s heated exchange with Twitter senior executives before the House Judiciary Committee,” a spokesman for Gaetz told VICE News. The allegations of bias haven’t been limited to Congress either. McDaniel and President Donald Trump’s 2020 campaign manager Brad Parscale wrote a letter to Facebook and Twitter in June asking for the companies to conduct public reviews of potential bias against conservative content on the platform. “We are alarmed by numerous allegations that Facebook has blocked content from conservative journalists and groups, and Twitter has hidden such content from conservative users’ followers,” they wrote. An RNC spokesperson told VICE News that Twitter has yet to respond to McDaniel but that Facebook reached out to set up a meeting. Democrats, for their part, have largely rolled their eyes at conservative claims of discrimination. At Diamond and Silk's hearing in April, the committee’s top-ranking Democrat Jerrold Nadler called the idea of Big Tech censorship of conservatives a “hoax” and a “tired narrative of imagined victimhood” that was eclipsing other priorities like election security and online privacy. But Facebook and Twitter have appeared to take the conservative criticism seriously and have arranged a series of meetings and public reviews aimed to build up trust with influential figures on the right. Despite some evidence that Diamond and Silk were exaggerating their claims, Facebook publicly apologized to the duo in front of Congress last week. And Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey convened a D.C. dinner on June 19 with prominent conservatives including White House advisor Mercedes Schlapp, Fox News commentator Guy Benson, and tax activist Grover Norquist, as the Washington Post first reported. But the black box of the platforms’ changes still has conservatives wary. “This type of opaque behavior by social media companies is exactly why conservatives are speaking out and demanding more transparency and accountability,” House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California told VICE News in a statement. “The bias has to stop.” Follow Alex Thompson on Twitter at @AlxThomp.

Phillip Bellamy, a leading barrister, tells his wife, psychiatrist Anne Dyson, about his most recent case defending a young man, Harry Jukes, who has apparently shot a policeman on a country road and been found by police still holding the gun. Bellamy is convinced of his guilt but Anne is less sure. Much of her practice is with troubled young people and she feels there is more to the story than the police evidence. Anne visits Harry in prison. He is depressed and distrustful but finally agrees to talk to her. Harry's story is that he took a Bentley Continental car to impress a girl but when she went off with another boy decided to take the car for a spin before dumping it. Swerving to avoid another car he burst a tyre but could not find any tools in the boot to change the wheel. He asked the driver of a car parked in the copse nearby for help but he was occupied with his girl and refused. Harry was spotted by a policeman on a bike who stopped to help. He flagged down a lorry to ask to borrow a jack. The lorry stopped but the passenger immediately produced a gun and shot the policeman. Harry managed to grab the gun off the killer as the lorry drove away. Shortly after, a police car arrived and Harry was arrested. Anne believes Harry's story and tries to persuade Bellamy of Harry's innocence. She interviews Harry several times and begins to follow up some aspects of his story. She visits the gang that Harry hung out with in a café in Battersea and they agree to help her by trying to find the couple in the parked car. She also visits Taplow, the man whose car was stolen, several times and finds his account unconvincing.

The one employee was nice but this is just a sign of poor management at this location.","response":"To determine the sentiment of the review, we need to go through the content and identify the associated emotions or feelings that the user has expressed towards the service. Here is how I would go step-by-step through the process of analysis: 1. Recognize the sentiment of individual phrases and aggregate for overall sentiment: The text contains phrases like 'long wait times', 'long call hold times,' 'sub-par customer service', and 'sign of poor management', which are indicative of negative sentiment. However, there is a positive comment about the single employee being 'nice.' 2. Weigh the severity and frequency of negative versus positive sentiments: Given that the negative comments are not only numerous but also pertain to significant aspects of the a customer's experience like wait time, call handling, and overall customer service, they outweigh the single positive comment. The negative comments are also more severe, highlighting chronic issues that could potentially affect all customers, whereas the positive comment is isolated to this particular user's experience with one employee. 3. Draw an overall conclusion: Thus, the sentiment of the review is overall negative. The customer has expressed dissatisfaction with the long wait times, call handling, and overall customer service quality, which shows a lack of approval of the management at this location. The single positive sentiment in the review about the employee being 'nice' is insufficient to override the overall negative sentiment conveyed by the rest of the feedback."},{"question":"Q: who is when i was your man written about?

Movie title: High Noon Movie plot: In Hadleyville, a small town in New Mexico Territory, Marshal Will Kane (Cooper), newly married to Amy Fowler (Grace Kelly), is preparing to retire. The happy couple is departing for a new life, raising a family and running a store in another town; but word arrives that Frank Miller (Ian MacDonald), a vicious outlaw who Kane sent to jail, has been released, and is arriving on the noon train. Miller's gangâhis younger brother Ben (Sheb Wooley), Jack Colby (Lee Van Cleef), and Jim Pierce (Robert J. Wilke)âawait his arrival at the train station; it is clear that Miller intends to exact revenge. For Amy, a devout Quaker and pacifist, the solution is simpleâleave town before Miller arrives; but Kane's sense of duty and honor is strong. \\"They're making me run,\\" he tells her. \\"I've never run from anybody before.\\" Besides, he says, Miller and his gang will hunt him down anyway. Amy gives Kane an ultimatum: She is leaving on the noon train, with or without him. While waiting at the hotel for the train, she meets Helen RamÃ­rez (Katy Jurado), who was once Miller's lover, and then Kane's, and is leaving as well. Amy understands why Helen is fleeing, but the reverse is not true: Helen tells Amy that if Kane were her man, she would not abandon him in his hour of need. Kane's efforts to round up a posse at the tavern and the church are met with fear and hostility. Many townspeople believe that Kane's departure would defuse the situation; a gunfight in the streets would be bad for the town's reputation. Others are Miller's friends, and resent that Kane cleaned up the town in the first place.

Homer ( , \\"Hómēros\\") is the name ascribed by the ancient Greeks to the legendary author of the \\"Iliad\\" and the \\"Odyssey\\", two epic poems which are the central works of ancient Greek literature. The \\"Iliad\\" is set during the Trojan War, the ten-year siege of the city of Troy by a coalition of Greek states. It focuses on a quarrel between King Agamemnon and the warrior Achilles lasting a few weeks during the last year of the war. The \\"Odyssey\\" focuses on the journey home of Odysseus, king of Ithaca, after the fall of Troy. Many accounts of Homer's life circulated in classical antiquity, the most widespread being that he was a blind bard from Ionia, a region of central coastal Anatolia in present-day Turkey. Modern scholars consider them legends. The Homeric Question—by whom, when, where and under what circumstances were the \\"Iliad\\" and \\"Odyssey\\" composed—continues to be debated. Broadly speaking, modern scholarly opinion falls into two groups. One holds that most of the \\"Iliad\\" and (according to some) the \\"Odyssey\\" are the works of a single poet of genius. The other considers the Homeric poems to be the result of a process of working and re-working by many contributors, and that \\"Homer\\" is best seen as a label for an entire tradition. It is generally accepted that the poems were composed at some point around the late 8th or early 7th century BC. The poems are in Homeric Greek, also known as Epic Greek, a literary language which shows a mixture of features of the Ionic and Aeolic dialects from different centuries; the predominant influence is Eastern Ionic.

To better answer the question about Windows 8 Enterprise, here's a detailed explanation: Windows 8 Enterprise is a special edition of the Windows 8 operating system, specifically designed to cater to the needs of large businesses and organizations. It offers numerous features not available in other editions, such as Windows 8 Pro, to facilitate deployment, management, and security across an organization's infrastructure. Some of the key additional features offered by Windows 8 Enterprise include: 1. Windows To Go: This unique feature allows users to create a bootable Windows 8 environment on a USB flash drive. It enables employees to carry their own personalized Windows 8 workspace on a USB drive and access it on any compatible machine, which is quite useful for travelers and remote workers. 2. DirectAccess: DirectAccess allows users to securely access their organization's network resources without the need for a separate Virtual Private Network (VPN) connection. It simplifies remote work by providing an always-on connection to the corporate network. 3. BranchCache: This feature improves data access for branch offices with limited network connectivity to the main office. BranchCache caches data from the central servers at the local branch office, reducing the amount of traffic over the Wide Area Network (WAN) and providing faster access to data for users in remote locations. 4. AppLocker: AppLocker allows IT administrators to create rules that determine which applications can run on a user's device. This feature helps organizations maintain a controlled and secure application environment, preventing unauthorized software usage and reducing the risk of malware infection. 5. Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) Enhancements: Windows 8 Enterprise offers improved VDI capabilities, including RemoteFX, which delivers a rich graphical experience to remote users, and support for the User State Virtualization (USV), which allows users to save their personal settings and data across multiple devices. 6. Enterprise Sideloading: Windows 8 Enterprise allows organizations to sideload internal applications without having to go through the Windows Store. This facilitates the deployment and management of custom or line-of-business (LOB) applications developed specifically for an organization. 7. BitLocker and BitLocker To Go: These features provide full volume encryption for the local hard drive and removable storage devices, respectively, offering enhanced data protection for an organization's sensitive information. These are just a few of the many extras that Windows 8 Enterprise offers, and the differences between this edition and others, such as Windows 8 Pro. This tailored edition is designed to meet the needs of large organizations by providing advanced features for better control, security, and ease of management."},{"question":"In this task, you are given a public comment from online platforms.

I know that I’m sensitive to shampoos containing sodium laureth sulfate (also known as SLS, it’s the ingredient that makes shampoos, shower gels and soaps lather) but I’m also sensitive to some other ingredients in shampoos too – mainly fragrances. I had previously been using Rainforest Balance Shampoo and Conditioner from The Body Shop®, but I found the conditioner a bit too rich and my hair didn’t always feel totally clean after using it. So I started doing a bit of research into recommended natural shampoos – and this Sensitive Shampoo from Lavera kept coming up again and again! Several of the reviews I read said that this was the best shampoo for sensitive scalps and that it left hair feeling really clean and soft, so I decided to try it. The shampoo is a translucent peach-coloured gel that contains organic witch hazel and organic almond milk. It has quite a strong scent, but it’s a nice one so it doesn’t put me off. The shampoo feels creamy when you rub it together in your hands, but I did need quite a lot of it to get a good lather on my first application – the second application lathers a lot more easily. I definitely agree that this makes hair feel a lot cleaner than a lot of the other SLS-free shampoos that I’ve tried, my hair feels clean and full and soft when I’ve used it – the same way it would do if I were using a regular shampoo. I think it also helps my hair to dry more quickly and makes it easier to straighten too. But where this shampoo is outstanding is the way it makes my scalp feel – my scalp feels soothed and calm and there’s no hint of itching. I’ve been using Lavera Sensitive Shampoo for over a year now and I wouldn’t change it for the world, it’s definitely one of the best shampoos for a sensitive itchy scalp.

Genius has also hired another journalist, Christopher Glazek, to focus on politics and culture annotations, Mr. Zechory, 30, and Mr. Lehman, 31, said. The site will continue to hire people with expertise in particular subject areas, aiming to bring in more users from online communities obsessed with particular topics. Genius’s expansion marks the latest merger of the tech and media worlds, and helps to fulfill a prediction made by one of the company’s funders, Marc Andreessen of the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, that the definition of journalism might broaden to include jobs outside of traditional writing and editing. “My remit is going into the lyrics site and building a team,” Mr. Frere-Jones said. He added that he planned to initially add three or four people, and that their precise role was hard to describe, though the skills were rooted in journalism.

Lyric-annotation site RapGenius.com just landed a 15 million investment, leading to a press blitz this week as tech and entertainment sites rushed to profile the three kids who are going to change the game. But why'd they land so much money? And why are so many rap fans and critics shaking their heads? Here's our guide. What exactly is Rap Genius? Rap Genius is an annotated lyrics site. Users explain rap lyrics line-by-line or even word-by-word — click on a lyric, and a box will pop up with an explanation. Why should I care about the site? A few weeks ago, the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz — an early investor in companies like Facebook and foursquare — invested 15 million in Rap Genius. (The Andreessen of Andreessen Horowitz is Marc Andreessen, the author and founder of Netscape Navigator, God rest its soul.) They plan to one day \\"annotate the world.\\" Hey, that doesn't sounds so bad. In a lot of ways, it's not. Rap Genius is innovative in a few basic ways. Anyone who has ever searched for lyrics online knows how treacherous an experience it can be — Rap Genius, though, is readable and has a good internal search engine. It also has a dedicated user base — the lyrics to every song on Kendrick Lamar's unreleased new album, which just leaked yesterday, are already on Rap Genius. Are the explanations, you know, correct? Maybe, but therein lies a major problem. One great thing about rap and its ever-evolving vernacular is that the meaning of everything isn't readily apparent. To quote Willy Staley in a New York Times Magazine column about misheard lyrics: Part of the joy of listening to a lot of rap music is having all this unfold for you as you become more familiar with it. Okay, so why not just avoid the site? Fair enough, and that's easy to do. But if Rap Genius is as successful as it hopes to be, it will effectively re-write rap history, including songs and lyrics that have a secret meaning, or even no meaning at all. The site has begun to bring in rappers to annotate their own lyrics, but this would be an effective whitewashing of decades of art without the input of its creators or intended audience. Anything else? Another big issue with Rap Genius is that it trades on a particular noxious brand of humor that has infected the internet for years: white people \\"translating\\" rap lyrics in arch, academic prose. The most famous examples are \\"rap graphs,\\" but there's also things like this Twitter account, which turns 50 Cent's tweets into \\"Queen's English.\\" This humor has also been a staple of Bill Maher's stand up act. I've laughed at those rap graphs — what's wrong with that kind of humor? The presumption — one that partly fuels Rap Genius, if even inadvertently — is that rappers are too dumb to use \\"correct\\" English. A very early instance of the joke was a chain e-mail from the 1990s that offered a dry translation of Biggie's \\"One More Chance (remix)\\" under the guise of a competition in an Oakland school district that asked students to \\"translate ebonics.\\" But why crucify Rap Genius' founders for the acts of their users? Well, Rap Genius' founders also have a touchy history with race. After Staley critiqued Rap Genius in a column, co-founder Mahbod Moghadam recorded a rap diss in reponse— Wait, a co-founder of Rap Genius recorded a rap diss? Two of them, unfortunately. An old insult of music critics is that they are failed musicians, but in this case it actually seems true. In that diss track, Moghadam lamented that he can't use the N-word. In another freestyle, he compared Dapwell of the rap group Das Racist, who is of South Asian descent, to a \\"dirty cigarette.\\" Well, that's just one guy. True, but Rap Genius nurtures a young, white-leaning user base that desperately wishes to do things like say the N-word. I once got an email from a RapGenius.com intern asking me why I don't think it's okay for white people to use that word. Huh. They kind of seem like dicks. Well, they kind of are. In early August, Rap Genius brought Chief Keef into its office to become a \\"verified artist.\\" A video of the occasion shows a visibly disinterested Keef flirting with a female employee and generally looking like he would rather be doing something else. When Rap Genius posted the video, they used the title, \\"Chief Keef Gets TOO HIGH to Explain His Lyrics on Rap Genius.\\" Oh. So what? I'll let Stephen Kearse of RESPECT magazine explain: The real idiots are the folks at Rap Genius. Being high had nothing to do with Chief Keef's lack of explanation. Let's be real: Chief Keef doesn't give a damn about wordplay. Even if he did, wordplay is only one aspect of hip-hop. Tone, mood, rhythm, cadence, flow and a million other things are just as important as the actual ABCs. By posting this video, Rap Genius tried to cover up the underlying silliness of its mission, but ended up exposing it even further. Rap is more than lyrics and it's definitely more than geniuses fools attempting to explain it. What will Rap Genius do with their investment money? They want to expand the concept into things like poetry and law. They already have annotated the Supreme Court's decision in Plessy v. Ferguson, for example. Well, some snotty kids got 15 million. At least the people who founded the culture that made them rich are also living on the high hog, right? Not quite. A lot of the originators of rap music — many of whose lyrics provide part of the content that RapGenius' business model is based on — are far from rich. Kool Herc, who maybe more than any one person can be said to have invented hip-hop, can't afford required surgery, and when these kids are parading around in suits and fresh kicks it leaves a bad taste in a lot peoples' mouths. Well, maybe they're doing things with the money that will strengthen hip-hop culture and the rap community?

The overall trend signals a new direction in the evolution of tech and media synergy. The article mentions the website securing 15 million investment from the venture capital firm, Andreessen Horowitz, alluding to the potential of its business model. Rap Genius positions itself as an explanatory tool, helping unravel the intricacies and nuances of rap lyrics for its users. Despite its growth and popularity, the site has faced criticism due to a number of reasons. Critics express concerns about the potential for misinformation, as the website's explanations of certain lyrics may not accurately represent the true intention of the artists or misinterpret subtle aspects of the lyrics. There is also anxiety that the site might rewrite the history of rap music by imposing its own interpretations of lyrics without sufficient input from the original artists or intended audience. Moreover, the company’s humour, defined by the 'translation' of rap lyrics into high-brow, academic English, is also a point of contention. Critics see this as potentially reinforcing harmful stereotypes about intelligence and linguistic competence in the rap community. There are concerns about the potential racism in this approach, as well as discomfort at the apparent disconnect between the founders (characterized as a young, majority-white user base) and the art form and culture they're building a site around, which is deeply rooted in Black culture. The site plans to broaden its scope beyond rap lyrics and delve into fields like poetry and law. However, concerns remain about the site's cultural impact, possible appropriation, and financial disparity. It's noted that many iconic figures in hip hop, the very artists whose works fuel the site's content, are struggling financially while the Rap Genius founders amass wealth. Several other topics are briefly mentioned throughout the text, including upcoming hirings, projects, potential functionality upgrades for the platform, the implications of the website's financial success, as well as other news and tidbits from the world of music and entertainment. In summary, the discussion orbits around Rap Genius, its significant investment, the potential and risk of its business model, and the cultural, ethical implications of its operation in interpreting and dissecting rap lyrics."},{"question":"Based on the premise \\"The Khedive Ismael had extravagant plans for numerous great works that were to be financed by Western European powers, but when he became stuck in a financial quagmire, they insisted on bringing in their own advisors to control key institutions.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"The Khedive Ismael had big plans he waned to implement.\\" is true?","response":"Yes, based on the given premise, we can indeed conclude that the hypothesis \\"The Khedive Ismael had big plans he wanted to implement\\" is true. In order to better understand this, let's delve deeper into the context and historical background that surround Khedive Ismael and his intentions. Khedive Ismael, who ruled Egypt between 1863 and 1879, was an ambitious leader with a vision to modernize Egypt and bring it up to par with the advancements happening in Western Europe. He had a grand vision for Egypt's infrastructure, economy, and culture and pursued a policy of modernization and reform during his reign. Ismael's plans included the expansion of railways, telegraph lines, irrigation projects, the construction of the Suez Canal, and the modernization of Egypt's educational system. These projects were seen as a way to transform Egypt into a global power and elevate the living conditions of its people. To finance these ambitious projects, Ismael sought external funding from European powers, primarily Britain and France. Initially, these powers were more than willing to support Ismael's vision, seeing the potential for their own financial gains and political influence in the region. However, over the course of his reign, Ismael found himself stuck in a financial quagmire, largely due to soaring debts, cost overruns, and mismanagement of funds. As Egypt's debt situation worsened and the risk of financial collapse loomed, the European powers that once readily supported Ismael's vision grew increasingly concerned. They insisted that in order to continue financing these grand projects and avoid defaulting on their loans, it was necessary for them to take direct control of key Egyptian institutions and bring in their advisors to oversee financial and administrative matters. This demand eventually culminated in the Dual Control Agreement of 1876, which put Egypt's finances under the joint control of Britain and France, with their representatives overseeing the revenues. This move was seen as an infringement on Egyptian sovereignty and greatly diminished Khedive Ismael's authority. The British and French advisors primarily focused on ensuring Egypt's financial stability and the repayment of debts, which meant that some of Ismael's grand plans were either scaled back or abandoned altogether. In conclusion, based on the given premise, it is clear that Khedive Ismael had ambitious plans and a vision for Egypt's modernization and overall development. However, his reliance on foreign financing and the financial crisis that ensued eventually led to the European powers taking control of key Egyptian institutions, limiting his ability to fully realize his grand plans and vision for Egypt."},{"question":"Q:If grass is given plenty of water and light, what will it do? - burn - changes color with seasons - turn brown - continue to grow - eat water The best answer is A:","response":"continue to grow"},{"question":"Is the premise \\"A boy in orange shirt and blue jeans is jumping on the slide while others watches him\\" true if \\"The boy goes to the bottom of the slide.\\"?

Au Bon Pain Store, Carepoint Health, Hoboken University Medical Center, Kmart Store 7749, St. Luke’s Emergency Dept., New York City Transit Authority, City of New York, NYC MTA, LaGuardia Airport Administration, Amy Caggiula, Does 1-1000, Case No. 1:14 CV 2755 (S.D.N.Y. filed 4/11/2014). Civil rights violations, personal injury, discrimination on national origin, retaliation, harassment, fraud, attempted murder, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and conspiracy to defraud. 2,000 decillion (2,000,000,000, 000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000). Pro Se Although, surprisingly, the complaint appears to be frivolous, Mr. Purisima does seem to have gotten his math right, although he could have simplified the demand a little. According to this very helpful big-number page, a “decillion” in American usage means a 1 followed by 33 zeroes. “2,000 decillion” therefore could of course be written as a 2 followed by 36 zeroes, which is in fact what Anton has in parentheses. So good work there. But it turns out that a 1 followed by 36 zeroes is an “undecillion.” (This is a little embarrassing, since I’ve been going around using that term to refer to any number that is not a decillion, but I guess that was causing a lot of confusion anyway.) So he could have just demanded “two undecillion dollars,” and (after a little research) everybody would still have known what he was talking about. Sure, it would be more fun to call it “two octillion gigadollars,” but that’s getting a little ridiculous. Okay, it’s a lot more fun to call it “two octillion gigadollars,” as confirmed by an ongoing experiment in which I say that out loud in my office and then laugh at it. Not that it matters, because these demands have long since outstripped the total amount of money in the world. That was already the case back in 2008, when we were only talking about quadrillions. See “Katrina Victim Sues for Three Quadrillion Dollars,” Lowering the Bar (Jan. 12, 2008). At that time, I calculated that the plaintiff was essentially demanding the entire U.S. gross domestic product for the next 228 years (give or take), and that if he were paid in pennies (as he should have been) it would take 301 stacks of pennies, each stack high enough to reach Saturn, to satisfy the judgment. Less than two years later, Dalton Chiscolm decided it would take a lot more than that to send a message to Bank of America, which he sued for 1.784 septillion dollars (a.k.a. 1,784 billion trillion dollars, I think). “If he thinks Bank of America has branches on every planet in the cosmos,” Reuters then quoted a math professor as saying, “then it might start to make some sense.” That remained the record-holder despite John-Theodore: Anderson’s (stupid punctuation in original) effort in this 2010 case, in which he started out demanding a relatively restrained 918 billion for breach of contract but then got mad and amended his complaint to make it 38 quadrillion. That still only put him in second place, though. All of them have now been eclipsed by Anton, of course, who is also seeking punitive damages, I guess in case an undecillion-dollar judgment is not enough to send a message to the various defendants. Exactly what each of them did is not entirely clear, although the plaintiff claims a dog bit him on the middle finger and that he’s routinely overcharged for coffee at LaGuardia Airport, among other things. (Also, some Chinese people took his picture without permission.) The complaint does allege that the defendants’ acts caused damages that “cannot be repaired by money” and are “therefore priceless.” Granted, no amount of money can truly compensate a plaintiff for what he or she has lost, but two octillion gigadollars would be a pretty good start. ||||| We've encountered plenty of lawsuits about nothing and lawsuits that might as well have been about nothing, but a lawsuit filed this week by a Manhattan man may take the cake for greatest lawsuit about nothing.

Lowering The Bar has an excerpt from the suit (note: the \\"Does 1-1000\\" refers to a thousand 'John Does') from the 62-year-old Purisima, who has previously sued the People's Republic of China, several major banks (including Wells Fargo, JP Morgan, and Wachovia), and a whole lot of other people: Anton Purisima v.

It's the most effective way to thoroughly clean the dust and dander from your curtains. Be sure to check the backing of the curtains to make sure they can be laundered this way. Can we infer the following? It is wiser to have someone else do it","response":"No, we cannot infer that it is wiser to have someone else do it. Washing linen curtains can be a straightforward process if the proper steps are followed. Here's a detailed explanation of how to wash linen curtains: 1. Check the care label: Before washing your linen curtains, it's important to check the manufacturer's care label for specific cleaning instructions. Not all linen curtains are the same, and some may have particular care requirements. 2. Remove hardware: Before washing, remove any hooks, clasps, or other hardware from the curtains so they don't get damaged during the cleaning process. 3. Vacuum or dust: If your curtains are particularly dusty, consider vacuuming them gently with the upholstery attachment to remove as much of the dust and debris as possible prior to washing. Alternatively, you can shake the curtains outside to remove loose dust and dirt. 4. Pre-treat any stains: If there are any visible stains on your curtains, pre-treat them with a stain remover specifically designed for linen fabrics. Follow the instructions on the product label, as the process may vary depending on the type of stain and the remover. 5. Load the washing machine properly: When washing linens, it is important to avoid overloading the machine. Linen curtains should be washed separately from other items, preferably in a large load setting to allow enough space for proper cleaning and agitation. 6. Use a gentle detergent and appropriate machine settings: Choose a mild detergent designed for delicate fabrics and set the washing machine to a gentle or delicate cycle with cold or lukewarm water. It's advisable to avoid using bleach or fabric softeners, as these can negatively impact the natural fibers within linen. 7. Dry curtains carefully: After washing, it's crucial to dry the curtains properly to avoid damaging them or causing wrinkles. You can either air-dry them by laying them flat on a clean, dry surface or hang them up outside, away from direct sunlight. Alternatively, you can tumble-dry them on a low heat setting, but be sure to remove them while they’re still slightly damp to avoid over-drying. 8. Iron or steam curtains: Once your linen curtains are dry, they might appear wrinkled. If desired, use a steam iron on the lowest setting to gentle press out the wrinkles. Be sure to iron with the fabric still slightly damp, and always use a pressing cloth to prevent any scorching or burning. 9. Rehang the curtains: Once your curtains are clean, dry, and wrinkle-free, reattach the hardware and hang them back up on the curtain rod. By following these steps, you can successfully wash and care for your linen curtains at home without the need for someone else to do it. Remember, it is essential to follow any specific care instructions provided by the manufacturer to achieve optimal results while avoiding damage to your curtains."},{"question":"In the United States, conscription began in 1917 and was generally well received, with a few pockets of opposition in isolated rural areas. The administration decided to rely primarily on conscription, rather than voluntary enlistment, to raise military manpower for when only 73,000 volunteers enlisted out of the initial 1 million target in the first six weeks of the war. In 1917 10 million men were registered. This was deemed to be inadequate, so age ranges were increased and exemptions reduced, and so by the end of 1918 this increased to 24 million men that were registered with nearly 3 million inducted into the military services. The draft was universal and included blacks on the same terms as whites, although they served in different units. In all 367,710 black Americans were drafted , compared to 2,442,586 white . Forms of resistance ranged from peaceful protest to violent demonstrations and from humble letter-writing campaigns asking for mercy to radical newspapers demanding reform. The most common tactics were dodging and desertion, and many communities sheltered and defended their draft dodgers as political heroes. Many socialists were jailed for \\"obstructing the recruitment or enlistment service\\". The most famous was Eugene Debs, head of the Socialist Party of America, who ran for president in 1920 from his prison cell. In 1917 a number of radicals and anarchists challenged the new draft law in federal court, arguing that it was a direct violation of the Thirteenth Amendment's prohibition against slavery and involuntary servitude. The Supreme Court unanimously upheld the constitutionality of the draft act in the Selective Draft Law Cases on January 7, 1918.

Halteres are rapidly oscillated simultaneously with the wings, allowing them to experience forces resulting from body rotations. If the body of the insect rotates about one of its three axes (yaw, pitch or roll), the rotation exerts a force on the vibrating halteres this is known as the Coriolis effect (see below). The insect detects this force with sensory organs called campaniform sensilla and chordotonal organs located at the base of the halteres and uses this information to interpret and correct its position in space. Halteres act as a balance and guidance system by providing rapid feedback to the wing-steering muscles, as well as those responsible for stabilizing the head. This is what allows flies to perform their fast acrobatic maneuvers. - The Streblidae are flies in the superfamily Hippoboscoidea, and together with their relatives the Nycteribiidae, are known as bat flies. They are winged or wingless ectoparasites of bats, and often have long legs. They appear to be host-specific, with different species of bat flies occurring only on particular species of bat hosts, sometimes with multiple species of flies sharing a host bat. - Insects (from Latin ', a calque of Greek ['], \\"cut into sections\\") are a class of invertebrates within the arthropod phylum that have a chitinous exoskeleton, a three-part body (head, thorax and abdomen), three pairs of jointed legs, compound eyes and one pair of antennae. They are the most diverse group of animals on the planet, including more than a million described species and representing more than half of all known living organisms. The number of extant species is estimated at between six and ten million, and potentially represent over 90% of the differing animal life forms on Earth. Insects may be found in nearly all environments, although only a small number of species reside in the oceans, a habitat dominated by another arthropod group, crustaceans. - Nycteribiidae of the true fly superfamily Hippoboscoidea are known as \`\` bat flies '' , together with their close relatives the Streblidae . As the latter do not seem to be a monophyletic group , it is conceivable to unite all bat flies in a single family . They are flattened , spiderlike flies without eyes or wings , and are seldom encountered by general collectors , as they almost never leave the bodies of their hosts . Both males and females take blood meals , thus they qualify as real parasites . Most species are highly host - specific . The family is primarily found in the Old World tropics ; a few of the 274 known species occur in the Neotropics and in Europe . - Hippoboscoidea is a superfamily of the Calyptratae. The flies in this superfamily are blood-feeding obligate parasites of their hosts. Four families are often placed here: - True flies are insects of the order Diptera, the name being derived from the Greek \\"di\\" = two, and \\"ptera\\" = wings. Insects of this order use only a single pair of wings to fly, the hindwings being reduced to club-like balancing organs known as halteres. Diptera is a large order containing an estimated 1,000,000 species including horse-flies, crane flies, hoverflies and others, although only about 125,000 species have been described. - Bats are mammals of the order Chiroptera (from the - \\"cheir\\", \\"hand\\" and - \\"pteron\\", \\"wing\\") whose forelimbs form webbed wings, making them the only mammals naturally capable of true and sustained flight. By contrast, other mammals said to fly, such as flying squirrels, gliding possums, and colugos, can only glide for short distances. Bats do not flap their entire forelimbs, as birds do, but instead flap their spread-out digits, which are very long and covered with a thin membrane or patagium. - Calyptratae is a subsection of Schizophora in the insect order Diptera, commonly referred to as the calyptrate muscoids (or simply calyptrates). It consists of those flies which possess a calypter that covers the halteres, among which are some of the most familiar of all flies, such as the house fly. After reading the paragraphs above, choose the best answer for the entity that related to 'nycteribiidae' with the relationship of 'parent taxon'. Choices: - calyptratae - chiroptera - diptera - insects - nycteribiidae - schizophora - thorax Answer:","response":"The best answer for the entity that related to 'nycteribiidae' with the relationship of 'parent taxon' is Calyptratae.

Charles Czeisler, a professor at Harvard Medical School, and his colleagues got a small group of people for an experiment. For five days in a row, the people read either a paper book or an iPad for four hours before sleep. Their sleep patterns were monitored all night. Before and after each trial period, the people took hourly blood tests to paint a day-long picture of just how much melatonin was in their blood at any given time. When subjects read on the iPad as compared to the paper books, they reported feeling less sleepy at night and less active the following morning. People also took longer to fall asleep on the iPad nights, and the blood tests showed that their melatonin secretion was delayed by an hour and a half. The researchers conclude in today's journal article that given the rise of e-readers and the increasingly widespread use of e-things among children and adolescents, more research into the long-term consequences of these devices on health and safety is urgently needed. Czeisler and colleagues go on, in the research paper, to note:\\"Reading an iPad in bed may increase cancer risk.\\" However, software has been developed that can reduce some of the blue light from the screens of phones and computers according to time of day, and there are also glasses that are made to filter short wavelengths. While they seem like a logical solution for the nighttime tech users, it needs more research. Question: The special software recently developed can _ . Yes or no, is the answer \\"weaken the harm done by doing nighttime e-reading\\"? The answer is:","response":"Yes, the special software recently developed can weaken the harm done by doing nighttime e-reading. This is because the software is designed to reduce some of the blue light emitted from the screens of phones and computers according to the time of day. Blue light is known to disrupt our production of melatonin, the hormone that regulates sleep, which can lead to sleep disturbances and related health issues. In the mentioned study conducted by Charles Czeisler and his colleagues, it was observed that reading an iPad in bed before sleep was associated with delayed melatonin secretion and a detrimental impact on sleep quality. As a result, the researchers suggested that more studies are needed to explore the long-term consequences of using electronic devices before bedtime, particularly among children and adolescents. The development of software that can reduce blue light exposure during nighttime e-reading could potentially mitigate some of these sleep-related problems. By cutting down the amount of blue light emitted by screens, the software might help to prevent melatonin suppression and improve sleep quality. However, it's important to note that more research is needed to fully understand the effectiveness of this technology and other potential solutions, such as glasses designed to filter short wavelengths of light. In conclusion, while the special software has the potential to weaken the harm done by nighttime e-reading, additional studies are necessary to validate its effectiveness and quantify the extent to which it can improve sleep quality and promote health and safety in long-term use."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Who is vicious towards Louis? Answer the above question based on the context below: The Creed family—Louis, Rachel, and their children Ellie and Gage—move from Chicago to rural Ludlow, Maine, after Louis is offered a job as a doctor with the University of Maine. They befriend their elderly neighbor Jud Crandall, who takes them to an isolated pet cemetery (misspelled \\"sematary\\") in the forest behind the Creed's new home. On his first day at work, Louis encounters Victor Pascow, a jogger who has been mortally injured after being hit by a truck. He warns Louis about the pet cemetery before he dies, calling Louis by name despite the fact they have not previously met. That night, Pascow comes to Louis as a ghost and leads him to the Pet Sematary, warning him not to cross the barrier because the ground beyond is \\"sour\\". Louis awakens, assuming it was a dream, but notices his feet are covered in dirt. During Thanksgiving while the family is gone, Ellie's cat, Church, is run down on the highway. Realizing that Ellie will be devastated, Jud takes Louis beyond the cemetery and deep into the woods, where they reach an ancient Micmac burial ground. Jud instructs Louis to bury the cat and warns him not to tell anyone else about what they have done. The next day a reanimated Church returns to the house, a shell of what he was before; he stinks, moves sluggishly, and is vicious towards Louis. Jud explains that as a boy he himself revived his beloved pet dog in the Micmac ground, and that although the cat might be different, it will save Ellie the grief of losing her favorite pet. Sometime later, the young Gage is killed by a truck along the same highway. The family is devastated, and Jud anticipates that Louis is considering burying his son in the Micmac ground, although Louis denies it. Jud believes that introducing Louis to the ritual ground aroused the malevolent forces present there, which caused Gage's death.

Under U.S. law, all top government officials are required to file annual financial disclosure documents with the agency. In Tuesday's 92-page filing, Trump acknowledged that he'd reimbursed his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, last year for more than 100,000 for unspecified expenses incurred in 2016. Trump’s lawyers have previously said the president reimbursed Cohen for 130,000 that Cohen paid to an adult film star to keep her quiet about a sexual tryst she said she had with Trump 10 years earlier. Trump has denied having the tryst but recently confirmed reimbursing Cohen to stop “false and extortionist accusations” about it. The financial disclosure did not say why Trump had not listed the payment in his previous financial filing, but the ethics agency said the reimbursement constituted a loan that should have been reported. That has set off a firestorm of criticism and calls for an investigation into whether Trump violated federal law by omitting the payment from his 2017 disclosure. The controversy has overshadowed other details in Trump's financial disclosure, which is the only publicly available snapshot into the president's finances — his debts, assets and income from dozens of companies and partnerships around the world. Here are six noteworthy takeaways from the report: Golf losses. Trump, an avid golfer who frequently visits his golf courses, sometimes in the company of world leaders, listed 17 golf companies in his disclosure form, with 13 reporting losses. Overall, golf-related revenue plunged to 210 million from nearly 300 million from the previous reporting period. However, the president's struggling golf courses in Turnberry, Scotland, and Doonbeg, Ireland, improved their earnings, with income at the Turnberry property growing to more than 20 million from 14 million. Trump plans to travel to Scotland during his visit to Britain this summer. Question: How long does Trump probably play golf without resting?

Central Asia continued in its role as a commercial crossroads, linking China, the steppes to the north, and the Islamic heartland.\\" Answer: A:","response":"Based on the given context, the Kushan Empire came earlier than Islam. The Kushan Empire was established in the first century CE and ruled until the 4th century CE. During this time, a variety of religions were practiced, including Buddhism, Nestorian Christianity, Zoroastrianism, and Manichaeism. However, Islam was not introduced to the region until the eighth century CE when Arabs moved into the region. The Kushan Empire, formed by a group of Yuezhi tribes, was significant during the early centuries, having a strong influence throughout their rule on the culture and religion of the region. Their reign saw the fusion of the Greco-Buddhist culture, which significantly influenced the development of the arts and philosophies in the region. This era also saw the prevalence of several religions, indicating the Empire's religious tolerance. Later, the Hephthalite Empire succeeded the Kushan Empire. They were a collection of nomadic tribes and continued to assert their influence over the region. However, despite the change of rule, one element remained constant in Central Asia— its role as a commercial crossroads. It continued to link the widely scattered realms of China, the northern steppes, and what would soon become the Islamic heartland. The introduction of Islam to this region did not occur until the early eighth century with the arrival of the Arabs. Following this, the religion of Islam began to spread, taking root not only in Central Asia but also across various parts of the world. Islam began in the 7th century in Mecca, a city in present-day Saudi Arabia, and was propagated by the Prophet Muhammad. Its core tenets are based on the Quran, regarded as the verbatim word of God. All in all, the sequence of these historical periods clearly indicates that the Kushan Empire predated the advent of Islam. Despite the different timescales and main religions, both periods had a profound impact on the region and played a significant part in shaping its historical and cultural landscape."},{"question":"Fact 1: Mutations may change the structure of a chromosome or just change a single nucleotide.

Eat alone in public: When you are new to a city, it can be intimidating to eat alone in public places. However, as mentioned in the tip, eating alone can make you more approachable. People are usually more inclined to strike up a conversation with someone who is alone compared to someone who is with a group of friends. To make yourself feel more comfortable, bring a book or newspaper to read while eating. This way, you have something to engage in if no one approaches you, and if someone does, the book or newspaper can serve as a conversation starter. 3. Join a class, sports team, or club: Another effective way to build a social circle in a new city is by joining a class, sports team, or club. Engaging in activities that interest you not only helps you stay productive but also puts you in a position where you will meet like-minded people. It's much easier to make friends when you share a common interest, as you'll have something to talk about and bond over. Moreover, the structure of classes or clubs usually facilitates repeated interactions with the same group of people. As you continue attending the sessions and interacting with others, you are more likely to develop friendships naturally. In conclusion, building a new social circle in a new city can be a challenge, especially for those who are shy. However, by using these three tricks—taking pictures at events, eating alone in public, and joining classes, sports teams, or clubs—you can quickly make new friends and establish a strong support network. These methods can also help improve your confidence and social skills, making it easier for you to navigate new social settings in the future."},{"question":"Sentence: English is the language of the United Kingdom where the AIDS journal was published.

An HIV infection is really an intensive molecular arms race launched from the minute the virus infects a new host. AIDS progresses not because the body isn't capable of fighting off HIV -- it is. But the immune defenses eventually succumb to the virus in the final standoff. Now researchers led by Barton Haynes, director of the Duke University Human Vaccine Institute at Duke University School of Medicine, believe they have found a way to tip the odds in the immune system's favor. From the moment of infection, the immune system goes on alert and immediately generates antibodies designed to attach to and destroy HIV. And for the first few weeks, these antibodies are successful, eliminating all but a few viruses that remain hidden away from the body's surveillance systems. These viral stalwarts then mutate to escape detection and start to flourish, expanding until new antibodies are generated to dispatch them. That launches another wave of viral destruction that pushes HIV to mutate yet again, prompting another immune attack, and so on, until eventually the body isn't able to keep up with the virus and pushes out poor, or no more additional antibodies that can neutralize HIV. TIME.com: A newborn may be cured of HIV. Is the end of AIDS near? That's the scenario in about 80% of those who are infected with HIV. But in a fortunate 20%, this arms race is stacked in the host's favor, with antibodies that are able to neutralize not just the latest, specific mutated version of HIV but a broader range of viral marauders. Such broadly neutralizing antibodies are the holy grail of AIDS vaccine researchers, who hope to corral these agents in an immunization that can protect against infection. But most attempts to convince the body to churn out these antibodies haven't been successful, primarily because the antibodies take on an unusual shape that marks them for destruction by the very immune system that generated them. In addition, these antibodies can bind to and destroy healthy cells as well as HIV-infected ones, making them a potentially useful but unpredictable partner in fighting the virus. TIME.com: Study explains how the first effective HIV vaccine worked. But by carefully mapping the different mutations that HIV generates, and the resulting antibodies made against them in an African patient who is able to produce broadly neutralizing antibodies, Haynes and his colleagues believe they have come up with a way to drive the immune system to preferentially churn out these HIV-fighting immune cells. \\"We followed individuals from the time of HIV infection to the time they generated broadly neutralizing antibodies, and mapped and isolated the virus at every step along the way so we now don't have to guess any more about what induced those antibodies,\\" he says. \\"We have a map on how to recreate the sequential (versions of HIV) that could drive particular antibody lineages.\\" The work, which was published in the journal Nature, was possible because Haynes had collected and saved blood samples over the course of about three years from roughly 400 patients, starting within weeks of their infection. Researchers found that the first round of broadly neutralizing antibodies generally appeared about 14 weeks after infection, and these were better able to bind to portions of HIV that the virus doesn't change as quickly or as frequently. That makes the antibodies useful weapons in attacking the virus' Achilles heel, and a potentially powerful target for an effective vaccine. TIME.com: Treatment as prevention: How the new way to control HIV came to be. \\"Now we have a picture of how these antibodies developed, so what we are doing is figuring out how to use them to make a vaccine,\\" says Haynes. The challenge will be to push the body to pump out these antibodies rather than the more specific ones aimed at the ever-changing portions of HIV. It turns out that most infected people do produce these antibodies, but HIV distracts the immune system into crowding them out with all the subsequent iterations they convince the body to make against the mutating virus. \\"We are trying to take an unusual or rare event and make it more common,\\" says Haynes. TIME.com: HIV drugs may prevent infection in healthy individuals. Ultimately, he adds, a vaccine will probably need to generate several of these broadly neutralizing antibodies; each person tends to make unique versions that have differing efficacy in stopping HIV. But there's precedent for such an approach, since the antiretroviral drugs that now control HIV infections are used in combination to hit the virus at more than one point in its life cycle. \\"The hope is that by mapping individual pathways to generating broadly neutralizing antibodies, we can find some commonalities among people even though everyone is different, and that gives us hope for using these pathways in a vaccine,\\" says Haynes. \\"It's a huge effort but it looks like it's going to pay off.\\" This article was initially published on TIME.com.

You'll be given the following question. Please do chain-of-thought reasoning. Which of these sentences doesn't make sense? Options: - Sentence A: \\"Staplers Staple paper\\" - Sentence B: \\"Staplers punch holes in paper\\"","response":"To answer this question, we need to analyze what each sentence states and then compare that to the actual functions of a stapler. First, let's consider Sentence A: \\"Staplers staple paper.\\" - Staplers are small office tools that are primarily designed to bind sheets of paper together by driving a thin piece of metal (staple) through the sheets and folding the ends. This action is known as stapling. So, this sentence accurately describes the function of a stapler. Now, let's analyze Sentence B: \\"Staplers punch holes in paper.\\" - The primary function of a stapler is not to punch holes in paper. Hole punching is actually done using a different office tool, called a hole puncher, which is designed to create holes in paper for the purpose of organizing them in binders or folders. So, this sentence incorrectly attributes the function of a hole puncher to a stapler. Based on this chain-of-thought reasoning, we can conclude that Sentence B (\\"Staplers punch holes in paper\\") doesn't make sense as it inaccurately ascribes the function of a hole puncher to a stapler."},{"question":"Q: Which type of substance is considered a proton donor in a reaction? A: Answer:","response":"Step 1: Understand the concept of a proton donor. A proton donor in a reaction is a substance that donates a proton (H+) to another substance. This process is commonly related to acid-base reactions, where the substance donating the proton behaves as an acid. Step 2: Identify proton donor characteristics. To be considered a proton donor, a substance must be able to lose a proton (H+) and form a bond with another substance. This usually implies that the substance has one or more hydrogen atoms that are relatively easy to be removed during a reaction. Step 3: Respond with the appropriate type of substance. Considering the characteristics of a proton donor, it can be concluded that the type of substance that is considered a proton donor in a reaction is an acid. In the Brønsted-Lowry definition of acids and bases, an acid is a proton donor, while a base is a proton acceptor."},{"question":"Q:Given the following context: Paul Helfeld (also given as Hefeld), aged 21 in 1909, and Jacob Lepidus (also reported as Lapidus), who was 25 the same year, were Jewish-Latvian immigrants.

The pair had been living in Paris in 1907, along with Lepidus's brother Paul, a revolutionary bomber who went under the nom de guerre \\"Strygia\\"; Jacob was described in The Times as a \\"member of a notorious Russian revolutionary family\\". On 1 May 1907 Paul Lepidus was killed when a bomb he was carrying to assassinate Armand Fallières, the President of France, exploded prematurely. Lepidus and Helfeld fled the country and lived in Scotland for a year, before moving to Tottenham.Both men joined a small group of Latvian agitators living in north London; according to other members of the group, the pair had criminal records and had joined as a cover for the robberies they carried out.

In 1874, Disraeli's ambitious foreign policy, aimed at creating a British empire, is voted down by the House of Commons after a speech by his great rival, William Gladstone. Later, Disraeli receives the welcome news that the spendthrift Khedive of Egypt is in dire need of money and is willing to sell the controlling shares in the Suez Canal. The purchase of the canal would secure control of India, but Michael Probert, head of the Bank of England, makes it clear to Disraeli that he is vehemently opposed to any such plan. Disraeli then summons Hugh Myers, a leading Jewish banker. Meanwhile, Lord Charles Deeford proposes to Lady Clarissa Pevensey. Although she is in love with him, she turns him down. He is content to enjoy his wealth and high social standing, and lacks the ambition she wants in a husband; further, she is a great admirer of the Prime Minister and Charles has no strong opinion about him. Disraeli, seeing promise in the young man and wanting Clarissa to be happy, convinces Charles to come work for him, and tells him about the canal purchase. But he does not tell him about the spies. Russia, eager to seize India for itself, has assigned two spies to watch Disraeli: Mrs. Travers, who has entree to the highest social circles, and Mr. Foljambe. Disraeli was not fooled; he has hired Foljambe as his personal government secretary, the better to deceive him. When Foljambe asks Charles if Myers is there to provide financial backing for the purchase of the canal, Charles says nothing, but his manner makes it clear that Foljambe has guessed correctly. Mrs. Travers orders Foljambe to leave the country and warn their masters. Disraeli soon discovers what has happened.

And Cholinergic Urticaria has destroyed my life completely. I developed it exactly 3 years ago, in March 2013. After 3 years of physical and mental torture, pain, stress, anguish, heartache, no income, no help, no support, and no cure, I'm not sure how much more a person is expected to suffer daily like this. I've lost everything. I can't take it anymore and I'm begging for help. I've lost everything. Please. I've lived in Florida for eight and a half years now. Three years ago, in March 2013, I was working at a gymnastics gym for my fourth year in a row, and I was also a dance teacher. And I loved my life. And out of nowhere, I developed a rare skin condition called Cholinergic Urticaria. I am allergic to my own sweat. (And tears.) Me, out of all people. Someone who was so physically active everyday. And loved being out in the sun. I had to quit my jobs; my passions. And having my passions just stripped from me out of the blue one day, along with my whole life as I knew it, I cannot describe to you the depths of depression that exist when your life is just, taken from you. And you may think, 'oh big deal' but you dont realize how much your body sweats until you become allergic to it. I would say its one step shy of being allergic to breathing or blinking! Bodily functions you have no control over. And to add insult to injury, when you get sick, you find out who your true friends are. And that turned out to be nobody, sadly. People tell me to move up North, hah! As if that would make a difference. I get hives trying to shower. I break out if I even try to vacuum, in air conditioning! And the hives have gotten worse with each passing year. I've had times where 100% of my body is covered in painful itchy hives. It is very hard to find any doctor who has even heard of CU. And I have no medical insurance, so it's usually anywhere from 200 to 350 (US dollars) to make a new patient appointment. And every medication, lotion, or remedy I've found online, does absolutely nothing to treat it. When I try to find answers online it usually just says, \\"there has been very little research on CU since it is such a rare condition.\\" And for two and a half years now, I have applied for government, social security disability benefits/assistance, and I have been denied each time. Justice for all, right? I guess not. The judge stated that, \\"This does not affect my daily life.\\" Are you kidding me? This has DESTROYED my life! It has destroyed me too. I stopped living three years ago. Our judicial system in the US is so blind if they cannot see how obvious it is, that someone with CU is unable to perform daily tasks like a healthy person can, or work a normal job. Though I continue to be denied for my legal right for help? Isn't this why the Americans with Disabilities Act was established? To help people like me, who have worked hard my entire life since the day I was legally able to? That's ten years of my life that I have put in hard work wherever I was employed. And I'm a perfectionist so I really did work myself to the bone at every job I ever had, even though I received such little in return for my efforts. I know ten years is not a very long time, but I have no control over when I developed my disabilities. Yes, I have more illnesses than just CU and it's an everyday struggle. Especially because nobody has ever reached out a hand to help me. Even though I am now facing homelessness. I am outraged at our legal system here in the US, which is why I have turned to the internet now for help. When I went to trial to fight for my disability income rights, I was forced to go without representation, and was denied. I didn't know that I had any other option at the time because the judge said that they will not reschedule a new trial. So I feel I was taken advantage, because I was told I could either proceed without a lawyer, or simply be denied. And I had been waiting years for this court date, and both my lawyers didn't bother to show up. Not a single person in that courtroom told me there was any other option other than waiving my right to an attorney in order to proceed with the trial. But, now that I spoke to a real, legit lawyer, I am well aware how unfairly I was treated in my trial process. Because in the US, it is a Constitutional right that you are guaranteed representation for any trial. I also wasn't allowed to submit pictures. In fact, I couldn't even go up to the judge and show him my arms covered in hives, because he wasn't even in the room! He was on a screen via skype! And the only medical records they obtained were from the free clinic, (which is a joke) that contained so much false information that it sent me into a panic attack! (For example, it said I went back to work, I never went back to work!) I have not worked in three years because it is physically impossible for me. I wake up covered in hives everyday, even though I have the air conditioner on. I have layed in bed for the last three years straight to avoid sweating, and it breaks my heart every single day. I miss my old life so much. One without itching and without pain. I even dream about it. But when I wake up, only then does it turn into a nightmare. To know that my life will never be rhe same again. These everyday hives are so unbearable that I scratch my skin open and still continue to scratch because it just itches so bad. And after laying in bed all day everyday for 3 years now, I can barely stand or walk for more than a minute or two. My back has just given out. Especially since I went from being 100lbs to 200lbs from being almost completely immobile, unable to exercise, and so severely depressed that I cope with food. There is also added anxiety due to a number of things, one being that an allergist believes I can go into anaphylactic shock at any moment and die. But I can't afford an epi-pen. It saddens me so much to think about my life 3 years ago, compared to what Ive become now. Im unrecognizable. So I also developed Agoraphobia. Which means I almost never leave my apartment. Only for doctor appointments. Because when I see myself in store glass windows or doors, I can't even believe it's me. And people can be so cruel. People have made horrible comments about my weight gain, and it makes me feel worthless. And people have physically moved away from me in the store because they think I have some kind of contagious rash. It makes me feel like I'm some kind of monster. I went from being an outgoing, friendly, happy person, to someone who, has cried everyday for three years, has no friends or family, and never leaves my apartment. No man wants me once I tell them about my CU. It's like I'm damaged goods. I went from being a gymnast and a dancer, to not being able to walk through the grocery store, during the day, without receiving hurtful stares. It is just as emotionally painful as it is physically. I am a great person, and in this shallow, media infused society that we live in, we are judged by our looks. No matter how amazing of a person we might be. I am screaming out for help and no one even bats an eyelash. At least if I was approved for disability assistance I could stop eating free meals at the churches and wouldn't be facing homelessness. I am scared to death of what is going to happen to me because of that fact that I cannot work and therefore cannot afford the cost of living. And the thought of living on the streets of Florida in 100+F temperatures, just makes me start to panick. Just imagining how severe my hives would get, I would probably die. But which one sounds better to you? Death or living in Hell everyday? Im not suicidal, but just how much is a person supposed to take living like this everyday? I'm at my three year mark, and I'm at my breaking point both mentally and physically. Can anyone help me? ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

Julie Reid said she developed a devastating immunological condition called cholinergic urticaria, which causes her skin to become hypersensitive to emotional stress and exercise. If she sweats, cries or simply takes a hot shower. \\"It's torture living like this, it's torture,\\" Reid said in an interview with ABC's Tampa Bay affiliate WFTS. \\"I just feel like a monster now.\\" She said she developed the immunological condition three years ago when she was working at a gymnastics gym. On a website to draw attention to her case, Reid said she has gained significant amount of weight and had to quit her job because the sweat would cause her to break out in massive hives for hours or days. She told WFTS she doesn't leave the house during the day over fear she could sweat and break out into hives. \\"I went from being a gymnast and a dancer, to not being able to walk through the grocery store, during the day, without receiving hurtful stares,\\" Reid said on her website. \\"It is just as emotionally painful as it is physically.\\" Reid could not be immediately reached by ABC News for further comment. The disease often comes on spontaneously, according to the National Organization for Rare Diseases, and doctors can only offer supporting medications such as antihistamines to patients. The disease will usually stop just as suddenly as it started, though there is no timeline for when it might end, according to the organization. \\"I cannot describe to you the depths of depression that exist when your life is just, taken from you,\\" Reid said on her website.

The 28-year-old Clearwater transplant suffers from Cholinergic Urticaria, a rare hypersensitive skin condition that causes her to break out in hives all over her body because she is allergic to her own sweat and tears. The hives can last anywhere from an hour to several days. It is a condition that came on suddenly two years ago. \\"It itches like crazy, I scratch my skin open,\\" Reid said. Her condition came on without warning. Now Reid, who made a living as a gymnastics and dance instructor, can now longer follow her passion. Being outside is not possible either. The Florida heat and sun are just too much for her. \\"Any physical activity I do, I develop hives everywhere,\\" she said. Reid told ABC Action News she slipped into a deep depression and struggles to get out of bed. Over the past three years, she has put on more than 100 pounds. She admits she's turned to eating food to cope with her condition. \\"I used to be so beautiful, now I look like a monster,\\" she added. Reid has not left her apartment during the daytime hours in the past three years. She claims she has developed agoraphobia and fears to leave the house and deal with public scrutiny. \\"I just stay in bed and cry and cry,\\" she said. Unable to work, she's lost her health insurance. She says she's also been denied disability. \\"It's destroyed my life. I have no, I have nothing, I have nothing, no friends, no furniture, no help, no family here,\\" she said. She spends hours online searching for a cure but her condition is not curable. According to Reid, one doctor who previously treated her told her she could go into anaphylactic shock and requires an Epipen. She can't get it because she cannot afford it. Reid has no furniture in her apartment. She's sold it all to try and make ends meet and to pay for doctor visits. Fearful of her mental condition and emotional state, Reid reached out to ABC Action News for help. She is hoping someone out there will see her story and help her. She has documented her journey with a personal website, click here to view it. ||||| A summary of this is?","response":"Julie, a 28-year-old woman from Clearwater, Florida, suffers from a rare and debilitating skin condition called Cholinergic Urticaria. This condition, which Julie developed in March 2013, makes her allergic to her own sweat and tears, causing her to break out into painful, itchy hives whenever she sweats, cries, or even showers. As a former gymnast, dancer, and gymnastics coach, Julie loved her active lifestyle, but her condition has forced her to quit her passions and stay at home to avoid triggering the painful hives. Despite trying numerous medications, lotions, and remedies, none have relieved Julie's symptoms, and her condition is not well-understood due to its rarity. With no medical insurance, she has found it difficult and costly to get medical help. Furthermore, her applications for government disability benefits have been repeatedly denied, even though her condition severely impacts her daily life. Julie's condition has not only affected her physically but also emotionally, leading her into deep depression and agoraphobia. As a result, she rarely leaves her apartment during the day and has gained significant weight due to a combination of inactivity and emotional eating. Additionally, the condition has taken a toll on her personal relationships, leading to social isolation. Unfortunately, cholinergic urticaria does not yet have a cure. The National Organization for Rare Diseases states that the disease often appears and disappears suddenly, but there is no indication of when it might end. As Julie's condition continues to impact her daily life, she has turned to the internet for help, hoping that sharing her story will raise awareness and potentially lead to the assistance she desperately needs."},{"question":"Most cases of food poisoning can be handled at home. Symptoms can begin within hours and last for hours or days and even longer in some cases. Mildly contaminated foods, or some types of contaminants, may not cause the symptoms to start for several days, or even longer. When the onset of symptoms is delayed, the duration of the problem can last for days to weeks. Chronic symptoms should be promptly evaluated by a doctor especially if you are having hematemesis or hematochezia, which is bloody vomit or diarrhea, respectively. The symptoms of food poisoning include nausea, vomiting, watery diarrhea, abdominal pain and cramps, sweating, and fever. You may want to let your stomach settle for an hour or so, but then you need to start introducing fluids to prevent dehydration. Take small sips of whatever liquid you can most easily tolerate, and continue to drink as much as possible throughout the day. Sip on water or suck on ice chips. Taking small sips of water may help calm nausea and will provide your body with a small and steady dose of this essential liquid. If your stomach is not ready for liquid, then try putting ice chips in your mouth and let them dissolve. Try sucking on a ginger candy or drink some ginger tea. Ginger can help with digestion and treat stomach upset, diarrhea, and nausea. Diarrhea and vomiting also cause your body to lose essential electrolytes. A good way to replace the lost electrolytes is to sip on a caffeine-free sports drink (not an energy drink) once you can hold it down. Other products are available for adults and children that help to replenish fluids and restore electrolytes. These products are called electrolyte replacement drinks. Types of sports drinks include Gatorade and Powerade, to name a few. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist for a specific recommendation. Sometimes a little carbonation may actually help reduce symptoms of nausea. Try sipping on ginger ale or other clear carbonated beverages over ice. Sip on clear broth, such as chicken, vegetable, or beef, once your stomach has settled enough and you are not likely to trigger the nausea and vomiting. Starting with broth is a good way to help replenish fluids and begin to introduce nutrients back into your body. Move on to foods that are bland, low-fat, and easily digested. Some examples include saltine crackers, toast, and gelatin. Back away from these solid foods if your nausea returns. Some beverages should not be used while are trying to restore the fluids you lost during your illness. Some liquids pull water from your body tissues and contribute to the problem of dehydration. Alcoholic beverages are not to be used while you are still sick. Avoid caffeinated beverages including coffee, tea, colas, or energy drinks. Fruit juices and fruit drinks contain carbohydrates, are low in sodium, and may aggravate your upset stomach. Avoid dairy products and spicy drinks or foods until you are feeling better. Summary:","response":"1. Allow stomach to settle for an hour before starting to drink fluids. 2. Start by taking small sips of water or sucking on ice chips to prevent dehydration. 3. Try ginger candy or ginger tea to help with nausea and digestion. 4. Replenish lost electrolytes by sipping on caffeine-free sports drinks or electrolyte replacement drinks. 5. Sip on clear carbonated beverages like ginger ale to help reduce nausea. 6. Consume clear broths to replenish fluids and introduce nutrients into the body. 7. Gradually introduce bland, low-fat, easily digested foods like saltine crackers, toast, and gelatin. 8. Avoid alcoholic beverages, caffeinated drinks, fruit juices, and dairy products until you are feeling better.

They were both from the House of Trastámara and were second cousins, being both descended from John I of Castile; on marriage they were given a papal dispensation to deal with consanguinity by Sixtus IV. They married on October 19, 1469, in the city of Valladolid; Isabella was eighteen years old and Ferdinand a year younger; this marriage united both kingdoms under one crown. It is generally accepted by most scholars (John Elliott being an English-speaking example) that the unification of Spain can essentially be traced back to the marriage of Ferdinand and Isabella. Some newer historical opinions propose that under their rule, what later became Spain was still a union of two crowns rather than a unitary state, as to a large degree Castile and Aragon remained separate kingdoms, with most of their own separate institutions, for decades to come. The court of Ferdinand and Isabella was constantly on the move, in order to bolster local support for the crown from local feudal lords. - The New World is one of the names used for the Earth's Western Hemisphere, specifically the Americas (including nearby islands such as those of the Caribbean and Bermuda). - Genoese (\\"Zeneize\\") is a dialect of the Ligurian language spoken in Genoa (the principal city of the Liguria region in Northern Italy). - Bartholomew Columbus (Genoese dialect: Bertomê Corombo; ) (c. 1461 1515) was an Italian explorer from Genoa and the younger brother of Christopher Columbus. - Christopher Columbus ( 20 May 1506) was an Italian explorer, navigator, colonizer, and citizen of the Republic of Genoa. Under the auspices of the Catholic Monarchs of Spain, he completed four voyages across the Atlantic Ocean. Those voyages and his efforts to establish permanent settlements on the island of Hispaniola initiated the European colonization of the New World. - Spain, officially the Kingdom of Spain, is a sovereign state largely located on the Iberian Peninsula in southwestern Europe, with two large archipelagos, the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea and the Canary Islands off the North African Atlantic coast, two cities Ceuta and Melilla in the North African mainland and several small islands in the Alboran Sea near the Moroccan coast. Its mainland is bordered to the south and east by the Mediterranean Sea except for a small land boundary with Gibraltar; to the north and northeast by France, Andorra, and the Bay of Biscay; and to the west and northwest by Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean. It is the only European country to have a border with an African country (Morocco) and its African territory accounts for nearly 5% of its population, mostly in the Canary Islands but also in Ceuta and Melilla. - Hispaniola (Spanish: \\"La Española\\"; Latin: \\"Hispaniola\\"; Taíno: \\"Haiti\\") is the 22nd-largest island in the world, located in the Caribbean island group, the Greater Antilles. It is the second largest island in the Caribbean after Cuba, and the tenth most populous island in the world. - Domenico Colombo ( English : Dominic Columbus , Genoese : Domenego Corombo ) ( 1418 -- 1496 ) was the father of navigator Christopher Columbus and Bartholomew Columbus .

A Rube Goldberg machine is a contraption that employs a chain of sequential cause and effect actions to achieve a simple goal, using various everyday objects and materials. Step-by-step process: 1. Identify the goal: Determine the simple final outcome, such as flipping a switch or dropping a ball into a basket. 2. Brainstorm materials: Consider a variety of objects and materials available, like dominoes, balls, ramps, levers, pulleys, etc. 3. Develop ideas: Think about interesting ways to connect objects and design actions to produce chain reactions that ultimately accomplish the goal. 4. Choose feasible connections: Ensure that the connections between elements are physically possible, taking into account principles like gravity, force, and friction. 5. Sketch the design: Draw a rough layout of the Rube Goldberg machine, detailing the arrangement and order of the components. 6. Refine the design: Analyze your sketch to identify potential flaws or areas of improvement. Make necessary adjustments to ensure the entire contraption is likely to function properly. 7. Test the machine: Physically assemble the Rube Goldberg machine according to your design and run trials to test its functionality. Record the results and troubleshoot any issues. 8. Iterate and improve: Modify and refine your design based on the testing results. Repeat the testing process until the machine consistently achieves the desired outcome. By completing this task, an individual's ability to perform physical reasoning would be tested, as it requires an understanding of the principles of mechanics and physics in order to design a functioning Rube Goldberg machine."},{"question":"In this task, you need to count the number of times the given letter appears in the given sentence.

The fungus also thrives in warm, moist environments and may enter your body through cuts or openings between the nail and skin. Don’t share shoes, socks, or towels with anyone. Avoid walking barefoot in locker rooms, public swimming pools, communal showers, or gyms. Discard old shoes that may still be infected with the fungus. Wash your hands with soap after touching the infected toenail(s) to keep it from spreading to uninfected nails. Keep your infected foot dry by wearing open-toed shoes or wearing dry, clean socks. This infection can begin mildly, but spread into a more uncomfortable condition. The fungus may cause your nail to change color, disintegrate at the edge, or become abnormally thick. If it becomes bothersome, the condition should be treated. Try a prescription medicated antifungal cream that’s rubbed into the nail after it’s soaked in warm water. Ask your doctor for prescription oral medication that should be taken from six to 12 weeks, in combination with topical antifungal treatments. It may be necessary for your doctor to monitor your liver function while you are on these medications A few non-conventional treatments have been effective in treating nail fungus in some people. Use tea tree oil, applied in a light coating to the affected nail(s) two to three times a day—use products that are 100% tea tree oil. Apply snakeroot extract, a treatment that has often proven as effective as conventional antifungal cremes. Soak your infected nail(s) in white vinegar, which has natural antibacterial properties. After filing the nail (exposing a fresh surface), apply full-strength vinegar with a cloth, cotton ball, or cotton swab 1–2 times daily for several weeks. This may be necessary if the infected nail becomes extremely painful. The procedure involves removing the infected nail completely. The removal is often done in combination with treatment using antifungal medication in the nailbed. Rest assured that a new nail will grow back, but it may take up to one year. What is a summary?","response":"The article discusses about a toenail fungus infection that can occur from athlete's foot or exposure in public places. The fungi responsible thrive in warm, moist environments and can enter the body through cuts or openings between the nail and skin. The infection can cause the nail to change color, disintegrate at the edge, or become thick. Preventive measures include not sharing shoes or towels, avoiding barefoot walks in public places, and maintaining cleanliness. Once infected, treatments options vary from prescription medications, which may need liver function monitoring, to non-conventional methods like tea tree oil, snakeroot extract, or soaking the nail in white vinegar. In extreme cases, nail removal may be necessary.

And I was wondering What will Jesse want to do next?","response":"As an AI, I cannot predict specific actions of individuals, but I can offer some suggestions based on general human behavior and social norms. After enjoying a surprise breakfast cooked by Bailey, it's possible that Jesse might: 1. Express gratitude: Jesse may want to thank Bailey for the thoughtful gesture and the delicious food. A simple \\"thank you\\" or a heartfelt appreciation can strengthen their relationship. 2. Return the favor: Jesse might consider doing something nice for Bailey in return, either by cooking a meal themselves or offering help in some other way to show appreciation for Bailey's kind act. 3. Spend quality time together: After enjoying the breakfast, Jesse may want to spend more time with Bailey and their family, engaging in activities such as playing board games, watching movies, or taking part in other shared hobbies. 4. Share the experience: Jesse could share the story of Bailey's surprise with friends or on social media to highlight the kind and caring nature of their friend or family member. 5. Offer to clean up: Since Bailey took the time to cook for everyone, Jesse may show appreciation by volunteering to help with cleaning up the dishes and kitchen area.

Options: - revealing information - being ridiculed - problems - more funding - telling all Explain why a human would choose \\"more funding\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","response":"A human would choose \\"more funding\\" as the answer to the question because going public is a common method of raising capital for a company. When a company goes public, it involves issuing shares of its stock to the public, allowing individuals and institutional investors to buy ownership stakes in the company. This process, also known as an Initial Public Offering (IPO), leads to an influx of funds that the company can use for various purposes such as business expansion, paying off debt, or launching new products and services. The other options mentioned in the question do not accurately describe the reasons for a company going public: - Revealing information: While companies are required to provide certain financial information and disclosures when going public, this is not the primary motivation for a company's decision to go public. - Being ridiculed: This has no relevance to a company's decision to go public. Companies generally go public for financial and strategic reasons, not because of any desire to be ridiculed. - Problems: While some companies may go public as a solution to their financial problems, the term \\"problems\\" by itself is too vague and does not directly address the primary purpose of raising capital through an IPO. - Telling all: Similar to revealing information, transparency is an aspect of going public, but it is not the main reason why a company would decide to do so. In summary, a human would choose \\"more funding\\" as the answer to the question because going public is an effective way for a company to raise capital, enabling it to grow and achieve its strategic objectives.

HMS Bulwark brought more than 400 people to safety after they were found 40 miles from the Libyan coast in inflatable boats. The European Commission has proposed a scheme to offer 20,000 refugees the right to resettle in the EU. Meanwhile, Home Secretary Theresa May has suggested that some rescued migrants should be returned home. The BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale said a further 150 migrants had been transferred to HMS Bulwark from an Italian coastguard vessel and the ship would now head to Sicily. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said the Royal Navy had rescued about 600 people so far this month. The Ministry of Defence said HMS Bulwark had been alerted to four 30ft boats in potential distress, each carrying about 100 people including pregnant women and children. Captain Nick Cooke Priest, commanding officer of HMS Bulwark, said people on the \\"precarious\\" boats were suffering from dehydration and injuries. \\"The weather at the moment is extremely hot so my ship's company and I are very pleased that we were able to bring them to safety,\\" he said. To help combat the migrant crisis, the European Commission has proposed the new resettlement scheme, which will take place over the next two years. By the end of May, it also plans to introduce a temporary mechanism for distributing thousands of migrants already in Europe among EU member states. But Mrs May said offering resettlement regardless of circumstances to migrants rescued from the Mediterranean would encourage more to make \\"perilous journeys\\". This was why the UK was not backing a resettlement quota plan, she said. Mr Fallon said HMS Bulwark had already proved to be an \\"invaluable asset in assisting with the Mediterranean migrant crisis\\". \\"The ship is providing medical assistance, food, water and dry clothes to those in need and will transfer them safely to land as soon as possible,\\" he said. The UN estimates that 60,000 people have already tried to cross the Mediterranean from North Africa this year. More than 1,800 migrants have died - a 20-fold increase on the same period in 2014. France, Germany, Italy and some other countries have backed the quota proposal, but a majority of EU governments would have to agree for it to become law. As things stand, the UK could decide to opt in to the scheme, but could not be compelled to join, as it has the power to opt out of justice and home affairs policies set by the EU - and asylum decisions are included in that opt-out. The Home Office has instead urged the EU to focus on combating people traffickers.","response":"HMS Bulwark rescued over 400 migrants near the Libyan coast, amid ongoing discussions in the EU regarding a proposal to offer 20,000 refugees resettlement rights and the distribution of migrants among EU member states."},{"question":"In 1912 , immediately after he and Whitehead PM wrote , he published his book \`\` The Problems of Philosophy '' .

Step 2: It tells us that something occurred immediately after another action. In this case, it is the writing of PM by the subject and Whitehead. Step 3: The subject published a book called 'The Problems of Philosophy.' Sentence 2: “Immediately after he and Whitehead wrote PM, he published his 1912, 'The Problems of Philosophy'.” Step 1: The sentence begins with the same action in relation to PM (immediately after writing it with Whitehead). Step 2: The subject published something; however, the reference to the year 1912 is placed awkwardly, making it unclear whether 1912 is the publication year of the book, or if it relates to something else. Step 3: 'The Problems of Philosophy' is mentioned, just like in Sentence 1. After analyzing both sentences, they mostly convey the same meaning, but Sentence 2 has a less clear structure and placement of the year 1912.

On December 22 , 1862 , to reorganize the Washington territory and form the new Montana territory .","response":"Yes, the two sentences provided are paraphrases of each other. Paraphrasing is the act of rewording or restating a sentence, passage, or idea to achieve better clarity or a different perspective, while retaining the original meaning. The structure, wording, and order of information in the two sentences are different, but the main idea of reorganizing one territory and forming another remains consistent. Here's a more detailed explanation of the paraphrasing in the sentences: 1. Original sentence: 738 on December 22, 1862, to reorganize the Montana Territory and form the new Washington Territory. This sentence states that on December 22, 1862, a particular action (presumably a legislative or governmental decision indicated by \\"738\\") was taken to reorganize the Montana Territory and establish the new Washington Territory. 2. Paraphrased sentence: On December 22, 1862, to reorganize the Washington territory and form the new Montana territory. In the second sentence, the date is placed at the beginning and the territories' names have been swapped. This new sentence implies that on December 22, 1862, the action taken was to reorganize the Washington Territory and establish the new Montana Territory. These sentences are paraphrases of each other because both convey the core idea of reorganizing one territory and forming a new one, albeit with different presentations and changing the positions of the territories.

Ruth Caisley, from Haltwhistle, Northumberland, is one mother who still lives with its devastating results. Her son William is now 17, but the Strep B infection left him with cerebral palsy and other learning disabilities. He is unlikely to ever live independently. It was only years after William's birth that Ruth Caisley discovered that a simple treatment of antibiotics during her pregnancy could have cleared the infection and prevented her passing it on to her son. She is now one of a number of parents campaigning for a screening programme for pregnant women. She said: \\"When I look at the children who William started school with, they're now building independent lives. William will never get that chance. \\"He should be going to college, and having girlfriends, but for the want of a few antibiotics that'll never happen. \\"I love him to bits but if I could go back in time and change that tomorrow I would.\\" Vikki and Peter Craig, from Rowlands Gill, Gateshead, also believe mothers should be screened. Their daughter Alice Ellen is approaching her 1st birthday, but last March she also became infected by Strep B soon after birth. They endured days of agony while the premature baby was treated with antibiotics. Thankfully, Alice has suffered no long term ill effects, but the couple were shocked when they discovered just how serious the infection could have been. Vikki Craig said: \\"Because I had a fibroid, I was in hospital being scanned every four weeks. It was just ludicrous to think that I was there that regularly and yet I could have had this blood test that could have picked up this infection.\\" Peter Craig said: \\"The cost of the test and antibiotics do seem like a very small price to pay for something that has an opportunity to prevent a horrible situation.\\" The Department of Health though does not believe a screening programme would be necessary or effective. It's advised by the UK National Screening Committee, which looks at what conditions could be monitored. During a review in November 2012, it looked at the evidence on whether screening would be effective and concluded the harm involved would outweigh the benefits. The panel said it would lead to many mothers having antibiotics unnecessarily. That could cause dangerous allergic reactions and in some cases the drugs could also pose health risks to the babies. It also says the risks of Strep B are relatively low given that there are 700,000 births every year. But the Department of Health says it is looking at other ways to tackle the infection and protect newborn babies. But some are not convinced that decision is right. The Easington Labour MP Grahame Morris sits on the commons health select committee and has tabled a motion calling for a rethink. He says the evidence for routine Strep B screening is compelling. He said: \\"The evidence suggests it's on the increase and those countries like the USA, Canada, France, Germany and Spain that have introduced screening on a routine basis have seen a dramatic reduction in infections in the newborn. \\"I believe in early interventions in life, and this could prevent years of expense and agony with a simple, cheap measure.\\" So far more than 35 other MPs have backed the commons motion. A petition has also been started by the Group B Strep Support group, which includes dozens of the families affected by the infection. The Department of Health panel says it will look again at the case for screening in two or three years' time. It doesn't believe the problem of Strep B is more serous in the UK than in countries that do screen. But families living with the effects of the infection remain convinced that a simple blood test for pregnant women at around 35 weeks would save many more lives and prevent others enduring pain and loss. A summary of the above article is?","response":"This story is about a harmful infection called Group B Streptococcus, or Strep B for short. Strep B can make babies sick, and sadly, around 40 babies die from it each year. Some babies who survive might end up with disabilities like cerebral palsy, making it hard for them to live normal lives. Parents like Ruth Caisley are sad because they found out that a simple treatment with antibiotics during pregnancy could have stopped the infection from passing to their babies. They want all pregnant women to be tested for Strep B, so other babies can be protected. However, the Department of Health doesn't think testing all pregnant women would be a good idea, as it could lead to too many moms taking antibiotics when they don't need to, which can cause problems. They believe the number of babies at risk from Strep B is low compared to the total number of babies born every year. Still, some people, including a group of parents and members of parliament, think testing pregnant women for Strep B would be a good way to save babies and keep them healthy. They want the government to reconsider their decision.

So, one day, we will run out of them. (c) Fossil fuels cannot last for eons in the future. Since we're using them faster than they form, they won't last very long. We need to find other sources of energy that can be used for a long, long time."},{"question":"How is \\"Even though she failed to have the European Union Cultural Heritage Label established, the European Heritage Label is still excellent, as is the project itself.\\" said in German?","response":"To translate the given sentence into German, I will follow these steps: 1.

They were both into collecting rare specimens of plants and wildlife. They would often complain about the weather. Which friend experienced warmer weather? Answer:","response":"To determine which friend experienced warmer weather, we need to compare the climates of East Antarctica and West Antarctica. Step 1: Understand the general climate conditions of Antarctica Antarctica is the coldest continent on Earth, with the South Pole located in East Antarctica. The coastlines of both East Antarctica and West Antarctica have milder climates due to proximity to the surrounding ocean, while the continent's interior experiences more extreme cold temperatures. Step 2: Compare East Antarctica's climate with West Antarctica's climate East Antarctica is larger, higher, and colder than West Antarctica. It is predominantly made up of a high, ice-covered plateau, with average temperatures ranging from -20°C to -60°C (-4°F to -76°F). It can reach even lower in the interior. Coastal regions of East Antarctica tend to be slightly warmer but still cold, ranging from -10°C to -40°C (14°F to -40°F). West Antarctica, on the other hand, has a more varied landscape and generally milder climate. The Antarctic Peninsula, located in West Antarctica, has the mildest climate on the continent, with coastal summer temperatures ranging from -2°C to 2°C (28°F to 36°F) and winter temperatures ranging from -15°C to -20°C (5°F to -4°F). The interior of West Antarctica is colder than the coastal areas, but still generally warmer than East Antarctica.

He felt that form was less important than what? Options: - shapeless - quality - function - change shape - chaos Let's think now! Step-by-step reasoning:","response":"John didn't care about style. He felt that form was less important than what? To answer this question, let's analyze the given options: 1. Shapeless: This term means lacking a definite shape or form. It doesn't make much sense as an alternative to form because it doesn't represent a different aspect that John might prioritize over style or form. 2. Quality: Quality refers to the standard or level of excellence of something. It is a possible alternative to form, as John might prioritize the overall quality of an object over its style, which focuses only on appearance. 3. Function: Function refers to the practical purpose or use of something, which can be prioritized over style/form. If John doesn't care about style, he might be more focused on the functionality of an object. 4. Change Shape: This term refers to the ability to change form or shape. It doesn't seem to be a suitable alternative to form in this context because it still focuses on the shape or appearance of an object. 5. Chaos: Chaos means a state of extreme confusion or disorder. It's unlikely that John would prioritize chaos over style/form, as it doesn't align with the context of preference for what is more important. After analyzing the given options, \\"function\\" seems to be the most fitting answer. John didn't care about style, and he felt that form was less important than function.

In the Bible it corresponds to the Levant, in particular to the areas of the Southern Levant that provide the main setting of the narrative of the Hebrew Bible, i.e., the area of Israel, Philistia, Phoenicia, and other nations. - Tell Ashtara ( Arabic : ) also Aštartu , was a site south of Damascus mentioned in the Amarna letters correspondence of 1350 BC. In the Amarna letters the city is named Aštartu , and is usually identified with the Biblical ' Ashteroth Karnaim ' . Aštartu is only referenced in two letters of the 382 letter corpus , in letters EA 256 , and EA 197 : ( titled : \`\` Biryawaza 's plight '' ) , - ( EA is for ' el Amarna ' ) . Biryawaza was the mayor of Damascus - called Dimasqu . EA 256 is a story concerning Mutbaal , the son of Labaya , and the Habiru , and concerns the whereabouts of Ayyab , who may be in Pihilu , modern day Pella , Jordan , and is a letter of intrigue , titled : \`\` Oaths and denials '' , and lists 7 cities located in the Golan area . Ayyab is the king of Aštartu and does author one letter to the Egyptian pharaoh , letter EA 364 . - Ashteroth Karnaim was a city in the land of Bashan, east of the Jordan River, mentioned in and (where it is rendered simply as \\"Ashteroth\\"). The name translates literally to 'Ashteroth of the Horns', with 'Ashteroth' being a Canaanite fertility goddess, and 'horns' being symbolic of mountain peaks. It is possibly the same as Carnaim in First Maccabees and Carnion in Second Maccabees. - Upper Egypt (', shortened to ' ) is the strip of land on both sides of the Nile that extends between Nubia and downriver (northwards) to Lower Egypt. - Mesopotamia (\\"[land] between rivers\\"; from Ancient Armenian (Mijagetq); \\"bild ar-rfidayn\\" \\"miyn rodn\\"; \\"Beth Nahrain\\" \\"land of rivers\\") is a name for the area of the TigrisEuphrates river system, in modern days roughly corresponding to most of Iraq plus Kuwait, the eastern parts of Syria, Southeastern Turkey, and regions along the Turkish-Syrian and IranIraq borders. - The Levant (Arabic: \\"\\") is an approximate historical geographical term referring to a large area in the Eastern Mediterranean. In its widest historical sense, the Levant included all of the eastern Mediterranean with its islands, that is, it included all of the countries along the Eastern Mediterranean shores, extending from Greece to Cyrenaica. The term \\"Levant\\" entered English in the late 15th century from French. It derives from the Italian \\"Levante\\", meaning \\"rising\\", implying the rising of the sun in the east. As such, it is broadly equivalent to the Arabic term \\"Mashriq\\", meaning \\"the land where the sun rises\\". - Ancient Egypt was a civilization of ancient Northeastern Africa, concentrated along the lower reaches of the Nile River in what is now the modern country of Egypt. It is one of six civilizations to arise independently. Egyptian civilization followed prehistoric Egypt and coalesced around 3150 BC (according to conventional Egyptian chronology) with the political unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under the first pharaoh Narmer (commonly referred to as Menes). The history of ancient Egypt occurred in a series of stable kingdoms, separated by periods of relative instability known as Intermediate Periods: the Old Kingdom of the Early Bronze Age, the Middle Kingdom of the Middle Bronze Age and the New Kingdom of the Late Bronze Age. - Damascus (' ) is the capital and likely the largest city of Syria, following the decline in population of Aleppo due to the ongoing battle for the city. It is commonly known in Syria as \\"ash-Sham\\" (') and nicknamed as the \\"City of Jasmine\\" (\\"\\"). In addition to being one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world, Damascus is a major cultural and religious centre of the Levant. The city has an estimated population of 1,711,000 . - Aleppo (/ ALA-LC: \\"\\") is a city in Syria, serving as the capital of the Aleppo Governorate, the most populous Syrian governorate. With an official population of 2,132,100 (2004 census), Aleppo was the largest Syrian city before the Syrian Civil War; however, now Aleppo is likely the second-largest city in Syria after the capital Damascus. - Pharaoh is the common title of the monarchs of ancient Egypt from the First Dynasty (c. 3150) until the Macedonian conquest in 305 BC, although the actual term \\"Pharaoh\\" was not used contemporaneously for a ruler until circa 1200 BCE. - Egypt (; ', , \\"Kimi\\"), officially the Arab Republic of Egypt, is a transcontinental country spanning the northeast corner of Africa and southwest corner of Asia by a land bridge formed by the Sinai Peninsula. Egypt is a Mediterranean country bordered by the Gaza Strip and Israel to the northeast, the Gulf of Aqaba to the east, the Red Sea to the east and south, Sudan to the south, and Libya to the west. Across the Gulf of Aqaba lies Jordan, and across from the Sinai Peninsula lies Saudi Arabia, although Jordan and Saudi Arabia do not share a land border with Egypt. It is the world's only contiguous Afrasian nation. - The Jordan River (also River Jordan; \\"Nahar ha-Yarden\\"; \\"Nahr al-Urdun\\", Ancient Greek: , \\"Iordànes\\") is a -long river in the Middle East that flows roughly north to south through the Sea of Galilee and on to the Dead Sea. Israel and the West Bank border the river to the west, while the Golan Heights and Jordan lie to its east. Both Jordan and the West Bank take their names from the river. - The Amarna letters (sometimes referred to as the Amarna correspondence or Amarna tablets) are an archive, written on clay tablets, primarily consisting of diplomatic correspondence between the Egyptian administration and its representatives in Canaan and Amurru during the New Kingdom. The letters were found in Upper Egypt at Amarna, the modern name for the ancient Egyptian capital of \\"Akhetaten\\" (el-Amarna), founded by pharaoh Akhenaten (1350s 1330s BC) during the Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt. The Amarna letters are unusual in Egyptological research, because they are mostly written in Akkadian cuneiform, the writing system of ancient Mesopotamia, rather than that of ancient Egypt. The known tablets total 382: 24 tablets had been recovered since the Norwegian Assyriologist Jørgen Alexander Knudtzon's landmark edition of the Amarna letters, \\"Die El-Amarna-Tafel\\", published in two volumes (1907 and 1915). The written correspondence spans a period of at most thirty years. - Bashan (\\"ha-Bashan\\"; or Basanitis) is a biblical place first mentioned in , where it is said that King Chedorlaomer and his confederates \\"smote the Rephaim in Ashteroth\\", where Og the king of Bashan had his residence. At the time of the Israelites entrance into the Promised Land, Og came out against them, but was utterly routed. Bashan extended from Gilead in the south to Hermon in the north, and from the Jordan river on the west to Salcah on the east. Along with the half of Gilead it was given to the half-tribe of Manasseh. Golan, one of its cities, became a Levitical city and a city of refuge. - Syria, officially known as the Syrian Arab Republic (\\"\\"), is a country in Western Asia, bordering Lebanon and the Mediterranean Sea to the west, Turkey to the north, Iraq to the east, Jordan to the south, and Israel to the southwest. Syria's capital and largest city is Damascus. - Amarna is an extensive Egyptian archaeological site that represents the remains of the capital city newly established and built by the Pharaoh Akhenaten of the late Eighteenth Dynasty, and abandoned shortly after his death (1332 BC). The name for the city employed by the ancient Egyptians is written as Akhetaten (or Akhetatontransliterations vary) in English transliteration. Akhetaten means \\"Horizon of the Aten\\". - Aten (also Aton, Egyptian \\"jtn\\") is the disk of the sun in ancient Egyptian mythology, and originally an aspect of the god Ra. The deified Aten is the focus of the religion of Atenism established by Amenhotep IV, who later took the name Akhenaten (died ca. 1335 BCE) in worship and recognition of Aten. In his poem \\"Great Hymn to the Aten\\", Akhenaten praises Aten as the creator, giver of life, and nurturing spirit of the world. Aten does not have a Creation Myth or family, but is mentioned in the Book of the Dead. The worship of Aten was eradicated by Horemheb.

Regrettably, our expectations were not met – in fact, they were entirely shattered. I feel compelled to share our negative experience in order to alert potential patrons who might be misled by the restaurant's seemingly glowing reputation. The first issue arose when we entered the establishment. Despite having made a reservation well in advance, we were kept waiting for 45 minutes before being seated. There was a clear lack of communication between the host and the wait staff, resulting in a perplexing and aggravating delay. Once seated, the unpalatable nature of our evening continued. It took an additional 25 minutes for our waitress to greet us and take our order, all while we observed her chatting with other staff members. Her demeanor was not only unprofessional, but also dismissive and curt while taking our orders. As for the food itself, it left much to be desired. Despite being touted as a \\"must-try\\" dish, my steak was severely overcooked and lacked the tenderness and juiciness typically associated with prime cuts. My wife's vegetarian lasagna, which had been highly recommended by the waitress, consisted of undercooked pasta, bland sauce, and was barely warm upon arrival. We were thoroughly disappointed with the quality, flavor, and presentation of the meals that had been so highly praised by others. It would be remiss of me not to mention the noise level in the establishment. The ambience was far from what one would expect in a fine dining restaurant. The noise was so overpowering that my family and I could scarcely hold a conversation during dinner. While some excitement and bustle are not uncommon in popular restaurants, The Gourmet Bistro's patrons had to practically shout to be heard, severely detracting from an enjoyable dining experience. In conclusion, our visit to The Gourmet Bistro was anything but the memorable and delightful evening we had anticipated. The long waiting time for both a table and our orders, lackluster service, subpar food quality, and unconducive noise level combined to create a thoroughly disappointing experience. In light of this, I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this restaurant to others, and my family and I will certainly not be returning."},{"question":"Available options: (a). Yes; (b).

Choices: - strong planetary fields - weak gravitational fields - strong magnetic fields - strong gravitational fields A: A:","response":"Strong gravitational fields are capable of altering the rate of time passing. This phenomenon is a consequence of the general theory of relativity established by Albert Einstein more than a century ago. The general theory of relativity allows us to understand the relationships between space, time, and gravity, and how these factors are interconnected. In simple terms, general relativity states that gravity is a result of mass curving spacetime. Objects with mass create a curvature in spacetime, which affects the motion of other objects. Furthermore, time dilation is an effect predicted by this theory, where the passage of time is influenced by the strength of the gravitational field. This means that time passes at different rates depending on the experienced strength of the gravitational field. When an object is subjected to a strong gravitational field, the rate of time is altered compared to a weaker gravitational field. In a strong gravitational field, time passes slower than in a weaker field. This effect has been experimentally observed and confirmed through multiple experiments. One such example is the Hafele-Keating experiment, which involved atomic clocks flown around the Earth on commercial aircraft. The results showed a difference in the time measured, according to the predictions of general relativity. To better understand why strong gravitational fields can alter the rate of time passing, consider a hypothetical twin scenario. Imagine two twins, one living on Earth and the other in a spaceship orbiting close to a massive celestial object, such as a black hole. The gravitational field strength around a black hole is immense compared to Earth. As a result, the twin in the spaceship will experience a slower passage of time, meaning they will age at a slower rate compared to their sibling on Earth. When the space-traveling twin returns to our planet years later, they will have aged less than their Earth-bound counterpart. In summary, strong gravitational fields are capable of altering the rate of time passing due to the phenomena predicted by the general theory of relativity. Gravitational time dilation occurs as mass bends spacetime and influences the passage of time. As such, time passes slower in strong gravitational fields than in weak gravitational fields. This effect has been experimentally validated and confirms that time is not entirely constant and universal as it interacts with gravity."},{"question":"Sentence 1: Impossible! I exclaimed.

In classical mechanics, the position and velocity of an object can be precisely measured simultaneously. However, as we delve into the subatomic realm, particles like electrons no longer follow the same classical rules. This mystery was first described by the German physicist Werner Heisenberg in 1927, and it became known as the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. This principle states that it is fundamentally impossible to know both the exact position and the exact velocity of an electron at the same time. The reason for this limit in our knowledge is not due to the inadequacy of our measuring devices, but rather an inherent aspect of the electron's behavior. When we try to measure an electron's position very accurately, we have to interact with it. The act of interacting with the electron causes it to be disturbed, thus changing its momentum (mass times velocity). The more accurately we try to measure its position, the more we disturb its momentum. This relationship between position and momentum uncertainty can be represented mathematically using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle equation: Δx * Δp ≥ h/4π, where Δx is the uncertainty in position, Δp is the uncertainty in momentum, and h is the Planck's constant. This inequality shows that when the uncertainty in one variable is reduced, the uncertainty in the other variable increases, and their product can never be smaller than the Planck's constant divided by 4π. This constant is incredibly small at the quantum level but still has significant implications in our understanding of the subatomic world. Ultimately, the answer to the question of why it is not possible to tell the exact position and velocity of an electron simultaneously is because of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which is a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics and the nature of subatomic particles."},{"question":"The exercise is to decide whether the question accepts the proposed suggestion as a correct answer.

The films portray the Griswold family's outrageous road trips, filled with mishaps and humor, which have delighted audiences since the original film's release in 1983. The company behind the production of these films is, in fact, National Lampoon, a well-regarded media company with its roots in the satirical National Lampoon magazine. The company was founded in 1969 by a group of Harvard University graduates, including Doug Kenney, Henry Beard, and Robert Hoffman. Since then, National Lampoon has been known for producing witty and irreverent content, encompassing both print and film media. Over the years, the National Lampoon brand has become synonymous with the comedic misadventures of the Griswold family. The original film, \\"National Lampoon's Vacation\\" (1983), was inspired by an article titled \\"Vacation '58,\\" written by John Hughes for National Lampoon magazine. Following the immense success of the first film, National Lampoon's Vacation film series grew to encompass a number of sequels, including \\"National Lampoon's European Vacation\\" (1985), \\"National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation\\" (1989), \\"Vegas Vacation\\" (1997), and the more recent film simply titled \\"Vacation\\" (2015). \\"Hotel Hell Vacation,\\" a 14-minute short film released in 2010, follows the Griswolds as they embark on another comedic road trip adventure. This particular film was produced as part of a promotional campaign for the popular vacation rental website, HomeAway. Despite being sanctioned by National Lampoon, the production of \\"Hotel Hell Vacation\\" was directly managed by HomeAway, who retained Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo to reprise their iconic roles as Clark and Ellen Griswold. Throughout the years, National Lampoon has played an integral role in shaping the narrative of the American comedic landscape, particularly through the endearing and unforgettable antics of the Griswold family.

Sugaring is the process of desiccating a food by first dehydrating it, then packing it with pure sugar. This sugar can be crystalline in the form of table or raw sugar, or it can be a high sugar density liquid such as honey, syrup or molasses. The purpose of sugaring is to create an environment hostile to microbial life and prevent food spoilage. Sugaring is commonly used to preserve fruits as well as vegetables such as ginger. From time to time sugaring has also been used for non-food preservations. For example, honey was used as part of the mummification process in some ancient Egyptian rites. A risk in sugaring is that sugar itself attracts moisture. Once a sufficient moisture level is reached, native yeast in the environment will come out of dormancy and begin to ferment the sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide. This leads to the process of fermentation. Although fermentation can be used as a food preservation method, it must be intentionally controlled, or the results will tend to be unpleasant. I am facing a new situation today: Peter decided to sugar mangoes, ginger, pineapples, peaches to preserve them for next spring. He also bought blueberries and raspberries to eat fresh. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which fruit had a lower sugar content, mangoes or blueberries? Answer:","response":"Based on the background article, sugaring is used as a food preservation method where the food is packed with pure sugar to create an environment hostile to microbial life. However, the article does not directly provide any information on the sugar content of mangoes and blueberries. To answer the question \\"Which fruit has a lower sugar content, mangoes or blueberries?\\", we would need to look beyond the information available in the article and examine the natural sugar content of these two fruits. Mangoes are tropical fruits known for their sweetness and juicy pulp. They contain natural sugars like sucrose, fructose, and glucose. On average, a medium-sized mango (around 200 grams) contains approximately 45 grams of sugar. Blueberries, on the other hand, are small, round berries that are generally less sweet compared to mangoes. They are rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, and they also contain natural sugars such as fructose, glucose, and traces of sucrose. A 200-gram serving of blueberries (approximately equal in weight to the medium-sized mango) contains about 30 grams of sugar. Comparing the sugar content of the two fruits, we can conclude that blueberries have a lower sugar content than mangoes. It is essential to keep in mind that this information is not directly available in the background article, and the natural sugar content of fruits is distinct from the sugar content involved in the sugaring process mentioned in the article."},{"question":"Question: \\"Lakes and rivers are made of?\\" Context: \\"As a result of the magnitude 7.9 earthquake and the many strong aftershocks, many rivers became blocked by large landslides, which resulted in the formation of \\"quake lakes\\" behind the blockages; these massive amounts of water were pooling up at a very high rate behind the natural landslide dams and it was feared that the blockages would eventually crumble under the weight of the ever-increasing water mass, potentially endangering the lives of millions of people living downstream.

Becky Barrow. PUBLISHED:. 18:34 EST, 1 October 2012. |. UPDATED:. 19:02 EST, 1 October 2012. The pensions revolution affecting up to 11million workers began yesterday. It is the biggest shake-up of pensions for more than a century and was hailed by ministers as ‘a truly radical social change’. For the first time, every boss will be forced to pay into a pension for their workers, who will be automatically signed up to the scheme. Pensions Minister Steve Webb, pictured, said the start of auto-enrolment, whereby for the first time every boss will be forced to pay into a pension for their workers, is a 'major milestone' Yesterday the first workers were ‘enrolled’ into the new pension schemes, with around 800,000 expected to be signed up before Christmas. Most workers aged between 22 and state pension age who are not members of a pension scheme will be signed up to a pension by their boss, known as automatic enrolment. Only the lowest earners, whose annual salary is £8,105 or less, will be exempted from the scheme. Workers who are auto-enrolled will join either a company scheme or the National Employment Savings Trust, known as NEST. At present, the majority of private sector workers do not put any money into a pension. If they do have a pension pot, it is worth an average of just £26,000. Under the new scheme, if a 30-year-old saved £50 a month, the pot would be worth around £90,000 at the age of 65, if the fund grew by 7 per cent a year. A £90,000 pension pot buys a 65-year-old man a pension of about £4,850 per year. A £26,000 pot buys an annual pension of about £1,500. The scheme was suggested by Lord Turner in 2005 when he was asked by the Labour government to try to solve Britain’s pensions crisis, but the launch has been a long time coming. Pensions Minister Steve Webb said yesterday that the start of auto-enrolment represents ‘a major milestone’ for workers as well as the Government’s attempt to solve the crisis. ‘Few policies affect as many people and this will be a truly radical social change,’ he said. Under the new scheme, if a 30-year-old saved £50 a month, the pot would be worth around £90,000 at the age of 65. ‘I’m determined to make sure that pensions are no longer seen as the preserve of the few.’ He said it made a break from many other Government reforms which he described as ‘just awful and horrible’. Mr Webb hailed the shake-up as the biggest pensions revolution since state pensions were introduced by a 1908 Act of Parliament. The CBI, Britain’s biggest business lobby group, said it is the start of ‘a new dawn for pension savers’ which it said will ‘tackle the ticking retirement time bomb’. Workers will pay into their pension – but so will their boss and the Government will also make its own contribution through tax relief. Contributions will begin low but will rise to 4 per cent of salary from workers, 3 per cent from their boss and 1 per cent from tax relief in October 2018, making a total of 8 per cent of salary. Workers will have the right to opt out immediately if they do not want to save into a pension for whatever reason, but bosses have no right to encourage, or even force, them to opt out. The Government admits it expects around a third of workers will opt out, with many expected to say they simply cannot afford to save at the current time. Britain’s biggest companies will be the first to enrol their workers, a process which began yesterday, followed by smaller businesses over the next six years. In October, around 380,000 workers will be signed up, followed by a further 420,000 in November, and workers will continue to be signed up over the next few years. Between February and May next year, around 6.5million will be automatically enrolled. Nobody can escape, from Tesco having to enrol workers who are not currently in the supermarket’s pension scheme to a couple who employ a nanny to look after their young children. An advertising campaign featuring TV stars such as Theo Paphitis and Nick Hewer was launched recently to raise awareness of the shake-up. Stephen Gay, director of savings at the Association of British Insurers, said: ‘Automatic enrolment is an opportunity not to be missed. ‘It cannot be stressed enough how important it is to save for retirement. ‘The fact that we are living longer is great, but we can no longer have our heads in the sand about how we fund our income in retirement. ‘The state pension is a foundation, but most people need more and the earlier people start to save the easier they will find it to build enough savings for their later life.’ The shake-up comes after official figures showed the number of private sector workers with a company pension scheme has collapsed to its lowest level since records began in 1953. Of the country’s 23.9million private sector workers, only 2.9million are paying into a company pension scheme. At their peak in 1967, there were 8.1million members. Highlights:","response":"1.

Doctors say that body contact is a kind of medicine that can work wonders. When people are touched, the quantity of hemoglobin -a type of matter that produces the red color in blood increases greatly. This results in more oxygen reaching every part of the body and the whole body benefits. In experiments, bottle-fed baby monkeys were separated from their mothers for the first ten days of life. They became sad and negative. Studies showed the monkeys were more probable to become ill than other babies that were allowed to stay with their mothers. Human babies react in much the same way. Some years ago, a scientist noticed that some well-fed babies in a clean nursery became weak. Yet babies in another nursery were growing healthily, even though they ate less well and were not kept as clean. The reason, he concluded, was that they often had touches from nurses. Experiments show that most people like being touched. And nearly all doctors believe touch helps to reduce patients' fear of treatment. Of course there is time when a touch is not welcome. But even if we don't like being touched, a smile can make us feel better. Smiling increases blood flow and starts the production of \\"happy brain\\" chemicals.

According to the passage provided, body contact, such as touching someone's arm or holding their hand, can have positive effects on a person's happiness, health, and productivity. The article mentions that increased hemoglobin levels lead to increased oxygen supply throughout the body, resulting in various benefits. It also describes experiments involving baby monkeys and human babies, where those receiving touch seemed to be healthier and happier than those who did not. However, the passage acknowledges that not everyone likes being touched, and there are times when touch might not be welcome. Even in such cases, a smile can have a positive impact on a person, as it increases blood flow and triggers the production of \\"happy brain\\" chemicals."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: If pollination is the fertilization step in something that is healthy when clean, then pollination is the fertilization step in something that is healthy when what? Answer choices: - made - autumn - Summer - edible - clean - flowers - small - seeds A:","response":"Pollination is the fertilization step in something that is healthy when clean. This enigmatic statement leads to the understanding that pollination has a major role to play in maintaining the good health of the subject matter when it is in a clean state. For deciphering the analogy presented in the question, we need to scrutinize each answer choice and see which one comes closest to the meaning conveyed by the statement. - Made: This answer choice doesn't offer a clear relationship with the cleanliness and health aspect mentioned in the question. Manufacturing or construction doesn't necessarily correlate with cleanliness and health. - Autumn: Autumn is a season, making it unrelated to the healthiness or cleanliness of an object or process. Seasons might have an impact on pollination or health, but they don't inherently represent health when clean. - Summer: Similar to Autumn, Summer is a season and doesn't inherently represent health or cleanliness. It is not a fitting answer choice for drawing an analogy with pollination being the fertilization step. - Edible: The answer choice \\"edible\\" establishes a connection with cleanliness and healthiness. In the context of food, being clean and healthy when edible is crucial. In this scenario, pollination could be analogous to a process that contributes to the cleanliness and health of edible items, by ensuring their proper growth and development. - Clean: The statement itself involves cleanliness, which makes it a redundant answer choice. - Flowers: Pollination indeed plays a significant role in the health and reproduction of flowering plants. However, the analogy of \\"healthy when clean\\" does not apply directly to flowers, so this isn't the best fitting answer choice. - Small: The size – small – doesn't convey a clear relationship with health and cleanliness, making it an unsuitable answer choice. - Seeds: Seeds are essential in the reproduction and propagation of plants, and their development is heavily dependent on pollination. However, the expression \\"healthy when clean\\" isn't directly applicable. In conclusion, the answer choice \\"edible\\" emerges as the most suitable candidate. To phrase this analogy: Pollination is the fertilization step in something that is healthy when clean, then pollination is the fertilization step in something that is healthy when edible. This suggests that pollination is a crucial process that contributes to the cleanliness and healthiness of edible items by ensuring their proper growth and development."},{"question":"How does one make the switch from C++ to Java?

Mary preferred to use the toaster to warm her bread and not the microwave because the 1). toaster was broken.; 2). microwave was broken.;","response":"Mary preferred to use the toaster to warm her bread and not the microwave because the toaster provided a number of advantages that suited her personal preferences and needs better than the microwave would have been able to. The toaster was not only a more efficient appliance for warming bread, but also produced better results in terms of texture and taste, which played a significant role in her decision-making process. To begin with, the toaster is specifically designed for the purpose of toasting bread, which makes it a more suitable option for Mary. Unlike the microwave, which operates by heating water molecules inside the food, a toaster utilizes heating elements that evenly toast the bread on both sides. This results in a crispy, golden-brown toast that boasts a combination of crunchy and soft textures that many people find appealing. Furthermore, using a toaster to warm bread often retains and enhances the flavor of the bread, maintaining a desirable aroma that is not always present when using a microwave. Microwaves, on the other hand, tend to cause bread to become soggy and chewy, instead of nicely browned and crisp. Moreover, toasters consume less energy than microwaves when it comes to warming bread. Since toasters are designed specifically for this task, they utilize their heating elements efficiently and quickly provide the desired outcome. Microwaves, however, would need more time to heat up bread evenly. This difference in energy consumption may be a key determinant for Mary when she needs to use her appliances economically. Additionally, Mary might have a toaster with various settings that allow her to customize the degree of toasting or warming she would like for her bread. With these settings, she can achieve the perfect hue and texture that she finds appetizing. The microwave may not necessarily provide the same level of control as a toaster, and hence, she prefers the latter. Lastly, using a toaster is more convenient and time-saving for Mary. She can simply insert the bread into the toaster, set the desired toasting level, and it will automatically pop up when the toasting is complete. A microwave, on the other hand, would require her to monitor the bread's progress and perhaps even flip it, which could result in uneven heating. In conclusion, Mary's preference for using the toaster instead of the microwave to warm her bread can be attributed to a mixture of factors: the toaster's efficiency and efficacy in toasting bread, the appealing texture and taste it provides, the optimized energy consumption, the customizability of settings, and the convenience it offers in the process of warming bread. These reasons outweigh the advantages of using a microwave, making the toaster the clear winner in this scenario."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Pick the option in line with common sense to answer the question.

He was instrumental in securing the \\"high ambition coalition\\" of rich and poor countries that was pivotal to a deal in the French capital. Mr De Brum died at his home in Majuro, the capital of the Marshall Islands. Born near the end of WWII, Mr De Brum grew up in an era when the tiny Pacific state was being used to host a number of US nuclear bomb tests. When he was nine years old he witnessed one such detonation, while fishing with his grandfather around 200 miles away. The resulting destruction of the atolls, the evacuation of many islanders as a result of the atomic tests became a hotly contested political issue. The islander's push for independence and compensation played a large part in Tony De Brum's political awakening. As one of the Islands' first university graduates, Mr De Brum was heavily involved in the negotiations with the US that resulted in an agreement on independence and compensation signed in 1986. However it was the threat of rising seas and a changing climate became the key issues of his time as a Marshall Islands foreign minister. In the Paris climate negotiations, his warm, personal and relaxed style was very much in contrast to the stiffer, greyer faces of some teams. He used his charm to build strong personal relationships with many of the political leaders from rich and poor countries alike. This helped create the \\"coalition of high ambition,\\" a group that ultimately involved around 100 nations, including the US, the EU, African, Caribbean and island states. This alliance of rich and poor proved critical in pushing the deal through. The biggest win from Mr De Brum's perspective, was that the Paris agreement committed to the goal of keeping global temperature increases close to 1.5C - \\"1.5 to stay alive,\\" was a phrase often used by Mr De Brum. Tributes to the former minister have been led by the Marshall Islands' President Hilda Heine. \\"The very existence of the Paris Climate Agreement owes a lot to Tony De Brum,\\" she wrote in a statement. \\"He was a giant of history, a legend in every meaning of the world and a custodian of our shared future.\\" Others took to Twitter to extend their sympathies.

The PM attended the main celebration in Guildford, where a service was held at the cathedral. Security at the events was heightened after attacks in Tunisia, France and Kuwait on Friday. The Sun also reported that so-called Islamic State had planned to target a parade in Merton, South London. The newspaper said IS had plotted to detonate a pressure cooker bomb, but the plot failed after it informed police and security services. Police did not confirm the Sun's report but said it was \\"helpful\\" when journalists shared information that could indicate terrorist activity. Speaking in Guildford, Mr Cameron said: \\"Today, we celebrate our brave servicemen and women who work so hard to keep our country safe.\\" Defence Secretary Michael Fallon and Vice Chief of the Defence Staff Air Chief Marshal Sir Stuart Peach also attended the event. The Duke of York took the salute on the parade route on behalf of the Queen and Royal Family, as the Red Arrows staged a flypast. More than 150 events took place across the country to mark the seventh annual celebration. Mr Fallon told the BBC Armed Forces Day was a \\"huge opportunity to salute the armed forces for the service and the sacrifice they make on behalf of us all and also to pay tribute to families who support them\\". Earlier the PM chaired an emergency Cobra meeting to look at the UK's response to the attack in Tunisia. At least five Britons have been confirmed dead by the Foreign Office following the attack on Friday, but Mr Cameron warned the public must be prepared for a high British death toll. The Tunisian health ministry said eight Britons had been identified among the dead. Following the Cobra meeting Mr Cameron said: \\"Let's be clear. There's no doubt we face a very severe threat in our country and we have done for many months and many years. \\"But today is about paying tribute to our armed forces and their families who do so much to keep us safe and we should proceed with those events.\\" Meanwhile, the Sun reported that an IS leader in Syria unwittingly recruited an undercover investigator from the newspaper to carry out the attack in Merton. The Sun described the alleged plot as a \\"suicide\\" attack, saying IS was intending to strike soldiers from the unit of murdered soldier Lee Rigby. It alleged an IS leader, who it said was originally from Birmingham, told the investigator: \\"It will be big. We will hit the kuffar (unbelievers) hard InshAllah. Hit their soldiers in their own land.\\" The Merton parade was to be targeted because it was closest to the barracks in Woolwich where Fusilier Rigby, was murdered in May 2013, the newspaper said. Fusiliers from his regiment were to be among some 250 marchers, it added. A Scotland Yard spokesman said: \\"The police, together with our security partners, remain alert to terrorist threats that may manifest here or where individuals overseas may seek to direct or inspire others to commit attacks in and against the UK. \\"It is always helpful when journalists share with us information, as The Sun did in this case, that could indicate terrorist or criminal activity.\\" Summary:","response":"A big celebration was held for our brave servicemen and women, and everyone was extra careful to keep everyone safe after some recent attacks in different countries."},{"question":"I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

However, there is no report about the role of PPARgamma on differentiation of mast cells from the progenitors. In this study, we investigated the role of PPARgamma in regulating bone marrow-derived mast cell maturation and the therapeutic implications for mast cell-related diseases such as atopic or contact dermatitis.', 'We used in vitro cell culture system for mast cell differentiation from bone marrow-progenitors using specific ligands and lentiviral-mediated short hairpin RNA of PPARgamma, and in vivo murine dermatitis models.', 'Activation of PPARgamma inhibited the maturation of bone marrow progenitors into connective tissue-type mast cells (CTMCs) through up-regulation of GATA-4 and GATA-6 resulting in a decrease in expression of histidine decarboxylase and mast cell histamine content. In comparison, the differentiation of bone marrow progenitors into CTMCs was significantly accelerated by the knockdown of PPARgamma expression by lentiviral-mediated short hairpin RNA. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma ligand administration to mice inhibited the maturation of mast cells resulting in attenuation of atopic and contact dermatitis via diminishment of the number of mature mast cells.Question: Does activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma suppress mast cell maturation involved in allergic diseases?

It is a special case of a trapezoid. Alternatively, it can be defined as a trapezoid in which both legs and both base angles are of the same measure. Note that a non-rectangular parallelogram is not an isosceles trapezoid because of the second condition, or because it has no line of symmetry. In any isosceles trapezoid two opposite sides (the bases) are parallel, and the two other sides (the legs) are of equal length (properties shared with the parallelogram). The diagonals are also of equal length. The base angles of an isosceles trapezoid are equal in measure (there are in fact two pairs of equal base angles, where one base angle is the supplementary angle of a base angle at the other base). Answer this question, making sure that the answer is supported by the text: are the bases of a trapezoid always parallel? Choose your answer from: 1). no. 2). yes.","response":"Imagine a shape with four sides, kind of like a box that's been squished a little bit. This shape is called an isosceles trapezoid. In this squished box, the top and bottom sides are called bases, and they are always straight like train tracks, which means they are parallel. The other two sides are called legs, and they are always the same length, like your two legs! So the answer is: 2). yes, the bases of a trapezoid are always parallel."},{"question":"Given the question: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: What do you think of black cats? Are they unluckier than cats of other colors? Many people in Western countries think so. Scientists at the University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley), did a study on cat colours and people's understandings of cat personalities. The study found that people do judge cat personalities by color. Scientists did a survey on the Internet. There were 49 statements matching five cat colorings with 10 personalities. People think orange and bi-coloured cats are friendly, tri-coloured cats are not generous, and white cats are calm, lazy and shy. As for black cats, people think they don't have special personalities. But why do so many people dislike keeping black cats as pets? People think black cats have less special personalities, which might be because of their bad reputation . They think black cats may bring bad luck, especially at Halloween. Movies and television shows also make people believe that. Although people have these ideas, UC Berkeley scientists give another reason: people don't think black cats are pretty enough. After all, nothing can show black cats are unluckier than other cats. \\"You can't judge a cat by its colour, because it's the personality of the cat, not the colour, that will let you know if the cat is right for you,\\" Cathy Marden, a scientist said.

Does it follow that \\"Click to read the question, which is about a guy named Bill, said the website.\\"?","response":"It does not directly follow that \\"Click to read the question, which is about a guy named Bill, said the website,\\" because there is not enough context to fully understand the scenario. However, from the given context, we can infer that the question is related to a situation where two individuals named Bill had different outcomes in discouraging unwanted pursuit by a woman named Janet. To provide a detailed and long answer, let's dive deeper into possible reasons for the difference in outcomes. 1. Communication Style: One Bill might have been more effective in communicating his disinterest when encountering Janet's pursuit. Clear and direct communication is essential in these circumstances. This Bill may have expressed his lack of interest in a way that left no room for ambiguity, ensuring Janet would not persist with her pursuit. 2. Persistence: In contrast, the other Bill might have been less successful in discouraging Janet due to her persistence. Sometimes people do not take a hint or give up easily, leading to continued unwanted pursuit. 3. Personality Differences: People's personalities could have played a significant role in the effectiveness of each Bill's attempt to discourage Janet. One Bill's personality may have aligned more closely with Janet's, making it harder for her to let go of her pursuit, whereas the other Bill may have had a personality that clashed or did not resonate with Janet's, making it easier for her to accept his disinterest. 4. Initial Attraction Level: The level of initial attraction could have influenced the effectiveness of each Bill's attempt to discourage Janet. The Bill who was initially less attractive to Janet might have had an easier time convincing her to relinquish her pursuit, while the other Bill, who was more attractive to Janet, may have had a harder time getting her to back off. 5. Social Circle and Environment: Different social environments and the presence or absence of mutual friends can also impact the effectiveness of discouraging unwanted pursuit. One Bill may have been in a social setting where it was easier to avoid or navigate away from Janet's pursuit, while the other Bill could have found himself consistently in close proximity to Janet due to overlapping social circles or other factors. 6. Timing: Timing can play a crucial role in the success of discouraging unwanted pursuit. One Bill may have communicated his disinterest at an opportune time when Janet was more emotionally equipped to handle the rejection, while the other Bill may have expressed his disinterest when Janet was more vulnerable or emotionally invested, making it difficult for her to accept and move on. In conclusion, it does not follow directly that \\"Click to read the question, which is about a guy named Bill, said the website,\\" as the context provided is limited. However, based on the context given, we can hypothesize that there are various factors, such as communication style, personality differences, initial attraction level, social environment, and timing, that have influenced the success of each Bill's attempts to discourage unwanted pursuit by Janet."},{"question":"Premise: A man in a hat is walking in a city while looking to the left.

But if you ask a doctor, he can see a whole lot more. Everything from poor diet and stress to serious kidney problems can be revealed by a glance at your fingernails. There are about 30 different nail signs that can be associated with medical issues, though may indicate more than one problem, according to Dr.Amy Derick, a clinical instructor of dermatology at Northwestern University. Here are five of the things a doctor can tell about your health based on your fingernails. 1. People who aren't eating well and lack vitamin or dietary may have thinner than normal nails, which are more likely to break. 2.Horizontal lines are associated with serious physical stress. They frequently occur in people who have gone through chemotherapy .They can also occur after some illnesses, injuries, or with severe malnourishment .Interestingly, there may be an altitude connection too. They've also been found in people who dove 1,000 feet and others who participated in an Everest exploration. 3. Vertical lines, however, are generally not such a big deal. Some people are more genetically prone to them than others, but they're commonly associated with aging. 4. When people lack iron, their nails can turn spoon-like. Instead of curving down and covering the finger normally, they 'll start to rise up on the sides and front, like the part of a spoon that holds liquid. 5. Kidney and liver problems can create \\"half-and-half nails\\", where one part of the nail is white and the other part dark or pink, according to Derick. Doctors note that because disease diagnosis is complex and some symptoms can be associated with different diseases, you should always see a medical professional if you are concerned about something you notice. What is the main idea of the passage? A) Doctors can tell us something about our health by looking at our nails. B) We should see a doctor if we find nails in bad condition. C) A famous doctor in the USA conducted an interesting research. D) If we don't want to get ill, we need to clean and stop biting our fingernails.

(Russell Brand) is intended to succeed his father, Mr. Bunny (Hugh Laurie), as the Easter Bunny. Intimidated by the calling's demands, E.B. runs away to Hollywood to pursue his dream of becoming a drummer. Mr. Bunny sends his three ninja royal guards, the Pink Berets, to find his son. Meanwhile, Easter Chicks Carlos and Phil (Hank Azaria) plot a coup d'état against Mr. Bunny to take over the Easter organization. Wandering through Van Nuys, E.B. is hit by Fred O'Hare (James Marsden), an out-of-work, job-hopping slacker (who is being pressured by his family to \\"get a job\\") who was driving to his sister Sam's (Kaley Cuoco) boss's house he's housesitting.

The presence of the Holy Ghost in the poem's final moments may indeed hint at notions of salvation or divine intervention. This particular image combines elements of spirituality with industrial growth, showcasing a potential connection between the force of divine presence and the challenges humanity faces in a rapidly evolving environment. The portrayal of the sky as \\"brown\\" represents the consequences of human industrialization and emphasizes the impact of human actions on the environment. The Holy Ghost emerging from this setting suggests that even in the darkest and most challenging times, God's presence is still ever-present. Although the ending of the poem highlights the Holy Ghost's appearance and power, it is vital to remember that a single image, no matter how compelling, does not necessarily dictate the entirety of a poem's meaning. Poetry is an art form that often employs multiple themes, images, and emotions, inviting the reader to explore various interpretations. In this light, the poem's message might not be limited only to ideas of salvation, but could also address themes such as humanity's relationship with nature, the impact of human progress on the environment, and the hope for a better future. By examining the rest of the poem, we might uncover additional insights into its thematic richness. For instance, we could explore the poem's structure and how it affects the overarching narrative. Furthermore, we should consider other central images and symbols employed by the poet, as these too could contribute to a more profound understanding of the work's meaning. By acknowledging the full range of the poem's content and construction, we stand a better chance of drawing a well-rounded conclusion. In summary, while the final image of the Holy Ghost in the poem certainly holds significance, it does not exclusively define the poem as being about \\"the Holy Ghost saving people.\\" To make such a claim, one must thoroughly analyze the entire poem, examining its linguistic choices, imagery, themes, and structure in detail. Ultimately, poetry is a complex and layered medium that often projects multiple ideas and stimulates diverse interpretations."},{"question":"Given those answer options, answer the question: Title: Great Fun Review: Outstanding Films.

California's Proposition 64, which is leading in the polls, could create a multibillion-dollar marijuana industry by legalizing the recreational use the drug for adults in the state. Similar measures are on the ballot in Arizona, Nevada, Maine and Massachusetts. Marijuana could be legalized for medical use in Florida and three other states. Medical marijuana is already permitted in half the 50 U.S. states, and recreational use is allowed in Alaska, Colorado, Washington state, Oregon and the District of Columbia. Marijuana is banned under federal law, but U.S. officials have taken a hands-off approach on the issue.

A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization). Palindromes have been of interest to linguists, mathematicians, and recreational puzzle enthusiasts for many centuries. The palindrome \\"A man a plan a canal Panama\\" was attributed to Leigh Mercer, a British wordplay expert, and first appeared in the November 13, 1948, issue of \\"Notes and Queries,\\" a scholarly journal for the discussion of historical and etymological topics. This particular palindrome is remarkable because of its length, coherence, and historical significance. The phrase itself references the construction of the Panama Canal, an artificial waterway that connects the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The canal's construction was a challenging and ambitious project, involving many people, notably the French engineer Ferdinand de Lesseps and the American President Theodore Roosevelt, as well as a significant amount of planning and engineering expertise. A closer look at the palindrome reveals a logical progression of ideas that makes it more meaningful than many other examples of palindromes, which are often nonsensical or purely pattern-based: - \\"A man\\" can represent the individuals responsible for the canal's creation, such as the aforementioned visionaries, politicians, and engineers. - \\"A plan\\" signifies the immense strategic efforts and various planning phases involved in such an ambitious endeavor. - \\"A canal\\" denotes the actual physical construction and existence of the Panama Canal. - \\"Panama\\" is the geographical location where the canal was built, a vital link between two major oceans. Given this context, \\"A man a plan a canal Panama\\" is not only an impressive palindrome but also a succinct summary of the significant human effort required to make the Panama Canal a reality. In summary, the phrase \\"A man a plan a canal Panama\\" is a celebrated example of a palindrome, a linguistic construction that reads the same forward and backward. It provides a meaningful, albeit condensed, account of the Panama Canal's development and exemplifies the ingenuity and expertise of those behind its creation, making it a noteworthy example of playful yet purposeful language use."},{"question":"Instructions: In this task, you will use your knowledge about language (and common sense) to determine what element the marked number refers to.

Answer:","response":"The first step in the process of fossil formation, known as fossilization, typically begins with the death or deposition of an organism or its remains in a suitable environment that promotes preservation. This step is crucial in ensuring that the organism's remains have the best chance of undergoing the subsequent processes that ultimately lead to the creation of a fossil. There are several factors that contribute to a suitable environment and influence the chances of fossilization: 1. Rapid burial: Upon the death of an organism, its remains become susceptible to decay from exposure to elements, scavengers, or decomposition by microorganisms. In order to minimize the risk of destruction, rapid burial by sediments or other materials is essential. This may occur in various settings, such as riverbanks, lake bottoms, ocean floors, or sand dunes, where the remains can be quickly covered by sediments or other organic materials. 2. Anoxic conditions: The initial setting of burial plays a significant role in preserving the remains. In anoxic (or low-oxygen) conditions, the rate of decomposition is considerably slowed, allowing for the preservation of soft tissues in addition to hard parts such as bones, shells, or teeth. This can occur in deep oceanic environments, stagnant water bodies, or within certain types of sedimentary deposits. 3. Low-energy environment: A low-energy environment, meaning one where there is little physical disturbance due to water currents, wind, or other forces, is also important in promoting fossil preservation. Such an environment reduces the likelihood that the remains will be moved, damaged, or destroyed during the burial process, allowing for proper preservation. Some examples of low-energy environments include deep ocean floors, lagoons, or quiet lakes and ponds. 4. Geological stability: Over long periods, the remains of the organism must be protected from external forces to preserve their structural integrity. These external forces include factors such as erosion, tectonic activity, and extreme changes in temperature and pressure. Geological stability is necessary for maintaining the integrity of the remains as they gradually transform into fossils. 5. Early mineralization: In some cases, the early stages of fossilization can begin even before the organism is completely buried. This often occurs when the remains become infiltrated with mineral-rich waters that deposit minerals within the cellular structure of the organism, thus aiding the preservation and providing a scaffold for later stages of mineralization. In summary, the first step in the process of fossil formation often begins with the death or deposition of an organism or its remains in a suitable environment that promotes preservation, ensuring that the remains have the best chance of undergoing the subsequent processes leading to the creation of a fossil. Rapid burial, anoxic conditions, a low-energy environment, geological stability, and early mineralization all play a crucial role in this complex and fascinating process."},{"question":"Given the question: Pick the option in line with common sense to answer the question.

He has won 43 events on the PGA Tour, including five major championships: three Masters titles (2004, 2006, 2010), a PGA Championship (2005), and an Open Championship (2013). Mickelson is one of 16 players in the history of golf to win at least three of the four majors. He has won every major except the U.S. Open, where he has finished runner-up a record six times. Mickelson attended Arizona State University in Tempe on a golf scholarship and became the face of amateur golf in the United States, capturing three NCAA individual championships and three Haskins Awards (1990, 1991, 1992) as the outstanding collegiate golfer. With three individual NCAA championships, he shares the record for most individual NCAA championships alongside Ben Crenshaw. Mickelson also led the Sun Devils to the NCAA team title in 1990. Over the course of his collegiate career, he won 16 tournaments. Mickelson was the second collegiate golfer to earn first-team All-American honors all four years. In 1990, he also became the first with a left-handed swing to win the U.S. Amateur title. Mickelson secured perhaps his greatest achievement as an amateur in January 1991, winning his first PGA Tour event, the Northern Telecom Open, in Tucson. At age 20, he was only the sixth amateur to win a tour event and the first in over five years after Scott Verplank at the Western Open in August 1985. Other players to accomplish this feat include Doug Sanders (1956 Canadian Open) and Gene Littler (1954 San Diego Open). With five holes remaining, Mickelson led by a stroke, but made a triple-bogey and was then three behind. The leaders ahead of him then stumbled, and he birdied 16 and 18 to win by a stroke. To date, it is the most recent win by an amateur at a PGA Tour event. That April, Mickelson was the low amateur at the Masters Tournament in Augusta, Georgia. With his two-year PGA Tour exemption from the Tucson win, he played in several tour events in 1992 while an amateur but failed to make a cut. Ask a question about this article.","response":"Absolutely, little buddy! So this is all about a very good golfer named Phil Mickelson, but everyone calls him Lefty because he swings the club with his left hand. He's won a lot of golf games, including some really, really big ones. But there's one big game, called the U.S. Open, he hasn't won yet, even though he's come close many times. While he was still in college, studying and learning, he was also playing a lot of golf and he was really good at it. He even won a big golf game before he was all done with school, which is something not a lot of people can do. Even though he was still a student, he got to play in some professional golf games because he was really good. But he didn't win any of those games while he was still a student. Do you have any questions about Phil Mickelson, buddy?"},{"question":"Given the question: Information: - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe.

To do this, we'll move the constant term to the other side of the equation by adding 900 to both sides: 0 + 900 = -45*f + 900 This simplifies to: 900 = -45*f Step 3: Solve for f.

She loves her students very much, and she works hard. She often tells them some interesting stories in class and her students like her, too. Yesterday, Lucy found some boys always made faces in class. She didn't want them to do that again, so she got all her students together and said, \\"Boys and girls, when I was young, I liked making faces in class, too. But one day, my grandmother told me not to do that again. She said, 'If you make faces again, you will be ugly when you grow up.' So you shouldn't do that again.\\" Some students thought she was right, but some students didn't. One of the boys put up his hand. \\"Oh, Tom! What do you want to say?\\" asked Lucy.

However, I will attempt to provide a general understanding of the factors that may affect the rating of this review and possible areas of improvement. 1. Reviewer's Credibility - It is important to know who the reviewer is and if they have expertise in the relevant subject matter. Since we do not have any information about Parviz Sorkhabi, determining their credibility is not possible. 2. Context and Relevance - A review should offer insights and opinions relevant to the subject being reviewed. This could involve sharing personal experiences, comparing it to other cases, or analyzing its features. Unfortunately, this review only has a name and does not provide any context, making it impossible to assess its relevance. 3. Detail and Substance - A useful review typically contains specific information about a product or service, providing potential users with a better understanding of what they can expect. Once again, the given review does not have any substance or specific details about the subject. 4. Coherence and Clarity - Effective reviews are well-organized, making it easier for readers to understand the points being made. This review only has a name, so there is no structure or narrative required for assessing coherence and clarity. 5. Objectivity and Balance - A balanced review should present the positive and negative aspects of the subject, giving readers a comprehensive understanding of its pros and cons. However, the review in question does not provide any information to judge objectivity or balance. Based on these factors, the review \\"Parviz sorkhabi\\" would likely receive a rating of 1, as it is least favorable due to the lack of context, details, and any meaningful assessment of the subject. However, it is essential to note that this rating is primarily due to the insufficient information provided by the reviewer. Therefore, it may not accurately reflect the reviewer's intentions, as there may not be enough context to make an informed judgment about the item being reviewed."},{"question":"I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it.

Answer choices: - It used to be covered by water - exposure to cold - decrease in crop yields - greater food production - elimination of harmful pests - a tree falling - wind power increases - Damages them Answer:","response":"A possible negative effect of exposing soil to wind is a decrease in crop yields. This can occur due to a variety of reasons, such as soil erosion, loss of soil moisture, and reduced nutrient availability for plants. Wind exposure can contribute to soil particles being blown away, reducing the overall soil structure and making it less capable of retaining water and supporting healthy plant growth. Additionally, wind can cause evaporation of soil moisture, leading to drier conditions that make it more difficult for plants to access the water they need for optimal growth. Lastly, wind-blown soil may lead to a reduced availability of essential nutrients for plants, as nutrients can be blown away or unevenly distributed throughout the soil. All of these factors can result in a decrease in crop yields, potentially impacting food production and availability."},{"question":"Write a sentence that is about a restaurant with all the following properties: name = Blue Spice, food = Indian, priceRange = more than £30, area = riverside Sentence:","response":"The Blue Spice is a place by the river where we can eat yummy Indian food, but it costs more than £30, which is like having more than 30 coins to buy something."},{"question":"Premise: uh no probably south maybe Texas actually Hypothesis: The person discusses something about Texas.

If a program is waiting for the user to click on the mouse or press a key on the keyboard, then it will not take a \\"time slice\\" until the event it is waiting for has occurred. This frees up time for other programs to execute so that many programs may be run simultaneously without unacceptable speed loss.\\" Answer: Answer:","response":"When there is too much happening at once, especially in the context of a computer multitasking and running several programs simultaneously, the computer's performance and speed can be significantly affected. However, the impact on the system's speed might not be directly proportional to the number of programs running, as many programs spend much of their time waiting for slow input/output devices to complete their tasks. In situations where a program is waiting for the user interaction, such as a mouse click or a key press on the keyboard, the program will not consume a \\"time slice\\" or require significant processing power until the expected event occurs. Consequently, this allows other programs to execute and utilize the system resources more effectively. Nevertheless, when too much is happening at once, and multiple programs require a higher demand for processing power or system resources, the computer's performance may slow down. This slowdown can be due to: 1. Higher CPU usage: With multiple programs running simultaneously, the CPU may struggle to accommodate each program's processing demands, leading to reduced performance and slower execution times. 2. Insufficient RAM: The computer's RAM may not have the capacity to hold all the data required by the various programs and processes, causing some data to be temporarily stored in virtual memory on the hard drive, which impacts system performance. 3. Limited input/output bandwidth: When multiple applications seek to access the same input/output devices (such as the hard drive or network), the available bandwidth can become a bottleneck, limiting overall performance. 4. Increased overhead: As the computer manages more processes, the operating system and its kernel require additional resources to manage and allocate time slices amongst these programs efficiently. To mitigate these potential slowdown issues, modern operating systems employ various optimization strategies, such as prioritizing tasks and intelligently allocating resources. However, it is essential to understand that managing too much happening at once could still affect a computer's performance and speed, depending on the system's hardware capabilities and the specific programs being executed."},{"question":"Q:Franklin Area School District (FASD) is a rural public school system headquartered in Franklin Venango County located in western Pennsylvania.

What do you think Jen Aniston could possibly see in John Mayer? He's been drinking too much koo-koo-kool-aid in my book. Doesn't that seem like an odd match? -- Submitted during last week's Celebritology Live discussion Koo-koo-Koolaid or not, 30-year-old John Mayer seems to have an almost Lance Armstrong-esque ability to attract his choice of A-list (okay, maybe B) lady loves: Jennifer Love Hewitt, Jessica Simpson, Minka Kelly, among others. And, now, Hollywood untouchable Jennifer Aniston. Just last week, pictures of Mayer snogging with Aniston poolside in Miami hit the net with all the force of Brangelina baby bump shot. And not only is Mayer considered a jumbo-sized chick magnet, he apparently has the ability to love 'em and leave 'em, rendering his exes inconsolable: Last week, a drunken Jessica Simspon was rumored to have been removed from a Hollywood hotel bar on the same day the JenJohn (remember, you heard that portmanteau here first!) pix surfaced on the Web. Coincidence? Maybe. (Of course, Simpson's debauchery could also have been a reaction to rumors of a split from most recent boyfriend Tony Romo.) Is it, as pal Josh Groban says, Mayer's \\"swagger\\" and \\"'tude,\\" or something else that makes him such a catch? Mayer claims he's just a nice guy. \\"I don't have a secret,\\" Mayer recently told People. \\"I don't think about it like that. I think about it as just being nice. All you have to do is just be polite and treat people really well.\\" For the record, the date-ready Mayer has never taken any of his romantic relationships to the cohabitation level. According to Wikipedia, Mayer \\"splits his time between his home in the Los Angeles suburbs (with his roommate and sound engineer, Chad Franscoviak) and his apartment in the New York City neighborhood of SoHo.\\" Comment of the Week \\"I can't believe i finally have something in common with Gwyneth.

But the former \\"Friend\\" has been glowing of late, pals of the actress tell us. The reason can't just be that she is dating John Mayer. What we hear is there is a certain feature of John that leaves Jen so pleased. The crooner's ex-paramours reveal he is hell to get over, not because he's a great guy, but because he's a \\"great\\" guy, if you know what we mean. \\"His body actually is a wonderland,\\" one ex was overheard saying. Posted by: This is why | May 19, 2008 2:03 PM Possum I was thinking the same thing when I saw the male roommate. What, neither he nor the sound engineer make enough to get their own separate places?

Posted by: Juicy | May 19, 2008 3:05 PM I guess nobody on this site is much of a music fan because John M. is a phenomenal musician. Eric Clapton was one of his mentors - the man is now close to SRV-legend territory. \\"Wonderland\\" and \\"Daughters\\" are definitely his lamest songs - I believe he begged his record label not to release \\"Daughters\\" as a single. Anyway - his last CD, \\"Continuum\\" has quite a number of terrific bluesy songs. Great lyrics, too. (Although I have to admit that the song he wrote for the \\"Bucket List\\" movie was also pretty lame.) There aren't very many \\"Singer-Songwriter\\" types around anymore (i.e., Joni Mitchell, James Taylor, Clapton, Winwood, etc) - so this kid's music is pretty refreshing. BTW - as a middle-aged woman, I appreciate the fact that he talks about his parents in some of his songs - what a nice boy.

Although Rodrigo distrusts Richard greatly, he agrees to partner him on a gigantic scam, provided he gets a percentage of the money gained to help his ailing father, who is in trouble because of his gambling debts. Richard accepts, and they plan to sell a fraudulent version of a silver certificate currency note to William Hannigan, a rich collector who is in town.

The move prompted howls of protests from supporters of the whistleblowing organization as well as American conservatives, who have found ammunition in a trove of private Democratic National Committee emails released in recent weeks by Assange's outfit. Ecuadoran officials and their counterparts in the State Department have denied that the move to cut off his Internet access was prompted by U.S. government pressure, as my colleague Nick Miroff reports. But all was not quite lost for Assange. On Wednesday morning, Bobby Mair, a Canadian comedian based in the British capital, appeared outside the Ecuadoran Embassy with a megaphone and a sign around his neck that read “Julian Assange's personal Internet service.” He then proceeded to shout out headlines and tidbits of global information into what presumably is Assange's window.

Midway through releasing a series of damaging disclosures about U.S. presidential contender Hillary Clinton, WikiLeaks founder... (Associated Press) QUITO, Ecuador (AP) — WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is finding himself in open conflict with his Ecuadorean protectors as the group's latest dump targeting Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign runs afoul of the South American government's goal of warming up to Washington. Ecuador's move to cut off his internet access at its embassy in London was a stinging rebuke from leftist President Rafael Correa, who in 2012 heralded Assange as a digital-age Robin Hood and granted him asylum over protests from the United States, the United Kingdom and Sweden, where he faces allegations of rape. Correa's government said Tuesday that WikiLeaks' publication of a trove of damaging emails from Clinton's campaign had impacted the U.S. election in violation of Ecuador's traditional respect for other nations' sovereignty. Analysts say Correa is unlikely to now kick Assange out into the streets of London where he faces certain arrest. But allowing him to keep leaking secrets from the embassy risks putting the small Andean nation unwittingly on Russia's side of a brewing cyber-battle with the United States, Ecuador's top trade partner, at a time of deep economic stress. \\"Before, the costs for Ecuador of hosting Assange were minor,\\" said Santiago Basabe, a political analyst at the Latin American School of Social Sciences in Quito. \\"But they are growing bigger now because they involve questions of U.S. national security, its tense relations with Russia and the presidential elections.\\" The cascade of disclosures of Democratic operatives' hacked emails, including this week's publication of Clinton's speeches to Wall Street investment bank Goldman Sachs, has been hailed by Republican candidate Donald Trump as evidence of his rival's dishonesty. However, U.S. intelligence agents say the hack is the work of the Kremlin, although it's not clear how the files ended up with WikiLeaks. Regardless, Ecuador has plenty of reasons to try to curry favor with Washington. The oil-dependent, dollarized economy is fighting a recession made worse by low crude prices, a destructive earthquake in April and a strong U.S. dollar. Adding to the uncertainty is Correa's imminent departure from office after a decade in power that provided a sense of stability after years of coups and revolving-door presidencies. Analysts say whoever wins February's election — Correa's preferred successor currently leads polls — is almost certain to turn to the International Monetary Fund for a bailout. In such a scenario the support of the Washington, the biggest shareholder in the IMF, will be key in determining how severe an austerity program is required. \\"Assange has inserted Ecuador in the U.S. presidential campaign and exposed it to retaliation in case Clinton wins,\\" said former Foreign Minister Mauricio Gandara, adding that the publication of stolen documents is considered a crime in Ecuador. Correa, who in 2009 closed the only U.S. military base in South America and two years later expelled the U.S. ambassador, still peppers his speeches with anti-Yankee harangues in the mold of the late Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez. But with Venezuela in economic freefall and ideological allies losing power in countries like Argentina and Brazil, Correa has quietly extended an olive branch to the Obama administration and sought to deepen commercial ties. This week he's hosting a U.S. trade delegation. Correa also praised Clinton in an interview last month with Moscow-based broadcaster RT. \\"For the good of the United States and the world, and for my personal appreciation of her, I'd like to see Hillary win,\\" he said. Tensions between Assange and his hosts have surfaced before. In 2013, Correa criticized him for shooting a video from the embassy mocking Australian politicians during a political campaign. On Tuesday, Ecuador said WikiLeaks' \\"journalistic activities\\" would not be affected by the \\"temporary restrictions\\" on Assange's communications. Assange accused Ecuador of bowing to U.S. pressure and alleged that Secretary of State John Kerry discussed the issue with Correa last month in Colombia, something both Washington and Quito deny. It seems unlikely he will submit to the internet ban quietly. Over the weekend WikiLeaks released three lines of code it described as \\"pre-commitments,\\" labeling them \\"John Kerry,\\" ''Ecuador,\\" and \\"FCO\\" — an apparent reference to Britain's Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Pre-commitments are cryptographic functions that can be used to verify the integrity of material released subsequently. Security experts interpreted that as a warning to the named parties that WikiLeaks has ammunition in reserve that could embarrass his hosts as well. For most Ecuadoreans, Assange's case seems like a Hollywood spy movie with little bearing on their daily life. But even Correa's opponents have shown little enthusiasm for revoking the Australian's asylum. \\"We can't just throw him out of the embassy from night to day because he could be exposed to risks,\\" opposition presidential candidate Guillermo Lasso said last month, even while arguing that Assange was breaking the conditions of his asylum. ___ AP writers Joshua Goodman in Bogota, Colombia, and Raphael Satter in Paris contributed to this report. ||||| Tweet with a location You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

Arkin and Robert Windrem Quiet pressure from the U.S. government played a role in Ecuador’s decision to block WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange from using the internet at Ecuador’s London embassy, U.S. officials told NBC News. “It was a bit of an eviction notice,” said a senior intelligence official. Ecuador's government said Tuesday it had partly restricted internet access for Assange, the founder of anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks, who has lived in the South American country's London embassy for more than four years. A source familiar with the situation says the Ecuadoran government has been frustrated with Assange and his presence at the embassy in London for months and has been considering how best to proceed. The action came after U.S. officials conveyed their conclusion that Assange is a willing participant in a Russian intelligence operation to undermine the U.S. presidential election, NBC News has learned. U.S. intelligence officials believe Assange knows he is getting the information from Russian intelligence, though they do not believe he is involved in helping plan the hacking, officials told NBC. “The general view is he is a willing participant in the Russian scheme but not an active plotter in it. They just realized they could use him,” said a senior intelligence official. “It was a bit of an eviction notice.” WikiLeaks has been posting the private emails of Clinton adviser John Podesta and other Democratic officials that the U.S. says were hacked by, or on behalf of, Russian intelligence agencies. WikiLeaks said Assange’s internet access was cut off Sunday. In a statement, Ecuador said the decision was its own. “Ecuador, exercising its sovereign right, has temporarily restricted access to part of its communications systems in its UK Embassy,\\" the statement said. \\"The Ecuador government respects the principle of non-intervention in other countries' affairs, it does not meddle in election processes underway, nor does it support any candidate specially.\\" A senior administration official said that the U.S. did not push Ecuador to cut Assange off from the internet: \\"Reports that the U.S. government, to include the Intelligence Community, pressured the Ecuadorian government to interrupt internet service within Ecuador's embassy in London are not accurate.\\" The State Department said it did not pressure Ecuador or play any other role in blocking Assange's internet access. \\"While our concerns about WikiLeaks are longstanding, any suggestion that Secretary (John) Kerry or the State Department were involved in shutting down WikiLeaks is false,\\" State Department spokesman John Kirby said in a statement. However, U.S. intelligence officials told NBC that a message was conveyed to Ecuador that it should stop allowing Assange to carry water for Russian intelligence agencies, and that Ecuador, though run by a leftist, anti-American government, was receptive. The U.S. moves come as bipartisan concern is growing about the alleged Russian interference amid a daily release of Podesta emails. Marco Rubio, who is running to retain his Florida Senate seat after losing the Republican presidential primary to Donald Trump, urged members of his party not to seek to capitalize on emails stolen by Russian spies. \\"As our intelligence agencies have said, these leaks are an effort by a foreign government to interfere with our electoral process, and I will not indulge it,” Rubio told ABC News. \\"Further, I want to warn my fellow Republicans who may want to capitalize politically on these leaks: Today it is the Democrats. Tomorrow it could be us.\\" ||||| Summary:","response":"The Ecuadorian Embassy in London has cut off WikiLeaks' founder Julian Assange's internet access, so Canadian comedian Bobby Mair offered to read him highlights of the internet through a megaphone.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump on Tuesday defended his false claim that his predecessor didn't call the families of service members killed in action by alluding to former Gen. John Kelly's son, a Marine who died in Afghanistan. \\"You could ask General Kelly, did he get a call from Obama?\\" Trump said in a radio interview with Fox News' Brian Kilmeade. Kelly, who came on as Trump's chief of staff in July, does not often speak about the son he lost in 2010. 1st Lt. Robert Michael Kelly, 29, was killed in combat in Afghanistan after stepping on a landmine. \\"I don't know what Obama's policy was. I write letters and I also call,\\" Trump said, adding he has called \\"virtually everybody\\" during his past nine months as commander in chief. Trump's comments Tuesday come a day after he falsely claimed that President Barack Obama did not call the families of service members killed in action after being asked why he had not yet addressed the deaths of American service members killed in Niger earlier this month. When pressed by NBC News on how he could make that claim, Trump said he was told that Obama \\"didn't often\\" call families of fallen service members. \\"President Obama, I think, probably did sometimes, and maybe sometimes he didn't. I don't know. That's what I was told. All I can do — all I can do is ask my generals,\\" he said. According to a 2011 profile in The Boston Globe, Kelly has avoided speaking publicly about his son so as not to draw attention. \\"We are not inclined to make ourselves out to be any different, just because I’m a lieutenant general in the Marines,\\" Kelly said then. \\"We are just one family. It's not worse for us; it's not easier for us.\\" A White House official told NBC News on Tuesday that Obama did not call Kelly after the death of his son. But a person familiar with the breakfast for Gold Star Families at the White House on May 30, 2011, told NBC News that Kelly and his wife attended the private event and were seated at first lady Michelle Obama’s table. A former senior Obama administration official disputed Trump's initial claim on Monday that Obama didn't call Gold Star families, calling it \\"wrong.\\" \\"President Obama engaged families of the fallen and wounded warriors throughout his presidency through calls, letters, visits to Section 60 at Arlington, visits to Walter Reed, visits to Dover, and regular meetings with Gold Star Families at the White House and across the country,\\" the ex-official told NBC.

President Donald Trump on Tuesday invoked the death of the son of his chief of staff, John Kelly, as he defended his claim from a day before that Barack Obama and other past presidents didn't always call the families of slain service members. “For the most part, to the best of my knowledge, I think I’ve called every family of somebody that’s died, and it’s the hardest call to make, and I said it very loud and clear yesterday. The hardest thing for me to do is do that,” Trump said Tuesday morning during an interview with Fox News radio host Brian Kilmeade. Story Continued Below “Now, as far as other representatives, I don’t know,” he continued. “I mean, you could ask General Kelly did he get a call from Obama. You could ask other people. I don’t know what Obama’s policy was. I write letters, and I also call.” A White House official said Kelly didn’t receive a call from Obama after his son, 2nd Lt. Robert Kelly, died in Afghanistan in November 2010 when he stepped on a land mine. Obama did, however, host a breakfast in May 2011 for Gold Star families. And Kelly and his wife attended and sat at the table of first lady Michelle Obama, a source familiar with the event said. “President Obama engaged families of the fallen and wounded warriors throughout his presidency through calls, letters, visits to [Arlington Cemetery], visits to Walter Reed, visits to Dover, and regular meetings with Gold Star families at the White House and across the country,” a former White House official said. Trump has faced an onslaught of criticism — most notably from former Obama aides — since making the accusation against Obama on Monday afternoon in a Rose Garden news conference when asked about his silence regarding the death of four Green Berets related to an Oct. 4 ambush in Niger. “The traditional way, if you look at President Obama and other presidents, most of them didn’t make calls,” the president alleged without evidence Monday. “A lot of them didn’t make calls. I like to call when it’s appropriate, when I think I’m able to do it.” He said he was “told” that Obama didn’t always make calls but doesn’t know for sure. “All I can do is ask my generals,” he added Monday. “Other presidents did not call. They’d write letters. And some presidents didn’t do anything.” Obama's former aides chafed at the comment. Ben Rhodes, Obama’s deputy national security adviser, called the president’s claim “an outrageous and disrespectful lie even by Trump standards” and noted on Twitter that it was Trump, not Obama, who attacked a Gold Star family that had been critical of him. Alyssa Mastromonaco, Obama's former deputy chief of staff of operations, was even more direct, tweeting, “that's a f------ lie. to say president obama (or past presidents) didn't call the family members of soldiers KIA - he's a deranged animal.” Trump, however, said Tuesday that he doesn't feel a need to clarify his remarks. “There’s nothing to clarify,” he said, blaming CNN for first broaching the subject at his news conference. “This was, again, fake news CNN. I mean, they’re just a bunch of fakers.” In an apparent attempt to clean up the president’s comments, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Monday that Trump “wasn’t criticizing his predecessors, but stating a fact,” and insisted that past presidents never “called each family of the fallen” because they sometimes sent letters or met with them in person in lieu of phone calls. “I think what the president was saying is that there are many different ways to reach out to these families,” White House counselor Kellyanne Conway explained Tuesday in an interview with Fox News. “The president, I think, made very clear there what he meant and what he was saying.” Trump was adamant Tuesday that he’s prioritized calling the family of every fallen service member.

But certainly I’ll use the word ‘virtually’ everybody, where during the last nine months something’s happened to a soldier I’ve called virtually everybody,” the president said. “I’ve gone to Dover [Air Force Base]. I’ve seen what takes place at Dover. It’s an incredible scene and very, very sad — one of the saddest things you’ll ever see.” He cautioned, however, that he speaks for himself, not past presidents. “I don’t know what Bush did. I don’t know what Obama did,” he conceded. “You could find out easily what President Obama did. All you have to do is ask the military people. But I believe his policy was somewhat different than my policy.” Trump said his policy is to call the family of every fallen soldier, though his rhetoric Monday suggested he only calls “when it’s appropriate” and “when I think I’m able to do it.” “You have to let a little time go by. You can’t just call immediately,” he said, explaining why he has yet to reach out to the families of those killed in the Niger ambush. “But I will be calling, have called and will be calling the parents and the loved ones, wives, etc., of the soldiers that recently were killed.” Sanders said in a statement later Tuesday that Trump had spoken to the families of all four service members who were killed in action. “He offered condolences on behalf of a grateful nation and assured them their family’s extraordinary sacrifice to the country will never be forgotten,” she said.

Listen to the full interview below: -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- BRIAN KILMEADE: So, I know this is a big week. How important is getting this budget passed? To even get to the tax reform conversation, Mr. President? PRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, it's very important. I mean we need the budget, we need the passage. We have Thad Cochran, as you know, is not feeling so great. He may not be able to vote. We don't know what John McCain's going to do. We have a couple of others that maybe could disappoint us, but maybe they won't. They've been talking about all sorts of things for so long, now they have a President who's really willing to sign what we have to sign. But I think we're going to be good, and I think we're going to be good for taxes. And it's very close, because we have no support from the democrats. They're obstructionists, all they want to do is obstruct. So we have 48 votes against us. So we literally can't lose more than two votes, which is a pretty tough situation. KILMEADE: On tax reform or the budget -- on the budget in particular right? TRUMP: On the budget. Well we have phase one and phase two. Phase one, we have to think only - I'm only right now thinking about the budget. KILMEADE: Right. TRUMP: Phase two is tax, because that will next week. But phase one is the budget. And if we get the budget, I think we'll be in good shape to get the tax, but we have to get the budget. KILMEADE: I talked to Senator Joe Manchin yesterday who really seems to enjoy your interactions. And he says if they could give me a little something, I could deliver six to eight democrats. Number one, do you believe that? And number two, are you willing to negotiate? TRUMP: Well we'll be talking to Joe. I think it's hard for Joe to vote against tax cuts. We're talking about massive tax cuts -- KILMEADE: In West Virginia? TRUMP: In West Virginia. And I've turned West Virginia around, because what I've done environmentally with coal. And I don't know if you saw, but West Virginia is second to Texas in percentage increase of GDP. And everyone's saying \\"I can't believe it,\\" because they were having such problems. But, I think it's very hard for Joe, I think it's very hard for other people to vote especially where I'm very popular in their states, and they're coming up for election to vote against the largest tax cut in the history of our country. People need their money, where the government is taking too much money. We're the highest taxed nation in the world. We need the tax cuts. KILMEADE: So what Mick Mulvaney brought up to me this morning on television was no one talks about the zero percent, because they have up to 24,000, you're not going to pay any tax, that's part of tax reform - TRUMP: Right. KILMEADE: Also, people are focused on the corporate rate deduction, what about the small business? TRUMP: So small business is coming way down. And if you talk about the zero, I said \\"You've got to put the zero in,\\" they were saying \\"We have three brackets.\\" I said \\"I know you like to say we only have three brackets as opposed to seven or eight, but you've got to put the zero in.\\" So I said \\"Make it four.\\" And the democrats, Schumer and all, were using that - and they were using it as bait. Now they can't use it anymore, because where they're paying a much higher rate - paying a very high rate, right now a lot of people are going to pay zero. KILMEADE: Right. TRUMP: Then we go to a 12 percent, as an example, it comes down from 15 - but it really comes down from much higher than that. So it's a great tax cut for the middle class, but - hey look, even the middle class will say it's an unbelievable tax cut for business, which is going to employ people. And the biggest beneficiary will be the middle class. KILMEADE: So you golfed with Rand Paul over the weekend, and I think most agree, including Mark Short (ph) this morning, said that he's going to be the greatest challenge, because he does not like to vote for budgets or tax reform. I mean, can you be friends - TRUMP: I think he's definitely with us. KILMEADE: -- can you be friendly with someone that's going to vote against that? Have you talked to him? TRUMP: I've had a great relationship with Rand Paul, and I think he's going to be with us. I think in the end he's going to be with us. I hope John McCain's going to be with us, we just don't know yet. We have a couple of votes, and of course that is in a position where it may be impossible for him to be here, which is a big - that's like a no vote. That's almost the equivalent to a no vote. And the problem is we have no democrats. We have absolutely no democrat votes, so - KILMEADE: Have you tried? TRUMP: Yes, we've tried. They're in a box (ph), they have 48 votes, and all they want to do is obstruct. Now, I think we'll have democrats if we get through the budget - we have to get through the budget first. KILMEADE: Right. TRUMP: If we get through the budget, we have the taxes. I think we're going to have some democrats, especially in states where I did very well. I mean I had some states where I won be 30 and 40 points. KILMEADE: Right. TRUMP: And that's a big margin. And I think we could have potentially some democrats in those states, for the massive tax cuts that we're talking about. KILMEADE: So it's going to be a big week obviously, and there's certain things you zone in on, and every President's got his preference, some (inaudible) foreign policy. I think you love the numbers, the budget, and the economy. But I've got ask you something the big picture - TRUMP: I think foreign policy for me has been very strong. I think we did the right thing with Iran, and if you notice, Iran was respectful yesterday. They were not jumping up and down, they were respectful of what I did. And they may not agree with it, but they were very respectful. I think that if you look at what I did with the payments going to the insurance companies, not going to poor people, they're going right into the pockets of the insurance companies. And I bought a list for you... KILMEADE: You did. For me? TRUMP: Look at these -- look at these insurance companies. This is since Obamacare started. Anthem, big company, 270 percent increase. 270 percent. And that's since ACA, that's Obamacare. So since Obamacare, Humana, 420 percent increase. Aetna, 470 percent increase. Cigna, 480 percent increase. KILMEADE: So I looked at those numbers... TRUMP: Insurance companies are making a fortune. KILMEADE: So are you saying when you - when they raise premiums, or raise deductibles, they're trying to increase their profits instead of doing an honest job about giving people insurance? Are they being dishonest in going too profit-oriented? TRUMP: No, they got a great deal with Obamacare. The one beneficiary, the great beneficiaries for Obamacare is not the people. They're getting killed. And look at what's happening to their premiums, look at what's happening to their deductibles, how high their deductibles. But look, these are - these are not made up by me. When you have Cigna, Aetna, Humana, Anthem going up 270, 420, 470 percent, 480 percent, these are insurance companies that went up 480 percent since Obamacare. Is any stock on the stock exchange - has anybody gone up that much? KILMEADE: You would know better than me. TRUMP: The reason is - the reason is, it's because Obamacare is a rip-off. It's great for the insurance companies. And find out who gave all that money to the Democrats. Take a look at the insurance companies. KILMEADE: Right. TRUMP: So the Democrats don't want to hurt the insurance companies. So the money I took away was taken away by - from the insurance companies. And by the way, since I took it down, you saw what happened to their stocks. KILMEADE: Senator Alexander and Senator Murray are working on a bipartisan plan. They stopped when it looked as though Lindsey Graham and Cassidy had something going. Is this to force their hand to come up with something? TRUMP: Well, this helps, because nobody knows (ph)... KILMEADE: No, not so much this paper, but so much the 7 billion, \\"I'm not making that payment.\\" Does that help... TRUMP: Yeah, I think it helps. I think it helps to make a deal... KILMEADE: So you did it to push action? TRUMP: I think if I did not do that, if I didn't hold it back - and I just said we're not going to make that payment. If I didn't do that, I don't believe the Democrats would have called. KILMEADE: David Axelrod said last night that you're pulling this back and (inaudible) tearing up the Iran deal is your attempt to obliterate the Obama legacy. Is it? TRUMP: No, it's just that I disagree with Obama on so many things. I mean, I heard - as an example, let's say, Hilary Clinton said it was OK for the NFL players to kneel during the anthem. Well, I disagree. Maybe that's why she lost, because that's bad. That's real bad. We have to respect our flag, our country, our anthem. Obama, I disagree with what he does. Look, when you look at this - nobody knows this. I just got these numbers. Nobody knows this about the insurance companies. The only beneficiary from Obamacare are the insurance companies. They made a fortune. And that's not - you've never heard that, you've never seen these numbers before. KILMEADE: I haven't. And that's why you handed it to me ahead of time, gave me a little bit of time to study. So some other news that broke today and you tweeted out, Congressman Marino was pulled back as drug czar. What went into that? TRUMP: Yeah, well he's a fine man. He was a supporter of mine from Pennsylvania. Great state, I won Pennsylvania. And he's a Congressman from Pennsylvania, very popular. And he told me, look, if there's even a perception that he has a conflict of interest with insurance companies, essentially - but if there's even a perception that he has a conflict of interest, he doesn't want anything to do with it. So whether we have insurance companies or drug companies - and there was a couple of articles having to do with him and drug companies. And I will tell you, he felt compelled - he feels very strong about the opioid problem and the drug problem, which is a worldwide problem. It's a problem that we have. And Tom Marino said \\"Look, I'll take a pass. I have no choice. I really will take a pass, I want to do it.\\" And he was very gracious, I have to say that. KILMEADE: Big exposé on 60 minutes. TRUMP: He didn't want to have - he didn't want to have even the perception of a conflict of interest with drug companies or, frankly, insurance companies. KILMEADE: New HHS secretary, I was talking to Kellyanne Conway today. It seems like you're close. Do you want to go over any names? TRUMP: We are more than close, but I won't be able to tell you the name yet because we have to do a little vetting. But we are more than close and if this person gets approved it will be a fantastic, a fantastic nomination. KILMEADE: You came out with Mitch McConnell yesterday and seemed on the same page and then said I'll take any questions. And, it was just a regular - it was like a press conference you'd see on a sporting event. TRUMP: I only did that because you weren't in the audience. KILMEADE: I know. Why is that? TRUMP: If you were in the audience I wouldn't have done that. KILMEADE: One of the questions was about writing the Green Berets soldiers and ends up being a bigger story. Can I ask you what you thought about when you brought up past presidents and what they've done? Do you want to clarify anything? TRUMP: Well, there's nothing to clarify because if you look at my whole (ph) this was again fake news CNN. I mean, they're just a bunch of fakers. So, they asked me that questions and for the most part to the best of my knowledge I think I've called every family of somebody that's died and it's the hardest call to make. And I said it very loud and clear yesterday. The hardest thing for me to do is do that. Now, as far as other representatives, I don't know. I mean, you could ask General Kelly did he get a call from Obama. You could ask other people, I don't know what Obama's policy was. I write letters and I also call. Now, sometimes if you had a tragic event with - it's very difficult to be able to do that. But I have called, I believe everybody but certainly I'll use the word virtually everybody where during the last nine months something's happened to us all. I've called virtually everybody. I've gone to Dover. I've seen what takes place at Dover. It's an incredible scene and very, very sad. One of the saddest things you'll ever see. But I really speak for myself. I'm not speaking for other people. I don't know what Bush did, I don't know what Obama did. You could find out easily what President Obama did. All you have to do is ask the military people but I believe his policy was somewhat different than my policy. I can tell you my policy is I've called every one of them. And, you have to let a little time go by. You can't just call immediately but I will be calling, have called and will be calling the parents and the loved ones, wives, et cetera of the soldiers that recently were killed. KILMEADE: No, I meant seeing (ph) you happy? TRUMP: I love doing it. I'm getting tremendous support even in your polls I'm getting tremendous support and it's hard to believe I can get support when you have so many phony stories out there. Like, CNN, like MSNBC, like NBC. NBC is probably worse than CNN. But all I know is FOX is good. FOX, we love you, FOX. KILMEADE: We're fair. TRUMP: You are fair. KILMEADE: Thank you. TRUMP: You know what, the truth is you hit me when it's needed. You do. I mean, you do in particular. KILMEADE: Right. TRUMP: But the fact is - KILMEADE: I think we're fair. TRUMP: All I want is fair. I don't want anything else. I just want fair. And FOX has really been fair and I appreciate it. KILMEADE: Thank you. I appreciate the time you gave us and the Brian Kilmeade Show. TRUMP: Thank you. KILMEADE: And this morning. And, thanks for having us out here. TRUMP: Thank you very much. Thank you. Take care of yourself. KILMEADE: Thank you, Mr. President. All right. So, we're here in the Eisenhower Building and the president actually gave us my own (ph) notes for the interview so that's great. There he is. Thanks for listening. Keep it here. I'm Brian Kilmeade. |||||","response":"President Trump talked about how some soldiers were hurt in a country called Niger. He also mentioned that he calls the families of soldiers who are hurt or killed to offer support. Trump said that he is not sure if President Obama had the same way of giving support to these families when he was President. People started to argue about whether this was true, so Trump also talked about General Kelly, a man who works with him, and how General Kelly's son died when he was a soldier. People are trying to know if this really means that President Obama did not call families or if it is just one example."},{"question":"Information: - Moondram Pirai is a 1982 Indian Tamil-language romantic drama film written, directed and filmed by Balu Mahendra.

So committed is the play to the idea of Nixon’s likability that it may be one of the great victories of Nixon revisionism. But in compressing dialogue, rearranging chronology and shifting some of Nixon’s disclosures out of their original context, “Frost/Nixon” loses one of the most poignant moments of the talks. In one portion of the interviews, Mr. Frost asks Nixon about life after resignation, and Nixon responds dismally: “You feel, gee, isn’t it just great to have enough money to afford a nice house, to be able to play golf and have nice parties and good clothes and shoes and suits, etc., etc., to travel if you want to. And the answer is, if you don’t have these things, they can mean a great deal to you. When you have them, they mean nothing to you.” The play has Nixon expressing a similar sentiment to his agent, Swifty Lazar, and the effect is dissipated. As the journalist Murray Kempton once wrote, Nixon ended his 1960 campaign “wandering limply and wetly about the American heartland begging votes on the excuse that he had been too poor to have a pony when he was a boy.” When Nixon expressed his boredom to an audience of millions, he was exploiting class sentiments once again. Nixon essentially began his career in presidential politics asking people to feel sorry for him because he once had no money with which to idly divert himself; he ended it asking them to feel sorry for his having way too much. Much of the drama of “Frost/Nixon” rests on the idea that Nixon was a consummate stonewaller and Mr. Frost a glitz-hound and possible nincompoop, incapable of the obduracy required for such a reportorial effort. But one of the many points at which that interpretation of Mr. Frost falls apart, upon a fresh viewing of the actual interview tapes, takes place during an exchange about the war in Southeast Asia. Mr. Frost, inquiring whether Nixon felt that the invasion of Cambodia fueled the growth of the Khmer Rouge, uses the word “concatenate.” Concatenate. (It isn’t just that we are unable to imagine Meredith Viera using a word like that with Meg Ryan. It is nearly as unfathomable to think of Charlie Rose pulling it out of his dictionary for Cormac McCarthy.) On the subjects of the Spiro Agnew scandal and the C.I.A.’s involvement in removing Salvador Allende from his leadership of Chile, Mr. Frost in the televised interviews remains persistent. Nixon defends the United States involvement there by quoting an Italian businessman who once conveyed to him a fear of a “red sandwich” in Latin America. “But that’s madness of him to say this,” Mr. Frost responds, determined to get Nixon to acknowledge the horrors of Augusto Pinochet’s dictatorship. “If you had to use a word to describe the Pinochet regime,” Mr. Frost continues, “what adjective would you use, brutal?” Mr. Frost did have difficulty securing august advertisers for his project, as the play claims, and this is undoubtedly so. The footage of the interviews available at the Museum of Television and Radio includes the commercials, many of which have the strange subliminal effect of reminding us that we are watching a man try to unsully himself. There are ads for Weed Eaters, Certs breath mints, Ban roll-on antiperspirant and another product that establishes the era’s mood of revelation. “Millions know him as the Fonz, but Henry Winkler feels trapped by his TV fame,” the ad begins. It implores viewers to learn the deep truth about him in “a bold new picture magazine.” The magazine is called Us.

It said there was an \\"indefensible\\" lack of leadership in child protection, with no single officer in charge. The Met apologised for any failures but the home secretary described the report as \\"profoundly concerning\\". The force's assistant commissioner Martin Hewitt said the safety of youngsters was a priority but added that child protection \\"often involves complex social problems which cannot be solved by police alone\\". HM Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) inspectors discovered 277 of 384 cases investigated had been poorly handled. Of those, 38 were referred back to the Met because inspectors believed the children involved may still be at risk. HM Inspector of Constabulary Matt Parr said \\"far too many of the cases we looked at fell well short of expected standards\\". The force was found to be the only one investigated not to have a chief officer in charge of child protection, in spite of it being the largest police service in the country. Information about victims and offenders was kept on \\"isolated\\" IT systems and not shared between boroughs, while some staff - including borough child sexual exploitation officers - had been given no training in child sexual exploitation. Mr Parr told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the previous mayor had set the priorities for the Met to tackle crimes such as burglary, criminal damage, theft and violence, which meant it had taken its \\"eye of the ball\\" when it came to child protection. As a result, child protection investigations were \\"inconsistent\\" and caused issues such as a backlog of visits to registered sex offenders who were thought to be a very high risk to children. In a statement, the Met said it already had \\"more than 1,300 officers\\" who were \\"dedicated to protecting vulnerable young people\\". It said it had re-examined the cases highlighted by HMIC and had identified \\"no further harm to children and no further offenders\\". With regards to accusations it had focused too much on other areas of policing, the force said \\"children are disproportionately victims\\" in those crimes. However, it said it had \\"worked closely\\" with HMIC since the inspection and would use the report as \\"a launch pad\\" to change its approach to child protection. Assistant Commissioner Hewitt told the Today programme: \\"We had already identified that we needed to change in the way that we managed child protection and we were - as the report acknowledges - we are in the process of a range of activities to change our response to child protection. \\"But what this report gives us is some very clear issues that we need to look at and we need to address as we continue in that process of change.\\" HMIC has made several recommendations, including a London-wide oversight of child protection. Home Secretary Amber Rudd said: \\"The findings of this report are profoundly concerning. They raise serious issues that must be urgently addressed. \\"I have spoken to the mayor of London and sought his assurance that immediate action will be taken to overhaul the force's approach to child protection.\\" She added: \\"Every child has the right to feel safe and protected, and to trust that they can turn to the police for help. \\"It is critical that the Met learns from its mistakes and gets this right going forward.\\" Current London Mayor Sadiq Khan said: \\"This deeply troubling report has found that, too often, children in our city have been let down when they are most in need. \\"This is simply unacceptable and things must change.\\" He sais he has set out a plan to improve the service, including \\"a new independent group of child protection experts\\". Inspectors will carry out another inspection of the force to check on improvements within 12 months. What was that article about?","response":"This article is about a report that found that the police in London, called the Met, have not been doing a good job at protecting children. The report says that the police need better leadership and organization to make sure children are safe. The Met has apologized for their mistakes and they are working to improve the way they handle child protection. The mayor of London and the home secretary are both very worried about this issue and they want the police to fix these problems as soon as possible. The article also mentions that there will be another inspection in a year to see if things have improved."},{"question":"holiday apartment for rent praha 5-smichov czech republic - from vacation rental agency Can you repeat this sentence, but capitalize it correctly?","response":"Holiday Apartment for Rent Praha 5-Smichov Czech Republic - From Vacation Rental Agency"},{"question":"Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: Who is the stolen marionette a sidekick to?

It was, of course, Pete. Pete was the night shift guy at Crossroads Detox across town. Ray called it the Jesus Shop because it was wholly supported by a contingent of local churches who saw addicts as a potential ministry. Apparently Jesus saved--not only from sin and hell, but also from Dark Eyed Jim Beam. Pete was a relatively innocuous born again fundie who volunteered his time two or three nights a week. When he was not saving the world, his Clark Kent was actually a steady CPA job with the local H&R Block. He'd been pulling shifts for about six months, knew nothing about drugs beyond that bad people used them to escape their problems and that they were tools of Satan, and he always needed Ray's advice about one thing or another. This arrangement was not problematic as Pete had long ago given up trying to convert him. Pete was also the only guy in the city who was, as Ray figured it, making less money than he was at such an hour. In return for Ray's magnanimity, Pete had done Ray's taxes for free last year. They had never actually met, though Ray had faxed him the tax forms and Pete had faxed back a photo of his two pre-teen daughters and his geriatric Lab. \\"What's the problem?\\" Ray asked. \\"I have a recalcitrant.\\" That's what he called them, the drunk and definitely disorderly.

Nearly three-quarters of Nevada's people live in Clark County, which contains the Las VegasParadise metropolitan area where three of the state's four largest incorporated cities are located. Nevada's capital is Carson City. Nevada is officially known as the \\"Silver State\\" because of the importance of silver to its history and economy. It is also known as the \\"Battle Born State\\", because it achieved statehood during the Civil War (the words \\"Battle Born\\" also appear on the state flag); as the \\"Sage-brush State\\", for the native plant of the same name; and as the \\"Sage-hen State\\".

Mountain men were most common in the North American Rocky Mountains from about 1810 through to the 1880s (with a peak population in the early 1840s). They were instrumental in opening up the various Emigrant Trails (widened into wagon roads) allowing Americans in the east to settle the new territories of the far west by organized wagon trains traveling over roads explored and in many cases, physically improved by the mountain men and the big fur companies originally to serve the mule train based inland fur trade. - Suicide is the act of intentionally causing one's own death. Risk factors include mental disorders such as depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, personality disorders, alcoholism, or substance misuse. Others are impulsive acts due to stress such as from financial difficulties, troubles with relationships, or from bullying. Those who have previously attempted suicide are at higher risk for future attempts. Suicide prevention efforts include limiting access to method of suicide, such as firearms and poisons, treating mental disorders and substance misuse, proper media reporting of suicide, and improving economic conditions. Although crisis hotlines are common, there is little evidence for their effectiveness. The most commonly used method of suicide varies between countries, and is partly related to the availability of effective means. Common methods include hanging, pesticide poisoning, and firearms. Suicide resulted in 842,000 deaths globally in 2013 (up from 712,000 deaths in 1990). This makes it the 10th leading cause of death worldwide. Approximately 0.5% to 1.4% of people die by suicide, about 12 per 100,000 persons per year. Three quarters of suicides globally occur in the developing world. Rates of completed suicides are generally higher in men than in women, ranging from 1.5 times as much in the developing world to 3.5 times in the developed world. Suicide is generally most common among those over the age of 70; however, in certain countries those aged between 15 and 30 are at highest risk. There are an estimated 10 to 20 million non-fatal attempted suicides every year. Non-fatal suicide attempts may lead to injury and long-term disabilities. In the Western world, attempts are more common in young people and females. Views on suicide have been influenced by broad existential themes such as religion, honor, and the meaning of life. The Abrahamic religions traditionally consider suicide an offense towards God due to the belief in the sanctity of life.

The main application for this procedure is capital punishment, but the term may also be applied in a broad sense to euthanasia and suicide. It first renders the person unconscious, and then stops the breathing and heart, in that order. - Lawrence Colwell , Jr. , aka Charles Durrant , a 35 - year - old white male , was voluntarily executed by lethal injection at the Nevada State Prison in Carson City , Nevada on March 26 , 2004 .

As of the 2010 census, the population was 55,274. The majority of the population of the town lives in Eagle Valley, on the eastern edge of the Carson Range, a branch of the Sierra Nevada, about south of Reno. The town originated as a stopover for California bound emigrants, but developed into a city with the Comstock Lode, a silver strike in the mountains to the northeast. The city has served as the capital of Nevada since statehood in 1864 and for much of its history was a hub for the Virginia and Truckee Railroad, although the tracks were removed in the 1950s. Prior to 1969, Carson City was the county seat of Ormsby County. In 1969, the county was abolished, and its territory was merged with Carson City to form the Consolidated Municipality of Carson City. With the consolidation, the city limits today extend west across the Sierra Nevada to the California state line in the middle of Lake Tahoe.

Imagine the explorer, journeying through the vast, seemingly endless expanses of the desert, with its harsh, unforgiving environment. The sun beating down relentlessly, casting a haze over the dunes which stretch out into the distance, the winds whipping up clouds of blinding sand, and the harsh, arid climate taking its toll on both the body and the mind. Then, suddenly, upon cresting a particularly tall dune, the explorer's eyes fall upon an astonishing sight - a garden oasis nestled in the midst of this inhospitable wasteland. A place of almost miraculous respite from the desert's fury, a bastion of life surrounded by death. Imagine the sense of awe and wonder the explorer would feel at the sight of this garden oasis—lush green foliage, vibrant flowers bursting into bloom, and the cool, refreshing waters of a shimmering pond. Here in this paradise, one may gather the strength needed to survive the surrounding desert. This oasis stands in stark contrast to its surroundings, a testament to the enduring power of life in the face of adversity. The fragile beauty of the oasis also serves as a poignant reminder of nature's capacity to persevere in even the harshest of conditions—finding solace in the face of inhospitality and providing a sanctuary for weary souls seeking refuge from the desolation. The other options, while interesting, do not hold the same power as the desert oasis. A hop garden may be a lovely sight for an explorer, but it would not have the same impact as finding an unexpected haven in an environment as cruel as the desert. A parking lot, while a testament to human ingenuity, would not inspire the same sense of awe and wonder in an explorer seeking natural beauty. Sand dunes are an integral part of the desert landscape, and while they may be beautiful and awe-inspiring, they do not possess the same life-affirming qualities as a garden oasis. Wastelands, by their very nature, lack the vitality and richness that make the oasis such a powerful symbol of hope and survival. In conclusion, the garden oasis in the middle of the desert represents the most beautiful thing that the explorer could witness in his journey. This oasis symbolizes hope, resilience, immeasurable natural beauty, and offers shelter from the harsh conditions that encircle it. Such a sight would surely captivate the explorer's heart and remain as an unforgettable testimonial of nature's tenacity and grace."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Generate a question that has the following answer: a gym instructor for the following movie plot: Sanjay Sahu (Pawan Kalyan) is a post-graduate from Osmania University and is working as a gym instructor.

Gabrielle Giffords continues to make positive progress, her husband and doctors told CNN in exclusive interviews on Thursday. The chief of neurosurgery at Tucson's University Medical Center said that Giffords' eye movements suggest the congresswoman is experiencing \\"glimmers of recognition.\\" \\"That tracking of the eyes tells you a whole lot more, that she's aware of her surroundings to some extent,\\" Dr. Michael Lemole told Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent. \\"She's trying to engage that reality.\\" Giffords opened her eyes briefly for the first time Wednesday, with her husband, her parents and other members of Congress in the room, and continued to open them on Thursday. \\"It was extraordinary,\\" said Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-New York, who was holding Giffords' hand when she opened her eyes on Wednesday. \\"It was a miracle to witness.\\" The incident occurred shortly after President Barack Obama had visited Giffords in her hospital room. \\"I think she realized the president of the United States was there, but I'm not sure she knew why,\\" Mark Kelly, Giffords' husband, told CNN Thursday in an exclusive interview. Giffords' breathing tube could be removed as early as Friday, Kelly said. Less than an hour after his Wednesday visit, given permission to disclose the information by Kelly, Obama electrified a memorial-service crowd and a national television audience by revealing one of the most promising pieces of news about Gifford's condition to emerge since an assassination attempt against her on Saturday. Giffords was squeezing and stroking Gillibrand's hand, as doctors previously said she had been able to do. Giffords \\"absolutely could hear everything we were saying,\\" Gillibrand said. \\"And Debbie (Wasserman Schultz, D-Florida) and I were telling her how much she was inspiring the nation with her courage, her strength, and we were talking about the things we wanted to do as soon as she was better.\\" Gillibrand mentioned having another night out with Giffords and her husband for beer and pizza. And Wasserman Schultz recounted telling her, \\"Come on, you've got to get better, because we expect you up in New Hampshire this summer\\" at Wasserman Schultz's vacation home. \\"And just as I said that, that's when she suddenly was struggling to open ... her eyes,\\" Wasserman Schultz said. \\"First just a little bit. And the doctors couldn't believe it. They said, 'This is such a good time.' \\" Kelly saw her struggling, Gillibrand said, and he and the others began to encourage her, saying, \\"Open your eyes, Gabby. Open your eyes.\\" And Giffords did. Her right eye remains bandaged, but Giffords is opening both of them, doctors said Thursday. \\"She took a moment to focus, you could see she was focusing,\\" Gillibrand said. \\"And then Mark said ... 'Gabby, if you can see me, if you can see me, give us a thumbs-up ... She didn't only give a thumbs-up, she literally raised her entire hand.\\" But Giffords didn't stop there, Gillibrand said. She reached out and grabbed her husband \\"and is touching him and starts to really choke him like she was really trying to hug him.\\" He asked her to touch his wedding ring, \\"and she touches his ring, then she grabs his whole watch and wrist and then the doctor was just so excited, he said, 'You don't understand ... this is amazing what she is doing right now and beyond our greatest hopes.' \\" \\"It was, as you can imagine, a glorious moment,\\" said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, who was also in the room. Of the six patients the hospital is still treating from Saturday's shooting, Giffords is the only one in critical condition. Four others are in fair condition, and the sixth was being released from the hospital Thursday, said Dr. Peter Rhee, medical director of the University Medical Center's trauma center. Giffords remains in critical condition because doctors are worried about her losing ground, said Lemole. Giffords' doctors spoke exclusively to CNN Thursday about the first moments after her arrival at the hospital. \\"My first response was I grabbed her hand, leaned into her an said 'Ms. Giffords, you're in the hospital, we're going to care for you, please squeeze my hand' and she did,\\" said Dr. Randall Friese, a trauma surgeon. \\"I got the impression that she was trying to communicate but was frustrated by the fact that she couldn't communicate,\\" he said. In some of his first public comments since Saturday's shooting, Giffords' husband told CNN he was in Houston when he got a call saying that his wife had been shot. Worried that a commercial flight would take too long, Kelly, a NASA astronaut, flew in a friend's plane to Arizona and met Giffords in the intensive care unit after surgery. A 9-year-old girl, Christina Green, and Arizona's chief federal judge, John Roll, are among the dead, along with Gabe Zimmerman, a Giffords staffer. A funeral mass was held for Green on Thursday. Also Thursday, first lady Michelle Obama released an open letter to parents about the shooting. \\"In the days and weeks ahead, as we struggle with these issues ourselves, many of us will find that our children are struggling with them as well,\\" she wrote. \\"The questions my daughters have asked are the same ones that many of your children will have -- and they don't lend themselves to easy answers.\\" \\"But they will provide an opportunity for us as parents to teach some valuable lessons -- about the character of our country, about the values we hold dear, and about finding hope at a time when it seems far away,\\" the first lady continued. Authorities say Giffords was the target of the shooting. Twelve other people suffered gunshot wounds, the Pima County Sheriff has said, while others were injured trying to flee the scene. Tucson resident Jared Lee Loughner, 22, is facing federal charges in the attack. A bag that is believed to belong to Loughner contains the same kind of ammunition as was used in Saturday's massacre, authorities said Thursday. Even when Giffords' prognosis was grim, she has consistently defied the odds and met or exceeded expectations. The next step, doctors told reporters Thursday, is the removal of Giffords' breathing tube. She is breathing on her own \\"with very little support,\\" Rhee said, but he wasn't sure when the tube might come out. Giffords is \\"becoming more and more alert at this time,\\" he said, telling reporters she acts like someone waking up in the morning -- yawning and rubbing her eyes. She has been opening her eyes more often since Wednesday, Lemole said. \\"This is all very encouraging,\\" he said. \\"... It is a significant move forward.\\" Rhee said Giffords has been undergoing physical therapy, in which staffers sit her up with her legs dangling off the side of the bed. When asked, she can move both legs, straightening them out, he said. Safeway, which owns the grocery store where the shooting took place, took out a full-page ad in Tucson's Arizona Daily Star newspaper Thursday, saying it is proud to be part of a community that cares so deeply about one another. The company is working to reopen the store, it said. Doctors have cautiously described Giffords' recovery as going according to plan, so far absent of any complications or issues, and have said throughout that she has been able to communicate when they lessen her sedation and allow her to awaken. Lemole said he was in the room when Giffords opened her eyes, saying it might have been the \\"unexpected familiarity\\" of having close friends visit that perhaps Giffords wasn't expecting. \\"This is the part that doctors, I think, have the hardest time with -- those intangibles in medicine,\\" he said, referring to the role that family and friends can play in prompting patient progress. \\"Miracles happen every day,\\" Lemole said. \\"... A lot of medicine is outside our control.\\" CNN's Steve Dolce contributed to this report. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","response":"U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords was shot in the head, but she is making progress and getting better. Her husband and doctors think she is recognizing things around her.

We just had a little time for dinner before a show, and the concierge suggested this place since we had no reservations. It was horridly overpriced, and the food mediocre at best. The service was, however, outstanding...sorta. They brought a piece of bread before the meal, and never offered another, until we chased the server down and asked. Not cool. We split the grilled octopus appetizer. The octopus was cooked perfectly, but sauced with an extremely strong balsamic glaze that completely obscured the flavor of the fish. We both ordered the short rib with polenta dinners. The meat was overcooked to the point that it became mush as soon as we started to chew it. The polenta was excellent...both tablespoons of it. The \\"dinner\\" portion would have been an appetizer anywhere else. This meal was thoroughly disappointing, especially at 36 a pop.

Maxwell's gang, the People's Revolutionary Strike Force (PRSF), plans to use the gas men's uniforms and van as part of an ambitious series of crimes that will make them rich. Inspector Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) and his partner Frank DiGiorgio (John Mitchum), after dealing with a chronic fainter, arrive at a liquor store where robbers have taken hostages. The robbers demand a car with a police radio; the inspector provides one by driving his squad car into the store and shooting the robbers. His superior Captain McKay (Bradford Dillman) reprimands Callahan for \\"excessive use of force\\", injuring the hostages, and causing 14,379 of damage to the store, and temporarily transfers him out of the Homicide unit. While assigned to Personnel, Callahan participates in the interview process for promotions, and learns that affirmative action means that three of the new inspectors will be female including Kate Moore (Tyne Daly), despite her very limited field experience. The PRSF uses the gas company van to steal M72 LAW rockets, Colt M16 rifles, a Taser and other weapons from a warehouse. In the course of the robbery, three people are killed: a security guard whom Maxwell kills for his keys; DiGiorgio, whom Maxwell stabs in the back after he stumbles in on the robbery after discovering the guard's body; one of Maxwell's accomplices is accidentally shot when DiGiorgio's gun goes off. Maxwell finishes her off as \\"dead weight\\" with DiGiorgio's weapon. To Callahan's distress, Moore is his new partner; she claims to understand the risk, noting thatâbesides DiGiorgioâtwo other partners of his have died.

To begin with, the fact that only around 23% of lawyers met the goal suggests that a significant majority did not feel compelled to comply with the Georgia State Bar's recommendation. This could indicate that the perceived consequences or penalties were not severe or discouraging enough to motivate the lawyers to reach the suggested 50 hours of pro-bono work. The low compliance rate can be associated with minimal repercussions for not meeting the goal. However, it is essential to point out that this reasoning assumes that lawyers' primary motivation for meeting the goal would be to avoid penalties. It is possible that there are other factors contributing to the low rate of pro-bono work that are not directly related to penalties. For example: 1. Lack of awareness: Some lawyers might not be informed about the Georgia State Bar's goal, leading them to unintentionally not meet the target. 2. Time constraints: Lawyers may not have sufficient time to fulfill the goal of 50 hours of pro-bono work due to their existing workload and commitments to paying clients. 3. Financial pressure: Economic factors may play a role, as lawyers might prioritize billable work to maintain their income level, especially if they are working in smaller firms or as sole practitioners. 4. Personal priorities: Different lawyers may have varying personal goals and professional aspirations, which could influence their willingness to engage in pro bono work. 5. Insufficient pro-bono opportunities: The availability of pro-bono cases in the area may be limited, thereby preventing lawyers from meeting the 50-hour goal even if they are willing to provide such services. Additionally, it is worth noting that the Georgia State Bar's 50-hour pro-bono work is framed as a \\"goal\\" rather than a mandatory requirement. The use of the term \\"goal\\" might implicitly suggest that it is an aspirational target and not an enforced obligation. This could explain why there is potential leniency in terms of penalties or enforcement for not meeting the pro-bono goal. In summary, the premise that only 23 percent of the active lawyers in Georgia met the State Bar's goal of 50 hours of pro-bono service in 2002 provides some support for the hypothesis that \\"There is little penalty for failing to meet the goal.\\" However, it is essential to consider that other factors can also contribute to the low compliance rates observed. The choice of language framing the 50-hour requirement as a goal rather than a regulation could further reinforce the notion that the penalties for not meeting this target may be minimal."},{"question":"Data: Baked Alaska COUNTRY France; Baked Alaska REGION New York; Baked Alaska INGREDIENT Ice cream What would a sentence about this data be like?","response":"Based on the given data, a sentence could be: \\"Baked Alaska, a decadent dessert featuring ice cream as a key ingredient, originated in France and has gained notable popularity in the New York region.\\""},{"question":"Translate to Romanian: Second, I hope that the Competitiveness Pact will prove credible and will also attract non-euro area members.","response":"To translate the given sentence from English to Romanian, here are my steps: 1. First, identify the key components in the sentence, including the subject, object, and any complex phrases or technical jargon. The sentence seems to speak about some established protocol or agreement, referred to as the \\"Competitiveness Pact\\". 2. Next, I will utilize my in-built language processing and translating abilities to convert each part of this sentence into the desired language, Romanian. 3. The translation of the sentence “Second, I hope that the Competitiveness Pact will prove credible and will also attract non-euro area members.” in Romanian is, \\"În al doilea rând, sper că Pactul pentru Competitivitate se va dovedi credibil și va atrage de asemenea membrii care nu fac parte din zona euro.\\" Here's the rationale for each part: \\"Second\\" = \\"În al doilea rând\\". In Romanian, the equivalent of \\"second\\" when transitioning thoughts or points is \\"În al doilea rând\\" \\"I hope\\" = \\"sper\\". The verb \\"to hope\\" translates to \\"sper\\" in Romanian. \\"that the Competitiveness Pact\\" = \\"că Pactul pentru Competitivitate\\". The term \\"Competitiveness Pact\\" is translated as \\"Pactul pentru Competitivitate\\" in Romanian. \\"will prove credible\\" = \\"se va dovedi credibil\\". The future tense construction \\"will prove\\" is translated as \\"se va dovedi\\" and \\"credible\\" is directly translated to \\"credibil\\". \\"and\\" = \\"și\\". The conjunction \\"and\\" is \\"și\\" in Romanian. \\"will also attract\\" = \\"va atrage de asemenea\\". The future tense \\"will also attract\\" can be translated as \\"va atrage de asemenea\\". \\"non-euro area members\\" = \\"membrii care nu fac parte din zona euro\\". \\"Non-euro area members\\" refers to countries that are not a part of the Euro-zone, an economic and monetary union of some European Union countries that have adopted the Euro as their currency. In Romanian, it is translated as \\"membrii care nu fac parte din zona euro\\".

The subject asking for directions: In the premise, the subject is a man, while in the hypothesis, the subject is a woman. 2. The act of asking for directions: Both the premise and the hypothesis describe someone asking for directions. 3. The presence of a bicycle: Both the premise and the hypothesis mention the subject having a bicycle. 4. The people being asked for directions: The premise specifically mentions three older folks on bikes; the hypothesis does not mention this detail. Based on the comparison above, we can see that there are differences between the premise and the hypothesis. The premise involves a man asking for directions, while the hypothesis involves a woman. Additionally, the premise provides details about the individuals being asked for directions, which the hypothesis does not include. In conclusion, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. The two statements involve different subjects (a man versus a woman) and the hypothesis does not include the information about the individuals being asked for directions that is present in the premise."},{"question":"Worldwide, child labor is most prevalent in the agricultural sector, where children are widely used as day laborers.

Plot title: The Nightmare Before Christmas Movie plot: Pumpkin king Jack Skellington (speaking voice Chris Sarandon, singing Danny Elfman), an elegantly attenuated skeleton, has delivered another scary Halloween. But he receives the adulation of Halloweentown with no enthusiasm -- something is missing from Jack's life and he's tired of doing the same old Halloween thing year after year. The missing something might well be Sally (Catherine O'Hara), an animated rag doll who yearns for Jack, but he doesn't notice. (Sally was created by Halloweentown's evil scientist (William Hickey), who keeps her locked up except when she knocks him out by slipping deadly nightshade in his soup.)After pondering his ennui in a cemetery (disturbing Sally, who's replenishing her supply of deadly nightshade), Jack takes his ghostly dog Zero for a walk in the woods. They come upon a strange circle of trees, each with a door representing a holiday. Jack opens the Christmas door and they're sucked in, landing in Christmastown. Jack is curious about everything he sees there, but finds it all delightful and wants to be part of it.Back in Halloweentown Jack calls a town meeting, where he describes what he saw in Christmastown. His people don't seem very impressed, so to draw them in, he makes some elements of Christmas -- including \\"Sandy Claws\\" (Edward Ivory) -- sound scary. Then he announces that they're taking over Christmas and starts assigning jobs. The evil scientist must whip up some reindeer, Halloweentown's top trick-or-treaters are to kidnap Sandy Claws, and Sally's task is to make Jack a red Santa suit. She tries to tell him that co-opting Christmas is a terrible idea, but he's too wrapped up in his enthusiasm to listen.The three trick-or-treaters return triumphantly with the Easter Bunny; Jack sends them back and eventually they bring him Sandy Claws (who surprises Jack by having hands rather than claws). Jack directs the trick-or-treaters to take Sandy Claws away and make him comfortable, but they give him to Oogie Boogie (Ken Page) instead.Meanwhile, Sally has produced a red...

The answer to the question should be unambiguous and a phrase in the paragraph. Most questions can have only one correct answer. Input: Passage: Darren Silverman, Wayne LeFessier, and J.D. McNugent, best friends since fifth grade and Neil Diamond fans throughout, form a Neil Diamond tribute band called \\"Diamonds in the Rough\\". Darren meets a beautiful but domineering psychologist who is showing signs of being emotionally abusive, Judith Fessbeggler, through a chance encounter in a local bar after a band gig. Six weeks into their relationship, Darren asks Judith if whether they could finally have sex, but Judith refuses in the belief that premarital sex is wrong; rather, she suggests non-penetrative sex as alternative, during which Darren gets nothing but a sore jaw. Judith isolates Darren from his friends, demands that Darren quit the band, receive humiliating medical procedures, and attend relationship counseling under her care. Wayne and J.D. decide to save Darren from her by attempting to bribe her, arm wrestle her, and shock her with faked photographs of Darren cheating, all to no avail. The friends, undaunted, try to reunite Darren with his \\"one and only\\", Sandy Perkus, when she returns to Seattle to take her final vows as a nun. When Darren and Judith announce their engagement, Wayne and J.D. kidnap Judith. However, Judith eventually discovers the identity of her captors, and the duo are convinced they cannot let her go.

Shading a tattoo is not so much different from shading a still life. Try to become comfortable shading off body, even if you are already an accomplished artist. Practice with pressure. Pressing hard versus pressing lightly can have dramatically different effects, so you should get a feel for this ahead of time. Also, practice using different strokes to prepare yourself for tattooing different kinds of artwork. Pigs make good human analogues and you can buy a pork belly at a local grocery store or even online. This way you can get a feel for how much pressure to use and what type of strokes to use without worrying about permanently marking a human's skin just yet. Different shader needles result in different effects. For instance, bigger shader needles create a softer shade than smaller needles, which concentrate the color more. Ensure that the needle is protruding no more than 1 mm (0.039 in) for the purposes of shading. A slower speed helps create a softer shade that you can build upon. Using a faster speed creates darker shading. Adjust the speed as needed depending on what type of look and depth the customer wants. Clean the entire area with soap and water, especially if you have already done the lining. Make sure that you have gotten rid of any stencil marks, sticky residue, or grease that will get in the way of your shading process. What is a summary of what this article is about?","response":"This article is about the importance of practice and technique in shading tattoos. It emphasizes developing confidence through off-body shading, understanding the effects of pressure and stroke types, and using pigs as human analogues for practice.

Journalists witnessed Dewani board an Emirates flight to Dubai from Cape Town international airport. He is believed to be travelling via Dubai back to the UK, where he will pick up his life again four years after he was arrested at the request of the South African authorities who wanted to speak to him about his wife’s murder during their honeymoon. Dewani, 34, was escorted through the airport and ushered through security towards his flight. He looked calm and self-composed as he walked into the airport, wearing a tight white shirt and dark jeans, and stared resolutely ahead as police officers helped him through a waiting media scrum. Accompanied by his family and officials from the British consulate in Cape Town, Dewani did not check in directly, but walked straight though to international departures. About a dozen South African police officers were also present to ensure the Briton was able to enter the airport freely. He did not respond to journalists’ questions and stared ahead as photographers and TV crews jostled to take his picture. Dewani is free to return to the UK after the judge, Jeanette Traverso, dismissed the case against him on Monday, describing evidence against him as being “riddled with contradictions”. The collapse of the trial in Cape Town left his wife’s family devastated and Anni’s uncle, Ashok Hindocha, said they were exploring the possibility of taking legal action in the bid to find answers. Hindocha said the decision to halt the trial before Dewani gave evidence meant there were “holes to be filled” in the story about his niece’s final days. Speaking from Sweden, he told the Guardian: “We were hoping for closure. We still do not have that but hope that we will have it in the near future. We need to get the family together here and see what options we have, what possibilities we have to continue the process. “There is still determination to continue. Otherwise we will have sleepless nights for the rest of our lives. We choose determination.” The family will gather in Sweden over Christmas to plan their next moves. “We need to be together; we’ve been away from each other for a long time now – some of the family here, some in the UK, some in South Africa. All we’ve had is telephone contact. We really need to speak all together and speak to lawyers and see what options we have.” Hindocha said the family’s “number one” option was some sort of legal action in the UK. Hindocha said Dewani, whose legal team said in court that he was bisexual, had lied to the family and to Anni about his sexuality. “He lied the moment he told Anni that he loved her and they were in a serious relationship. He lied to the priest in India [where the couple married]. He should have spoken the truth and said: ‘Look Anni, I love you but I’m gay, bisexual.’ I think that is a crucial thing. When you go into a long-term relationship you must be honest.” Of the legal process in Cape Town, he said: “We didn’t get the full story out of South Africa. The judge wouldn’t allow it. There were crucial points to be debated.” He conceded there were holes in the evidence of taxi driver Zola Tongo. “But I’m sure many of those holes could have been filled if Shrien had been cross-examined. We never got the answers. We never got the chance to know. He’s never been cross-examined. The judge in South Africa bought everything that Shrien’s lawyer said.” Asked about what he thought of the image of Dewani leaving South Africa via Cape Town airport, Hindocha said: “We never said who is guilty, who is not guilty. Our objective has been that we want to know the truth. We did not get it from South Africa. We are hoping in the near future to get this truth.” Title:","response":"\\"Shrien Dewani Acquitted and Departs South Africa: Wife's Family Seeks Further Legal Action for Closure\\""},{"question":"Here's a complex question that requires someone to reason about the input, can you answer it?

He popularized the classification of birds on the basis of the quinarian system. - William Sharp Macleay or McLeay (21 July 1792 26 January 1865) was a British civil servant and entomologist. - Johann Jakob Kaup ( April 10 , 1803 - July 4 , 1873 ) was a German naturalist . A proponent of natural philosophy , he believed in an innate mathematical order in nature and he attempted biological classifications based on the Quinarian system . - Philosophy (from Greek , \\"philosophia\\", literally \\"love of wisdom\\") is the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570 c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)? Do humans have free will? - Johann Jakob Kaup (10 April 1803 4 July 1873) was a German naturalist. A proponent of natural philosophy, he believed in an innate mathematical order in nature and he attempted biological classifications based on the Quinarian system. Biography. He was born at Darmstadt. After studying at Göttingen and Heidelberg he spent two years at Leiden, where his attention was specially devoted to the amphibians and fishes. He then returned to Darmstadt as an assistant in the grand ducal museum, of which in 1840 he became inspector. In 1829 he published \\"Skizze zur Entwickelungsgeschichte der europäischen Thierwelt\\", in which he regarded the animal world as developed from lower to higher forms, from the amphibians through the birds to the beasts of prey; but subsequently he repudiated this work as a youthful indiscretion, and on the publication of Darwin's \\"Origin of Species\\" he declared himself against its doctrines. The extensive fossil deposits in the neighbourhood of Darmstadt gave him ample opportunities for palaeontological inquiries, and he gained considerable reputation by his \\"Beiträge zur näheren Kenntniss der urweltlichen Säugethiere\\" (18551862). He also wrote \\"Classification der Säugethiere und Vögel\\" (1844), and, with Heinrich Georg Bronn, \\"Die Gavial-artigen Reste aus dem Lias\\" (18421844). - The Quinarian system was a method of zoological classification which had a brief period of popularity in the mid 19th century, especially among British naturalists. It was largely developed by the entomologist William Sharp MacLeay in 1819. The system was further promoted in the works of Nicholas Aylward Vigors, William John Swainson and Johann Jakob Kaup. Swainson's work on ornithology gave wide publicity to the idea. The system had opponents even before the publication of Charles Darwin's \\"On the Origin of Species\\" (1859 ) which paved the way for evolutionary trees. - Natural philosophy or philosophy of nature (from Latin \\"philosophia naturalis\\") was the philosophical study of nature and the physical universe that was dominant before the development of modern science.

Movie title: Saigo no Yakusoku Movie plot: Saigo no Yakusoku (The Last Promise) is a Japanese TV film drama special starring the members of the boy band \\"Arashi\\" in their first acting project together in nearly ten years. The story begins by the introduction of five seemingly very different young men and their reasons for being at the Energy Bio Corporation building: janitor Satoru Mashiko (Satoshi Ohno), motorcycle courier Nozomu Got (Jun Matsumoto), coffee shop employee Akira Tanada (Masaki Aiba), insurance salesman Yukio Tomizawa (Sho Sakurai) and security center employee Shji Yamagiwa (Kazunari Ninomiya). Without warning, a masked gunman suddenly appears on the TV monitors in the lobbies on each floor of the high rise and announces that he and his allies have hijacked the building, everyone inside is a hostage, and that a bomb that will go off in ninety minutes should Energy Bio Corporation President Niimi (Masahiko Tsugawa) not arrive with the ransom. Before she is locked in the rest of the hostages in the fifth floor lobby, Yuriko Niimi (Meisa Kuroki), the daughter of the president, manages to slip away into the stairwell of the building along with motorcycle courier Got. Prior to the lockdown by the masked men, coffee shop employee Tanada found a hiding place in a nearby supply room and has been keeping in contact by cell phone with Niimi and chief detective Genji Morozumi (Yukiya Kitamura) at the police station. Meanwhile, Yuriko quickly collects company data that is worth more than the ransom money. She confesses to Got that she believes her father isn't concerned for her safety at all and that he's only interested in saving his company. In turn, Got reveals a bit of his own past and how his trusted friend died ten years ago. The electricity in the building is momentarily cut off, which allows most of the hostages to escape. This gives security manager Shinichir Okanaka (Naohito Fujiki) the opportunity to distract the gunmen while security employee Yamagiwa opens the doors on the second floor, allowing more hostages to escape after the power...

McKinney details her upbringing as a charismatic young beauty queen with a self-reported IQ of 168. In search of a \\"clean-cut, all-American boy\\" for a potential husband, McKinney is introduced to Kirk Anderson, a young Mormon man on the eve of his religious mission. McKinney states that she and Anderson fell madly in love and that they were engaged to be married, but that she mistrusted the Mormon church and its hold over Anderson, declaring the church to be a \\"cult\\" that had \\"brainwashed\\" him. Former Mormon turned activist Troy Williams offers insight into Mormon practices, beliefs, and attitudes to explain how Mormonism might seem cult-like to one not raised in the religion.

Do you think sex will ever become obsolete? Please tell me if those questions are the same.","response":"The two questions you ask, \\"Do you think sex will eventually become obsolete?\\" and \\"Do you think sex will ever become obsolete?\\" are essentially asking the same thing. They both inquire about the possibility of sex becoming obsolete in the future. Although the phrasing differs slightly, the core idea behind both questions is identical. Now, let me delve into a comprehensive answer to the question at hand. Sex has been an essential aspect of life and reproduction for most species on Earth, including humans, for millions of years. However, as a result of technological advances and social shifts, it's valid to ponder whether or not sex may become obsolete in the future. To consider this possibility, we must examine various factors that could contribute to diminishing the role of sex in society or making it irrelevant altogether. 1. Reproductive technologies: Advances in reproductive technologies, such as In-Vitro Fertilization (IVF) and artificial insemination (AI), have already eased the reliance on traditional sexual intercourse for procreation. In the future, the development of artificial wombs could further remove the need for sex in the process of human reproduction. 2. Genetic engineering: With the advent of technologies such as CRISPR-Cas9, researchers can now edit genes in living organisms, which could allow future generations to design their offspring and eliminate genetic disorders. This process might make sexual reproduction less necessary, as it allows for more control over offspring traits and characteristics. 3. Changing human relationships: The growing popularity of virtual relationships and increasing acceptance of alternative relationship models, such as polyamorous or asexual partnerships, could potentially reduce the importance of traditional sexual relationships in society. Furthermore, advancements in artificial intelligence and robotics have led to the development of sex robots, which could substitute human sexual partners for some individuals. 4. Overpopulation: Concerns about overpopulation and strains on our planet's resources could lead to cultural shifts where people opt for alternative methods of reproduction or choose not to reproduce at all. Despite these factors, it's important to address some counterpoints that suggest sex will not become entirely obsolete: 1. Biological and emotional aspects: Sex serves not only a reproductive purpose but also a crucial role in bonding and emotional connection between individuals. The release of neurochemicals such as oxytocin during sexual activities contributes to feelings of attachment and contentment, which would be difficult to replicate through technology or alternative methods completely. 2. Cultural significance: Sex has held a significant cultural and symbolic importance across societies, religions, and periods in human history. The chances are that sexual practices will continue to adapt and change rather than becoming obsolete. 3. Diversity of human desires: Humans possess a wide range of sexual desires, preferences, and kinks. Technology may not be able to satisfy all these nuanced experiences fully. Similarly, the quest for intimacy and human connection would likely continue to drive people to engage in sexual activities with others. Considering the arguments above, it's unlikely that sex will become entirely obsolete in the foreseeable future. While technology and social changes might decrease the reliance on sex for procreation, its emotional, biological, and cultural significance will likely ensure that it remains an important aspect of human lives. However, it's crucial to recognize that advancements in technology and scientific knowledge will continue to shape and transform our understanding of sex and human relationships in ways we may not yet be able to predict."},{"question":"Death toll from flooding in southern Brazil reaches 116; 31 people missing.
