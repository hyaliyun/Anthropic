Trump will not discuss with Kim at the at the Singapore meeting atrocities in North Korea (2). Trump will confront Kim at the Singapore meeting regarding atrocities in North Korea (3). Trump will congratulate Kim for his ethics at the Singapore meeting (4). not enough information Given those answer options, answer the question: SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — North Korea human rights advocates are considering more practical ways to reform the repressive practices of the Kim Jong Un government, as denuclearization talks continue to end the country’s economic and diplomatic isolation. Rights activists hold out hope that U.S. President Donald Trump will confront Kim at their expected Singapore meeting in June about ongoing atrocities in North Korea, including a network of political prison camps and widespread government sanctioned abuses in the country. Benedict Rogers, with Christian Solidarity Worldwide, a religious freedom oriented organization, urges President Trump to emulate former President Ronald Reagan who once publicly called on the leader of the Soviet Union to tear down the Berlin Wall that separated democratic West Germany and the Communist East. “Mr. Trump’s message should be, Mr. Kim if you seek peace, come to the gates of the prison camps, open the prison camps, tear down the walls of the prison camps,” said Rogers at a North Korea human rights conference in Seoul on Thursday. It is unclear if human rights will be part of the agenda at the U.S.-North Korea nuclear summit, if it happens. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and high-ranking North Korean official Kim Yong Chol have been meeting this week in New York to overcome the main obstacle to the summit; the gap between the U.S. demand for rapid and complete denuclearization and North Korea’s more phased in approach that would provide early sanctions relief. Brad Adams, the Asia director at the advocacy group Human Rights Watch said in a statement on Thursday, “Whatever the outcome of nuclear talks, human rights-related sanctions should remain in effect until North Korea changes the way it treats its people.” The United Nations has passed 13 resolutions addressing human rights abuses in North Korea, most recently in March of this year at the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva.

The activists also hope that Trump would emulate former President Ronald Reagan's diplomacy, making the case for human rights improvements alongside calls for other changes.

What is the answer??","response":"To solve the equation 148*w - 78*w - 16 = 69*w + 10 for w, follow these steps: Step 1: Combine like terms on both sides of the equation. On the left side, we have two w terms: 148*w and -78*w. Combining them, we get (148-78)*w = 70*w. So the equation becomes: 70*w - 16 = 69*w + 10 Step 2: Isolate the w term. To do this, subtract 69*w from both sides of the equation to gather the w terms on one side: 70*w - 69*w - 16 = 10 (70-69)*w - 16 = 10 1*w - 16 = 10 Step 3: Solve for w. Now, we just need to solve for w by isolating it on one side of the equation.

As they make their way toward the undertaker's establishment to pay their respects to the deceased, a reporter (Joseph Hoover) and his editor, Maxwell Scott (Carleton Young) approach and ask Stoddard to explain why a United States Senator would make the long journey from Washington just to attend the funeral of a local rancher. Stoddard's story flashes back 25 years to his arrival in Shinbone as a young, idealistic attorney. His stagecoach is robbed by a gang of outlaws led by Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin). When Stoddard takes Valance to task for robbing a widow of her heirloom, he is brutally whipped and left for dead. When Doniphon finds and brings him into town, restaurant owner Peter Ericson (John Qualen), his wife Nora (Jeanette Nolan), and employee Hallie tend to his injuries, and explain that Shinbone's townsfolk are regularly victimized by Valance. Link Appleyard (Andy Devine), the town marshal, has neither the courage nor the gunfighting skills to challenge Valance; Doniphon (who loves Hallie and plans to ask her to marry him) is the only man willing to stand up to him.

Force, Doniphon explains, is the only thing Valance understands; he advises Stoddard to either flee the territory or buy a gun. Stoddard maintains he will do neither; he is an advocate for justice under the law, not brute force.

Using skeletal muscle in this way increases its size and strength. In exercises such as running, the cardiac muscle contracts faster and the heart pumps more blood. Using cardiac muscle in this way increases its strength and efficiency. Continued exercise is necessary to maintain bigger, stronger muscles. If you don’t use a muscle, it will get smaller and weaker—so use it or lose it. Please answer this question : Which brother had smaller muscles? Answer:","response":"Based on the given information, it is not possible to definitively determine which brother had smaller muscles as both types of exercises have different effects on muscles and their development. Bill, who focused on weight lifting, primarily developed his skeletal muscles. This type of exercise promotes muscle growth in terms of size and strength. As a result, his skeletal muscles would be bigger and stronger compared to someone who doesn't engage in resistance training. On the other hand, Bob, who chose running, focused on developing his cardiac muscle. This type of exercise strengthens the heart and increases its efficiency in pumping blood. While it doesn't specifically target muscle growth like weightlifting, consistent running can lead to improved cardiovascular health and endurance. However, it is important to note that running can also lead to the development of leg muscles, but the overall size and strength gained might be lesser compared to weightlifting. In conclusion, without more specific information about the brothers' overall muscle development and the muscles being compared, it is not possible to definitively say which brother had smaller muscles. The type of muscles involved and the extent of their exercise routines would play a crucial role in determining their individual muscle sizes."},{"question":"Can the IRS share information obtained through a IRS summons with other government agencies? Information like bank statements, etc. What agencies can access my income on the IRS? Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","response":"The two questions you have asked are distinct but related, as they both involve sharing taxpayers' information between the IRS and other government agencies. 1. Can the IRS share information obtained through an IRS summons with other government agencies? Information like bank statements, etc. The IRS, in conducting its operations and examinations, can use a summons to obtain a wide variety of records, including bank statements, from various individuals and entities, such as taxpayers, accountants, and other third parties. However, the IRS is subject to legal restrictions on disclosing any tax-related information collected during its operations, including information from a summons, to other government agencies or the public. Under Internal Revenue Code §6103, tax return information is strictly confidential and can only be shared with other government agencies in limited circumstances. These circumstances include instances where there is statutory authority or a specific legal exception that permits or requires the IRS to disclose the information to another agency. Various types of federal and state agencies may lawfully receive tax-related information from the IRS under certain conditions. For example, tax information can be shared with certain federal agencies to investigate or prosecute non-tax crimes, but only when they request the information and adhere to specific legal procedures. Furthermore, the IRS can share tax information with state and local tax agencies, as well as some non-tax agencies, as long as there are established tax administration or information sharing agreements in place. It is important to note that unauthorized disclosure of tax-related information is a federal crime punishable by fines and imprisonment. However, if a government agency receives information through authorized channels, it is generally permitted to use it according to the scope and purpose stated in the authorizing statute. 2. What agencies can access my income on the IRS? Certain federal, state, and local government agencies can access income information from the IRS, provided they meet the relevant requirements under law or have specific agreements in place with the IRS. Some of these agencies include: - The Social Security Administration (SSA), which can access income tax information to administer programs like Social Security and Medicare. - The Department of Justice (DOJ), which can request tax information during specific circumstances, such as investigating or prosecuting tax or non-tax crimes. - State tax agencies that have agreements with the IRS, which allow them to access limited tax information for state tax administration purposes. - Certain state and local agencies administering programs like child support enforcement or public assistance, provided they have information sharing agreements in place with the IRS. - Other federal agencies, in limited cases, where specific statutory authority exists. In summary, the IRS is generally not permitted to share information obtained through a summons with other government agencies unless there is statutory authority or a legal exception in place. Taxpayer information, including income, is protected by strict confidentiality rules under the Internal Revenue Code. However, under specific circumstances and authorized conditions, some federal, state, and local agencies can access tax-related information from the IRS. The two questions you raised involve sharing taxpayers' information between the IRS and other agencies; however, they address different aspects of information sharing. The first question concerns the sharing of information obtained through a summons, while the second question focuses on agencies that can access individuals' income information with the IRS."},{"question":"Is this product review positive?

For their study,he and his colleagues randomly divide 565 preschoolers into two groups.In one group,parents recorded notes about kids' normal TV viewing,without receiving any guidelines to reduce or change those habits.In the other group,researchers made visits and calls and sent monthly newsletters encouraging parents to replace violent TV with educational programming.After six and 12 months,parents reported their kid's angry,aggressive or anxious behaviors on a questionnaire.At both time points,children in the TV intervention program had slightly fewer problems than those in the comparison group.Boys in lowincome families seemed to benefit most from the change in programming,the researchers found. \\"The point is,this is something that is as effective as other things we do to try to guide behavior in children,and it's fairly simple,\\" Christakis said. Another study published in Pediatrics found the more TV kids and teens watched,the more likely they were to have a crime or other problems in society.Children may imitate violence they see--or more time in front of the TV could simply mean less communication with peers and families,and worse performance in school.

What is an example of a web server? OK. Let's think. My stream of consciousness:","response":"Apache, IIS, and Nginx are three popular web servers widely used on the internet. A web server is a software or hardware system that accepts requests from clients (usually web browsers) and returns the requested resources, such as web pages, images, or other files. The communication between clients and web servers generally follows the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) standard. Let me provide a brief overview of each of these web servers: 1. Apache HTTP Server (Apache): Developed and maintained by the Apache Software Foundation, Apache is an open-source web server that is immensely popular for its flexibility, power, and commitment to an open-source community.

Several kilometers deep, they obscure the underlying topography. Only nunataks protrude from their surfaces. The only extant ice sheets are the two that cover most of Antarctica and Greenland. They contain vast quantities of fresh water, enough that if both melted, global sea levels would rise by over 70 m (230 ft). Portions of an ice sheet or cap that extend into water are called ice shelves; they tend to be thin with limited slopes and reduced velocities. Narrow, fast-moving sections of an ice sheet are called ice streams. In Antarctica, many ice streams drain into large ice shelves. Some drain directly into the sea, often with an ice tongue, like Mertz Glacier.\\" Answer: The answer is:","response":"The largest ice sheet in the north is the Greenland Ice Sheet. Located in the Arctic region, this massive ice sheet covers approximately 1.7 million square kilometers (656,000 square miles) and is up to 3 kilometers (1.9 miles) thick in some areas. It accounts for roughly 10% of the Earth's glacial ice and contains an incredible amount of fresh water. If the entire Greenland Ice Sheet were to melt, global sea levels would rise by an estimated 7.2 meters (23.6 feet). The Greenland Ice Sheet is the second largest ice sheet on Earth, with the largest being the Antarctic Ice Sheet that covers most of Antarctica. While the Antarctic Ice Sheet is significantly larger than the Greenland Ice Sheet, it is located in the Southern Hemisphere, not the north. The Greenland Ice Sheet is not only the largest ice sheet in the north but also the largest ice mass outside Antarctica. The Greenland Ice Sheet plays a crucial role in the global climate system by influencing ocean circulation, sea level, and weather patterns. It is also an important area of study for scientists who monitor its health and stability in response to climate change. As the Earth's temperatures continue to rise, the Greenland Ice Sheet has experienced an increase in surface melting and a reduction in mass balance, contributing to rising sea levels and posing potential threats to coastal communities worldwide. In addition to the main Greenland Ice Sheet, there are several smaller ice caps and glaciers found throughout the Arctic region. These glacial features can also be found in northern Canada, Alaska, Russia, and various Arctic islands such as Svalbard and Iceland. However, the Greenland Ice Sheet remains the most significant and extensive ice mass in the north."},{"question":"Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: For years, Aimee Lind, a librarian at the Getty Research Institute, has been struggling with ways to make architecture archives more accessible to users. To help solve this problem, she co-founded the California Architecture Archives Network (or CalArchNet) with her Cal Poly SLO colleague Jessica Holada. Together they have organized a series of one-day mini-conferences designed to foster dialogue and collaboration among librarians, archivists, and curators at California institutions that house architecture archives. The goal of these semiannual meetings is to create a space for convergence among professionals who intersect with architectural archives in different ways. Architecture archives, often containing large drawings and scale models, present unique problems due to their size and fragility. CalArchNet participants are interested in improving the overall user experience for visitors to the archives by looking for solutions to obstacles to access. This space for an informal exchange of ideas provides an opportunity to be transparent about the challenges repositories face when managing and processing architecture holdings, as well as encourages investigation and experimentation into ways new technologies may help to solve accessibility issues, such as improved interaction with digitized collections via the IIIF protocol or 3D-scanned facsimile models and virtual walk-throughs. October 27 marked the third meeting of CalArchNet, held at the Palm Springs Art Museum, Architecture and Design Center, with representatives from 13 institutions in attendance. Topics discussed included historic site preservation research methodology, leveraging statewide resources to enhance discovery of collections, security considerations, GIS mapping technologies, and the use of linked open data to make connections between collections.

Among them is British journalist David Frost, currently recording a talk show in Australia, who decides to interview Nixon. Nixonâs literary agent, Irving \\"Swifty\\" Lazar, believes the interview would be an opportunity for Nixon to salvage his reputation, and to make some money. Nixon ultimately demands 600,000, and Frost accepts. After persuading his friend and producer John Birt that the interviews would be a success, Frost and Birt travel to California to meet with Nixon. On the plane to California, Frost flirts with a young woman called Caroline Cushing, and they begin a relationship. Frost struggles to sell the interviews to U.S. networks, and decides to finance the project with private money and syndicate the broadcast of the interviews. He hires two investigators â Bob Zelnick and James Reston Jr. â to help him prepare, along with Birt. Frost is not clear on what he wants from the interview, and Reston encourages him to aim for a confession from Nixon. Under the watchful eye of Nixon's post-presidential chief of staff, Jack Brennan, Frost and Nixon embark on the first three recording sessions. Restricted by an agreed-upon timeframe and under pressure from his own team to ask the tough questions, Frost struggles to get a word in as Nixon dominates with lengthy and self-serving monologues, fencing ably on Vietnam and boasting about his achievements in foreign policy. Behind the scenes, Frost's editorial team is nervous about his interviewing technique, and angry that Nixon appears to be exonerating himself. Four days before the final session, which will center on Watergate, Frost receives a phonecall from an inebriated Nixon. In a drunken rant, Nixon declares that they both know the final interview will make or break their careers, and compares himself to Frost, insisting that they both came from humble backgrounds and had to battle the elite to make it to the top of...","response":"In the movie Frost/Nixon, British journalist David Frost is interviewing former U.S. President Richard Nixon.

Cinema was one of his biggest passions (he penned a vast worldwide dictionary of films) and so he was bound to wield a camera at least one time in his life. But the films he left garnered lukewarm reviews: \\"Tiré à Part\\" (1996) in spite of Terence Stamp's sensational performance was very caricatured in the depiction of the characters, \\"une Affaire De Goût\\" (2000) was a slick affair even if Bernard Giraudeau delivered a perverse performance, \\"Pas Si Grave\\" (2003) was another let-down and \\"un Petit Jeu Sans Conséquence\\" is as underwhelming as its predecessors. Its comic potential is exploited in a flimsy way. And however, the starting idea let predict a twirling, spiritual comedy. A couple held by Yvan Attal and Sandrine Kiberlain who invited their friends is in full moving in a lascivious mansion. To play with their guests, they pretend to part company with each other. And things don't go as planned because the announcement of their separation doesn't surprise them. The two lovers start to ponder about the validity of their couple. In spite of lush scenery and the promising material he had at his disposal, Rapp's undistinguished directing can't manage to give life to this game with unexpected consequences. The plot follows a well-worn pattern with characters who have specific well-known functions and masks that are unveiled about who they really are. Verbal or situation comic effects often fall flat. A bad editing fades a little more the film with this bad habit from Rapp to abruptly cut many sequences. Even the actors' sincere input in the venture is debatable. They seem to be bored and to recite their texts than to live them, especially Sandrine Kiberlain. The audience is soon caught in a deep torpor.

The reviewer expresses disappointment in Bernard Rapp's film and highlights several shortcomings, such as undistinguished directing, a predictable plot, flat comic effects, poor editing, and the seemingly bored performances by the actors.

Bartlett's decision to deposit stores on the ice ensured that an ice camp, known as \\"Shipwreck Camp\\", was more or less established by the time Karluk sank. Two shelters had been built, one a snow igloo with a canvas roof, the other constructed from packing cases. To the latter was added a kitchen with a large stove rescued from Karluk's engine room. A small, separate shelter was built for the five Inuit, and a rough perimeter created from coal bags and assorted containers. In McKinlay's words, the camp provided \\"substantial and comfortable houses on which we could rely for shelter for a long time.\\" Stores were plentiful, and the party was able to eat well. Much of the time in the first days of the camp was spent preparing and adjusting clothing and sleeping gear, in readiness for the forthcoming march to Wrangel Island. The ice drift was slowly moving the camp in the direction of the island, but as yet there was insufficient daylight to attempt the march.Amid this activity Mackay and Murray, now joined by the anthropologist Henri Beuchat, played little part in the general life of the camp and expressed their determination to leave it, independently, as soon as possible. Bartlett wanted to wait for the longer daylight hours of February before attempting the march, but was persuaded by McKinlay and Mamen to send a trailbreaking group to set up an advance camp on Wrangel Island. A party of four, led by Karluk's first officer Alexander Anderson and including crew members Charles Barker, John Brady and Edmund Golightly, left Shipwreck Camp on 21 January with instructions from Bartlett to establish their camp at or near Berry Point on the north shore of Wrangel Island.

Patton leading 90,000 men of the Seventh United States Army in a landing near Gela, Scoglitti, and Licata to support Bernard Montgomery's British 8th Army landings to the north. Initially ordered to protect the British forces' flank, Patton took Palermo after Montgomery's forces were slowed by heavy resistance from troops of Nazi Germany and the Kingdom of Italy. Patton then set his sights on Messina. He sought an amphibious assault, but it was delayed by lack of landing craft and his troops did not land in Santo Stefano until 8 August, by which time the Germans and Italians had already evacuated the bulk of their troops to mainland Italy. Throughout the campaign, Patton's troops were heavily engaged by German and Italian forces as they pushed across the island.Patton had already developed a reputation in the U.S. Army as an effective, successful, and hard-driving commander, punishing subordinates for the slightest infractions but also rewarding them when they performed well.

The answer is:","response":"The foil cylinder of diameter 1cm will have greater resistance than the foil cylinder of diameter 10cm. To understand this, we need to discuss the basic principles of resistance. The resistance (R) of a wire or conductor depends on its length (L), cross-sectional area (A), and the material's resistivity (ρ). The relationship between these factors is given by the formula: R = (ρ * L) / A In the context of the problem, we have two aluminum foil cylinders with different diameters but made of the same material (aluminum). Therefore, the resistivity (ρ) of the material remains constant in both cases. Let's recall the given information: \\"The thinner the wire, the more resistance it offers.\\" A thinner wire corresponds to a smaller diameter, which means a smaller cross-sectional area. As we can see from the formula, if the area (A) decreases, the resistance (R) increases, assuming the length and resistivity remain constant. Therefore, since the foil cylinder with a diameter of 1cm is \\"thinner\\" compared to the one with a diameter of 10cm, it will have a smaller cross-sectional area and, as a result, offers greater resistance."},{"question":"Here is a premise: I left the cockpit, venturing outside.

He rose to fame with the progressive metal band Queensryche, who had commercial success with their 1988 album Operation: Mindcrime and 1990 album Empire. Tate is ranked fourteenth on Hit Parader's list of the 100 Greatest Metal Vocalists of All Time. Context: Since 2012, Geoff Tate has attracted some controversy, mostly in part to the circumstances surrounding the split with Queensryche (when his bandmates, guitarist Michael Wilton, bassist Eddie Jackson and drummer Scott Rockenfield fired him from the band and replaced him with then-Crimson Glory vocalist Todd La Torre). Tate attracted negative attention for spitting on and physically assaulting Wilton and Rockenfield before and during a show in Sao Paulo, Brazil, on April 14, 2012. Then, during a later show the Rocklahoma Festival on May 26, Tate commented to an unresponsive crowd \\"You guys suck,\\" which his bandmates, as well as some fans, felt was an insult, but Tate would later defend his actions by stating in a court declaration \\"I was not insulting the audience. I was trying to motivate or excite them.\\" He finds that this was used against him in the lawsuit: \\"It's just something that the other guys [in the band] and their team of people are trying to twist into a 'Geoff doesn't respect the fans' type of thing.\\" He elaborated on that in an interview, saying: \\"I say that stuff all the time, you know. It's part of being a front man, you know. You got to motivate the audience, you know. And I say things to get people motivated. I think... I say things to push people's buttons to get them to react. It's part of a performance. But if you're in a lawsuit, of course, these things get taken out of context and put into a new format. I guess the objective is to make me look like I don't care about the fans. Which is unfortunate.\\" During the \\"Operation: Mindcrime Anniversary Tour\\" tour, ten minutes into a show in St. Charles, Illinois on May 17, 2013, Tate grabbed an audience member's smartphone, turned around, and threw it over his shoulder into the crowd.On the subject, Tate commented: \\"Some actions that I have become very normal with as a performer are getting scrutinized and manipulated to paint a picture of me [to make me look like a bad guy].\\" He accused the uploader of the video showing this footage to have manipulated the footage to make it appear as though he threw it, as he insists that he accidentally dropped it while trying to take pictures of the fan and of himself. Tate has commented on these controversies in relation to the Queensryche lawsuits, saying: \\"I guess that's the nature of being in a lawsuit. Now you have to watch what you say, and trust that who you are talking to does the right thing, you know, and push the information out in the way that it happened. And not try to construct something different, you know?\\" Question: Did he comment on the situation? Answer:","response":"Yes, Geoff Tate did comment on the situation. He explained that some of his actions, like trying to motivate the audience, can be taken out of context. He also mentioned that during a performance, he sometimes says things to push people's buttons and get them to react. Geoff believes that these things are being twisted to make him look like he doesn't care about the fans.

However, this negativity is somewhat restricted with the use of the word \\"kinda,\\" which shows that the subjectivity of this opinion may not be that strong. 3. \\"and depressing\\" - Here we see a stronger negative emotion attributed to the given weather condition. The word \\"depressing\\" implies that the cold and cloudy weather negatively affected the person's emotional state and overall experience of the day. Taking these points into consideration, the sentiment of this tweet is not entirely negative, but it does express a personal dissatisfaction with the cold and cloudy weather.

(AP) — Melania Trump encouraged technology and social media companies Monday to provide more opportunities for young people to share ideas for how to be good citizens online. Pressing forward with an effort to combat youth cyberbullying, the first lady said that while most children are more aware than some adults of the \\"benefits and pitfalls\\" of social media, adults must still do \\"all we can\\" to provide them with information and tools for safe online habits. With her brief remarks, Mrs. Trump helped open a federal conference on cyberbullying in Maryland. Neither she nor any of those who spoke during morning sessions mentioned President Donald Trump and his aggressive use of Twitter to berate his foes and call them names. The first lady instead spoke highly of a group of students she recently met who participate in Microsoft's Council for Digital Good. The students provide the computer software maker with ideas and feedback for Microsoft's policy work on youth-centered online safety. She told scores of people attending the Federal Partners on Bullying Prevention summit in a conference room at the Health Resources and Services Administration building in Rockville how impressed she was by the students' \\"deep understanding of how important it is to be safe.\\" She said she was also \\"inspired by their sincere commitment to reducing peer-to-peer bullying through kindness and open communication.\\" \\"I encourage technology and social media companies, schools and community groups, to establish more opportunities for children such as Microsoft's Council for Digital Good,\\" the first lady said. \\"By listening to children's ideas and concerns, I believe adults will be better able to help them navigate this often-difficult topic.\\" \\"Let's face it: Most children are more aware of the benefits and pitfalls of social media than some adults, but we still need to do all we can to provide them with information and tools for successful and safe online habits.\\" After speaking, Mrs. Trump took a seat in the front row and listened to a panel discussion featuring representatives of Facebook, Google, Twitter and the nonprofit Family Online Safety Institute talk about how they're responding to the issue. As the panelists spoke, Trump sent fresh tweets about John Brennan, calling him \\"the worst CIA Director in our country's history\\" and a political \\"hack.\\" Brennan, who led the CIA under President Barack Obama, a Democrat, has been an outspoken critic of Trump, a Republican, over his performance and behavior as president. Trump recently revoked Brennan's security clearance. The first lady's appearance came as part of her campaign to help children \\"Be Best,\\" which also includes an emphasis on child well-being overall and opioid addition. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said the Health Resources and Services Administration, which his department oversees, began an anti-bullying campaign in 2001 to help raise awareness. He said one in five children experience bullying, and that 16 percent of children currently are victims of cyberbullying. \\"We need to recognize that bullying is bullying wherever it occurs,\\" Azar said. \\"And we need to stop it.\\" The conference also heard from Joseph Grunwald, who described his experiences being bullied during middle and high school. Grunwald said the bullying started as taunts on the school bus and had grown into physical harassment by high school, including violence. He did not go into detail. As the same time, he said he was also being harassed on social media. \\"Because the bullying was also online, I couldn't escape it, no matter where I was,\\" Grunwald said. ___ Follow Darlene Superville on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/dsupervilleap ||||| (CNN) First lady Melania Trump spoke out against cyberbullying Monday as part of her Be Best campaign, warning against \\"destructive and harmful\\" uses of social media and once again highlighting a messaging rift between the East Wing and the West Wing. \\"In today's global society, social media is an inevitable part of our children's daily lives,\\" Trump said at a cyberbullying summit in Rockville, Maryland. \\"It can be used in many positive ways, but can also be destructive and harmful when used incorrectly.

Despite firing off multiple tweets Monday morning, none were about the first lady's Be Best initiatives or her speech.

The President is proud of her commitment to children and encourages her in all that she does,\\" Grisham said in a statement. Responding to the apparent hypocrisy between the first lady's assertion that social media can be \\"destructive and harmful when used incorrectly\\" and the President's own habits, Grisham deflected. \\"Rather than dissecting her remarks, let's focus on the countless children who struggle w bullying & online safety each day,\\" she tweeted She later described Trump's advocacy against cyberbullying as \\"a sincere campaign meant to help children.\\" During her speech, the first lady acknowledged that children can be more aware of the \\"pitfalls\\" of social media than adults. \\"Let's face it: most children are more aware of the benefits and pitfalls of social media than some adults, but we still need to do all we can to provide them with information and tools for successful and safe online habits,\\" she said.

The agreement came after two weeks of talks between the leaders at the 21st Conference in Paris, France. As part of the Paris agreement, countries said they would cut down on pollution However, according to the terms of the deal, countries that don't do this will not be punished, or fined. Instead,the document is meant to show that governments around the world take climate change seriously and are willing to work together to fight global warming. World leaders have met many times to discuss climate change. But, the 21st Conference of Parties, or COP21, which began on November 30 in Paris, was the first time they agreed on a global, legal pact . Before the conference, each nation was asked to create plans on how to reach the shared goal. The pact that was signed allows countries to decide the best way to cut down their gas pollution. No matter how they decide to go green, each country must report honestly on all of their efforts. Every five years, nations must look at the work they've done and submit new plans on how they will improve over the next five years. In the pact, the countries pledge to limit the amount of greenhouse gases emitted by human activity to the levels that trees,soil and oceans can absorb naturally. It urges countries to spend trillions of dollars on creating new energy sources, like solar and wind power. It also requires countries to raise at least 100 billion each year to help developing countries. However, critics of the pact say it is not detailed enough, and doesn't include specifics about how the plan will be enforced and how improvements will be measured. The pact does include one large, specific goal: how countries will aim to keep global temperatures from rising more than 3. 60degF(20degC) by 2100. Nonetheless,the agreement is considered by many world leaders to be a major victory. The U. N. has been working more than two decades to convince governments to work...

If not treated, individuals can experience muscle weakness and increased heart rate (which could lead to a heart attack). Many sports drinks can be consumed to restore electrolytes quickly in the body. Now, I have a new situation: Two teams of runners took part in a study about exercise. Red team ran 10 km in the heat, while Green team ran the same distance in the morning in cool weather. The Red team experienced more runners with health problems. Answer this question please: Which team had fewer runners with muscle weakness?

Article: Japanese sailor Kenichi Horie has finished a 110-day solo voyage across the Pacific Ocean in a boat pushed by sea waves to win another world first. Weak waves and ocean water movements made his arrival late, which was going to be in late May. \\"When waves were weak, the boat slowed down. That's a problem that needs to be solved,\\" the adventure told reporters from his boat in western Japan. His 9.5-meter-long boat can move like a dolphin's tail, and it rises or falls with the waves. Horie reached his destination in the channel between the main Japanese islands just before midnight after covering about 7,000 kilometers from Hawaii. Horie first made world record in 1962 when, at the age of 23, he became the first person to sail alone across the Pacific. He made the three-month voyage from his hometown in spite of breaking Japanese law, which did not allow his citizens to sail on their own out of the country, and without a passport or money. He was arrested upon arrival in San Francisco but the city mayor freed him, gave him a 30-day visa and made him an honorary citizen. News of his achievement made him a hero back home in Japan and his book of the voyage In the Pacific was made into a film. Since then, he has completed many sailing trips across the Pacific and around the world. After his latest adventure with an environmentally friendly theme, Horie planned to return to his hometown on Sunday. He said, \\"Throughout history, mankind has used wind for power, but no one has appeared to be serious about wave power.\\" Horie told the reporter, \\"I think I'm a lucky boy as this wave power system has remained untouched in fact.\\" Question: The author wrote the article mainly to _ . - start an ocean crossing movement - tell us a piece of interesting news - make Horie known to the world - encourage people to learn from Horie A:","response":"tell us a piece of interesting news"},{"question":"Add punctuation to the following sentence: Approve Approve the message sending it on to the list","response":"Step 1: Identify the different parts of the sentence. The sentence appears to include an initial statement (Approve) and a subsequent action (Approve the message, sending it on to the list). Step 2: Add punctuation to separate the two statements. A period (.) can be used to separate the related, but independent, statements.

Yet, in other types of relationships, the ability to see each other physically can keep insecurities at bay. In long-distance relationships when you’re only seeing your partner every couple of weeks or months, it’s easy to become envious of the time they are spending with others. Unless your partner has given you any reason to have distrust, give them the benefit of the doubt and try to keep your jealousies in check. Checking their Facebook or worrying about who’s talking in the background during a phone call can cause resentment. Reconsider if a long-distance relationship is a good choice for you if you continuously have trouble trusting. Normal, face-to-face relationships count on seeing one another and engaging regularly to keep the spark alive. Since you and your partner don’t have the option to do that, it’s important that you are consistent and committed about putting time and effort into the relationship. Establish a pattern or “routine” with your partner in which the both of you can depend on the other to be a constant part of life. Coordinate your schedules so that you know when the other is available. Make an effort to stick to your “routine,” such as calling each other around the same time each day. Maintaining satisfaction on both accounts relies on frequent communication. In order to feel fulfilled in your long-distance relationship it’s essential that the two of you are actively involved in one another’s lives. This doesn’t mean you have to talk all day long, but it does mean you should be willing to share what’s going on in your everyday lives, express your thoughts and opinions, and ask for your partner’s input. A successful long-distance relationship equates to both partners having an understanding of the other’s expectations. Being miles apart becomes even more difficult when you don’t know where you stand in the relationship. This creates an environment that is susceptible to distrust, jealousy, and even infidelity. Have a talk with your partner to discuss what both of you want from the relationship. Are you in it for the long haul or just casually seeing how things go? Clearly communicate your expectations to your partner and be willing to listen as he or she does the same. You should also discuss romantic boundaries. Some couples opt to allow each other to have physical relationships with others if they are going to be apart for months or years, while other couples would see this as a betrayal. Discuss this with your partner, as you might have different ideas about what is allowed in long-distance You can broach the subject by saying “I really like you and I hope you feel the same. Where do you see us going?” and then being patient as your partner communicates their goals for your long-distance relationship. If your goals do not align, you may have to decide if you want to end the relationship.","response":"Trust is very important for relationships, especially if you live far away from each other. It's normal to feel a little jealous, but try not to worry too much about your partner's friends or check their social media all the time. Talk with your partner about your feelings and plans for the relationship. It's good to have a routine, like calling each other every day at the same time, so you both stay connected. Share what happens in your day and ask your partner about theirs. It's also important to talk about what both of you expect from this relationship, so you both know what's okay and what's not."},{"question":"Write an article that answers the following question: How many yards was the longest touchdown?","response":"Title: The Longest Touchdown Ever: A Record-Breaking Yardage! Hey there, little ones! Today, we are going to talk about an amazing achievement in the world of football. We will learn about the longest touchdown ever! Isn't that exciting? But before we start, let's quickly learn what a 'touchdown' is. In football, when a player carries the ball into the opponent's end zone or catches it there, we call it a touchdown. It's very exciting and a great way to score points for your team! Now, let's talk about the longest touchdown in the history of football. It happened during a game between two professional football teams, and it was truly amazing! The longest touchdown ever recorded was 109 yards long! Wow! That's almost as long as a football field! This incredible feat was accomplished by two players: Antonio Cromartie and Cordarrelle Patterson. They both did it in separate games, so they share the record. Antonio Cromartie managed this fantastic play on November 4, 2007, when he was playing for the San Diego Chargers against the Minnesota Vikings. Cordarrelle Patterson followed in his footsteps on October 27, 2013, as part of the Minnesota Vikings playing against the Green Bay Packers. Just imagine, these two talented players had to run the whole length of the football field and even a little more to score a touchdown. They were super fast, like superheroes, weren't they?!

The went back on top at last. \\"Yeah, it's pretty cool. That goes without saying,\\" first baseman Aubrey Huff (FSY) said. Huff hit a three-run homer, Buster Posey (FSY) had a solo shot and San Francisco moved into first place in the division race with a 10-2 win over the Los Angeles Dodgers on Thursday night. \\"It says a lot about this club and how hard they've been fighting,\\" manager Bruce Bochy said. \\"It's going to be a tough race, we know it.\\" Jonathan Sanchez (FSY) (11-8) struck out a career-high 12 as the Giants took a half-game lead on the Padres after San Diego lost 4-0 at St. Louis. San Francisco is in sole possession of first place for the first time since May 6. The Giants are trying to end a six-year playoff drought. \\"Hopefully we can stay there all the way until the end,\\" Sanchez said. \\"It feels good to be in first place. We've got a lot of games to go and we've got to keep playing like this if we're going to finish first.\\" Dodgers starter Ted Lilly (FSY) (8-11) was done after 3⅓ innings for his shortest outing of the season. This was just his third loss in nine starts since joining the Dodgers at the trade deadline. Russ Mitchell homered just fair inside the left-field foul pole for his first career hit leading off the fifth for Los Angeles. He had been 0-for-15. \\"The silent treatment is over,\\" Mitchell said of his funk. \\"I was talking to it, hoping it would stay fair.\\" Huff and Posey connected for back-to-back homers in the third, the seventh time the Giants have hit consecutive homers this season. Jose Guillen (FSY) added a two-run drive in the fifth to make it 8-2. It was his 18th home run of the season and second with the Giants. Guillen returned to the starting lineup after missing Wednesday's game with a painful neck. He underwent an MRI exam Thursday and said everything was fine. Freddy Sanchez (FSY) added a two-run double in the eighth. All the offense helped Jonathan Sanchez win his third consecutive decision. The left-hander, who has been one of the Giants' most reliable starters down the stretch, recorded his seventh career game with double-digit strikeouts and fourth of the season. He allowed four hits and one run in seven innings and didn't walk a batter for the second time in his 30 starts. \\"They're on a roll and swinging the bats,\\" Dodgers manager Joe Torre said. \\"Sanchez was terrific.\\" Sanchez's strikeouts were the second-most by a Giant this year. Tim Lincecum (FSY) struck out 13 at Florida on May 4. Sanchez has one motivation to keep throwing strikes: \\"I just want to win it and make the playoffs,\\" he said. The Giants allowed an unearned run in the first, but Sanchez was unfazed and quickly found his groove. \\"It seems like about a month now he's been throwing strikes and getting ahead,\\" Huff said. \\"When he's doing that, he's one of the most dangerous guys on our staff.\\" Lilly was tagged for five runs and seven hits, and he struck out three and walked one.

The teams open the 2011 season facing off for four games at Dodger Stadium from April 1-4, 2011. Los Angeles finished up a 10-game road trip and returned home for a weekend series with the Rockies. Los Angeles faces divisional opponents the rest of the way. Matt Kemp (FSY) struck out in the sixth to match his career high of 153 also done in 2008. NOTES: Torre attended Raiders practice across the Bay in Alameda and spent some time with owner Al Davis in his office. \\"I'll tell you, he's sharp,\\" Torre said. \\"I've known Al a long time. ... It was fun there. You don't realize how big those guys are 'til you're right up next to them.\\" Former Raiders coach John Madden also took Torre around. ... Los Angeles INF Jamey Carroll (FSY) isn't available for a few days because of a sore wrist that he hurt on a swing several days ago. ... Bochy said rookie C Posey could play every day the rest of the way, perhaps getting a break from behind the plate with some starts at first. ...

Trump on Tuesday announced that the United States is ending its participation in the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) that lifted sanctions on Iran in exchange for Tehran limiting its nuclear program, and would re-impose U.S. economic sanctions on Iran. The agreement was negotiated by the administration of Trump’s predecessor, President Barack Obama, and involved five other world powers; Great Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia. Trump’s National Security Adviser John Bolton said the U.S. decision to re-impose sanctions on Iran will set a higher standard for North Korea nuclear talks by sending, “a very clear signal that the United States will not accept inadequate deals.” The U.S. policy reversal on Iran should not seriously impede diplomatic progress underway with North Korea, said Victor Cha, a noted Korea scholar with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “In terms of how the North Koreans would take it, I don’t think they’d take it one way or the other. I don’t think they’d see it as negative or positive because they think they’re different from anybody else anyway. They think they’re a very special case,” Cha said at a CSIS conference this week. While the Iran deal limited that country’s efforts to develop a nuclear bomb, North Korea already possesses 20 to 60 nuclear warheads, according assessments by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency, and between 40 to 100 nuclear development facilities, according a report from the RAND Corporation security research organization.

This task typically involves various steps that call for understanding and working with different physical objects, notably the components of the furniture and the tools required for assembly. To successfully complete this task, you would need to: 1. Identify the components: Start by familiarizing yourself with the various parts and pieces included in the flat-pack kit. These may include wooden or metal panels, screws, nuts, bolts, dowels, brackets, and other connecting elements. Each component will differ in size, shape, and function, and you must be able to identify and discern the purpose of each. 2. Understand the tools required: The assembly process usually demands specific tools such as a screwdriver, hammer, wrench, or Allen key. Recognizing the appropriate tool for each step is crucial to avoid damaging the components or jeopardizing the structural integrity of the finished furniture. 3. Follow the instructions: Most flat-pack kits come with a detailed instruction manual that includes diagrams, measurements, and step-by-step directions. Carefully read the instructions, taking note of how the components should be arranged and joined, and check safety precautions to avoid risks and injuries. 4. Plan the assembly process: Before starting, lay out all the components and tools in an organized manner, ideally in the order they will be used. Make sure you have ample workspace and a clear spot to build the furniture. This aids in efficiently executing each step and lowers the chances of losing or misplacing essential parts. 5. Assembling the furniture: Following the instructions, begin by connecting the various components. During this stage, you must have a mental and physical grasp of how the physical objects interact and fit together. You'll need to ensure a proper alignment of the parts, tighten any screws or bolts securely, and apply the right amount of force to avoid damaging the furniture. 6. Verifying sturdiness and functionality: Once the furniture is fully assembled, it is essential to check if it is stable and functional. In the case of a bookshelf, this involves ensuring that the shelves can carry weight evenly and do not wobble or tilt. If there are any issues, you may need to make adjustments or go back through the assembly process to correct any errors. In summary, the task of assembling a flat-pack piece of furniture necessitates knowledge of the specific physical objects involved, such as their components, the tools to be utilized, and the ways these objects can be effectively and safely incorporated into a cohesive, functioning unit."},{"question":"This text is missing some spaces, please add them: Inseconds,youwilllearnexactlywhattypeofXLAMfileyouhave,thesoftwareprogramassociatedwithyourfile,thepublisherwhocreatedit,itssecuritysafetystatus,andavarietyofotherusefulinformation.","response":"In seconds, you will learn exactly what type of XLAM file you have, the software program associated with your file, the publisher who created it, its security safety status, and a variety of other useful information."},{"question":"What is the market size of wearable cameras? What is the best wearable device on the market or in development? Would you say that these questions are the same?","response":"No, these questions are not the same. They both pertain to the wearable technology industry, but they are seeking information on different aspects of the industry. The first question is about the market size of wearable cameras. To answer it, one needs to research the current estimates provided by industry analysts and market research firms about the total revenue that the wearable camera segment generates annually or is projected to generate in the coming years. Market size can also refer to the total units shipped or sold, and it includes various factors such as geographic segmentation, competitor market share, growth trends, and more. It may also involve examining related data about market drivers, restraints, opportunities, and challenges. As of the time of writing, I do not have access to real-time data, but to give an example, according to a report by Grand View Research, the global wearable camera market size was valued at USD 2.18 billion in 2016 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18.3% from 2017 to 2025. The second question is asking about the best wearable device, either currently on the market or in development. This is a different focus and would need to be addressed by looking at the quality, affordability, durability, design, ease of use, features, customer reviews, and industry expert opinion for various wearable devices, not just cameras. Factors like utility, comfort, battery life, compatibility, and connectivity may also be considered while judging the best among them. Another important aspect to consider is the purpose of the wearable – for example, fitness trackers, smart glasses, smartwatches, healthcare monitors, or wearable cameras. Again, without real-time data, it's difficult to pinpoint the best device, but for example, top contenders in the space could include the Apple Watch in the smartwatch category or the Fitbit Charge in the fitness tracking category. In conclusion, while these two questions both relate to wearable technology, they're tackling the subject from different angles.

Of the 30 clubs currently playing, 23 are in the United States and 7 in Canada. Headquartered in New York City, the NHL is considered to be the premier professional ice hockey league in the world, and one of the major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada. The Stanley Cup, the oldest professional sports trophy in North America, is awarded annually to the league playoff champion at the end of each season. - Edward James Livingstone ( September 12 , 1884 -- September 11 , 1945 ) was a Canadian sports team owner and manager . He was the principal owner of the Toronto Shamrocks and the Toronto Blueshirts of the National Hockey Association , where his battles with his fellow owners led them to create the National Hockey League . - An earl is a member of the nobility. The title is Anglo-Saxon in origin, akin to the Scandinavian form jarl, and meant \\"chieftain\\", particularly a chieftain set to rule a territory in a king's stead. In Scandinavia, it became obsolete in the Middle Ages and was replaced by duke (\\"hertig\\"/\\"hertug\\"/\\"hertog\\"). In later medieval Britain, it became the equivalent of the continental count (in England in the earlier period, it was more akin to a duke; in Scotland it assimilated the concept of mormaer). However, earlier in Scandinavia, \\"jarl\\" could also mean a sovereign prince. For example, the rulers of several of the petty kingdoms of Norway had the title of \\"jarl\\" and in many cases they had no less power than their neighbours who had the title of king. Alternative names for the \\"Earl/Count\\" rank in the nobility structure are used in other countries, such as Hakushaku during the Japanese Imperial era. - The Canadian titles debate has been ongoing since the presentation to the Canadian House of Commons of the Nickle Resolution in 1917. This resolution marked the earliest attempt to establish a Canadian government policy requesting the sovereign not to grant knighthoods, baronetcies, and peerages to Canadians and set the precedent for later policies restricting Canadians from accepting titles from foreign countries. Dissatisfaction with the British honours system led to the gradual creation of a separate system for Canada. - A global city, also called world city or sometimes alpha city or world center, is a city generally considered to be an important node in the global economic system. The concept comes from geography and urban studies, and the idea that globalization can be understood as largely created, facilitated, and enacted in strategic geographic locales according to a hierarchy of importance to the operation of the global system of finance and trade. - Ontario, one of the 13 provinces and territories of Canada, is located in east-central Canada.

It is home to the nation's capital city, Ottawa, and the nation's most populous city, Toronto. - The Greater Toronto Area (GTA) is the most populous metropolitan area in Canada. At the 2011 census, it had a population of 6,054,191, and the census metropolitan area had a population of 5,583,064. The Greater Toronto Area is defined as the central city of Toronto, and the four regional municipalities that surround it: Durham, Halton, Peel, and York. The regional span of the Greater Toronto Area is sometimes combined with the city of Hamilton, Ontario and its surrounding region, to form the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area. The Greater Toronto Area is the northern part of the Golden Horseshoe. - A baronet (or ; abbreviated Bart or Bt) or the rare female equivalent, a baronetess (, or ; abbreviation \\"Btss\\"), is the holder of a baronetcy, a hereditary title awarded by the British Crown.

Historically, in Europe, knighthood was conferred upon mounted warriors. During the High Middle Ages, knighthood was considered a class of lower nobility. By the Late Middle Ages, the rank had become associated with the ideals of chivalry, a code of conduct for the perfect courtly Christian warrior. Often, a knight was a vassal who served as a fighter for a lord, with payment in the form of land holdings. The lords trusted the knights, who were skilled in battle on horseback. Since the early modern period, the title of knight is purely honorific, usually bestowed by a monarch, as in the British honours system, often for non-military service to the country. The modern female equivalent in the United Kingdom is Dame. - The Stanley Cup is the championship trophy awarded annually to the National Hockey League (NHL) playoff winner. Originally commissioned in 1892 as the \\"Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup\\", the trophy is named for Lord Stanley of Preston, thenGovernor General of Canada, who awarded it to Canada's top-ranking amateur ice hockey club, which the entire Stanley family supported, with the sons and daughters playing and promoting the game. The first Cup was awarded in 1893 to Montreal HC, and subsequent winners from 1893 to 1914 were determined by challenge games and league play. Professional teams first became eligible to challenge for the Stanley Cup in 1906. In 1915, the two professional ice hockey organizations, the National Hockey Association (NHA) and the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA), reached a gentlemen's agreement in which their respective champions would face each other annually for the Stanley Cup.

During its lifetime, the league coped with competition for players with the rival Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA), the enlistment of players for World War I and disagreements between owners. The disagreements between owners came to a head in 1917, when the NHA suspended operations in order to get rid of an unwanted owner (Eddie Livingstone). The remaining NHA team owners started the NHL in parallel as a temporary measure, to continue play while negotiations went on with Livingstone and other lawsuits were pending. A year later, after no progress was reached with Livingstone, the other NHA owners decided to permanently suspend the NHA. The NHA's rules, constitution and trophies were continued in the NHL. - Los Angeles (Spanish for \\"The Angels\\"), officially the City of Los Angeles and often known by its initials L.A., is the second-most populous city in the United States (after New York City), the most populous city in California and the county seat of Los Angeles County.

Complete the following sentence. Samuel cried to Benjamin because","response":"Samuel cried to Benjamin because he felt a deep sense of betrayal, disappointment, and heartache after discovering that his long-term spouse was involved in a cheating scandal. Samuel and Benjamin, being close friends for many years, shared a strong bond and had always leaned on each other for support during difficult times. This was no exception. Samuel knew he could trust his best friend Benjamin to listen and offer words of wisdom to help heal his broken heart. The emotional burden of the cheating scandal weighed heavily on Samuel's heart, but the comfort from Benjamin's presence and empathetic ear helped him feel less alone. Samuel spent hours pouring out his heart, recounting all the good times he had shared with his spouse, and contemplating where it all went wrong. He was in a state of constant reflection, trying to figure out if there were any signs he had missed or any subtle indications that the relationship was not as strong as he had believed it to be. For his part, Benjamin did everything he could to be there for Samuel in his time of need. He listened patiently, offered his own perspective on the situation, and even shared some of his own experiences in dealing with relationship turmoil. By offering genuine empathy and understanding, Benjamin made it clear to Samuel that he was not alone in his sorrow, and that true friendship is a powerful asset during such emotionally challenging moments in life. As the days turned into weeks, Samuel was gradually able to work through the immediate pain of the breakup and began to see the cheating scandal as an opportunity to reevaluate his life. He started to understand that his spouse's actions did not define him or his own worth as a person. With Benjamin's consistent support, Samuel slowly gained the strength to consider new possibilities and perspectives for his future. The two friends continued to have long conversations, evaluate the lessons learned from the relationship, and explore new goals and dreams for the future. Samuel gradually started to embrace the concept of moving on and opening his heart to new experiences, while Benjamin provided a constant source of encouragement, assurance, and love. In the end, Samuel's crying to Benjamin marked not just the pain and heartache from the cheating scandal, but also the beginning of a transformative journey. The support Samuel received from Benjamin helped him not only mourn the loss of his long-term relationship, but also to grow stronger and more resilient in the face of such adversity. The enduring bond between Samuel and Benjamin only grew stronger throughout this time, proving once again that true friendship is an invaluable treasure that can withstand the hardest of trials and ultimately lead to healing and growth."},{"question":"Caretaker Rangers manager Kenny McDowall has revealed the club's board left it to him to break the news to Ian Durrant that he was being demoted.

Chess is a strategic and mentally stimulating board game that requires players to think critically, plan their moves, and adapt to the changing gameplay. When a person engages in playing chess, it captivates their attention and keeps their mind actively entertained, thus alleviating boredom. Here's a brief explanation of the other options and why they might not answer the question as effectively as \\"play chess\\": - funny: This term is more of a descriptor for something humorous or entertaining rather than an activity that could help alleviate boredom. While finding something funny could provide temporary relief from boredom, it doesn't necessarily provide long-term engagement like playing chess does. - learn new: Learning something new can indeed be a potential way to alleviate boredom. However, this option is quite vague and doesn't specify a subject or activity the person would engage in. Therefore, it isn't as clear and specific as the \\"play chess\\" choice. - see new: This option is also quite ambiguous and doesn't provide enough context to know how it might alleviate boredom. It could refer to traveling, meeting new people, or trying new experiences, but it doesn't provide the same level of focus and mental stimulation as playing chess. - surf net: Surfing the net can provide temporary relief from boredom by browsing various websites, accessing information, and engaging with others through social media.

Movie plot: Joseph Amadeus von Dracula, known as Pepito to his friends, is a trumpet player in 1930s Havana who spends his time away from the bandstand dabbling in quasi-terrorist plots to overthrow the Cuban government of dictator, Gerardo Machado. He is unaware that he is really a vampire, and that his uncle, Werner Amadeus von Dracula, the son of Count Dracula, has been using him as a test subject for a formula that negates the usually fatal effects of sunlight. A Chicago-based crime syndicate and a group of vampires with members from several countries in Europe have both learned of the formula and wish to possess it for different reasonsâthe Chicago group to suppress it and thus maintain their monopoly on indoor, artificial beach resorts, and the Europeans to market it as \\"Vampisol.\\" When Pepito learns of his true heritage (and his uncle's wish to give the formula away to vampires everywhere) he becomes the target of a multi-pronged manhunt, leading all parties involved on a wild chase through some of the seediest neighborhoods of Havana. At the film's climax, Pepito and his girlfriend find themselves cornered by the Chicago vampire cartel, led by vampire mobster Johnny Terrori. He tells Pepito to have some O positive blood as his last drink, the blood type which vampires consider to be the most delicious.

Terrori loses interest in the Vampisol formula, realizing that its effect is to turn vampires into humans.

Article: The British coloney of Bermude is a top summertime escape. Yet, even through October, Bermuda isn't ready to stop for the winter. During this month, world-class festivals on teh island keep things lively and the weather remains comfortable enough for Bermuda shorts and bathing suits. In October, Bermuda hosts two major festivals--the Bermuda Music Festival and the Bermuda Culinary Arts Festival. The 10thanniversary Bermuda Music Festival begins October 5 and features three days of performances at the Royal Naval Dockyard on Bermuda's West End. Featured main stage performers include Joss Stone, Pattie Labelle, and Al Green, and a second stage spotlights local Bermudian artists. General admission tickets start at 60 for on e day or 160 for a three-day pass. Starting October 21, the Culinary Arts Festival brings some of North America's top chefs to the island for four days of food and wine tastings, conferences and cooking competitions. Participating chefs include Todd English and Michael Lomonaco, among others. Three-day festival passes start at 649 per person, but you can also buy separate tickets for individual events. Even if you don't attend one of the festivals, there's still plenty to do. With mostly sunny days and temperatures averaging aroung 79 degrees, the weather is just right for participating in Bermuda's two favorite pastimes--golf and tennis. With fewer visitors on the island than during the summer, you may have an easier time getting the best times or a spot on the courts. It's also still warm enough to enjoy the island's pink sand beaches and go swimming, because the water keeps the summer's heat longer than the air. Of course, you can always shop in the city of Hamilton's upscale small goods arts and crafts shops. Question: The best time to travel to Bermuda is _ Answer: Select from the following. 1). spring 2).

Translate this to English?","response":"Financial sustainability is important, but we should also take into consideration the necessity of ensuring an adequate income. Financial sustainability is a crucial aspect of managing any business, organization, or even personal finances. It refers to the ability to maintain or improve one's financial situation over time without depleting resources, indebting oneself, or causing any long-term financial distress. This requires adequate financial planning, risk management, and utilizing efficient processes to ensure that monetary resources are allocated in a way that balances immediate needs with long-term goals. At the same time, ensuring an adequate income is an equally critical component for overall financial stability. Without sufficient income, meeting expenses, saving for future endeavors, and maintaining a good quality of life becomes a significantly tougher challenge. Ensuring an adequate income can be achieved through various means, including securing a stable job with fair compensation, pursuing additional education or certification to improve one's earning potential, and investing wisely to generate passive income. Taking both financial sustainability and adequate income into consideration is vital for several reasons: 1. Financial stability: Ensuring a balance between both concepts helps to create a strong foundation for financial stability, as it allows individuals or organizations to meet their current needs without jeopardizing their future financial situation. 2. Long-term planning: Considering both the sustainability of financial resources and the importance of maintaining a steady income allows for more effective long-term planning. This includes setting achievable goals, creating realistic budgets, and identifying potential areas of growth. 3. Risk management: Understanding the relationship between financial sustainability and income is essential for managing risks. This includes developing contingency plans for potential income fluctuations, preparing for unexpected expenses, and setting aside funds for emergencies. 4. Debt management: Achieving financial sustainability and ensuring an adequate income helps in preventing excessive debt accumulation. By successfully managing finances, it is possible to avoid falling into debt traps and ensure that all liabilities are paid off in a timely manner. 5. Quality of life: Ultimately, balancing financial sustainability with the need for an adequate income enables individuals and organizations to maintain a high quality of life, ensuring that financial pressures do not adversely impact well-being. In conclusion, financial sustainability and ensuring adequate income are two interconnected aspects of managing finances effectively. By taking both elements into account, individuals and organizations can strive to achieve a stable, secure, and successful financial future."},{"question":"Write a brief sentence.","response":"Step 1: Choose a subject for the sentence.

She also attracts the interest of aspiring author Nick Bradley. While having her portrait done by Broome, a call from Curtis brings her eagerly to a jeweler, only to discover to her disappointment that he merely seeks her advice in buying Donna an engagement gift. After he purchases an expensive one, Christabel plants a seed of doubt in Donna's mind and makes her feel guilty by insinuating that in accepting such a lavish gift, Donna is giving Curtis the appearance of being after his money.

Solve this problem.","response":"Step 1: Identify the type of equation. This is a linear equation since there are no exponents or radical expressions involving the variable j. Step 2: Isolate the variable. To solve for the variable j, we need to get all terms with j on one side of the equation and all constant terms on the other side. Step 3: Move the 7*j term to the left side of the equation. To do this, we can subtract 7*j from both sides of the equation to eliminate it from the right side. 18*j + 44 - 7*j = 7*j - 7*j Step 4: Simplify the equation. Subtracting 7*j from 18*j gives us: 11*j + 44 = 0 Step 5: Move the constant term (44) to the right side of the equation. To do this, we can subtract 44 from both sides of the equation. 11*j + 44 - 44 = 0 - 44 Step 6: Simplify the equation. Subtracting 44 from both sides gives us: 11*j = -44 Step 7: Solve for j by dividing both sides by 11. To isolate j, we can divide both sides by 11. (11*j) / 11 = (-44) / 11 Step 8: Simplify the equation. Dividing both sides by 11 gives us: j = -4 So, j = -4 is the solution to the given linear equation."},{"question":"Write an article based on this summary: A man has pleaded guilty to two counts of causing death by dangerous driving after two friends died when his car hit a tree and flipped onto its roof.

Beautystorm are proudly the cheapest stockists of Dermalogica products in Australia and provide online skin consultations with their in house Skincare Therapists. Selina will be giving us advice on how to repair sun damaged skin. Whilst we are blessed to be living in such a sun drenched country, here in Australia, as a consequence the majority of us will have sun damaged skin. Here are Selina's tips to repair some of the damage: The severe, Australian suncauses a multitude of cases of serious skin damage every year. However, there are ways, to repair rough, dry, wrinkled skin that may also suffer from redness and brown spots. The very first step to reverse some of that skin damage is some gentle cleansing. Never wash the face with an ordinary bar of soap. This will make the situation worse and cause severe dry skin. In order to wash the sun-damaged skin effectively without causing further injury, use a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser. This will remove, not only dirt and oil, but also the top layer of dead skin cells, providing a nice glow. This will reveal fresh skin cells ready for treatment. After cleansing the skin, follow with a mud mask or a facial mask made specifically for skin that’s been damaged by the sun. The purpose of a mask is to draw out impurities in the skin while adding key ingredients like moisturisers and minerals back into the skin. After gently rinsing the purifying mask, a lotion, cream or serum containing key ingredients should be applied to the skin. The difference between the three is that a lotion is best for daytime use, worn under makeup or for those prone to breakouts. Creams are considered heavier and best used at night or for those with dry skin. Serums are usually highly concentrated formulas that can be used day or night, but a little goes a long way. Those with the most severe sun damaged skin should use them. Question: What does Selina think will help repair redness and brown spots from skin? Options: A. using a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser B. use just water to cleanse C. use abrasive soap D. not enough information Answer:","response":"A. using a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser"},{"question":"Find the right ending to this passage.

That's why sometimes you can see these continents fit together like a puzzle!"},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Information: - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\" - A record producer or music producer oversees and manages the sound recording and production of a band or performer's music, which may range from recording one song to recording a lengthy concept album. A producer has many roles during the recording process. The roles of a producer vary. He or she may gather musical ideas for the project, collaborate with the artists to select cover tunes or original songs by the artist/group, work with artists and help them to improve their songs, lyrics or arrangements. - A concept album is an album unified by a larger purpose or meaning to the album collectively than to its tracks individually. This may be achieved through a single central narrative or theme, or through a sense of artistic cohesiveness. The scope and definition of a \\"concept album\\" varies, and there is no consensus over what exactly the term constitutes. - Michigan is a state in the Great Lakes and Midwestern regions of the United States. The name Michigan is the French form of the Ojibwa word \\"mishigamaa\\", meaning \\"large water\\" or \\"large lake\\". Michigan is the tenth most populous of the 50 United States, with the 11th most extensive total area (the largest state by total area east of the Mississippi River). Its capital is Lansing, and its largest city is Detroit. - Detroit is the most populous city in the U.S. state of Michigan, the fourth-largest city in the Midwest and the largest city on the United StatesCanada border. It is the seat of Wayne County, the most populous county in the state. - A song, most broadly, is a single (and often standalone) work of music that is typically intended to be sung by the human voice with distinct and fixed pitches and patterns using sound and silence and a variety of forms that often include the repetition of sections. Written words created specifically for music or for which music is specifically created, are called lyrics. If a pre-existing poem is set to composed music in classical music it is an art song. Songs that are sung on repeated pitches without distinct contours and patterns that rise and fall are called chants. Songs in a simple style that are learned informally are often referred to as folk songs. Songs that are composed for professional singers who sell their recordings or live shows to the mass market are called popular songs. These songs, which have broad appeal, are often composed by professional songwriters, composers and lyricists. Art songs are composed by trained classical composers for concert or recital performances. Songs are performed live and recorded on audio or video (or in some, cases, a song may be performed live and simultaneously recorded). Songs may also appear in plays, musical theatre, stage shows of any form, and within operas. - Vol. 1 : Unreleased ( aka The Official Jay Dee Instrumental Series Vol.1 : Unreleased ) is an instrumental album by the late Detroit record producer , Jay Dee , released in 2002 .

Child: Hey, why is that small plant growing in our garden? Assistant: Well, it's because a tiny seed was planted there. The seed absorbs water from the soil, and then it pops open and sends out a little root to get more water. Child: And then what happens? Assistant: Then, the root keeps growing down into the ground and a tiny stem starts to grow up towards the sun. Just like how you stretch your arms up high when you want to reach something, the plant does the same to reach the sunlight. Child: Why does it like the sun so much? Assistant: The plant likes the sun because it helps the plant grow by making its food. This process is called photosynthesis. But don't worry if this sounds like a hard word; it just means that the plant uses sunlight, water, and air to make its food. Child: Like how we eat food? Assistant: Yes, exactly! But instead of a mouth to eat the food, the plant uses its green leaves to make the food and grow. Child: What about the pretty flowers? Assistant: Oh, those are the best part! Once the plant is all grown up, it makes flowers. The flowers are like a special treat after the plant has grown so much. Plus, they can make seeds and the whole cycle can start all over again!

A limited quantity edition CD single was issued in January 2015, and sent to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences as part of the submission process to be considered for the Academy Award for Best Original Song. The single was included in the list of 79 contenders for the award, but it did not receive a nomination.A lyric video was uploaded onto The Weinstein Company's YouTube channel on January 13, 2015. It was a minute and 35 seconds, and featured clips from the film. The video received over two million views in 24 hours. The video featured scenes from the film in which \\"the iconic Peruvian bear finds himself in all manner of mishaps while trying to find a home and ultimately working his way into our hearts\\". The visual was included on the DVD and Blu-ray releases of Paddington along with a behind-the-scenes feature on the making of the track.

Body of the Article: A British police inspector, whose identity remains undisclosed, has received a suspended prison sentence after being found guilty of possessing indecent images of children on his home computer. The case has resulted in widespread condemnation from the community and calls for stricter checks on law enforcement personnel. The police inspector's indecent activities came to light during a routine investigation conducted by the cybercrime division of the police force. On discovering the illicit material on the inspector's computer, the cybercrime team promptly notified their superior officers, and disciplinary actions were initiated. The Digital Forensic Unit carefully and meticulously examined the inspector's computer, only to find a significant number of images classified as indecent content involving children. Moreover, the unit concluded that the images had been stored on the device for a substantial period, indicating that this was not a one-time transgression. The victimized children's ages ranged from just a few years old to their early teens, an aspect that only intensifies the horrifying nature of the crime. For someone entrusted with safeguarding society and fighting against such depravities, this discovery is both shocking and heartbreaking. Authorities decided against revealing the name or specific location of the police inspector to protect the ongoing investigation and any connected parties. However, the public has been assured that this case has received widespread attention, and significant actions are being taken to rectify and prevent such instances in the future. The court handed down a suspended prison sentence to the inspector, further explaining that he would be subjected to probation and closely monitored activities during the suspension period. Additionally, his name will be registered on the Sex Offenders Register, thereby preventing him from working with children and vulnerable individuals in the future. This case has generated significant public outrage, with many questioning how someone working within the law enforcement system could engage in such despicable activities. Consequently, demands for greater scrutiny and background checks on police personnel have been made. Conclusion: The suspended prison sentence handed to the police inspector involved in possessing indecent images of children on his home computer sheds light on the importance of ongoing vigilance and the role of the digital forensic unit in combating these heinous crimes. While this incident has further eroded the public's trust in law enforcement, authorities have emphasized their commitment to addressing and rectifying concerns to ensure safety and justice for vulnerable individuals."},{"question":"Question: I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal. Can you help me answer a few questions? If you can't, please say \\"No I can't\\". Question: What is Ben's occupation? Movie title: Shutter Movie plot: Shutter tells the story of photographer Ben (Joshua Jackson) and his new wife Jane (Rachael Taylor). The film begins with the couple's wedding, and the audience learns that they are planning to leave their apartment in Brooklyn for Japan, where Ben has been hired to take pictures for a particular client. The couple has made the decision to leave for Japan a few days early, renting a cabin so they can enjoy a shorter honeymoon. In the car on the way to the cabin, Jane gets lost and asks a sleeping Ben to check the map. While attempting to get their bearings, Jane sees a girl walk into the road. She hits the girl, and swerves off the road, crashing the car into a tree. They both fall unconscious. When she awakens, Jane realizes the girl could very well still be laying in the road, and rushes out of the car to find her, Ben on her heels. They find nothing, and Ben thinks that the girl was already found and has gotten the medical help that she would need. He also thinks the injuries weren't life-threatening, as they cannot find any blood or evidence of a collision and wants to call for help. Later, help does arrive for them, and they are able to continue with their travel to the cabin, but Jane is haunted by the image of the girl. Ben's shoulder is bothering him, since the accident. Jane tells him he needs to get it checked out. Ben chooses to ignore it, and at the cabin, they are able to enjoy a few day long honeymoon, and Ben wants to take pictures to record the event.Days later, Ben has to report for work with his friend Bruno (David Denman) Jane accompanies him but is somewhat left to her own devices as Ben needs to meet with the clients right away. We learn that Ben is fluent in Japanese, while Jane is not. Later, the pair are taken to their home, a building of which they are the solo occupants, and also the home of Ben's photography studio. Jane notices an alcove where an old chair sits, and the image sticks with her. After meeting Ben's assistant Seiko (Maya Hazen), Jane again is left to her own devices... Answer:","response":"Ben's occupation in the movie \\"Shutter\\" is a professional photographer. His proficiency in this occupation is significant enough to have him be hired by a client in Japan, where he moves to with his new wife, Jane. Moreover, his job as a photographer also necessitated him being fluent in Japanese to namely interact with clients. He seems to possess a dedicated photography studio in his new home in Japan as well. His photographic skills aren't relegated strictly to professional settings though, he also enjoys taking personal pictures, such as those to record their few days long honeymoon. His deep interest in the field is further hinted when even after getting injured in a car accident, Ben chooses to ignore his own discomfort in order to continue to take pictures. His occupation as a photographer seems to be a significant element of both Ben's character and the plot of the film itself. Indeed, the role of photography in the movie could suggest further investigations in the storyline such as revealing certain truths or discovering hidden elements related to the tragic event they experienced on their way to their honeymoon cabin. Therefore, understanding Ben's profession could uncover some layers of the movie's narrative and provide insights on the potential sequence of events."},{"question":"Christina Maria Aguilera (born December 18, 1980) is an American singer, songwriter, actress, reality show personality and television personality. Born in Staten Island, New York and raised in Rochester and Wexford, Pennsylvania, she appeared on the television series Star Search and The Mickey Mouse Club in her early years. After recording \\"Reflection\\", the theme for Disney's 1998 film Mulan, Aguilera signed with RCA Records. She rose to prominence with her 1999 self-titled debut album that spawned the US Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles \\"Genie in a Bottle\\", \\"What a Girl Wants\\", and \\"Come On Over Baby Christina Maria Aguilera was born in the Staten Island borough of New York City, New York, on December 18, 1980, to Shelly Loraine Kearns (nee Fidler), a musician, and Fausto Xavier Aguilera, a United States Army soldier. Her father is Ecuadorian, while her mother has German, Irish, Welsh, and Dutch ancestry. Her family moved frequently because of her father's military service, and lived in places including New Jersey, Texas, New York, and Japan. Aguilera and her mother alleged that her father was physically and emotionally abusive, claims which he denied; Aguilera used music as a form of escape from her turbulent household. Following her parents' divorce when she was six years old, Aguilera, her younger sister Rachel, and her mother (who later remarried Jim Kearns and gave birth to one more child, Michael 'Mikey' Kearns), moved into her grandmother's home in the Pittsburgh suburb of Rochester, Pennsylvania. After several years of being estranged, Aguilera expressed interest in reconciling with her father in 2012. Growing up, Aguilera, known locally as \\"the little girl with the big voice\\", aspired to be a singer, singing in local talent shows and competitions. She won her first talent show at the age of 8, in which she performed Whitney Houston's \\"I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)\\". In 1990, she appeared on Star Search singing \\"A Sunday Kind of Love\\", and was eliminated during the semi-final rounds. She later performed the same song during an appearance on Pittsburgh's KDKA-TV's Wake Up with Larry Richert. Throughout her youth in Pittsburgh, Aguilera sang \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\" before Pittsburgh Penguins hockey, Pittsburgh Steelers football, and Pittsburgh Pirates baseball games, in addition to the 1992 Stanley Cup Finals. She attended Rochester Area School District in Rochester and Marshall Middle School near Wexford, and briefly attended North Allegheny Intermediate High School before being home schooled due to bullying. In 1991, Aguilera auditioned for a position on The Mickey Mouse Club, although she did not meet its age requirements. She joined the television series two years later, where she performed musical numbers and sketch comedy until its cancellation in 1994. Her co-stars included Ryan Gosling, Keri Russell, Britney Spears, and Justin Timberlake. When she was fourteen, Aguilera recorded her first song, the duet \\"All I Wanna Do\\" with Japanese singer Keizo Nakanishi. She later sent her cover version of Houston's \\"Run to You\\" to Walt Disney Pictures in hopes of being selected to record the theme song \\"Reflection\\" for their animated film Mulan (1998). \\"Reflection\\" peaked at number 19 on the U.S. Billboard Adult Contemporary Chart. When planning her fourth studio album, Aguilera leaned towards a new artistic direction that she felt had more musical and lyrical depth. She named the album Stripped and explained that the title represented \\"a new beginning, a re-introduction of [herself] as a new artist in a way\\". For the album, Aguilera served as executive producer and co-wrote most of the songs. The album was preceded by the single \\"Dirrty\\", which was released to shed Aguilera's teen pop image and express her sexuality and aggression. Its accompanying music video generated controversy for depicting various sexual fetishes and concepts. Aguilera's new image presented in the video started to overshadow her music, generating widespread criticism from both her peers including Shakira and Jessica Simpson and the public. Aguilera defended her new image, explaining that \\"I'm in the power position, in complete command of everything and everybody around me. To be totally balls-out like that is, for me, the measure of a true artist.\\" The final cut of Stripped incorporated various genres from flamenco and R&B to rock and lyrically revolved around the theme of self-esteem while also discussing sex and gender equality. It was released in October 2002 to mixed critical reviews; Jancee Dunn from the Rolling Stone praised Aguilera's vocals yet panned the album for its lack of musical concentration. The album was nonetheless a commercial success, peaking at number two on the Billboard 200 and has sold over 4.3 million copies in the United States. It was a major success in the United Kingdom, having sold 2 million copies and became the second highest-selling album by a female US artist of the 2000s decade, behind Norah Jones with Come Away with Me. Stripped has sold over 12 million copies worldwide. The album was followed by four singles, \\"Beautiful\\", \\"Fighter\\", \\"Can't Hold Us Down\\", and \\"The Voice Within\\". \\"Beautiful\\" received universal acclaim for positive portrayal of the LGBT community and was the album's most commercially successful single, peaking at number two on the Billboard Hot 100. It earned Aguilera a Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance at the 2004 ceremony. The song was later listed at number 52 among the 100 Best Songs of the 2000s by the Rolling Stone in 2011. During the promotion of Stripped, Aguilera cultivated a new image by adopting the alter ego Xtina, dyeing her hair black, and debuting several tattoos and piercings. She co-headlined the Justified and Stripped Tour alongside Justin Timberlake from June to September 2003 in support of Stripped and Timberlake's album Justified, before embarking on her solo The Stripped Tour until December. Aguilera garnered media attention after attending the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards in August, where she and Britney Spears kissed Madonna during their performance of \\"Like a Virgin\\" and \\"Hollywood\\". Later that year, she was the host of the 2003 MTV Europe Music Awards, where she won an award for Best Female. Billboard also announced Aguilera as the Top Female Pop Act of 2003. Aguilera's sixth studio album Bionic was released in June 2010. The album drew inspirations from electronic genres, which had influenced Aguilera during her pregnancy. Critical response to the album was mixed, with some of the critics did not welcome the change in musical styles as well as the content of the lyrics for being \\"cringeworthy\\". Bionic struggled to match the chart impact and sales of her previous albums, peaking at number three on the Billboard 200 and has sold 315,000 copies in the United States. \\"Not Myself Tonight\\" and \\"You Lost Me\\" were released as singles internationally, while \\"Woohoo\\" featuring rapper Nicki Minaj was released as a single in the United States and several European countries, and \\"I Hate Boys\\" was released exclusively to Australian airplay service. In November 2010, Aguilera starred alongside Cher in the film Burlesque. The film was written and directed by Steve Antin, and grossed 90 million. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, who criticized it for being \\"campy and cliched\\", yet praised Aguilera's acting. Burlesque received a nomination for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy at the 68th Golden Globe Awards. Aguilera contributed eight tracks to the film's accompanying soundtrack, while Cher performed the other two. The soundtrack reached number 18 on the Billboard 200 and was certified gold by the RIAA. At the Super Bowl XLV in February 2011, Aguilera omitted a few lines while performing the U.S. national anthem \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\". She later apologized, saying, \\"I got so caught up in the moment of the song that I lost my place. I can only hope that everyone could feel my love for this country and that the true spirit of its anthem still came through\\". She performed at the opening act of the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards, alongside Jennifer Hudson, Martina McBride, Yolanda Adams, and Florence Welch, paying tribute to Aretha Franklin. In April 2011, Aguilera served as a coach on the television series The Voice and went on for its three first seasons until December 2012.

As consumers, they have various roles in food chains and webs. Some are predators. They prey upon other single-celled organisms, such as bacteria. In fact, protozoa predators keep many bacterial populations in check. Other protozoa are herbivores. They graze on algae. Still others are decomposers. They consume dead organic matter. There are also parasitic protozoa that live in or on living hosts. For example, the protozoan that causes malaria lives inside a human host. For their part, protozoa are important food sources for many larger organisms, including insects and worms. Story: Students learned about protozoa in school this week.

What is the answer??","response":"Alright, we have an equation to solve for 'w'. Don't worry, we'll do it step by step. The equation is: -1648 = 319*w + 4094 First, we need to get 'w' all by itself on one side. To do that, let's start by moving the number 4094 to the other side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 4094 from both sides: -1648 - 4094 = 319*w Now, let's do the subtraction: -5742 = 319*w Next, to get 'w' by itself, we need to divide both sides by 319: -5742 ÷ 319 = w Finally, when we do the division, we get the value of 'w': w ≈ -18 So, the answer is w ≈ -18. That means if we take -18 and put it back into the equation, it will make the equation true, like a magic number!"},{"question":"Summarize this article in one sentence. Samsung, Lotte, LG, Hyundai: they are unavoidable, selling everything from mobiles to laptops, cars to washing machines as well as food, drink and even health insurance. Staggeringly, sales revenue from the top five chaebols are worth more than half of South Korea's entire economy. But increasingly these empires have come under the spotlight because of the influence they wield (the word chaebol is a combination of the Korean words for \\"wealth\\" and \\"clan\\"). Calls for them to be reformed have come and gone before, but as South Koreans head for a presidential election, could this time be different? At a recent protest in Seoul I watched scores of young people raise their arms and voices against chaebols and the powerful position they hold in the country. In the crowd, I met Kim Seung-yeon, a young part-time worker who was there to campaign for better pay and working conditions. Like many young Koreans, she told me the system feels stacked in favour of the chaebols. \\"Right now chaebols monopolise too much of the wealth in South Korea, and it isn't being used properly,\\" she said to me. \\"I think this needs to be corrected.\\" The frustration over the close ties between business and politics has only grown through the complex corruption scandal that has engulfed the nation. South Korea's President Park Geun-hye, and the heads of Samsung and Lotte, two of the country's biggest chaebols have all been charged with bribery. But these very same businesses helped to build South Korea at a time when the country was emerging from a war and they are vital to the economy. Nowhere was that made more apparent to me than at a study centre in the capital. There I met a group of young women who were all preparing for entrance exams to get jobs with chaebols. It is a rigorous and exhaustive process. But in South Korea's ultra-competitive society, it is also a ticket to success. \\"If I get into a chaebol it means that I will have a well-paid job, and people will look at me and think 'wow',\\" explains Kang Da-heun who was studying to get a job with Lotte. \\"It will help me with my marriage prospects, and my future will be very bright.\\" Did it bother her, I asked, that the boss of Lotte might potentially go to prison for his role in a long-running corruption scandal? \\"It won't affect the company's prospects at all,\\" she said to me. \\"Lotte will keep being Lotte.\\" On the face of it, she appeared to be right, as I learned from a visit to Lotte's massive department store complex and the new premises of the Lotte World Tower. It's the tallest building in the country, at almost 500m high. It opened its doors a few weeks ago, against the backdrop of the bribery charges levelled at the company's boss. Lotte and other chaebols say they are changing, and trying to improve corporate governance at their firms, but also point to the fact that they are responsible for a sizeable portion of growth in the economy. \\"At the moment chaebols have this negative image,\\" Hwang Kag-gyu, head of Lotte's corporate innovation office told me. \\"But we feel partially falsely charged. It was necessary [in South Korea's history] for big companies to grow... I believe everyone benefited from these mutual growth partnerships.\\" Not everyone feels that way though. A few hours outside Seoul, in the city of Gwangju, I met Cho Seong-gu, who used to own a fairly small, but he says thriving, software business. To expand, he partnered with a chaebol and when there was a dispute over the terms of the deal, Mr Cho lost everything - his business, his house, even his marriage. He blames the culture of chaebol-worship in South Korea for his problems. \\"I have fought for 15 years,\\" he told me in his tiny flat. \\"I have met more than 170 congressmen, my case has even been discussed in the national assembly and featured countless times in the media. It's impossible in Korea for a small business to win against a chaebol.\\" Back on the 123rd floor of the Lotte World Tower, hordes of local tourists gathered to take selfies and marvel at the city below. Much of what they were looking at was built by chaebols, an achievement only these sprawling empires could pull off. As I watched from the sidelines, it struck me that the relationship between Koreans and their chaebols is a complicated one, and that any hope of real reform is going to be a long and difficult process. Chaebols are an essential part of South Korea's economy, and helped to transform what was once a poor nation into Asia's fourth largest economy. But along the way, their tentacles have spread into pretty much every single sector of business, meaning they are now towering giants, overshadowing everything in their sight. Summary:","response":"Large South Korean companies called \\"chaebols\\" control over half of the country's economy, but many people feel it's time for more fairness and reforms to break up their monopolies."},{"question":"Information: - An Emmy Award, or simply Emmy, recognizes excellence in the television industry, and corresponds to the Academy Award (for film), the Tony Award (for theatre), and the Grammy Award (for music). - The Kennedy Center Honors is an annual honor given to those in the performing arts for their lifetime of contributions to American culture (though recipients do not need to be U.S. citizens). The Honors have been presented annually since 1978, culminating each December in a star-studded gala celebrating the Honorees in the Kennedy Center Opera House. - Shirley MacLaine (born Shirley MacLean Beaty; April 24, 1934) is an American film, television and theater actress, singer, dancer, activist and author.

It is a strip or sheet of transparent plastic film base coated on one side with a gelatin emulsion containing microscopically small light-sensitive silver halide crystals. The sizes and other characteristics of the crystals determine the sensitivity, contrast and resolution of the film. The emulsion will gradually darken if left exposed to light, but the process is too slow and incomplete to be of any practical use. Instead, a very short exposure to the image formed by a camera lens is used to produce only a very slight chemical change, proportional to the amount of light absorbed by each crystal. This creates an invisible latent image in the emulsion, which can be chemically developed into a visible photograph. In addition to visible light, all films are sensitive to X-rays and high-energy particles. Most are at least slightly sensitive to invisible ultraviolet (UV) light. Some special-purpose films are sensitive into the infrared (IR) region of the spectrum. - Serbia, officially the Republic of Serbia, is a sovereign state situated at the crossroads of Central and Southeast Europe, covering the southern part of the Pannonian Plain and the central Balkans.

Precise scholarly definitions of the movement differ in their emphasis, largely as a result of its highly eclectic structure. Although analytically often considered to be religious, those involved in it typically prefer the designation of \\"spiritual\\" and rarely use the term \\"New Age\\" themselves. Many scholars of the subject refer to it as the New Age movement, although others contest this term, believing that it gives a false sense of homogeneity to the phenomenon. As a form of Western esotericism, the New Age movement drew heavily upon a number of older esoteric traditions, in particular those that emerged from the occultist current that developed in the eighteenth century. Such prominent occult influences include the work of Emanuel Swedenborg and Franz Mesmer, as well as the ideas of Spiritualism, New Thought, and the Theosophical Society. A number of mid-twentieth century influences, such as the UFO religions of the 1950s, the Counterculture of the 1960s, and the Human Potential Movement, also exerted a strong influence on the early development of the New Age movement. Although the exact origins of the movement remain contested, it is agreed that it developed in the 1970s, at which time it was centred largely in the United Kingdom. It expanded and grew largely in the 1980s and 1990s, in particular within the United States. Despite its highly eclectic nature, a number of beliefs commonly found within the New Age movement have been identified. Theologically, the movement typically adopts a belief in a holistic form of divinity which imbues all of the universe, including human beings themselves. There is thus a strong emphasis on the spiritual authority of the self. This is accompanied by a common belief in a wide variety of semi-divine non-human entities, such as angels and masters, with whom humans can communicate, particularly through the form of channeling....

The answer to the question can be found at the beginning of the sentence, which states that the renowned Polish composer and pianist, Frédéric Chopin, visited Berlin in September 1828. At the time of his visit, Chopin was still a student. He traveled to Berlin with a family friend, Feliks Jarocki, who was a zoologist by profession. During their stay in Berlin, Chopin and Jarocki attended multiple cultural events, such as operas directed by the famous Italian composer Gaspare Spontini. Spontini was known for his significant contributions to the French opera during the first half of the 19th century. Chopin also attended concerts featuring prominent musicians of the time, such as the German composer Carl Friedrich Zelter and the German composer and pianist Felix Mendelssohn. This sentence not only provides the answer to the question about the timeline of Chopin's visit to Berlin but also offers additional context and information about the events and people he encountered during his time in the city.

The local animal shelter is struggling to keep up with the demand for assistance, and the community is concerned about the welfare of these animals. Local residents have reported that the strays are damaging property, disrupting traffic, and some are even becoming aggressive towards humans. In response, the town council has called a public meeting to discuss potential solutions to the issue. Hypothesis: One possible hypothesis behind the significant increase in the number of stray dogs in the small rural town is that the rise in abandoned dogs is correlated with a recent factory closure. The closure has resulted in increased unemployment, which may lead to families being unable to care for their pets. To test this hypothesis, it would be necessary to gather data on pet abandonment rates before and after the factory's closure and compare it with historical data. Additionally, it would be useful to survey the townspeople about their financial situation and ability to care for pets in the current economic climate. If the data supports this hypothesis, the town council could develop programs to address the root causes of pet abandonment, such as offering affordable pet care resources or working with local businesses to create employment opportunities."},{"question":"Given the question: Process: - Bats fly through an area - The bat makes sounds with their mouth or nose - The sound waves travel away from the bat - The sound waves hit objects - The sound waves bounce off the objects back towards the bat - The bat hears the sound waves echoing off the objects - The bat knows where the objects are because of where the sound echoed from - The bat doesn't hurt itself by hitting the objects.

The premise is specific about the number of people, their gender, their position, and their activity. On the other hand, the statement \\"A guy is sleeping.\\" presents a different situation, detailing only one individual of unspecified gender, who is currently inactive due to being asleep. To evaluate whether the premise \\"Two men sit on a couch and talk.\\" is true given the information \\"A guy is sleeping.\\", let's consider the following possibilities: 1. If the individual mentioned in the second statement is one of the two men from the first statement, then the first premise is not true. In this case, there are not two men sitting on a couch and talking, as one of them is sleeping. 2. If the individual mentioned in the second statement is a separate person from the two individuals in the first statement, then it's possible that the first statement is true. This would mean that there are indeed two men sitting on a couch and talking, while a third person is sleeping elsewhere. 3. However, there is only limited information available, and it's difficult to determine the complete scenario with certainty.

What is the answer?","response":"The Battle of Naseby took place in the English county of Northamptonshire. This critical battle occurred during the English Civil War, a series of armed conflicts and political disputes between the Royalists, who supported King Charles I, and the Parliamentarians, who were led by Oliver Cromwell. The Battle of Naseby occurred on June 14, 1645, and was the first significant encounter between the Royalists and the newly-formed Parliamentarian army, known as the New Model Army. The location of the battle was near the small village of Naseby, which is situated in the present-day local government district of Daventry, in the county of Northamptonshire. The area consists primarily of open farmland and rolling hills, which made it a suitable battleground for that era's military tactics. Both the Royalist and the Parliamentarian armies were approaching from different directions to converge near Naseby. The Royalists, under King Charles I and Prince Rupert, were advancing from the north and west, while the Parliamentarian forces, commanded by Sir Thomas Fairfax and Oliver Cromwell, were moving from the southeast. The battle commenced in the morning of June 14th, with skirmishes occurring between detachments of cavalry from both sides. As the day progressed, the Royalists attacked the Parliamentarians in their carefully chosen positions. Initially, it seemed as though the Royalists would emerge victorious from these engagements, but the tide changed dramatically when the Parliamentarian forces launched a counter-attack. Leading the way was Oliver Cromwell and his \\"Ironsides,\\" a highly trained and disciplined group of cavalrymen, who were instrumental in turning the tide of the battle. Their charge ultimately shattered the Royalist infantry and forced the King's troops to retreat. The Parliamentarian forces pursued the enemy, capturing many prisoners and seizing a significant amount of supplies and ammunition. The outcome was a decisive victory for the Parliamentarians and dealt a critical blow to the Royalist cause. The Battle of Naseby is considered one of the most important engagements in the English Civil War, as it significantly altered the trajectory of the conflict. It highlighted the effectiveness of the New Model Army and its leadership, bolstering the Parliamentarian cause. The victory also weakened King Charles I's authority, leading to his eventual execution and the eventual establishment of a republic in England under Oliver Cromwell. In summary, the Battle of Naseby took place in the county of Northamptonshire, England, on June 14, 1645. The engagement was a crucial turning point in the English Civil War, securing a major victory for the Parliamentarians against the Royalists and demonstrating the effectiveness of the newly-formed New Model Army. This battle largely determined the outcome of the war, leading to the eventual fall of the monarchy and the rise of the English republic."},{"question":"Please answer the following question about this movie plot. If it's un-answerable, please output \\"No answer\\". Question: Who is El Wray detained by ? Movie plot title: Planet Terror Movie plot: This article's plot summary may be too long or excessively detailed. Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (March 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) In rural Texas, go-go dancer Cherry Darling (Rose McGowan) decides to quit her low-paying job and find another occupation. She runs into her mysterious ex-boyfriend El Wray (Freddy Rodriguez) at the Bone Shack, a BBQ restaurant owned by J.T. Hague (Jeff Fahey) and his sheriff brother (Michael Biehn). Meanwhile, a group of officials at a nearby US military base, led by the demented Lt. Muldoon (Bruce Willis), are making a business transaction with a chemical engineer named Abby (Naveen Andrews) for mass quantities of a deadly biochemical agent known as DC2 (codename \\"Project Terror\\"). When Muldoon learns that Abby has an extra supply on hand, he attempts to take Abby hostage, and Abby intentionally releases the gas into the air. The gas reaches the town and turns most of its residents into deformed bloodthirsty psychopaths, referred to as \\"sickos\\" by the surviving humans. The infected townspeople are treated by the sinister Dr. William Block (Josh Brolin) and his unhappy, unfaithful bisexual anesthesiologist wife Dakota (Marley Shelton) at a local hospital. Random zombie attacks begin along the highway, causing El Wray, with Cherry as his passenger, to crash his truck. In the aftermath, several zombies tear off Cherry's right leg. Also falling victim, fatally, is Tammy (Stacy \\"Fergie\\" Ferguson), who was on her way to into town to reunite with her former lover Dakota. When Tammy's body arrives at the hospital, Dr. Block recognizes her and by comparing text messages on the cellular phones of Tammy and his wife, realizes Dakota was about to leave him. He then attacks Dakota with her own anesthetic syringe needles, stabbing her repeatedly in the hands, rendering them useless, before locking her in a closet to tend to other patients, including Cherry, who is still alive. El Wray is detained by Sheriff... The answer to this question is:","response":"El Wray is detained by Sheriff Hague's brother (Michael Biehn)."},{"question":"Question. The person was prevented from leaving work, what blocked him in the street? Options: - building - demonstration - laugh - garage - conference Answer. demonstration What step-by-step reasoning justifies that answer?","response":"1. The question asks what blocked the person in the street, implying an obstruction or hindrance that prevented their movement. 2. We examine the given options one by one to determine which is most likely to cause such an obstruction: a. building - This is not a viable option, as a building would not suddenly appear in the middle of the street. b. demonstration - Demonstrations are gatherings of people, often in public spaces like streets, and they could potentially block movement. c. laugh - This is an abstract concept and does not physically block a person from leaving work. d. garage - A garage is usually a designated area for parking vehicles, which would not block a person in the street. e. conference - Conferences are held in specific locations like conference rooms and convention centers and would not block a person in the street. 3. Out of the options, a demonstration is the most plausible cause of obstructing the person from leaving work, as it involves a large and potentially disruptive gathering of people in a public space like a street. 4. Therefore, we conclude that the answer is 'demonstration'."},{"question":"Here are some concepts: museum, tourist, walk What is a sentence about these concepts?","response":"Exploring a captivating museum provides an enriching experience for tourists, as they leisurely walk through its halls, immersing themselves in the history, culture, and art, ultimately broadening their knowledge while fostering a deeper appreciation for the world around them."},{"question":"Continue the following story.

Matthew kept them apart by spreading rumors about them.","response":"One day, there was a very single person named Christopher. Christopher really liked Matthew's boyfriend and wanted him all for himself. So, (a). Christopher decided to come up with a plan to keep them apart. He began to spread silly stories about Matthew and his boyfriend that weren't true. He thought that if he told enough people these stories, then Matthew's boyfriend would hear them and believe them. In his mind, this would make Matthew's boyfriend not want to be with Matthew anymore, and then Christopher could try to be with him instead. (b). Meanwhile, Matthew saw what Christopher was trying to do and felt very upset. He did not want to lose his boyfriend, so he made a plan of his own. Matthew decided to spread rumors about Christopher, so that his boyfriend would not want to be with Christopher. He thought that if enough people knew bad things about Christopher, his boyfriend would stay away from him and Christopher's plan would fail. In both situations, Christopher and Matthew were not being very nice to each other. Instead of talking openly about their feelings and trying to understand each other, they both used rumors to hurt one another. It is always better to talk and share our feelings with each other. That way, we can learn to understand and help each other better."},{"question":"Steven Norman Carlton (born December 22, 1944), nicknamed \\"Lefty\\", is a former Major League Baseball left-handed pitcher. He pitched from 1965 to 1988 for six different teams in his career, but it is his time with the Philadelphia Phillies where he received his greatest acclaim as a professional and won four Cy Young Awards. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1994. Carlton has the second-most lifetime strikeouts of any left-handed pitcher (4th overall), and the second-most lifetime wins of any left-handed pitcher (11th overall). Carlton slumped in 1973, losing 20 games. The media's questioning of his unusual training techniques led to an acrimonious relationship between them and Carlton. In 1976, upon the advice of his lawyer Edward L. Wolf, decided to sever all ties with the media, and refused to answer press questions for the rest of his career with the Phillies. This reached a point where, in 1981, while the Mexican rookie Fernando Valenzuela was achieving stardom with the Los Angeles Dodgers, a reporter remarked, \\"The two best pitchers in the National League don't speak English: Fernando Valenzuela and Steve Carlton.\\" Media charges of bigotry and anti-Semitism In 1994 he agreed to an interview with writer Pat Jordan at his home in Durango, Colorado. The result was the story \\"Thin Mountain Air\\" in the April 1994 issue of Philadelphia magazine. This article was noted by the New York Times as being the source of numerous claims about Steve Carlton's political and social beliefs: \\"According to Pat Jordan, the writer of the article, Carlton alternately said that the world is ruled or controlled by the Russian and United States Governments, which 'fill the air with low-frequency sound waves,' the Elders of Zion, British intelligence agencies, '12 Jewish bankers meeting in Switzerland' and 'a committee of 300 which meets at a roundtable in Rome.' Not only that, but Carlton also charges, according to Jordan, that President Clinton has 'a black son' he won't acknowledge and that the AIDS virus was created at a secret Maryland biological warfare laboratory to get rid of gays and blacks.'\\" This same New York Times article notes that teammate Tim McCarver defended Carlton against charges of being a bigot and an anti-Semite, though he acknowledged \\"If he's guilty of anything, it's believing some of the material he reads. Does he become confused with his reading about radical things? Yes. I've told him that. Does that translate into him being anti-Semitic? No.\\" did carlton enjoy speaking about himself?","response":"It appears that Steve Carlton did not enjoy speaking about himself, at least not to the media. His decision to sever all ties with the media in 1976 demonstrates his reluctance to engage in discussions about his personal life and career. Carlton's contentious relationship with the media and his subsequent silence for the rest of his career with the Phillies indicate that he may have felt uncomfortable discussing himself publicly. However, his decision to give an interview with writer Pat Jordan in 1994 suggests that there might have been situations where he felt more comfortable opening up. It is important to note that the interview was conducted at his home, which could have contributed to a safer and more private environment for Carlton to share his thoughts and beliefs. Nonetheless, the controversial content discussed in the interview highlights the risks Carlton faced when opening up about himself. In summary, while there might have been instances where Steve Carlton was willing to talk about himself, his general behavior and negative experiences with the media suggest that he did not particularly enjoy discussing his personal life or career in public settings."},{"question":"Given those answer options, answer the question: Based on this review, would the user recommend this product? === Review: THE ONLY REASON WHY I GAVE THIS ITEM 2 STARS WAS BECAUSE IT LASTED FOR AT LEAST A MONTH WAS AMAZING IN THE BEGINNING BUT ONCE I ADDED 10 POUNDS THE TWO SIDES BENT DOWN SO NOW IT LOOKS REALLY FUNNY WHEN I BENCH OR SQUAT LOL.

Although some indigenous peoples of the Americas were traditionally hunter-gatherers--and many, especially in the Amazon basin, still are--many groups practiced aquaculture and agriculture. The impact of their agricultural endowment to the world is a testament to their time and work in reshaping and cultivating the flora indigenous to the Americas. Although some societies depended heavily on agriculture, others practiced a mix of farming, hunting and gathering. Context: Indigenas or pueblos indigenas (\\"indigenous peoples\\") is a common term in Spanish-speaking countries, and pueblos nativos or nativos (lit. \\"native peoples\\") may also be heard, while aborigen (aborigine) is used in Argentina, and pueblos aborigenes (aboriginal peoples) is common in Chile. The term \\"Amerindian\\" (short for \\"'Indians of the Americas\\") is used in Quebec, the Guianas, and the English-speaking Caribbean. In Brazil, indigenas or povos indigenas are common if formal-sounding designations, while indio is still the more often-heard term (the noun for the Indian nationality being indiano), and aborigene and nativo being rarely used in Amerindian-specific contexts (e.g. aborigene is usually understood as the ethnonym for Indigenous Australians). Indigenous peoples are commonly known in Canada as Aboriginal peoples, which includes not only First Nations and Arctic Inuit, but also the minority population of First Nations-European mixed-race Metis people who identify culturally and ethnically with indigenous peoplehood. This is contrasted, for instance, to the American Indian-European mixed-race mestizos of Hispanic America (caboclos in Brazil) who, with their larger population (in most Latin American countries constituting either outright majorities, pluralities, or at the least large minorities), identify largely as a new ethnic group distinct from both Europeans and Indigenous Americans, but still considering themselves a subset of the European-derived Hispanic or Brazilian peoplehood in culture and ethnicity (cf. ladinos). Indigenous peoples of the United States are commonly known as Native Americans or American Indians, and Alaska Natives. Application of the term \\"Indian\\" originated with Christopher Columbus, who, in his search for India, thought that he had arrived in the East Indies. Eventually, those islands came to be known as the \\"West Indies\\", a name still used. This led to the blanket term \\"Indies\\" and \\"Indians\\" (Spanish indios, Portuguese indios) for the indigenous inhabitants, which implied some kind of racial or cultural unity among the indigenous peoples of the Americas. This unifying concept, codified in law, religion, and politics, was not originally accepted by the myriad groups of indigenous peoples themselves, but has since been embraced by many over the last two centuries. Even though the term \\"Indian\\" generally does not include the culturally and linguistically distinct indigenous peoples of the Arctic regions of the Americas--such as the Aleuts, Inuit, or Yupik peoples, who entered the continent as a second more recent wave of migration several thousand years before, and have much more recent genetic and cultural commonalities with the aboriginal peoples of the Asiatic Arctic Russian Far East--these groups are nonetheless considered \\"indigenous peoples of the Americas\\". The Portuguese and Spanish equivalents to Indian, nevertheless, could be used to mean any hunter-gatherer or full-blooded Indigenous person, particularly to continents other than Europe or Africa--for example, indios filipinos. Question: What is that word used for? Answer:","response":"The word \\"Indigenous\\" is used to describe the first people who lived in a certain area or land. These people are also known as native or original inhabitants. In your question, you mentioned different terms used in various countries to refer to indigenous people, such as \\"Indigenas,\\" \\"Pueblos Indigenas,\\" \\"Nativos,\\" \\"Aborigen,\\" and \\"Amerindian.\\" These words are used to talk about the people who lived in the Americas before other people from different countries arrived. They are important because they remind us of the different cultures, traditions, and history connected to the land we live on."},{"question":"The New Zealand Maori Queen, Te Arikinui Dame Te Atairangikaahu died on Tuesday at 5.32 p.m. (NZST) following a long illness.

Trouble is, I may have been sucked into twitter. I still think it's stupid though. I'm going out for bird provisions","response":"To describe the sentiment of the given tweet, we must first break down the statement into its various components and analyze each of them to fully understand the emotions and attitudes behind the message. The sentiment in this tweet can be understood through the following analysis: 1. \\"Trouble is, I may have been sucked into Twitter.\\": This part of the statement presents a somewhat negative sentiment. The use of the word \\"trouble\\" signifies that the user is experiencing a conflict or issue. Additionally, the phrase \\"sucked into Twitter\\" implies that the user has unintentionally become engrossed or absorbed in using the platform, potentially against their better judgment. 2. \\"I still think it's stupid though.\\": This statement also portrays a clearly negative sentiment. The user explicitly mentions that they believe Twitter is \\"stupid,\\" implying that they have a low opinion of the platform and its value. This negative viewpoint may be tied to their earlier mention of being \\"sucked into\\" the platform, with the user disliking their involvement in something they deem unworthy or nonsensical. 3. \\"I'm going out for bird provisions\\": The sentiment in this part of the statement is neutral, perhaps even slightly positive. By announcing their intention to leave for \\"bird provisions,\\" the user is signaling that they are stepping away from the online world of Twitter and engaging in a real-life activity - potentially something they find more worthwhile or enjoyable. The mention of birds could also be a subtle wordplay on Twitter's bird logo, adding a touch of humor to the message. It shows that, despite negative feelings towards the platform, the user chooses to focus on taking a break and attending to their offline responsibilities. In summary, the overall sentiment of this tweet can be described as a mix of negative and neutral emotions, with a hint of humor. The user expresses dissatisfaction and disapproval towards Twitter, while also acknowledging their unintended attachment to the platform. At the same time, they decide to step away and engage in an offline activity, incorporating a subtle wordplay on the platform's bird logo. This sentiment analysis captures the complexity and multidimensionality of the emotions and attitudes present in the tweet."},{"question":"Given the question: I loved the little guy from the day she brought him home. She carried him wrapped in a sweatshirt from the shelter at the corner where she'd been saying for months she was going to go. She set him down on the hardwood floor and he clipped around like a fawn - - clip, clip -- looking through doorways and carefully eyeing us both. He was tiny but he was strong. He was muscular and sleek, like a miniature greyhound, and we both watched intently as he clipped around, soldiering things out and whining under his breath. Miss Tennessee looked at me and smiled and said: \\"Well honey? What do you think?\\" And I told her: \\"I love the little guy.\\" He was never really my dog. He was more like my step-dog, but together we named him Steve. We thought it was funny, giving a dog a man's name like that.

It always made her swallow a grin. Steve's name, on the other hand, made it sound like he wasn't a dog at all, but this little man. Miss Tennessee often called him that: the little man. Steve liked me okay but he loved Miss Tennessee. With me it was man things. After he got snipped or when he was stung by bees, down there, in grass that came up to his chin, he would come sit by me, hoping I'd understand. With her, it was everything else.

Prior to the introduction of the current format of semifinals (deltävlingar) in 2002, the competition was usually a single live show. Under the current system, four semifinals are broadcast at 20:00 CET on consecutive Saturday nights. The semi-finals begin in early February, and seven songs compete in each show. Unlike in the final, no juries are used; televoting decides the results. The songs are performed live with telephone lines open for the first round of voting; two songs with the fewest votes do not qualify to the second round. The top five battle for a place in the final and Andra chansen round – the 1st and 2nd placed songs qualifying to the final, and the 3rd and 4th placed songs progressing to Andra chansen. Both finalists reprise their entries at the end of the broadcast. The organisation of a semi-final system for Melodifestivalen popularised televised heats at national Eurovision selections. A similar system was adopted by the Eurovision itself in 2004. The Second Chance round (Andra chansen) is the fifth heat in which the remaining four entries to the final are chosen. The third- and fourth-placed songs from each semi-final (eight songs in total) compete in the event. The first Second Chance round in 2002 had a panel of former winners decide the two finalists. Between 2003 and 2006, the semi-final performances were re-broadcast, and a round of voting narrowed the songs to three or four. Another round then determined the two finalists. The programme was broadcast on the Sunday afternoon after the fourth semi-final. It was held in a smaller venue than those that would have hosted the semi-finals—such as Berns Salonger in Stockholm, which hosted the Second Chance round in 2005. In 2007, the Second Chance round became a full semi-final, taking place in a venue comparable in size to those hosting the others. The expanded Second Chance takes place on a Saturday night, adding an extra week to the event's timetable. The format of voting also changed with the introduction of a knock-out system. The...

Unless you are going to determine steps to make your wishes turn into goals AND you’re going to follow through with those steps, you probably should not make New Year’s resolutions. Full disclaimer before we completely dive in: I’m not against setting goals. I have always been a goal setter and sometimes even a goal achiever. If you’re the same, you may enjoy this audible, or if you’re interested in developing and achieving SMART goals try this e-book or this book. Why You Shouldn’t Make New Year’s Resolutions You’ll probably write the same things on a sheet of paper that you did the year before. Some of the common resolutions we’ve all heard are: Lose weight, exercise, spend less, save more, travel, go to church, and so on and so forth. There’s a reason these are common. We hear them (or write them) time and time again and…nothing changes. By mid-January, they’ll be long forgotten. Maybe even before January 15th, they aren’t a thought in our minds. They were good ideas two weeks prior (and the years before that), but that’s what they have remained…ideas. You didn’t think of a route to your destination. Saving money sounds great, but do you know what you’re already spending? Do you know what you need to cut and where you’ll put that amount? Have you factored in your new gym membership? What will you do with it? Will the autodraft payment that comes out each month help you shed those pounds? What churches are in your area? Do they have programs your family will be interested in? Do you know when the services are? You’re overwhelmed. You try to better yourself constantly. Maybe. Let’s say some of you try to better yourselves constantly. Which can be a good thing. But it can also be the reason you fail yourselves time and time again. You say yes when you should say no, sign up when you should wait a few more months, and have a list of ten New Year’s resolutions when you should focus on two.

Article:","response":"Title: Three Lions Embark on US Friendlies Ahead of World Cup; Arsenal’s Oxlade-Chamberlain and Wilshere Flaunt Suits on Social Media As the excitement builds for the upcoming 2022 FIFA World Cup, the England national team, better known as the Three Lions, are heading to the United States for friendly matches against Ecuador and Honduras. These matches will serve as a final rehearsal for the World Cup, allowing the players to fine-tune their skills and teamwork, while also giving manager Gareth Southgate a chance to make his last assessments and decisions for the main event. England's World Cup journey officially begins on June 14, when they square off against Italy in a highly anticipated contest.

While victory in the friendlies will not automatically guarantee success at the tournament, these games will only improve the team's confidence and determination to succeed. Manager Gareth Southgate will undoubtedly use these matches to identify the most suitable tactical systems and player combinations that will bring the best out of his squad. With a plethora of talented individuals at his disposal, Southgate has the difficult yet enviable task of selecting his best XI. These matches will give him the chance to experiment and learn which tactics are effective while developing a clear game plan that will give his side the best chance of triumph.

These mutations are considered neutral. Occasionally, a mutation may make a protein even better than it was before. Or the protein might help the organism adapt to a new environment. These mutations are considered beneficial. An example is a mutation that helps bacteria resist antibiotics. Bacteria with the mutation increase in numbers, so the mutation becomes more common. Other mutations are harmful. They may even be deadly. Harmful mutations often result in a protein that no longer can do its job. Some harmful mutations cause cancer or other genetic disorders. and the situation: David is a biochemist with a pharmaceutical company.

A mall Santa had a heart attack at work and was rushed to the Emergency Room in full cardiac arrest. Let me explain that a person playing Santa is generally a certain age (white beard) and body type (round) that is predisposed to cardiac disease. We did everything we could but ultimately our efforts were futile. The mall Santa rode his sleigh into the great beyond. A mother, there to visit another patient, was insistent that her 7–8 year old son be allowed back to visit his grandmother. We had a strict 12 year old age limit visitation policy. I was called to speak with her. ”Why do you have such a stupid Draconian policy?” She insisted. “The Emergency Room is no place for a child ma’am. Besides, the germs and infections he may be exposed to, there are things he may see or hear that a child would have a hard time processing,” I explained. “Like what?” She argued. “Well, there are people in pain moaning,” I answered. “And drunks cursing at the staff. It’s a tough place.” “He’s fine,” she insisted. “I think I know how to parent. I don’t need you to worry about what my son is able to handle.” I caved in and allowed her back. As we passed the room with the dead Santa, a tech exited and opened the curtain. Her child looked in and saw Santa’s lifeless body, ET tube sticking out of his throat, boots still on but costume cut to shreds and strewn across the room. The child lost it! “Mom, Santa Claus is Dead!” He cried. “I’m not going to get anything for Christmas.” “Why would someone open the curtain?” The mother demanded. “I warned you,” I said. “That’s why we have a 12 years and above visitation policy.” She was not happy. Come to find out the child had his picture made with that very Santa a few days prior. Very ironic. The doctors probably spent how long trying to save Santa? - A couple of hours. - not enough information - All night. - Several days.

Q: Passage: On 31 October 2005, Fanning released his debut solo album entitled Tea & Sympathy. The album debuted at No. 1 on the Australian ARIA Albums chart, and spent 58 weeks in the top 50. It peaked at No. 11 during its 18-week stay on the New Zealand albums chart.Tea & Sympathy comprised songs Fanning had written in his time with Powderfinger, as well as new content written after the band went on hiatus. Most of the writing was done in what Fanning described as a \\"creative burst\\" between March and May 2005. Much of the inspiration for the work on the album came from Fanning's reaction to the death of his brother in 2002, and to the ending of a 12-year relationship with his girlfriend, Philippa Sison. The majority of the album was recorded at Real World Studios with Tchad Blake in June 2005, except for \\"Not Finished Just Yet\\", \\"Believe\\", \\"Wash Me Clean\\", and \\"Hope & Validation\\", which were recorded at Fanning's Brisbane home. Fanning was supported by musicians Jerry Marotta, Keith Duffy, and John Bedggood, who also formed part of his live band. The album was developed in a relaxed manner, with Fanning stating, \\"We had a ball putting the songs together.\\"Three singles were released from the album. The most successful of these was the lead single, \\"Wish You Well\\", shortly followed by \\"Songbird\\". These releases were only sold as digital download singles. The third single from the album, \\"Watch Over Me\\", was the only to be released as a CD single and achieved minor success on the Australian singles chart. It entered the chart on 9 July 2006 at No. 16, and spent eight weeks in the top 50. On 26 January 2006, \\"Wish You Well\\" was voted No. 1 for the Triple J Hottest 100, 2005. Following \\"Watch Over Me\\", Fanning digitally released a fourth single \\"Weekend of Mystery\\", which was not officially on the album, except for those who purchased the album from the iTunes Store. Fanning also took home the award for Best Music Video at the 2006 ARIA Awards for the iconic 'Wish You Well' clip.On 2 December 2005, Fanning announced a nationwide Which Way Home Concert Tour, named after the song on the album of the same name. Fanning played seven shows between 25 February and 10 March 2006, in all of Australia's major capital cities. He was supported by Perth band The Panics and Brisbane singer Andrew Morris. He followed this with the \\"Yesterday's Gone\\" tour, announced on 11 August 2006, and concluding with Powderfinger re-uniting and returning to the recording studio— Fanning later stated that while he enjoyed making Tea & Sympathy, \\"Powderfinger is my real job\\".

Options: - office - bar - barn - industrial area - museum The answer is \\"barn\\" because","response":"The answer is \\"barn\\" because a milking machine is a piece of equipment used predominantly in the dairy farming industry for the extraction of milk from cows or other dairy animals like goats and sheep. A barn, which is a large structure typically found on farms, is the most suitable location to house and operate milking machines. It provides a safe, clean, and organized environment for the collection of milk. In contrast, the other options are not suitable for the purpose of milking animals. An office is a space used for conducting business, while a bar is a public establishment that serves beverages and is meant for leisure. Neither of these places would be appropriate for dairy farming activities. An industrial area has more to do with large-scale manufacturing and commercial activities rather than agricultural pursuits. Lastly, a museum is a space reserved for the preservation and exhibition of historical and cultural artifacts, which would not typically involve the daily operation of milking machines. That being said, it is important to note that depending on the context, it is theoretically possible to find a milking machine in some of these other settings (e.g., an agricultural museum that showcases historical milking machines). However, the most common and practical location for a milking machine in use would be a barn on a dairy farm."},{"question":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Mrs. Fairfax confuses her a little at first, because _ is so informal and welcoming. But in due course Jane discovers that Mrs. Fairfax is the housekeeper. Jane's pupil, Adele Varens, is the eight-year-old French child under the legal protection of Mr. Edward Rochester, the owner of the house. (We learn later that her mother had claimed she was his illegitimate daughter. Mr. Rochester is not convinced by this claim, but felt he could not leave the little girl poor when her mother died.) Adele is a pleasant little girl, even if she is not a particularly eager student. Life goes on very peacefully for three months, until the return of Mr. Rochester. Jane first meets him on his horse, and her description of him is quite fanciful. He takes a fall and Jane helps him, although she does not know who he is until they are both back at Thornfield. It is obvious to the reader, although not to Jane, that the reason why Mr. Rochester stays at Thornfield much longer than usual is that he finds her company enjoyable. Jane, unknowingly at first, falls in love with him. Their closeness is very apparent. There is something about Thornfield that is mysterious. Jane is encouraged to focus her attention on the servant Grace Poole, who is Mr. Rochester's mad wife Bertha Mason's keeper at Thornfield, and whose drunken carelessness frequently allows Bertha to escape and do something violent. It is clear to the reader, though, that Mr. Rochester's emotional engagement is immense. When his bed is set on fire, Jane rescues him, but does not understand why the matter is not pursued, despite Mr. Rochester assuring her the criminal is Grace. The next morning Grace behaves as though she has done nothing wrong. Eventually, Mr. Rochester leaves, to go to a house party. He brings everyone at the party back with him, transforming the atmosphere in the house, and delighting Adele. One of the guests is Blanche Ingram, whom Mr. Rochester is confidently expected to marry. However, it is clear from the way she is portrayed in the book that she is too proud; our sympathies are not with her. Mr. Rochester is called away from the house, and when he returns he chooses to play the role of a fortune teller. It is clear to the reader that one of his motives is to try to turn Blanche against the idea of marriage to him. While he has clearly bothered her, he is unsuccessful. One afternoon, Jane hears that her cousin John Reed is dead and Mrs. Reed, who is probably on her deathbed, has been asking for her. With strict instructions from Mr. Rochester to return quickly, she sets off to Gateshead. On arrival, she realizes she no longer hates her cousins. However, Mrs. Reed is still bitter towards her, owing to the fact that Jane's mother was Mr Reed's favourite sister and this resulted in him apparently favouring Jane over his own children. A short time later, Mrs. Reed gives Jane a letter from her uncle, John Eyre, that was written three years earlier. It explains how he planned to adopt Jane and allow her to inherit his fortune. Mrs. Reed never handed the letter over because of her bitterness. Jane tries once more to seek reconciliation , but without success; her aunt dies that night. 1. Who arrives at Thornfield? 2.

A:","response":"Claudio Moneta, an Italian voice actor, has starred in numerous series based on Japanese manga throughout his career, providing Italian dubs for various characters. However, one notable series in which he played a significant role is \\"Saint Seiya,\\" also known as \\"Knights of the Zodiac.\\" \\"Saint Seiya\\" is a popular Japanese manga created by Masami Kurumada and published from 1986 to 1990. Later on, it was adapted into an anime television series, which aired from 1986 to 1989. In the Italian version of \\"Saint Seiya,\\" Claudio Moneta lent his voice to one of the main characters, Andromeda Shun. Andromeda Shun is a gentle, pure-hearted warrior who dons the Andromeda Cloth, one of the 88 mythical armors worn by the Knights of the Zodiac. Shun is a central character in the series, and his compassion and reluctance to harm others help drive the storyline and subplot throughout the anime. Despite being a key character, Andromeda Shun was not the only role that Claudio Moneta has taken on in the Saint Seiya franchise. He has also provided the Italian dub for other characters such as Leda, Gamma Ray, and Kappa in the \\"Saint Seiya: Episode G\\" anime adaptation. Throughout his career, Claudio Moneta has been involved in the Italian adaptations of various Japanese manga series, including \\"Dragon Ball,\\" \\"Naruto,\\" \\"One Piece,\\" and \\"Cardfight!!

Step 1: We'll start by moving all the y-containing terms to one side of the equation. -3172100*y +3171853*y + 8398 = -3171853*y +3171853*y This simplifies to: -249*y + 8398 = 0 Step 2: We'll now isolate y by moving the constant term to the other side of the equation. That requires subtracting 8398 from both sides. -249*y = -8398 Step 3: We'll solve for y by dividing every term by -249. y = 8398 / 249 As a result, we obtain the numerical value for y, which is approximately -33.73. Note that I made sure to move the constant correctly following the mathematical rules, and then divide by -249 to isolate y. The negative sign was correctly handled as well. So, there appears to be no issue with the calculation."},{"question":"Answer the following question given this paragraph: Is Ceres a planet? Ceres only has about 1.3% of the mass of the Earth’s Moon. Its orbit is full of other smaller bodies. Its gravity was not high enough to clear its orbit. Ceres fails the fourth criterion for being a planet. Ceres is now considered a dwarf planet, the closest to the Sun. Q: What kind of planet do we consider ceres to be? A: Answer:","response":"Ceres is considered to be a dwarf planet, which distinguishes it from the eight main planets in our solar system. As a dwarf planet, Ceres shares certain characteristics with larger planets, such as having a spherical shape and orbiting the Sun. However, it does not fulfill all the criteria required for classification as a full-fledged planet. The primary reason Ceres is categorized as a dwarf planet rather than a regular planet is that it fails to meet the fourth criterion established by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) for defining planets. This criterion stipulates that a celestial body must have cleared its orbit of other smaller objects, meaning its gravitational force must be strong enough to either consume or repel other bodies in its orbital path, effectively establishing its dominance in that region of space. Ceres, with a mass of just 1.3% that of Earth's Moon, does not have the requisite gravitational strength to clear its orbit of other smaller bodies, as there are many other objects present in its orbital path. This lack of clearing ability has led the IAU to classify Ceres as a dwarf planet, rather than as one of the main planets in our solar system. As the closest dwarf planet to the Sun, Ceres occupies a unique position in our solar system and serves as an example of the diverse range of celestial bodies that exist within it. While the distinction between planets and dwarf planets may seem subtle, it highlights the complexity and nuance of the astronomical classification systems used to better understand and compartmentalize the vast array of objects that exist within our universe."},{"question":"How do you say \\"To the right there are three bedrooms each one with bathroom en-suite connected through a large corridor.\\" in Spanish?","response":"En español, se dice \\"A la derecha hay tres habitaciones, cada una con baño privado, conectadas por un pasillo grande.\\" Aquí, \\"a la derecha\\" significa \\"to the right\\", \\"tres habitaciones\\" significa \\"three bedrooms\\", \\"cada una con baño privado\\" significa \\"each one with bathroom en-suite\\", y \\"conectadas por un pasillo grande\\" significa \\"connected through a large corridor\\"."},{"question":"Question: What was the first day that the new parliament met?

However, to provide a more detailed and longer answer, you could include more information about the historical context, the country in question, and the circumstances that led to the convening of the new parliament. For example, suppose the new parliament refers to the United Kingdom's first ever parliament. In that case, the response could be: \\"The first day that the new parliament met in the United Kingdom was on May 15, 1265. This significant event in English history occurred during the Second Barons' War, a civil conflict between the forces loyal to Simon de Montfort, Earl of Leicester, and those led by King Henry III. Following de Montfort's victory at the Battle of Lewes, he seized control of the government and unilaterally called for a parliament to convene. The new parliament was revolutionary for its time, as it included not only members of the clergy and nobility but also representatives from cities and boroughs, known as burgesses in England. For the first time in history, the common people had a direct voice in their nation's government, which marked the beginning of a parliamentary tradition that would eventually evolve into modern democratic institutions. On May 15, 1265, the new parliament assembled in Westminster Hall, marking a pivotal moment in the development of parliamentary democracy and laying the foundations for the modern British political system.\\" This detailed and longer response provides more context and historical information about the event in question, which enriches the reader's understanding of the significance of the first day that the new parliament met."},{"question":"Tornadoes , up to a foot of rain and hail as big as cantaloupes pounded southern Nebraska and northern Kansas , killing one man and destroying at least four homes .

Context: William White sat across from me, fidgeting nervously with an empty packet of artificial sweetener while his coffee went cold, ignored on the table in front of him. He rolled the torn yellow paper up like a tight little spliff, then unrolled it, smoothed it out flat, and then rolled it again. I was midway through my third cup of coffee with no intention of stopping soon. I was tired and edgy, irritated at William for dragging me out at this time of night, and getting even more irritated at his refusal to get to the point. 'Did you know Philip K. Dick had a twin sister?' I stared at him blankly. 'Her name was Jane. She died shortly after their birth. They were six weeks premature,' he continued, his eyes drifting off to the window to his right. I wasn't sure if he was looking at something through it or staring at his own reflection in it. 'Dick never got over Jane's death; her ghost haunted him throughout his life, and the idea of a phantom twin pops up throughout his work. Some have even speculated that Dick's inability to make peace with the loss of his sister contributed to his drug abuse, and by extension also his death at the relatively young age of 53.' He unrolled the sweetener packet, laid it on the table, placed both index fingers together in its center, and then spread them outward, smoothing the paper flat. I reached out and slammed my own hand on top of the packet, preventing him from fiddling with it anymore. 'Sorry,' he said sheepishly. I let out a sigh. 'Not that this isn't fascinating, but did you seriously call me out to Denny's at 3 am for this?' Question: What did William say contributed to Dick's drug abuse problem?

The most common method of assigning numbers to lines is to assign every line a unique number, starting at 1 for the first line, and incrementing by 1 for each successive line. - Machine code or machine language is a set of instructions executed directly by a computer's central processing unit (CPU). Each instruction performs a very specific task, such as a load, a jump, or an ALU operation on a unit of data in a CPU register or memory. Every program directly executed by a CPU is made up of a series of such instructions. - In computer science, a preprocessor is a program that processes its input data to produce output that is used as input to another program. The output is said to be a preprocessed form of the input data, which is often used by some subsequent programs like compilers. The amount and kind of processing done depends on the nature of the preprocessor; some preprocessors are only capable of performing relatively simple textual substitutions and macro expansions, while others have the power of full-fledged programming languages. - Ratfor (short for \\"Rational Fortran\\") is a programming language implemented as a preprocessor for Fortran 66. It provided modern control structures, unavailable in Fortran 66, to replace GOTOs and statement numbers. - Computer science is the study of the theory, experimentation, and engineering that form the basis for the design and use of computers. It is the scientific and practical approach to computation and its applications and the systematic study of the feasibility, structure, expression, and mechanization of the methodical procedures (or algorithms) that underlie the acquisition, representation, processing, storage, communication of, and access to information. An alternate, more succinct definition of computer science is the study of automating algorithmic processes that scale. A computer scientist specializes in the theory of computation and the design of computational systems. - Goto (goto, GOTO, GO TO or other case combinations, depending on the programming language) is a statement found in many computer programming languages. It performs a one-way transfer of control to another line of code; in contrast a function call normally returns control. The jumped-to locations are usually identified using labels, though some languages use line numbers. At the machine code level, a goto is a form of branch or jump statement. Many languages support the goto statement, and many do not (see language support). - A compiler is a computer program (or a set of programs) that transforms source code written in a programming language (the source language) into another computer language (the target language), with the latter often having a binary form known as object code. The most common reason for converting source code is to create an executable program. - Crystallography is the experimental science of determining the arrangement of atoms in the crystalline solids (see crystal structure). The word \\"crystallography\\" derives from the Greek words \\"crystallon\\" \\"cold drop, frozen drop\\", with its meaning extending to all solids with some degree of transparency, and \\"grapho\\" \\"I write\\". In July 2012, the United Nations recognised the importance of the science of crystallography by proclaiming that 2014 would be the International Year of Crystallography. X-ray crystallography is used to determine the structure of large biomolecules such as proteins. Before the development of X-ray diffraction crystallography (see below), the study of crystals was based on physical measurements of their geometry. This involved measuring the angles of crystal faces relative to each other and to theoretical reference axes (crystallographic axes), and establishing the symmetry of the crystal in question. This physical measurement is carried out using a goniometer. The position in 3D space of each crystal face is plotted on a stereographic net such as a Wulff net or Lambert net. The pole to each face is plotted on the net. Each point is labelled with its Miller index. The final plot allows the symmetry of the crystal to be established. - Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is a branch of fluid mechanics that uses numerical analysis and data structures to solve and analyze problems that involve fluid flows. Computers are used to perform the calculations required to simulate the interaction of liquids and gases with surfaces defined by boundary conditions. With high-speed supercomputers, better solutions can be achieved. Ongoing research yields software that improves the accuracy and speed of complex simulation scenarios such as transonic or turbulent flows. Initial experimental validation of such software is performed using a wind tunnel with the final validation coming in full-scale testing, e.g. flight tests. - A programming language is a formal computer language designed to communicate instructions to a machine, particularly a computer. Programming languages can be used to create programs to control the behavior of a machine or to express algorithms. - Computational physics is the study and implementation of numerical analysis to solve problems in physics for which a quantitative theory already exists. Historically, computational physics was the first application of modern computers in science, and is now a subset of computational science. - Fortran (formerly FORTRAN, derived from \\"Formula Translation\\") is a general-purpose, imperative programming language that is especially suited to numeric computation and scientific computing. Originally developed by IBM in the 1950s for scientific and engineering applications, Fortran came to dominate this area of programming early on and has been in continuous use for over half a century in computationally intensive areas such as numerical weather prediction, finite element analysis, computational fluid dynamics, computational physics, crystallography and computational chemistry. It is a popular language for high-performance computing and is used for programs that benchmark and rank the world's fastest supercomputers. - Computational chemistry is a branch of chemistry that uses computer simulation to assist in solving chemical problems. It uses methods of theoretical chemistry, incorporated into efficient computer programs, to calculate the structures and properties of molecules and solids. It is necessary because, apart from relatively recent results concerning the hydrogen molecular ion (dihydrogen cation, see references therein for more details), the quantum many-body problem cannot be solved analytically, much less in closed form. While computational results normally complement the information obtained by chemical experiments, it can in some cases predict hitherto unobserved chemical phenomena. It is widely used in the design of new drugs and materials. - Numerical weather prediction (NWP) uses mathematical models of the atmosphere and oceans to predict the weather based on current weather conditions. Though first attempted in the 1920s, it was not until the advent of computer simulation in the 1950s that numerical weather predictions produced realistic results. A number of global and regional forecast models are run in different countries worldwide, using current weather observations relayed from radiosondes, weather satellites and other observing systems as inputs. - Ratfiv is an enhanced version of the Ratfor programming language , a preprocessor for Fortran designed to give it C - like capabilities . Fortran was widely used for scientific programming but had very basic control - flow primitives ( \`\` do '' and \`\` goto '' ) and no \`\` macro '' facility which limited its expressiveness . The name of the language is a pun ( Ratfor ( RATional FORtran ) - > \`\` Rat Four '' - > \`\` Rat Five '' - > RatFiv ) . Ratfiv was developed by Bill Wood at the Institute for Cancer Research , Philadelphia , PA in the early 1980s and released on several DECUS ( Digital Equipment Users Group ) SIG ( Special Interest Group ) tapes . It is based on the original Ratfor by B. Kernighan and P. J.

At a simple level there are leaders and followers, but in reality the lines are rarely as clear as that. Many leaders, with a common example being some founders, have tremendous vision and imagination, but lack the skills to translate that vision into actionable work. Many followers need structure to their efforts, but are dynamic and creative in the execution. Thus, the social dynamic in organizations needs a little more nuance. This is where traditional management hierarchies break down in companies. You may have your SVPs, then your VPs, then your Senior Directors, then your Directors, and so on, but in reality most successful companies don’t observe those hierarchies stringently. In many organizations a junior-level employee who has been there for a while can have as much influence and value, if not more, than a brand new SVP. As such, the dream is that we build organizations with crisp reporting lines but in which all employees feel they have the ability to bring their creativity and ideas to logically influence the scope, work, and culture of the organization. Sadly, this is where many organizations run into trouble. It seems to be the same ‘ol story time after time: as the organization grows, the divide between the senior leadership and the folks on the ground widens. Water cooler conversations and bar-side grumblings fuel the fire and resentment, frustrations, and resume-editing often sets in. So much of this is avoidable though. Of course, there will always be frustration in any organization: this is part and parcel of people working together. Nothing will be perfect, and it shouldn’t be…frustration and conflict can often lead to organizations re-pivoting and taking a new approach.

Title: Torn Curtain Movie plot: Michael Armstrong (Paul Newman), an American physicist and rocket scientist, is traveling to a conference in Copenhagen with his assistant and fiancÃ©e, Sarah Sherman (Julie Andrews). Armstrong receives a radiogram to pick up a book in Copenhagen; it contains a message which says, \\"Contact Ï in case [of emergency.]\\" He tells Sherman he is going to Stockholm, but she discovers he is flying to East Berlin and follows him. When they land, he is welcomed by representatives of the East German government. Sherman realizes that Armstrong has defected, and is appalled that, given the circumstances of the Cold War, if she stays with him, she will likely never see her home or family again. Armstrong visits a contact, a \\"farmer\\" (Mort Mills), where it is revealed that his defection is in fact a ruse to gain the confidence of the East German scientific establishment, in order to learn how much their chief scientist Gustav Lindt (Ludwig Donath) and by extension, the Soviet Union, knows about anti-missile systems. Armstrong has made preparations to return to the West via an escape network, known as Ï. However, he was followed to the farm by his official guard, Hermann Gromek (Wolfgang Kieling), an East German security officer. Gromek realizes what Ï is and that Armstrong is a double agent, and as Gromek is calling the police, a tortuous fight scene commences that ends with Gromek being killed by Armstrong and the farmer's wife (Carolyn Conwell). Gromek and his motorcycle are then buried. The taxicab driver (Peter Lorre Jr., uncredited) who drove Armstrong to the farm, however, reports on Armstrong's behavior to the police.

Both rivers are very important for the local economies. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which river had a water that contains lower concentrations of dissolved oxygen? Hint: The major zones in river ecosystems are determined by the river bed's gradient or by the velocity of the current. Faster moving turbulent water typically contains greater concentrations of dissolved oxygen, which supports greater biodiversity than the slow moving water of pools. These distinctions form the basis for the division of rivers into upland and lowland rivers. The food base of streams within riparian forests is mostly derived from the trees, but wider streams and those that lack a canopy derive the majority of their food base from algae. Anadromous fish are also an important source of nutrients. Environmental threats to rivers include loss of water, dams, chemical pollution and introduced species. A dam produces negative effects that continue down the watershed. The most important negative effects are the reduction of spring flooding, which damages wetlands, and the retention of sediment, which leads to loss of deltaic wetlands. The answer to this question is:","response":"The Mures river had a water that contains lower concentrations of dissolved oxygen. This is because, as mentioned in the hint, faster moving turbulent water typically contains greater concentrations of dissolved oxygen, which supports greater biodiversity than the slow-moving water of pools. Since the Olt river was fast-moving and the Mures river was slow-moving and deep, the Mures river would have a lower concentration of dissolved oxygen in comparison to the Olt river."},{"question":"Context: Skylar took the Brown family to the Superbowl for the whole day as a treat.

It is one of three separate royal houses referred to as \\"Angevin\\", meaning \\"from Anjou\\" in France. Founded by Charles I of Naples, a son of Louis VIII of France, the Capetian king first ruled the Kingdom of Sicily during the 13th century. Later the War of the Sicilian Vespers forced him out of the island of Sicily, leaving him with just the southern half of the Italian Peninsula the Kingdom of Naples.

It is shared by three countries: Croatia, Slovenia, and Italy. - The Drava or Drave is a river in southern Central Europe. With a length of , it is the fourth longest tributary of the Danube. Its source is near the market town of Innichen (San Candido), in the Puster Valley of South Tyrol, Italy. The river flows eastwards through East Tirol and Carinthia in Austria into the Styria region of Slovenia. It then turns southeast, passing through Croatia and forming most of the border between Croatia and Hungary, before it joins the Danube near Osijek. - The Kingdom of Naples, comprising the southern part of the Italian Peninsula, was the remainder of the old Kingdom of Sicily after the secession of the island of Sicily as a result of the Vespers of 1282. It continued to be officially known as the Kingdom of Sicily, although it no longer included the island of Sicily.

In 1816, it was reunified with the island kingdom of Sicily once again to form the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. - The Adriatic Sea is a body of water separating the Italian Peninsula from the Balkan peninsula and the Apennine Mountains from the Dinaric Alps and adjacent ranges. The Adriatic is the northernmost arm of the Mediterranean Sea, extending from the Strait of Otranto (where it connects to the Ionian Sea) to the northwest and the Po Valley. The countries with coasts on the Adriatic are Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Greece, Italy, Montenegro and Slovenia.

It is divided into three basins, the northern being the shallowest and the southern being the deepest, with a maximum depth of . The Otranto Sill, an underwater ridge, is located at the border between the Adriatic and Ionian Seas. The prevailing currents flow counterclockwise from the Strait of Otranto, along the eastern coast and back to the strait along the western (Italian) coast. Tidal movements in the Adriatic are slight, although larger amplitudes are known to occur occasionally. The Adriatic's salinity is lower than the Mediterranean's because the Adriatic collects a third of the fresh water flowing into the Mediterranean, acting as a dilution basin. The surface water temperatures generally range from in summer to in winter, significantly moderating the Adriatic Basin's climate. - The Sava is a river in Central Europe, a right side tributary of the Danube. It flows through Slovenia, Croatia, along the northern border of Bosnia and Herzegovina, through Serbia, discharging into the Danube in Belgrade. Its central part is a natural border of Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia. The Sava forms the northern border of the Balkan Peninsula, and southern edge of the Pannonian Plain. - In the history of Europe, the Middle Ages or medieval period lasted from the 5th to the 15th century. It began with the fall of the Western Roman Empire and merged into the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery. The Middle Ages is the middle period of the three traditional divisions of Western history: classical antiquity, the medieval period, and the modern period. The medieval period is itself subdivided into the Early, High, and Late Middle Ages. - Croats are a nation and South Slavic ethnic group at the crossroads of Central Europe, Southeast Europe, and the Mediterranean Sea. Croats mainly live in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, but are an officially recognized minority in Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Italy, Montenegro, Romania, Serbia, and Slovakia.

Thereafter, he claimed the island, though his power was restricted to the peninsular possessions of the kingdom, with his capital at Naples (and for this he is usually titled King of Naples after 1282, as are his successors). - Criana (Hungarian: \\"Körösvidék\\") is a geographical and historical region divided today between Romania and Hungary, named after the Cri (Körös) River and its three tributaries: the Criul Alb, Criul Negru, and Criul Repede. - Slavonski Brod is a city in eastern Croatia, with a population of 59,000 in 2011. Located in the region of Slavonia, it is the centre of Brod-Posavina County and a river port on the Sava river. - Stephen , Duke of Slavonia ( 26 December 1332 -- 9 August 1354 ) , was a Hungarian prince of the Capetian House of Anjou who served as governor of the provinces of Transylvania , Slavonia , Dalmatia and Croatia during the reign of his brother , King Louis I. - Slavonia is, with Dalmatia, Croatia proper, and Istria, one of the four historical regions of Croatia. Taking up the east of the country, it roughly corresponds with five Croatian counties: Brod-Posavina, Osijek-Baranja, Požega-Slavonia, Virovitica-Podravina and Vukovar-Srijem, although the territory of the counties includes Baranya, and the definition of the western extent of Slavonia as a region varies.

It was the most senior line of the Capetian dynasty itself a derivative dynasty from the Robertians. Historians in the 19th century came to apply the name \\"Capetian\\" to both the ruling house of France and to the wider-spread male-line descendants of Hugh Capet. It was not a contemporary practice (see House of France). They were sometimes called \\"the third race of kings\\", the Merovingians being the first, and the Carolingians being the second. The name is derived from the nickname of Hugh, the first Capetian King, who was known as \\"Hugh Capet\\". The direct succession of French kings, father to son, from 987 to 1316, of thirteen generations in almost 330 years, was unparallelled in recorded history. - A natural border is a border between states or their subdivisions which is concomitant with natural formations such as rivers, mountain ranges, or deserts. The \\"doctrine of natural boundaries\\" developed in Western culture in the 17th century being based upon the \\"natural\\" ideas of Rousseau and developing concepts of nationalism. The similar concept in China developed earlier from natural zones of control. - The War of the Sicilian Vespers or just War of the Vespers was a conflict that started with the insurrection of the Sicilian Vespers against Charles of Anjou in 1282, and ended in 1302 with the peace of Caltabellotta.

The war resulted in the division of the old Kingdom of Sicily; at Caltabellotta, Charles II was confirmed as king of the peninsular territories of Sicily (the Kingdom of Naples), while Frederick III was confirmed as king of the island territories (the Kingdom of Trinacria). - The Sicilian Vespers is the name given to the successful rebellion on the island of Sicily that broke out at Easter, 1282 against the rule of the French-born king Charles I, who had ruled the Kingdom of Sicily since 1266. Within six weeks, three thousand French men and women were slain by the rebels, and the government of King Charles lost control of the island. It was the beginning of the War of the Sicilian Vespers. - Vukovar is a city in eastern Croatia. It has Croatia's largest river port, located at the confluence of the Vuka River and the Danube. Vukovar is the seat of the Vukovar-Syrmia County. The city's registered population was 26,468 in the 2011 census, with a total of 27,683 in the municipality. - A mediterranean climate or dry summer climate is the climate typical of the lands in the Mediterranean Basin. The lands around the Mediterranean Sea form the largest area where this climate type is found, but it also is found in most of coastal California, in parts of Western and South Australia, in southwestern South Africa, sections of Central Asia, and in central Chile. - Naples (Neapolitan: \\"Napule\\" or ; meaning \\"new city\\") is the capital of the Italian region Campania and the third-largest municipality in Italy, after Rome and Milan. In 2015, around 975,260 people lived within the city's administrative limits. The Metropolitan City of Naples had a population of 3,115,320.

Bound on the east and south by its natural borders, the Carpathian mountain range, historical Transylvania extended westward to the Apuseni Mountains. The term sometimes encompasses not only Transylvania proper, but also the historical regions of Criana, Maramure, and the Romanian part of Banat. - Croatia proper is one of the four historical regions of the Republic of Croatia, together with Dalmatia, Slavonia, and Istria. It is located between Slavonia in the east, the Adriatic Sea in the west, and Dalmatia to the south. The region is not officially defined, and its borders and extent are described differently by various sources. Croatia proper is the most significant economic area of the country, contributing well over 50% of Croatia's gross domestic product. The capital of both Croatia proper, and the Republic of Croatia, Zagreb, is the largest city and most important economic centre in the region.

What is the solution?","response":"To solve the given equation -28*v + 20 = -32*v for v, we first need to isolate the variable (v) on one side of the equation. Step 1: Add 28*v to both sides to collect the v terms on one side: -28*v + 20 + 28*v = -32*v + 28*v This simplifies to: 20 = -4*v Step 2: Now, to isolate v, we need to divide both sides by the coefficient of v which is -4: 20 / (-4) = -4*v / (-4) This simplifies to: -5 = v The solution is v = -5."},{"question":"Q:This article: When originally used in Olney, it is unknown what music, if any, accompanied the verses written by John Newton. Contemporary hymnbooks did not contain music and were simply small books of religious poetry. The first known instance of Newton's lines joined to music was in A Companion to the Countess of Huntingdon's Hymns (London, 1808), where it is set to the tune \\"Hephzibah\\" by English composer John Husband. Common meter hymns were interchangeable with a variety of tunes; more than twenty musical settings of \\"Amazing Grace\\" circulated with varying popularity until 1835 when William Walker assigned Newton's words to a traditional song named \\"New Britain\\", which was itself an amalgamation of two melodies (\\"Gallaher\\" and \\"St. Mary\\") first published in the Columbian Harmony by Charles H.

Princes of the German states gathered there to proclaim Wilhelm I of Prussia as German Emperor after the French capitulation in the Franco-Prussian War. Unofficially, the \\"de facto\\" transition of most of the German-speaking populations into a federated organization of states had been developing for some time through alliances formal and informal between princely rulersbut in fits and starts; self-interests of the various parties hampered the process over nearly a century of autocratic experimentation, beginning in the era of the Napoleonic Wars, which saw the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire (1806), and the subsequent rise of German nationalism. - The German Empire (officially ') was the historical German nation state that existed from the unification of Germany in 1871 to the abdication of Kaiser Wilhelm II in November 1918, when Germany became a federal republic (the Weimar Republic). - Civil registration is the system by which a government records the vital events (births, marriages, and deaths) of its citizens and residents. The resulting repository or database has different names in different countries and even in different US states. It can be called a civil registry , civil register (but this is also an official term for an individual file of a vital event), vital records, and other terms, and the office responsible for receiving the registrations can be called a bureau of vital statistics, registry of vital records and statistics, registrar, registry, register, registry office (officially register office ), or population registry. The primary purpose of civil registration is to create a legal document that can be used to establish and protect the rights of individuals. A secondary purpose is to create a data source for the compilation of vital statistics. In most countries, there is a legal requirement to notify the relevant authority of certain life events, such as births, marriages and death. The first country to establish a nationwide population register was Sweden in 1631, which was organized by the Church of Sweden on the demand of the Swedish king. - The Napoleonic Wars (1803-1815) were a series of major conflicts pitting the French Empire and its allies, led by Napoleon I, against a fluctuating array of European powers formed into various coalitions, primarily led and financed by the United Kingdom. The wars resulted from the unresolved disputes associated with the French Revolution and the Revolutionary Wars, which had raged on for years before concluding with the Treaty of Amiens in 1802. The resumption of hostilities the following year paved the way for more than a decade of constant warfare often categorized into five conflicts: the War of the Third Coalition (1805), the War of the Fourth Coalition (1806-7), the War of the Fifth Coalition (1809), the War of the Sixth Coalition (1813), and the War of the Seventh Coalition (1815). The Napoleonic Wars had profound consequences for global and European history, leading to the spread of nationalism and liberalism, the rise of the British Empire as the world's premier power, the independence movements in Latin America and the collapse of the Spanish Empire, the fundamental reorganization of German and Italian territories into larger states, and the establishment of radically new methods in warfare. - A republic (from ) is a sovereign state, country, or government which is organized with a form of government in which power resides in elected individuals representing the citizen body and government leaders exercise power according to the rule of law. In modern times, the definition of a republic commonly refers to a government which excludes a monarch. Currently, 147 of the world's 206 sovereign states use the word \\"republic\\" as part of their official names; not all of these are republics in the sense of having elected governments, nor do all nations with elected governments use the word \\"republic\\" in their names. - The Province of Posen was a province of Prussia from 1848 and as such part of the German Empire from 1871 until 1918. The area, roughly corresponding to the historic region of Greater Poland annexed during the 18th century Polish partitions, was about . For more than a century, it was part of the Prussian Partition, with a brief exception during the Napoleonic Wars. - Weimar Republic is an unofficial, historical designation for the German state between 1919 and 1933. The name derives from the city of Weimar, where its constitutional assembly first took place. The official name of the state was still \\"Deutsches Reich\\"; it had remained unchanged since 1871. In English the country was usually known simply as Germany. A national assembly was convened in Weimar, where a new constitution for the \\"Deutsches Reich\\" was written, and adopted on 11 August 1919. In its fourteen years, the Weimar Republic faced numerous problems, including hyperinflation, political extremism (with paramilitaries both left- and right-wing); and contentious relationships with the victors of the First World War. The people of Germany blamed the Weimar Republic rather than their wartime leaders for the country's defeat and for the humiliating terms of the Treaty of Versailles. However, the Weimar Republic government successfully reformed the currency, unified tax policies, and organized the railway system. Weimar Germany eliminated most of the requirements of the Treaty of Versailles; it never completely met its disarmament requirements, and eventually paid only a small portion of the war reparations (by twice restructuring its debt through the Dawes Plan and the Young Plan). Under the Locarno Treaties, Germany accepted the western borders of the republic, but continued to dispute the Eastern border. - A Standesamt (German, plural \\"Standesämter\\") is a German civil registration office, which is responsible for recording births, marriages, and deaths. - The Prussian Partition (sometimes called the Prussian Poland) refers to the former territories of the PolishLithuanian Commonwealth acquired during the partitions of Poland in the late 18th century by the Kingdom of Prussia. The Prussian acquisition amounted to 141,400 km (54,600 sq mi) of land constituting formerly western territory of the Commonwealth. The first partitioning led by imperial Russia with Prussian participation took place in 1772; the next one in 1793, and the final one in 1795, resulting in Poland's elimination for the next 123 years. - Standesamt Margonin was a civil registration district ( Standesamt ) located in Kreis Kolmar , province of Posen of the German Empire ( 1871 -- 1918 ) and administered the communities of : Bud = Budsin ; Kol = Kolmar ; Mar = Margonin ; Wil = Wilhelmstreu Margonin was on the north end of a finger lake , where a mill stream slowly emptied the lake into the Netze ( Polish : Notec ) River . The Margonin lake dominated the southern portion of the Standesamt 's area , blocking any east / west traffic . From Margonin , one could go north through Samotschin 's area and on to the river , where a bridge provided access to southern Kreis Wirsitz . West of Margonin , the road and railroad diverge on their way to the Kreis seat of Kolmar ( Chodziesen ; Polish : Chodzie ) . The railroad swung north to Samotschin before following the bluff overlooking the river plain farming villages . The road ran westward and then swung north to meet up with the railroad on the last few clicks on the bluff to Kolmar . In the other direction , the road and railroad ran east and a little south , towards Gollantsch and Kreis Exin , passing through the strip of Kreis Wongrowitz that pushes northward to claim its token piece of the Netze river bank . The only major road to the south , exited Margonin at the southeast , arched a little east on its way south to the town of Wongrowitz , seat of its Kreis . Woods could be found on the east of the lake , northeast past the Margoninsdorf estate and forestry school , and northwest , on the western side of the millstream . Several mills shared the stream in this area . Aside from the mills , very little industry existed , apart from the weavers and their looms in the early days , and some brewing , a privilege held by the small Jewish population . Margonin was a market town , and had churches for all three faiths . The Catholic parish church belonged to the deanery of Czarnikau , which was part of the Posen diocese . The town suffered destruction by the Swedes , by floods and cholera . Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'country' with 'poland'. Answer:","response":"The entity that has the relation 'country' with 'Poland' is the Kingdom of Prussia.

Culture Secretary Sajid Javid, increasingly tipped as a future party leader, said he was not concerned about Britain’s prospects outside the EU if people voted to leave in a referendum. ‘I think it would open up opportunities. I am not afraid of that at all,’ he told the Daily Mail in a wide-ranging interview. Culture Secretary Sajid Javid, increasingly tipped as a future party leader, said he was not concerned about Britain’s prospects outside the EU if people voted to leave in a referendum. He said it could 'open opportunities' The Tories’ pledge to give people their first say on Britain’s place in Europe for nearly 40 years – and a commitment to stop European human rights judges interfering in British law – will be centrepieces of the party’s pitch at next year’s general election. The Prime Minister will unveil plans to curtail the role of the controversial European Court of Human Rights in the UK at the final Conservative Party conference before the election, which starts this weekend in Birmingham. He is expected to pledge to scrap Labour’s Human Rights Act and replace it with a British Bill of Rights. Mr Cameron will promise a mechanism which will establish pre-eminence for Britain’s Parliament and Supreme Court, allowing them to over-ride Strasbourg rulings, according to sources. Mr Javid backed the Prime Minister’s plan to renegotiate looser ties with Brussels before holding a referendum by the end of 2017. ‘We have reason to be confident,’ he said. ‘Look at what we have already achieved – getting us out of the EU bailout fund, reducing the budget of the EU, vetoing a treaty.’ But the Culture Secretary went further than Mr Cameron on the possibility of an exit, insisting Britain could prosper outside the EU. ‘If you said to me: “Are you worried or frightened or concerned that the British people might vote to leave?”, that doesn’t frighten me,’ Mr Javid said. The Culture Secretary backed Prime Minister David Cameron’s plan to renegotiate looser ties with Brussels before holding a referendum by 2017. ‘We should have a referendum on in/out, and if the British people decide Britain is better off outside, I would respect that decision. I think it would open up opportunities. I am not afraid of that at all.’ The European Convention on Human Rights, which is enshrined in British law by the Human Rights Act, has become increasingly unpopular with most Conservatives. Critics say the Strasbourg court has roamed way beyond its remit and created new rights never intended by the founders of the convention – such as its recent attempt to insist Britain must overturn a blanket ban on prisoners voting in elections. The ECHR has also been cited by dozens of people fighting deportation, who have argued its provisions mean they are entitled to various rights to be considered, including the right to a family life. Mr Cameron is understood to be convinced that much anti-European sentiment is due to Strasbourg rulings preventing the removal of foreign-born criminals and terror suspects, though the convention and the court in fact have nothing to do with Brussels. Two of the Government’s biggest defenders of the court – former Attorney General Dominic Grieve and veteran Cabinet minister Kenneth Clarke – were sacked in the Prime Minister’s Cabinet reshuffle this summer. ‘This issue is now going to be dealt with,’ said one government source. Tory strategists also hope a harder line on human rights laws will help win over disaffected voters considering backing Ukip.","response":"A senior Tory minister, Culture Secretary Sajid Javid, believes that Britain should not be afraid of leaving the European Union.

Bring a notebook and pen to the speech, so you can make note of areas that need improvement. Writing down a shorthand account of what the speaker said will help you to organize the points when it’s time to deliver your critique. Being as detailed as possible in your notes will help the speaker understand exactly what to work on for next time. If there are no restrictions against it and you have time, record the speech using either a video camera or a tape recorder. This way, you will have the opportunity to play back the speech more than once to get an idea of what point the speaker was making, as well as how well they said it. Organize your notes so there’s a section on content and a section on delivery. Include examples to back up your evaluation of each. Deconstruct the speech by part, starting with the introduction and ending with the conclusion. Give an overall evaluation of whether you felt the main points of the speech were adequately presented and reinforced, and whether you felt the speech as a whole seemed convincing and credible. Would you consider it a successful speech, or does it need to be revised? Tell the speaker what elements of the speech were interesting, which parts were confusing, and which areas need more references to back them up. If there were certain jokes or anecdotes that didn’t work, let the speaker know. It’s better to be honest now than to let the person tell the same bad joke twice. Tell the speaker whether you felt the speech was appropriate for the intended audience. It is in this area that speakers often need the most feedback, since it’s difficult to evaluate your own body language and style. Give the speaker a gentle but honest critique of the effectiveness of his or her body language and delivery, including tone of voice, pacing, eye contact, and posture. It might be helpful to discuss the concept of emotional intelligence, or EQ, which refers to the ability to read an audience and keep people engaged by affecting their emotions. The point of making eye contact, speaking clearly and sounding natural is to make the audience feel as though you care about them and you want them to understand where you’re coming from. Helping them feel included will make them more likely to stay engaged. If the speaker seemed nervous, you might suggest that he or she practice techniques that help reduce stage fright, like exercising before the speech, laughing before the speech and practicing in front of a small group of people first. The speaker you’re critiquing likely put some time and effort into writing and practicing the speech. Any time you’re giving a critique, it’s just as important to point out what went right as it is to discuss what needs improvement. If you’re working with a student or someone who needs help improving their speech-giving skills, be encouraging and complimentary so they have the confidence to keep working on their skills. Try the feedback sandwich technique: give the person a compliment on an element of their speech, tell them what needs improvement, then give them another compliment. This classic way to deliver constructive criticism makes the medicine go down more easily. For example, you could tell the person he or she started with a brilliant hook, but you were confused about how the second point related to the thesis. However, the conclusion clarified the main point. As a way to encourage the person to keep learning and improving, you might suggest he or she watch videos of speeches given by famous speakers. Point out similarities and differences between the speech you’re critiquing and the famous speech. Summary:","response":"The article provides comprehensive guidance on how to effectively critique a speech, recommending recording the speech for detailed analysis, taking thorough notes on both content and delivery, and dissecting the speech into sections for precise feedback. It emphasizes honest feedback on each aspect, and the importance of informing the speaker about their strengths, parts of the speech that were confusing, and areas that need more substantiation. The article suggests informing the speaker if certain joking or storytelling parts were ineffective. After discussing the appropriateness of the speech for the target audience, it emphasizes providing constructive criticism on body language, delivery style, and emotional engagement with the audience. It advises discussing emotional intelligence and strategies to mitigate nervousness. The article suggests acknowledging the speaker's efforts and using a balanced feedback approach - particularly the \\"Feedback Sandwich\\" method, starting and ending with positive feedback with suggestions for improvement in the middle, to ensure the critique is encouraging.

Article: The world, in painter Chen Xiao's eyes, is as colorful and sweet as ice cream. At the opening of his latest exhibition, Colorful World in the Eyes of Sean Chen, at the National Museum of China recently, the artist told his story. Chen left China for Australia in 1986 to seek artistic freedom, and like many new immigrants then, he had little money in his pocket. To make ends meet, he drew portraits of people in the street. Every day, he saw people buy ice cream from a shop. Chen couldn't help wondering: \\"It must taste great, that's why so many people buy it.\\" But he didn't buy one for himself because he had to save money to support his studies. After four months of painting there and watching people eat ice cream, Chen didn't resist the temptation --- he bought an ice cream. \\"The first bite took me to heaven,\\" Chen recalls while laughing. \\"You know, as a poor young man in a new country, an ice cream was too expensive then.\\" Since then, he kept the taste of the ice cream in his heart and included the happy feelings in his paintings, which turn out to be colorful and sweet. His current exhibition is part of his nationwide tour that began at the National Art Museum of China in Beijing in 2011. He plans to take his artworks to 24 cities around China by 2016. The exhibition at the National Art Museum of China will last until April 22. After the exhibition tour, he will sell his works through an auction , and all the money will be donated to protection of the environment in China. \\"The natural environment of New Zealand has inspired my artwork and brought me enjoyment.

Air currents are slowly carrying the fallout south; the only areas still habitable are in the far reaches of the Southern Hemisphere. From Australia, survivors detect an incomprehensible Morse code signal coming from the West Coast of the United States. The last American nuclear submarine, USS Sawfish, under Royal Australian Navy command, is ordered to sail north to the United States to attempt to make contact with the sender of the Morse signal. The submarine is commanded by Captain Dwight Towers (Gregory Peck), who must leave his new friend, the alcoholic Moira Davidson (Ava Gardner). The Australian government arranges for its citizens to receive suicide pills or prepared injections so they may end things quickly before there is prolonged suffering from radiation sickness. An Australian naval officer, Peter Holmes (Anthony Perkins) and his wife, Mary, who is in denial about the impending disaster, have a baby daughter. Assigned to travel with the American sub for several weeks, Peter tries to explain to Mary how to euthanize their baby and then kill herself in case he is not yet home when the end comes; Mary reacts very emotionally at the prospect of killing her daughter and herself. One scientist's theory is that the radiation level near the Arctic Ocean could be lower than that found at the mid-Northern Hemisphere, which might indicate the radiation could disperse before reaching the Southern Hemisphere. The theory is to be explored along with the submarine's main mission. After sailing to Point Barrow, Alaska, they determine that radiation levels are, on the contrary, intensifying.

When a baptized member is accused of committing a serious sin—usually cases of sexual misconduct or charges of apostasy for disputing Jehovah's Witness doctrines—a judicial committee is formed to determine guilt, provide help and possibly administer discipline. Disfellowshipping, a form of shunning, is the strongest form of discipline, administered to an offender deemed unrepentant. Contact with disfellowshipped individuals is limited to direct family members living in the same home, and with congregation elders who may invite disfellowshipped persons to apply for reinstatement; formal business dealings may continue if contractually or financially obliged. Witnesses are taught that avoiding social and spiritual interaction with disfellowshipped individuals keeps the congregation free from immoral influence and that \\"losing precious fellowship with loved ones may help [the shunned individual] to come 'to his senses,' see the seriousness of his wrong, and take steps to return to Jehovah.\\" The practice of shunning may also serve to deter other members from dissident behavior. Members who disassociate (formally resign) are described in Watch Tower Society literature as wicked and are also shunned. Expelled individuals may eventually be reinstated to the congregation if deemed repentant by elders in the congregation in which the disfellowshipping was enforced. Reproof is a lesser form of discipline given formally by a judicial committee to a baptized Witness who is considered repentant of serious sin; the reproved person temporarily loses conspicuous privileges of service, but suffers no restriction of social or spiritual fellowship. Marking, a curtailing of social but not spiritual fellowship, is practiced if a baptized member persists in a course of action regarded as a violation of Bible principles but not a serious sin.[note 4]\\" Answer: Answer:","response":"The punishment called when a member loses service privileges but is not shunned is known as \\"Reproof.\\" This is a lesser form of discipline given formally by a judicial committee to a baptized Witness who is considered repentant of serious sin.

Thus, it isn't just limited to one \\"best\\" answer but rather a diverse spectrum of responses. Let's explore the given options in-depth: 1. Strange: This is an appropriate opposite of ordinary when considering something that deviates from what is commonly known or expected, leading it to be perceived as bizarre or unusual. Strange opposes ordinary by suggesting that the subject in question doesn't conform to the typical patterns or norms of a particular area or society. 2. Special: Special can be considered the opposite of ordinary when highlighting the unique or distinguished qualities that set something apart from others. It emphasizes that there is something extraordinary or noteworthy about the subject, often in a positive way. Contrastingly, ordinary implies that the subject lacks any distinguishing features, making it blend in with the rest. 3. Unbelievable: Unbelievable opposes ordinary by suggesting that the subject is so extraordinary that it is difficult to believe or comprehend. It signifies that the subject vastly surpasses the usual and expected standards to the point where it's almost inconceivable. Ordinary subjects, in this context, would be much easier to accept and understand. 4. Exceptional: This term denotes something that is remarkably different from the norm, either in terms of quality or character. Exceptional opposes ordinary by emphasizing that the subject is not only distinguishable but also surpasses the norm in a positive way. While exceptional situations or items excel in their respective domains, ordinary ones are considered average and unremarkable. 5. Weird: Weird is an appropriate opposite of ordinary when referring to something that is unconventional or peculiar. The term suggests that the subject is different from what is considered the norm but in a way that may evoke confusion, curiosity, or even discomfort. Unlike ordinary, which invokes a sense of familiarity and predictability, weird challenges one's expectations and perceptions, bringing forth the notion of the unusual or unexpected. In conclusion, the best answer depends on the particular nuance or meaning that you wish to convey when referring to something that opposes the concept of ordinary. Each of the provided terms—strange, special, unbelievable, exceptional, and weird—offers a unique perspective on the opposite of ordinary, allowing you to tailor your choice to the specific situation or context that you are addressing."},{"question":"Definition: You are given a statement written in Panjabi.

The state was able to survive through the Reform War with minimal damage due to the large number of liberal political figures. The 1858 conservative movement did not succeed in the state even after the successful military campaign of the conservative Zuloaga with 1,000 men occupied the cities of Chihuahua and Parral. In August 1859, Zuloaga and his forces were defeated by the liberal Orozco and his forces; Orozco soon after deposed the state governor, but had to flee to Durango two months later. In the late 1860s the conservative General Cajen briefly entered the state after his campaign through the state of Jalisco and helped establish conservative politicians and ran out the liberal leaders Jesús González Ortega and José María Patoni. Cajen took possession of the state capital and established himself as governor; he brooked no delay in uniting a large force to combat the liberal forces which he defeated in La Batalla del Gallo. Cajen attained several advantages over the liberals within the state, but soon lost his standing due to a strong resurgence of the liberal forces within the state. The successful liberal leaders José María Patoni of Durango and J.E. Muñoz of Chihuahua quickly strengthened their standing by limiting the political rights of the clergy implementing the presidential decree.

Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","response":"Although the premise and the hypothesis are similar in their request for information about events following a particular point in time, there are some notable differences between them. The premise is a statement that presents a scenario or situation without any specific context or details regarding the events or individuals involved. It essentially asks for a general account of what occurred afterwards by stating, \\"Tell me in your own words exactly what happened after that.\\" The hypothesis, on the other hand, is more specific as it refers to a conversation where a woman shares her account of the events that took place after a certain point. This can be concluded from the statement, \\"Tell me what she told you about the events after that.\\" Despite the similarity in requesting information about subsequent events, stating that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true cannot be definitively concluded. The primary reason behind this is the variance in the source of information for each case. The premise asks for a recount based on the AI assistant's own understanding, whereas the hypothesis revolves around a woman's perception and description of the events. The nature of events, their significance, and the accompanying details might not perfectly align with the AI assistant's account when compared to the woman's account. People's interpretations and perspectives of events can be subject to personal biases, emotional states, and incomplete information, which may impact the accuracy of their descriptions and the conclusions drawn from them. In conclusion, while there is a possibility that the hypothesis could be true if the premise is true, it is not guaranteed. Although both the premise and hypothesis concern the events that happened after a particular point, the sources of information, the potential for personal biases, and individual perspectives make it difficult to definitively claim that the truth of the premise automatically ensures the truth of the hypothesis."},{"question":"Process: - A stream or river must occur - Through erosion, the stream cuts into the soil and bedrock - Through continuous erosion, a deep gash is cut through - After many years the river may dry up - A dry ravine is left - suppose the mother does not get an abortion happens, how will it affect LESS or SMALLER ravines forming.

Input: What is the sentiment of the following document towards the entity Hillary Clinton ? The Justice Department is reviving investigations involving Hillary Clintonâs emails and the degree to which the State Department during Mrs. Clintonâs tenure as secretary was put in the service of the Clinton Foundation. Good. Indeed it is long overdue. It underscores a point weâve tried to make repeatedly here: You donât need a special counsel for this kind of thing; such investigations are what we have a Justice Department full of career prosecutors for. The perverse institution of the independent prosecutor should be shunned whenever possible â and its jurisdiction tightly confined in the rare necessary case. Obamaâs first point led to one of the great head-fakes in modern law-enforcement history â one that reverberates to this day. Using his bully pulpit the president framed the Clinton case as one of negligence. The portrayal stuck: Incessantly the Justice Department the media and eventually James Comey then-director of the FBI addressed the case in terms of Mrs. Clintonâs purported carelessness â a hardworking public officialâs regrettable but forgivable inattention to detail. Even now critics of Clinton and the FBI are in a lather over reports that as Comeyâs team drafted his remarks exonerating Clinton (notwithstanding that key witnesses including Clinton herself had not been interviewed) agent Peter Strzok changed the term âgrossly negligentâ to âextremely careless.â Substantively these terms are indistinguishable. The emendation is said to be critical though because the statute applicable to Clinton âs conduct criminalizes âgross negligence.â If Comey had said the words âgrossly negligent â so the story goes it would be the equivalent of pronouncing Clinton guilty. This was a straightforward case of criminal intent. Negligence was the fallback position â for a prosecutor an âeven ifâ theory as in: âEven if youâre not convinced by our overwhelming evidence of Clinton âs willfully illegal retention and transmission of classified information you can still comfortably find her guilty if you conclude that she was grossly negligent â which as the judge will tell you in his instructions simply means âextremely careless.ââ Mrs. Clintonâs criminal intent was so clear that its obfuscation also required Obamaâs second point: Mrs. Clintonâs lack of intent to imperil the United States. Director Comey hammered his bossâs legerdemain again and again. And why not? After all it was true â Clinton unquestionably had no desire to endanger our country. Itâs always good to go with the truth . . . especially if you have the luxury of a Democrat-smitten media that wonât ask whether the truth youâve highlighted is relevant to the matter under investigation. Second you may be saying to yourself: âBut âintent to harm the United Statesâ is significant so it should be part of a classified-information offense.â Thatâs right and thatâs why it is a part of a classified-information offense â it just happens not to be the offense weâre talking about in Mrs. Clinton âs case. If an official illegally transmits classified information âwith an intent or reason to believe that the information is to be used to the injury of the United States â then that official commits the more serious felony offense prescribed at the top of the Espionage Actâs scale â subsection (a). If someone had suggested charging Mrs. Clinton with this treasonous offense then she President Obama and Director Comey would have been quite right to stress that she had no such intent. But no one suggested that. Rather it was urged that she had transmitted classified information on purpose but not with intent to do the country harm. That is less heinous than the treasonous offense. But it is still egregious. It is a crime that puts the lives of intelligence sources and the effectiveness of life-saving intelligence operations at risk. That Clinton did not intend that any harm come to the United States does not make her innocent of willfully transmitting classified information to unauthorized persons or places. Moreover it is a black-letter principle that a personâs innocence of Crime A is inadmissible to prove that the person has not committed Crime B. For example the fact that I have not personally sold drugs has no bearing on whether I laundered drug money. And the fact that Mrs. Clinton did not intend that any harm come to the United States does not make her innocent of willfully transmitting classified information to unauthorized persons or places or of retaining it when she left the government and when the State Department finally requested that she surrender the government records in her possession. Regardless of whether my motive theory is sound however the evidence that Clinton willfully mishandled classified information is mountainous. Before she was ever secretary of state Clinton lived and worked in a White House where classified-information protocols were observed. She had to apply these protocols for years as a senator whose committee assignments were intelligence-intensive. Before becoming secretary of state she was indoctrinated in the handling of classified information and signed documentation attesting that she had read and understood the relevant executive orders about intelligence classification and handling. Clinton well understood that the position of secretary of state involved immersion in classified information. She wrote in her memoir about the extraordinary steps she was required to take to safeguard classified information. Given the nature of her responsibilities for foreign relations and national security her decision to conduct all her government business on a private server system made it inevitable that classified information would be transmitted in and stored on the private system. There is no possibility that she did not know this. The private system she set up was in violation of government and State Department regulations. Her loyal staff fought efforts to bring her into the government email system â even though she forced the resignation of an ambassador over among other things his conducting of government business over an unauthorized private email system. When the request was made that Clinton surrender her emails to the State Department she turned them over to her own lawyers and subordinates who did not have the security clearances required for access to the information. She destroyed tens of thousands of emails even though they were under subpoena so that they could not be reviewed by the State Department or the FBI. Of the 30 000 she deigned to surrender to the State Department over 2 000 contained classified information some of it among the nationâs most highly classified national-defense secrets. And she serially lied in her public statements about her emails in congressional testimony (in which she brazenly claimed to have turned over all work-related email to the State Department and that her lawyers had carefully reviewed every email before designating which should be surrendered and which withheld) and in her FBI interview (in which she pretended not to know what the ubiquitous â[C]â designation â for confidential â in classified documents meant). Any prosecutor who understood there was no need to prove intent to harm the United States would be delighted to take that case to the jury â especially once the prosecutor realized heâd get to tell the jury: âEven if you suspend disbelief and buy the defense argument that she didnât mean to horde and transmit classified information you must still find her guilty if you conclude she was grossly negligent â as in âextremely carelessâ.â Output:","response":"Negative"},{"question":"Sentiment possibilities Possible answers: (a). negative; (b). positive;.

Craig heard about something called acupuncture, which is when you use tiny, special needles and gently poke them into your skin. It may sound scary, but some people believe it can help them feel better. One day, Craig decided he wanted to try acupuncture. He thought that it could help with his sore muscles, like when a magical fairy helps to heal the injuries of a knight after a battle. But, his friend William thought this idea was very foolish. William was like the worried sidekick who doesn't believe in the magic gem's powers. Instead, William thought there were other ways to feel better, like visiting the wise healer in the village, which meant seeing a doctor, or doing some gentle exercises. Craig listened to William but still wanted to give acupuncture a try. He believed that it could be like a special healing spell that might work for him. So, Craig went to a professional acupuncturist to let them use their tiny magic wands (needles) to poke him very gently. While Craig was trying acupuncture, William went on his own journey to learn more about this strange treatment. He asked people in the kingdom and even read some scrolls (books) about how it worked. William started to understand that different people might need different forms of healing, just like how different animals need different types of food. After a few acupuncture sessions, Craig found that his sore muscles started to feel better. He was happy that he listened to his heart and tried this new method. Meanwhile, William learned that sometimes it's good to be open to new ideas, even if they might sound strange or magical at first. In the end, their friendship became even stronger, as they continued on many more exciting adventures together, while always trying to learn and help each other along the way. And so, Craig and William lived happily ever after, enjoying the magic of friendship and the wisdom of trying new things."},{"question":"RWE npower plc (trading as npower) is a UK-based electricity generator and supplier of gas and electricity to homes and businesses formerly known as Innogy plc.

Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal? Available choices: + Coat tiles with car wax.. + Coat tiles with candle wax..","response":"To accomplish the goal of easily cleaning grease off backsplash tiles behind a stove, the best available choice between the two provided options would be to coat the tiles with car wax. Here is a detailed reasoning and comparison for both options: Car Wax: 1. Composition: Car wax is a formula specifically designed to protect surfaces from dirt, grease, and other contaminants. It usually contains solvents, polymers, and natural and synthetic waxes that create a protective layer on the surface, making the surface hydrophobic and resistant to dirt. 2. Application: Car wax is easy to apply, typically using a microfiber cloth to spread it onto the surface evenly and allow it to dry. It also requires a simple buffing after drying, which can be quickly accomplished by wiping the surface with a clean cloth. 3. Benefits: Using car wax on the backsplash tiles will create a durable barrier against grease and grime, making it easier to clean off any stains resulting from cooking. The hydrophobic properties will prevent water-based substances from adhering to the surface and protect the tiles from potential damage. 4. Safety: Car wax is appropriate for household use, safe for use on various materials, and does not pose any significant health risks. Candle Wax: 1. Composition: Candle wax is made from a variety of materials, such as paraffin, stearin, beeswax, or soy, primarily designed for candle-making purposes and not suitable for protecting surfaces from dirt or grime without additional processing. 2. Application: Applying candle wax to a surface would require melting the wax, which can be hazardous if not done carefully. Moreover, it is difficult to spread it evenly on a vertical surface, such as backsplash tiles, without the risk of wax drips and an uneven coat. 3. Benefits: Although candle wax may offer temporary protection against grease and dirt, it lacks the durable and robust characteristics of car wax, making it less efficient for this purpose. It may also require frequent reapplication to maintain effectiveness. 4. Safety: Chemical additives found in some candle waxes, such as paraffin, may release harmful fumes when heated, posing potential health risks. Furthermore, the process of melting wax can be dangerous, leading to potential burns or fire hazards, especially in a kitchen environment. In conclusion, car wax emerges as the more reasonable option to protect backsplash tiles from grease and grime. It is specifically designed for protecting surfaces from dirt and contaminants, is easy and safe to apply, and provides a durable solution that would simplify the cleaning process. In comparison, candle wax is not suitable for this purpose due to its inadequate protective properties, complicated application process, and potential safety concerns."},{"question":"Answer the following question: If you turned on the TV towards the end of 2002 you could have been forgiven for thinking that Britain had gone absolutely horseshit mental. Every week, it seemed, another pretty young girl from a nice family, who was happy and popular and always did well at school, was being kidnapped or murdered by what the Sun newspaper cheerfully termed 'evil paedo scum'. Naming and shaming was as popular a feature in the Murdoch press as Page Three girls and discounted holidays to Butlin's. Of course you can't blame parents for wanting to keep their children safe; that's pretty much the job description of a parent. And, on the face of it, the tabloids were doing a public service in warning us about the paedophile menace lurking in our midst. The problem came when it turned out that a huge number of these concerned tabloid-reading parents were also absolute fucking morons. For every story of an actual sex offender being driven from their house by a baying mob there was one like that of Dr Yvette Cloete, a doctor at the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport, South Wales, who returned home from work to find that a group of 'concerned parents' had daubed the word 'paedo' on her front door in bright red paint. Dr Cloete was a consultant paediatrician. Easy mistake. If you're an absolute fucking moron. And so it was that one hung-over morning, after reading yet another story about vigilantes who had threatened to stone Maxine Carr, the girlfriend of Soham killer Ian Huntley, to death during her high-profile trial for perverting the course of justice, I decided to set up a website parodying this collective national madness.

Analyze the given information. 2. Compare it with the question. 3. Research if necessary. 4. Provide the final answer. Step 1: Analyze the given information The information provided tells us about the government of the Greek state of Sybaris offering a one-year patent for new refinements in luxury around 500 BCE. Step 2: Compare it with the question The question asks about the recognition of copyright in Jewish law. The provided information is not about Jewish law or copyright but rather a patent in the Greek state of Sybaris. Step 3: Research if necessary I will conduct quick research to determine when Jewish law recognized copyright. Based on my research, Jewish law does address concepts of intellectual property rights dating back to the Talmud, which discusses the idea of \\"hasagat ge'vul,\\" meaning \\"boundary encroachment.\\" This concept prevents unfair competition and defends intellectual property rights, though it does not directly align with the modern concept of copyright. The recognition of copyright in Jewish law, as we understand it today, comes later during the Jewish Enlightenment (Haskalah) period, particularly in the 18th and 19th centuries. Step 4: Provide the final answer The answer \\"In 500 BCE, the government of the Greek state of Sybaris offered one year's patent to all who should discover any new refinement in luxury\\" is not a good answer to the question \\"When did Jewish law recognize copyright?\\". Instead, you could answer that Jewish law recognized concepts related to intellectual property rights as early as in the Talmud with the \\"hasagat ge'vul\\" concept, while the understanding of copyright in Jewish law as we know it today developed during the Jewish Enlightenment period in the 18th and 19th centuries."},{"question":"Question: Information: - Louis XIV (5 September 16381 September 1715), known as Louis the Great (') or the Sun King ('), was a monarch of the House of Bourbon who ruled as King of France from 1643 until his death in 1715.

The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - The City of London is a city and county within London. It constituted most of London from its settlement by the Romans in the 1st century AD to the Middle Ages, but the agglomeration has since grown far beyond the City's borders. The City is now only a tiny part of the metropolis of London, though it remains a notable part of central London. Administratively, it forms one of the 33 local authority districts of Greater London; however, the City of London is not a London borough, a status reserved for the other 32 districts (including London's only other city, the City of Westminster). - Great Britain, also known as Britain , is a large island in the north Atlantic Ocean off the northwest coast of continental Europe. With an area of , Great Britain is the largest European island and the ninth-largest in the world. In 2011 the island had a population of about 61 million people, making it the world's third-most populous island after Java in Indonesia and Honshu in Japan. The island of Ireland is situated to the west of it, and together these islands, along with over 1,000 smaller surrounding islands, comprise the British Isles archipelago. - Prince of Orange is a title originally associated with the sovereign Principality of Orange, in what is now southern France. Under the Treaty of Utrecht of 1713, Frederick William I of Prussia ceded the Principality of Orange to King Louis XIV of France (while retaining the title as part of his dynastic titulature). After William III of England died without children, a dispute arose between Johan Willem Friso and Frederick I of Prussia, which was settled in the Treaty of Partition (1732); consequently, Friso's son, William IV had to share use of the title \\"Prince of Orange\\" (which had accumulated prestige in the Netherlands and throughout the Protestant world) with Frederick William I of Prussia. The title is traditionally borne by the heir apparent of the Dutch monarch. The title descends via absolute primogeniture since 1983, meaning that its holder can be either Prince or Princess of Orange. - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight. - The Treaty of Utrecht, which established the Peace of Utrecht, is a series of individual peace treaties, rather than a single document, signed by the belligerents in the War of the Spanish Succession, in the Dutch city of Utrecht in March and April 1713. The treaties between several European states, including Spain, Great Britain, France, Portugal, Savoy and the Dutch Republic, helped end the war. - Prussia was a historic state originating out of the Duchy of Prussia and the Margraviate of Brandenburg, and centred on the region of Prussia. For centuries, the House of ruled Prussia, successfully expanding its size by way of an unusually well-organised and effective army. Prussia, with its capital in and from 1701 in Berlin, shaped the history of Germany. In 1871, German states united to create the German Empire under Prussian leadership. In November 1918, the monarchies were abolished and the nobility lost its political power during the German Revolution of 191819. The Kingdom of Prussia was thus abolished in favour of a republicthe Free State of Prussia, a state of Germany from 1918 until 1933. From 1933, Prussia lost its independence as a result of the Prussian coup, when the Nazi regime was successfully establishing its ' laws in pursuit of a unitary state. With the end of the Nazi regime, the division of Germany into allied-occupation zones and the separation of its territories east of the line, which were incorporated into Poland and the Soviet Union, the State of Prussia ceased to exist de facto in 1945. Prussia existed \\"\\" until its formal liquidation by the Allied Control Council Enactment No. 46 of 25 February 1947. - Frederick William I (14 August 1688 31 May 1740), known as the 'Soldier King,' was the King in Prussia and Elector of Brandenburg from 1713 until his death, as well as the father of Frederick the Great. He was in personal union the sovereign prince of the Principality of Neuchâtel. - The London Assembly is an elected body, part of the Greater London Authority, that scrutinises the activities of the Mayor of London and has the power, with a two-thirds majority, to amend the Mayor's annual budget and to reject the Mayor's draft statutory strategies. The assembly was established in 2000 and meets at City Hall on the South Bank of the River Thames, close to Tower Bridge. The assembly is also able to investigate other issues of importance to Londoners (transport, environmental matters, etc.), publish its findings and recommendations, and make proposals to the Mayor. - Francesco Guerini ( fl . 1740 -- 1770 ) was a Neapolitan violinist and composer whose works were published throughout Europe in the mid 18th century . While his birthdate is unknown , Guerini worked in The Hague for the Prince of Orange from 1740 until 1760 , at which time he moved to London , where he was active until 1770 . Most of Guerini 's published compositions were sonatas for one or two violins and continuo , but he also wrote keyboard works as well as Six Sonates / A deux Flûtes , ou deux Violons ... Ouevre III ( with no continuo ) , Paris , ca . 1750 , or Six Solos for a Violoncello with a Thorough Bass for the Harpsichord , Opus 9 , first published in London in 1765 . - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union.

It was established in the Anglo-Saxon system from the territory of the Middle Saxons, and existed as an official unit until 1965. The historic county included land stretching north of the River Thames from east to west of the City of London with the rivers Colne and Lea and a ridge of hills as the other boundaries. The largely low-lying county, dominated by clay in its north and alluvium on gravel in its south, was the second smallest by area in 1831. - The Mayor of London is an elected politician who, along with the London Assembly of 25 members, is accountable for the strategic government of Greater London. The current mayor is Sadiq Khan, who took up office on 9 May 2016. The position had been held by Ken Livingstone from the creation of the role on 4 May 2000 until he was defeated in 2008 by Boris Johnson, who served two terms before being succeeded by Khan. - William III (4 November 1650 8 March 1702; also widely known as William of Orange) was sovereign Prince of Orange from birth, Stadtholder of Holland, Zeeland, Utrecht, Gelderland, and Overijssel in the Dutch Republic from 1672, and King of England, Ireland, and Scotland from 1689 until his death. It is a coincidence that his regnal number (III) was the same for both Orange and England. As King of Scotland, he is known as William II. He is informally known by sections of the population in Northern Ireland and Scotland as \\"King Billy\\". - Surrey is a county in the south east of England and also one of the home counties bordering Greater London. Surrey shares borders with Kent to the east, East Sussex to the south-east, West Sussex to the south, Hampshire to the west and south-west and Berkshire to the north-west. The county town is Guildford. Surrey County Council sits extraterritorially at Kingston upon Thames, administered as part of Greater London since 1965. With a resident population of 1.1 million, Surrey is the most densely populated and third most populated county in the South East region, after Kent and Hampshire. - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency. - Frederick I (11 July 1657 25 February 1713), of the Hohenzollern dynasty, was (as Frederick III) Elector of Brandenburg (16881713) and Duke of Prussia in personal union (Brandenburg-Prussia). The latter function he upgraded to royalty, becoming the first King in Prussia (17011713). From 1707 he was in personal union the sovereign prince of the Principality of Neuchâtel. He was also the paternal grandfather of Frederick the Great. - The Principality of Orange (in French \\"la Principauté d'Orange\\") was, from 1163 to 1713, a feudal state in Provence, in the south of modern-day France, on the left bank of the river Rhone north of the city of Avignon. - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories.

Here's why: The premise clearly specifies that \\"You can drive right up to some; others require a walk.\\" This statement implies that there are certain things (the nature of these things is not specified in the premise, but let’s call them ‘points’ for the sake of discussion) that one can reach directly using some form of vehicular transportation, i.e., drive up to them. However, it also explicitly says that there are other points that \\"require a walk.\\" The phrase \\"require a walk\\" suggests that there is a necessity for certain points to be reached on foot, thereby eliminating vehicular transportation as an option for those points. This necessity could be due to various factors like the nature of the terrain, environmental protection rules, accessibility issues, etc. Therefore, it could be judged that the premise consists of two distinct groups of points according to their accessibility: 1. Points that can be reached by driving 2. Points that necessitate walking So, when the hypothesis suggests that \\"You can drive to all of them,\\" it contradicts the information provided in the premise, as the premise clearly states not all points allow or can be reached by driving. Thus, this generalization is not valid based upon the given premise. To align with the premise, the hypothesis could be modified to a conditional statement such as, \\"You can drive to some of them, and will have to walk to reach others.\\" This would reflect the description and conditions given in the initial premise."},{"question":"Roman histories and biographies anticipated the extensive mediaeval literature of lives of saints and miraculous chronicles, but the most characteristic form of the Middle Ages was the romance, an adventurous and sometimes magical narrative with strong popular appeal. Controversial, religious, political and instructional literature proliferated during the Renaissance as a result of the invention of printing, while the mediaeval romance developed into a more character-based and psychological form of narrative, the novel, of which early and important examples are the Chinese Monkey and the German Faust books.

Step 1: Research the time period and literature of the Bronze Age. - The Bronze Age was a historical period characterized by the use of bronze, the early development of urban civilization, and often marked by advancements in areas such as writing, architecture, and art. This period occurred between approximately 3300 and 1200 BCE. - The ancient civilizations known for their Bronze Age accomplishments include the Sumerians, the Ancient Egyptians, the Minoans, the Mycenaeans, and the Hittites among others. Step 2: Identify prominent literary forms and genres of the Bronze Age. - The earliest forms of writing appeared during the Bronze Age. This included the development of cuneiform by the Sumerians and hieroglyphics by the Egyptians. - Literature in the Bronze Age was primarily focused on religious texts, laws, accounts, and poetry. - Some examples of Bronze Age literature include the Egyptian Book of the Dead, the Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh, the Instructions of Shuruppak, and the Hittite Code of the Nesilim. Based on the available information, it is difficult to pinpoint a specific genre as the most characteristic form of the Bronze Age, as the various genres and texts produced during this time were primarily religious or legal in nature, and storytelling or narrative genres, like romance or novel, were not as developed or prominent during this time period."},{"question":"Generate a sentence about this data: Al Anderson (NRBQ band), associatedBand/associatedMusicalArtist, NRBQ; Al Anderson (NRBQ band), associatedBand/associatedMusicalArtist, The Wildweeds; Al Anderson (NRBQ band), genre, Rock music; Al Anderson (NRBQ band), birthDate, 1947-03-13","response":"Al Anderson, born on March 13, 1947, is a talented rock musician known for his extensive career in the music industry where he took part in a variety of bands, most notably NRBQ (New Rhythm and Blues Quartet) and The Wildweeds, showcasing his immense talent and contribution to the ever-evolving genre of rock music."},{"question":"Viewing Klecak's detention as a \\"notorious abuse of police for political purposes\\", political analyst Jelena Lovric told the AP it demonstrated the government \\"cannot influence [the] internet, and that deeply frightens it\\".

Two neighboring farms both had depleted soils due to intensive agricultural practices for decades. Apple far decided to start an agroforestry system and other methods to protect their depleted soils, while Pear farm did nothing and had big losses the following years. Hint: Depleted soils can be protected from soil erosion by groundcover plants such as naturally growing grasses in agroforestry systems. These help to stabilise the soil as they increase cover compared to short-cycle cropping systems. Soil cover is a crucial factor in preventing erosion. Cleaner water through reduced nutrient and soil surface runoff can be a further advantage of agroforestry. The runoff can be reduced by decreasing its velocity and increasing infiltration into the soil. Compared to row-cropped fields nutrient uptake can be higher and reduce nutrient loss into streams.Further advantages concerning plant growth:","response":"Pear farm used fewer cover crops."},{"question":"The Bush administration then turned its attention to Iraq, and argued the need to remove Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq had become urgent. Among the stated reasons were that Saddam's regime had tried to acquire nuclear material and had not properly accounted for biological and chemical material it was known to have previously possessed, and believed to still maintain. Both the possession of these weapons of mass destruction (WMD), and the failure to account for them, would violate the U.N. sanctions. The assertion about WMD was hotly advanced by the Bush administration from the beginning, but other major powers including China, France, Germany, and Russia remained unconvinced that Iraq was a threat and refused to allow passage of a UN Security Council resolution to authorize the use of force. Iraq permitted UN weapon inspectors in November 2002, who were continuing their work to assess the WMD claim when the Bush administration decided to proceed with war without UN authorization and told the inspectors to leave the country. The United States invaded Iraq on March 20, 2003, along with a \\"coalition of the willing\\" that consisted of additional troops from the United Kingdom, and to a lesser extent, from Australia and Poland. Within about three weeks, the invasion caused the collapse of both the Iraqi government and its armed forces, however, the U.S. and allied forces failed to find any weapon of mass destruction in Iraq.

A:","response":"The genre that AllMusic defines as the \\"most abrasive and aggressive fusion of rock and electronic music\\" is known as Industrial Metal. Industrial Metal is a diverse and innovative musical style that combines the hard-hitting and powerful elements of heavy metal with the futuristic and experimental sounds of industrial music. The roots of Industrial Metal can be traced back to the late 1970s and early 1980s when rock bands and electronic artists began experimenting with new ways to combine their sounds. With the advent of digital sampling technology, musicians and producers were able to integrate synthesized sounds, digital effects, and distorted recordings into their compositions. This resulted in dense, abrasive, and aggressive soundscapes that pushed the boundaries of contemporary music. As a genre, Industrial Metal typically features aggressive guitar riffs, powerful drumming, and commanding vocals. These elements are often enhanced with electronic elements such as synthesizers, drum machines, and looping equipment. Lyrically, Industrial Metal often explores themes of dystopia, oppression, societal decay, and individual freedom, reflecting the heavy and brutal nature of its sound. The Axis of Perdition, a UK-based experimental extreme metal band, has released four studio albums throughout their career. Their fourth and final studio album, \\"Tenements (Of The Anointed Flesh),\\" released in 2011, prominently features the Industrial Metal genre. This album showcases the band's penchant for combining the aggressive and dark aspects of black metal, death metal, and grindcore, with the ambient and experimental qualities often found in industrial music. The end result is a sonic journey that explores the depths of darkness, despair, and sonic chaos - a fitting representation of the abrasive and aggressive nature of Industrial Metal. The inclusion of Industrial Metal on the Axis of Perdition's final studio album further solidifies the importance of this genre within the world of extreme music. With its innovative fusion of rock and electronic music, Industrial Metal has left a significant impact on various subgenres and continues to challenge the limits of musical expression."},{"question":"In this task, you are given a tuple, comprising Head and Tail, separated with <sep>.

It's always satisfying to see the results of your own hard work. Person A: That's a great point, too. By doing the gardening herself, she not only saves money but also gets to be more in touch with her plants and her outdoor space, which might be really important to her. Person B: Yeah, and besides saving money, it could also be a sort of therapeutic experience for her. Gardening can be quite relaxing, and it's a great way to spend quality time outdoors. Person A: That's true. So I guess the reasons Cathy does most of the gardening herself are not only to save money but also to have a sense of accomplishment, to be connected with her plants, and to enjoy the therapeutic aspects of the activity. Person B: You've summed it up perfectly. It's nice to see that Cathy is able to find such joy and purpose from something as simple as gardening."},{"question":"Question: Cameron told Jan that she could go to the mall with her if she wanted to. Given the context: How would Cameron feel afterwards? Possible answers: sober, horrible, curious Answer:","response":"In the given context, it seems that Cameron is extending a friendly invitation to Jan to join her at the mall. From this information, we can infer that Cameron would most likely feel curious after presenting the invitation to Jan. The reason behind this assumption is that, after offering the invitation, Cameron would wonder whether Jan would accept it or decline. She might be interested in spending time with Jan, and could be looking forward to having enjoyable conversations or doing some fun activities together at the mall. This curiosity about Jan's decision and how their time at the mall might unfold would be a natural emotional response to the situation. We can eliminate the other two emotions - \\"sober\\" and \\"horrible\\" - as they do not seem to fit the given context. A sober feeling would usually be exhibited after a period of excessive emotions or excitement, and it seems that Cameron is simply making an offer to Jan in a friendly manner, with no indication of any excessive emotional behavior. Similarly, a horrible feeling typically results from a distressing or terrible event, or after causing harm or pain to someone else. In this context, Cameron is merely inviting Jan to go to the mall, which is a casual and friendly gesture. There is no indication that Cameron would feel horrible, as she is not causing any distress or harm to Jan by offering the invitation. In conclusion, given the context, it is most probable that Cameron would feel curious after telling Jan that she could go to the mall with her if she wanted to. This feeling stems from the natural curiosity to know Jan's decision and anticipate the potential social interaction and bonding that may occur at the mall."},{"question":"Answer the following question: What type of details about czesław hoc can be gathered from the following bio?

By Joanna Crawley and Jennifer Ruby PUBLISHED: 05:29 EST, 31 July 2013 | UPDATED: 09:24 EST, 15 August 2013 Their exclusive interview with GQ magazine is their most revealing to date, but One Direction's devoted fans aren't too happy with how their idols have been portrayed. Harry Styles, Zayn Malik, Louis Tomlinson, Liam Payne and Niall Horan were unveiled as the latest cover stars for the publication this week, with topics discussed in the accompanying interview including bisexual rumours, groupies and their tangled love lives. And since the publication of the interview, the magazine has experienced a major backlash from dedicated Directioners, who bombarded the GQ Twitter account with a string of often foul-mouthed and abusive messages. Hard worker:","response":"One Direction's Harry Styles opened up in the interview about his dedication to the band and how their hectic work schedule keeps them focused. However, the pop sensations' brutally honest confessions did not sit well with their loyal fans, known as the Directioners, who took to social media to express their outrage and disappointment. \\"These guys are our life savers and GQ is making them look like some desperate men who just want to party,\\" tweeted one fan. Another added, \\"They worked hard to become the band they are today and this magazine is just ruining their image.\\" Despite the negativity surrounding the publication, the interview allowed the members of One Direction to demonstrate their true commitment to the band and their connection with their fans. They acknowledged the impact they have on their supporters and how important it is to remain grounded and true to themselves. Harry Styles shared, \\"We know how much our fans invest in us and we try to give back by putting everything we have into our music and performances. We just want to keep making music that they can connect to and feel proud of supporting.\\" The members also addressed the rumors and misconceptions that circulate around them in the media. Louis Tomlinson explained, \\"People always try to look for drama in our lives, but we're a group of lads who love what we do and are fortunate to have the opportunity to create something together. Our friendship and our music is what keeps us grounded.\\" Despite the initial backlash, the controversy surrounding the GQ interview ultimately brought even more attention to One Direction's dedication and love for their fans.

As the controversy settled, the Directioners began to rally around the band in support of their transparency and vulnerability in the interview.

In the end, One Direction's legacy in both music and pop culture was only strengthened as the group managed to rise above the criticism, remaining true to themselves and their fans, and solidifying their status as a band that goes beyond just making music but also forging bonds with the very people who support them."},{"question":"Is \\"A rescue team from the Red Cross in Taiwan was also scheduled to depart Taipei on a Mandarin Airlines direct chartered flight to Chengdu at 15:00 CST on May 16.\\" a good answer to the question \\"How did the move the relief supplies from Taiwan to the stricken area?\\"","response":"To determine if the sentence provided is a good answer to the question \\"How did they move the relief supplies from Taiwan to the stricken area?\\" let's break down the relevant information in the sentence and check if it answers the question. 1.

Growing a cover crop extends the time for AM growth into the autumn, winter, and spring. Promotion of hyphal growth creates a more extensive hyphal network. The mycorrhizal colonization increase found in cover crops systems may be largely attributed to an increase in the extraradical hyphal network that can colonize the roots of the new crop (Boswell et al. 1998). The extraradical mycelia are able to survive the winter, providing rapid spring colonization and early season symbiosis (McGonigle and Miller 1999). This early symbiosis allows plants to tap into the well-established hyphal network and be supplied with adequate phosphorus nutrition during early growth, which greatly improves the crop yield. I am facing a new situation today: Bubba and Dean are two farmers which realized the benefits of having AM fungi in their soil. Dean, however, took active steps in helping the growth of AM fungi so he grew cover crops on his lands.

This is because Dean took active steps to promote the growth of AM fungi by growing cover crops on his lands, which helps create a more extensive hyphal network. In contrast, Bubba did not take any specific measures to enhance the growth of AM fungi and thus did not contribute to the increase of the extraradical hyphal network in his soil."},{"question":"Given a text passage as input comprising of dialogue of negotiations between a seller and a buyer about the sale of an item, your task is to classify the item being sold into exactly one of these categories: 'housing', 'furniture', 'bike', 'phone', 'car', 'electronics'.

If economic and environmental changes in a community affect access to food, food security, and dietary health, then this interplay between culture and biology is in turn connected to broader historical and economic trends associated with globalization.

She gets offered the best roles and wins all the awards she is nominated for. In addition, she also has a passionate affair with a handsome director named Aditya (Emraan Hashmi). This all ends when a younger actress, Sanjana (Esha Gupta) makes her film debut. In place of Shanaya, Sanjana comes into spotlight and begins to snatch away her awards. Suddenly, Shanaya seems forgotten and everybody only wants to work with Sanjana. Soon enough, Shanaya sees her career fading away and her envy slowly becomes craziness. She begins to turn to black magic and makes it her goal in life to destroy Sanjana's career and make her the pain of loss. She seeks help of her uncle sonu (Sunil Dhariwal), a tantrik who helps her to practice black magic and calls upon an evil entity, Tara Dutt (Manish Chowdhary). She asks him to make Sanjana's life a living hell. Tara agrees to help haunt and torture Sanjana until she becomes suicidal. He asks Shanaya to give her a black poison through a person she trusts.

Somehow, to try to end Aditya and Sanjana's love triangle, Shanaya hatches a plan by befriending Sanjana in order to poison her which Aditya gets suspicious about. At a movie premiere, Shanaya reveals that she actually hid the poison in the chocolate basket she gave to Sanjana earlier.

Aditya protects Sanjana from the defeated Shanaya who vows that she will remain a star and commits suicide by pouring acid on... Answer:","response":"In the movie \\"Raaz 3D,\\" Tara is an evil entity summoned by Shanaya, who is seeking help to destroy her rival, Sanjana. To accomplish this, Tara asks Sanjana for her trust and obedience in order to torment and make Sanjana's life miserable. The story unfolds as Shanaya becomes envious of Sanjana's success in the film industry, which leads her down a dark path of practicing black magic with the help of her uncle Sonu and establishing a connection with Tara Dutt. By leveraging black magic and the sinister power Tara possesses, Shanaya aims to make Sanjana's life a living hell, ultimately driving her to the brink of suicide. Tara's role in the story is to assist Shanaya in her mission to bring down Sanjana, mainly by haunting and torturing her emotionally and mentally. They devise a plan to introduce a black poison into Sanjana's life through a trusted individual, which turns out to be the handsome director, Aditya, who has become romantically involved with both actresses. As the story progresses, Aditya's guilt over his role in Shanaya's plan becomes unbearable, leading him to reject her and stand by Sanjana instead. This forces Shanaya to come up with new schemes on her own, including attempting to poison Sanjana and revealing that she hid the poison in a chocolate basket she had given to her as a gift. While trying to escape the swarm of moths Shanaya unleashed on her, Sanjana is forced to run nude in public, which leads Aditya to take her to the hospital where he learns about Shanaya's involvement. Throughout the movie, Tara continues to play an essential role in Shanaya's plot to bring about Sanjana's downfall. However, as the power of love between Aditya and Sanjana starts to triumph over black magic and evil forces, Tara's influence on the outcome becomes less effective. Ultimately, Shanaya fails in her attempts to remain a star and resort to committing suicide. In conclusion, Tara asks Sanjana for her trust and submission in order to carry out Shanaya's dark plan to destroy her life and career. Tara serves as the evil force and accomplice to Shanaya throughout the movie as they work together to dismantle the new rising star, Sanjana. However, their efforts are thwarted by the power of love between Aditya and Sanjana, which proves stronger than the manipulative influence of black magic and evil."},{"question":"ahhhh maybe... just maybe i'll win What is the sentiment of this tweet?","response":"The sentiment of this tweet seems to be hopeful and positive.

Daily Mail Reporter. PUBLISHED:. 21:02 EST, 24 February 2013. |. UPDATED:. 05:27 EST, 25 February 2013. Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman, whose fortune is estimated at more than 1 billion, has been on the run since 2001 when he escaped from a Mexican prison in a laundry truck. Officials now say there is no evidence the world's most powerful drug baron Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman was killed in a February 21 shootout in the Guatemalan jungle. Earlier reports claimed 'El Chapo' died in a hail of bullets February 21 in a jungle shootout with a rival gang near the Mexican border. Last week, villagers in the Peten province near the border with Mexico, claimed they spotted a blood-soaked body that resembled the fugitive Sinaloa cartel leader slumped in a car after after a clash between two heavily-armed drugs gangs. Guatemalan Interior Minister Mauricio Lopez Bonilla now calls the reports a misunderstanding. After police and soldiers assessed the area of the shootout, no evidence the kingpin was even there was found. He called the confusion a result of mistaken eyewitness accounts and apologized for the earlier reports. 'I apologize if where was a misunderstanding. It was a mix-up,' Bonilla told Guatemalan radio station Emisores Unidos. 'We were referring to information generated from the area that there was possibly a crime scene with a dead person resembling El Chapo.' 'As of now, we have no verification,' he said. Misunderstanding? Villagers in the Peten province of Guatemala near the border with Mexico claimed they found a body resembling El Chapo but officials have now called it all a 'misunderstanding' Public Enemy Number One: Chicago's crime commission this month officially recognized him as the city's Public Enemy Number One, a year after the US Treasury Department named the kingpin as the 'world's most influential drugs trafficker' before. He is the top dog in Mexico's bloody drug war, presiding over a 1 billion drug empire and accused of firing the first shot in a bloody cartel war that has so far killed 38,000 people. And in 2011, aside from a personal fortune to rival Bill Gates and Warren. Buffet, Joaquin Guzman Loera was officially named as the. world's most wanted man. Guzman has been the subject of a vast manhunt for the last ten years after he escaped from a Mexican high security prison in a complex break out that reportedly cost him £2.5million. Since then the drug lord known as 'El Chapo' - meaning 'Shorty' - because of his 5ft 2in height has eluded capture, protected by his vast Sinaloa drug cartel and no doubt a legion of corrupt officials paid from his vast wealth. He has attained almost mythical status in Mexico vast drugs operation that runs shipments of tons at a time from Columbia into Mexico and on to the United States. He is accused of starting Mexico's cartel wars when his hitmen. assassinated the leader of the Juarez cartel and his wife in 2004 in a. bid to take control of the city of Cidudad Juarez, breaking the pact of. non-aggression that had previously existed. As tit for tat. fighting escalated, government troops were sent into drug strongholds in. 2006 marking the start of a conflict that has so far claimed. 38,000 lives. Now. El Chapo is said to have infiltrated the highest level of Mexico's. government as President Felipe Calderon fights to keep control of his. country amid claims that such drug lords are. really the ones in charge. Government spokesman Francisco Cuevas. first told Guatevision Television that two drug gangs had clashed in. Peten, an area that has seen an increase in drug violence and that at. least two men had died in the shootout. Later, Cuevas told Mexico's Televisa. network that authorities hadn't yet found a body or the scene where. reports said a shootout took place. He never said what led officials to think that one of the dead men might be Guzman. But Interior Department spokeswoman. Carla Herrera told The Associated Press that one of the victims. physically resembled the drug lord. She said officials had asked the. Mexican government to send Guzman's fingerprints to compare them to the. man found inside a vehicle and to send investigators. Even then, Bonilla told the AP that it was residents of the town of San Francisco who had told officials of a gun battle and reported that one of the people killed looked like Guzman. Peten province is an isolated area of jungle and ranches where 27 ranch workers were massacred in 2011 by the Zetas drug gang, a top rival for Guzman's Sinaloa drug cartel. Guzman, who has been in hiding since escaping from a Mexican prison in a laundry cart in 2001, is one of the world's most dangerous and most wanted fugitives. El Chapo's, fortune is estimated at more than 1 billion, and he's been on the run since 2001 when he escaped from a Mexican. prison in a laundry truck. There has been a 7million bounty on his head ever since. Last year, the US Treasury Department. named the kingpin as the 'world's most influential drugs trafficker' before. Chicago's crime commission this month officially recognized him as the city's. Public Enemy Number One - the first time the infamous soubriquet has. been rolled out since Al Capone in the 1920s. Authorities say his Sinaloa cartel. has recently been expanding his drug business abroad, building. international operations in Central and South America and the Pacific. And earlier this month, Guzman formally received the title of Chicago's Public Enemy No. in both the Chicago Crime Commission and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration's first use since Prohibition. The. Public Enemy No. 1 label was created for mobster Al Capone. But the DEA. said Sinaloa cartel leader Guzman is more menacing than the Chicago. gangster was.

Minnesota is known for a politically active citizenry, and populism has been a long-standing force among the state's political parties. Minnesota has a consistently high voter turnout. In the 2008 U.S. presidential election, 78.2% of eligible Minnesotans voted—the highest percentage of any U.S. state—versus the national average of 61.2%. Voters can register on election day at their polling places with evidence of residency.Hubert Humphrey brought national attention to the state with his address at the 1948 Democratic National Convention. Minnesotans have consistently cast their Electoral College votes for Democratic presidential candidates since 1976, longer than any other state. Minnesota is the only state in the nation that did not vote for Ronald Reagan in either of his presidential runs. Minnesota has gone for the Democratic Party in every presidential election since 1960, with the exception of 1972, when it was carried by Republican Richard Nixon. Both the Democratic and Republican parties have major-party status in Minnesota, but its state-level \\"Democratic\\" party is actually a separate party, officially known as the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (DFL). It was formed out of a 1944 alliance of the Minnesota Democratic and Farmer-Labor parties. The state has had active third-party movements. The Reform Party, now the Independence Party, was able to elect former mayor of Brooklyn Park and professional wrestler Jesse Ventura to the governorship in 1998. The Independence Party has received enough support to keep major-party status. The Green Party, while no longer having major-party status, has a large presence in municipal government, notably in Minneapolis and Duluth, where it competes directly with the DFL party for local offices.

The young man used the motorcycle to get to work instead of the bicycle because the","response":"day was exceptionally hot and humid, and he didn't want to arrive at work drenched in sweat. As his motorcycle rumbled to life, he decided to take a longer, more scenic route that would weave through the outskirts of the city and offer him the cool breeze that would make the unbearable heat more tolerable. He knew it would add to his commute time, but he didn't mind. After all, he had always been one to appreciate the beauty of nature and the environment around him. The sun had just begun to rise, casting a golden hue on the sky and illuminating the tiny specks of dew that clung to the leaves. The young man rode his motorcycle across the empty roads, the warm air buffeting against his body as he carved through the city’s early morning stillness. He enjoyed the feeling of freedom the motorcycle gave him, something he found to be lacking in the confined spaces of public transit or in the slow crawl of a bicycle journey. His route took him past a serene lake, its waters reflecting the sky like a mirror. The sight was so enchanting he couldn’t help but pull over to admire it, and as he sat on the edge of the shore, he noticed small ripples in the water as if invisible creatures were dancing beneath the surface. Some distance away, a group of ducks floated gracefully, their synchronized movements a charming spectacle. The young man made a mental note to pack a sketchpad and some pencils the next time he stopped here, wanting to capture the scene that had mesmerized him so. He spent a few minutes basking in the peaceful atmosphere, allowing the subtle sounds around him to wash over his senses – the distant hum of a car, the gentle rustling of leaves, the melodious chirping of birds. Finally, feeling rejuvenated, he continued his ride through the winding roads, noticing the subtle changes in the flora and fauna as he went. Wildflowers lined the edge of the roads, their vibrant colors sprinkling the landscape with subtle beauty. He marveled at the way the morning light, now stronger, filtered through the trees and dappled the earth with a kaleidoscope of hues. He sighed with contentment, knowing that despite the extra time this route had added to his journey, it had also filled him with a resplendent joy that made the daily grind of work more bearable. The young man zipped past farmhouses, their grazing cows lazily eyeing the stranger as he whizzed by. As he entered the city's limits, he noticed the landscape becoming more urban and uniform. All around him were concrete structures rising into the sky, perhaps once magnificent but now eroding under the unyielding pressure of time. The city bustled with people heading to work, and the hum of machinery echoed louder as the day awoke. The young man arrived at work just in time, savoring the memory of the morning's adventure as he carefully parked his motorcycle and donned his familiar work attire. Navigating through the office, he greeted his colleagues with a warm smile and an undeniable energy that could only have come from starting his day with such a splendid detour. As he began his workday, he couldn't help but feel that he had discovered a ritual that would forever change his mornings. It was a simple act, choosing a different mode of transportation and taking a longer route to work, but in its simplicity lay a profound joy – a connection to the world around him and a constant reminder that there was beauty to be found amidst the demands of everyday life. And so, from that day onward, the young man would find solace and happiness in his scenic commute, making his days just a little more magical."},{"question":"Data: name = The Cambridge Blue, eatType = restaurant, customer rating = 5 out of 5.

After hearing this news, he convinced his wife, Charlotte, to get checked out. After running several tests, the doctors determined Charlotte has no cancer, but she does have high blood pressure. Relieved at this news, Jason was now focused on battling his cancer and fighting as hard as he could to survive. But I can use this background: Cancer is a disease that causes cells to divide out of control. Normally, the body has systems that prevent cells from dividing out of control. But in the case of cancer, these systems fail. Cancer is usually caused by mutations. Mutations are random errors in genes. Mutations that lead to cancer usually happen to genes that control the cell cycle. Because of the mutations, abnormal cells divide uncontrollably. This often leads to the development of a tumor. A tumor is a mass of abnormal tissue. As a tumor grows, it may harm normal tissues around it. Anything that can cause cancer is called a carcinogen . Carcinogens may be pathogens, chemicals, or radiation. What is an answer for this question: Who has more abnormal cells in their body? Answer:","response":"Jason has more abnormal cells in his body, as he has been diagnosed with cancer, which is characterized by abnormal cell division. Charlotte, on the other hand, has high blood pressure but no cancer, indicating that she does not have the same level of abnormal cell division as Jason."},{"question":"Given the question: Information: - Charlie Lee Byrd (September 16, 1925 December 2, 1999) was an American guitarist. His earliest and strongest musical influence was Django Reinhardt, the gypsy guitarist. Byrd was best known for his association with Brazilian music, especially bossa nova. In 1962, Byrd collaborated with Stan Getz on the album \\"Jazz Samba\\", a recording which brought bossa nova into the mainstream of North American music. - Bossa nova is a genre of Brazilian music, which developed and was popularized in the 1950s and 1960s and is today one of the best-known Brazilian music genres abroad. The phrase \\"bossa nova\\" means literally \\"new trend\\". A lyrical fusion of samba and jazz, bossa nova acquired a large following in the 1960s, initially among young musicians and college students. - Stanley \\"Stan\\" Getz (February 2, 1927 June 6, 1991) was an American jazz saxophonist. Playing primarily the tenor saxophone, Getz was known as \\"The Sound\\" because of his warm, lyrical tone, his prime influence being the wispy, mellow timbre of his idol, Lester Young. Coming to prominence in the late 1940s with Woody Herman's big band, Getz is described by critic Scott Yanow as \\"one of the all-time great tenor saxophonists\\". Getz went on to perform in bebop and cool jazz groups, but is perhaps best known for popularizing bossa nova with the worldwide hit single \\"The Girl from Ipanema\\" (1964) performed with Astrud Gilberto, and for his work done under the influence of João Gilberto and Antônio Carlos Jobim. - A pseudonym (and ) or alias is a name that a person or group assumes for a particular purpose, which can differ from their original or true name (orthonym). Pseudonyms include stage names and user names (both called \\"screen names\\"), ring names, pen names, nicknames, aliases, superhero identities and code names, gamer identifications, and regnal names of emperors, popes, and other monarchs. Historically, they have often taken the form of anagrams, Graecisms, and Latinisations, although there are many other methods of choosing a pseudonym. - Jazz Samba is a bossa nova album by Stan Getz and Charlie Byrd released by Verve Records in 1962. \\"Jazz Samba\\" signaled the beginning of the bossa nova craze in America. Stan Getz was the featured soloist and the tracks were arranged by Charlie Byrd, who had first heard bossa nova during a tour of Brazil in 1961. - Frederick Eugene John \\"Gene\\" Lees (February 8, 1928 April 22, 2010) was a Canadian music critic, biographer, lyricist, and former journalist. Lees worked as a newspaper journalist in his native Canada before moving to the United States, where he was a music critic and lyricist. His lyrics for Antonio Carlos Jobim's \\"Corcovado\\" (released as \\"Quiet Nights of Quiet Stars\\"), have been recorded by such notable singers as Frank Sinatra, Peggy Lee, Queen Latifah, and Diana Krall. Lees married his wife Janet in 1971. - \\"Desafinado\\", a Portuguese word (usually rendered into English as \\"Out of Tune\\", or as \\"Off Key\\"), is the title of a bossa nova song composed by Antonio Carlos Jobim with lyrics (in Portuguese) by Newton Mendonça. The English language lyrics were written by Jon Hendricks and \\"Jessie Cavanaugh\\" (a pseudonym used by The Richmond Organisation). Another English lyric, more closely based on the original Portuguese lyric (but not a translation) was written by Gene Lees, and appears on some recordings as well. The version by Stan Getz and Charlie Byrd (from the album \\"Jazz Samba\\") was a major hit in 1962, reaching number 15 and number 4 on \\"Billboard\\"s pop and easy-listening charts, respectively; their definitive rendering also reached number 11 in the UK, while Ella Fitzgerald's version made number 38. The song was voted by the Brazilian edition of \\"Rolling Stone\\" as the 14th greatest Brazilian song. - Rolling Stone is an American biweekly magazine that focuses on popular culture. It was founded in San Francisco in 1967 by Jann Wenner, who is still the magazine's publisher, and the music critic Ralph J. Gleason. It was first known for its musical coverage and for political reporting by Hunter S. Thompson. In the 1990s, the magazine shifted focus to a younger readership interested in youth-oriented television shows, film actors, and popular music.

The finished product will look rustic, and will look like the wood of a barn. Because this technique is designed to create a rustic look, you almost never have to sand. The roughness of the wood actually adds to the final, barn-like, product. The wood does not need to be perfectly clean, but if it’s very dirty, wash it with soapy water. Let it dry completely before you begin painting. It is best to pour the paint on the center of the wood. Start with a small amount, and add more if necessary. You can use any type of paint with this technique, although most people find latex paint the easiest to work with. Add water if the paint is too thick. Adding water will also make it easier to drag the paint across the wood. Spread the paint across the wood, into the grain, and let it soak into the grooves. If you want a light coat of paint, you can spread the paint out thinly. For more coverage, don’t spread the paint as widely. Repeat this step to fill in blank areas. Let the piece sit overnight, and then check it. The paint may take longer to dry in areas where you applied thick layers of paint. Make sure it is completely dry, and not tacky to the touch, before you move the wood. If you want the wood to have more coverage, or a brighter finish, add more paint and scrape it across the wood. Add as many layers as you like, but remember that the more paint you apply, the less the wood will show through. Summary:","response":"The article discusses a technique for giving wood a rustic, barn-like appearance without the need for sanding. Ideal for rough or reclaimed wood, this method involves applying paint, preferably latex, directly onto the wood's surface and allowing it to soak into the grooves and grain. The wood should be reasonably clean, but not necessarily spotless. Paint can be thinned with water to facilitate easy spreading, and the amount of coverage can be adjusted according to preference. Once painted, the wood should be left to dry overnight, with additional layers of paint added if desired. However, remember that applying more paint will decrease the visibility of the wood's natural texture."},{"question":"Write a sentence not in English.","response":"\\"Esta es una oración en español que significa 'This is a sentence in Spanish.'\\" In this sentence, I have used the Spanish language to express a statement about the sentence being in Spanish.

Hypothesis: A graffiti-covered van is taking children to the market. .Multi-select problem: Can we conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true? Pick from: (a). yes; (b). it is not possible to tell; (c). no;","response":"(b). it is not possible to tell; Explanation: Given the premise that \\"a white van with graffiti is driving in front of a market,\\" we are provided with a few pieces of information regarding the scenario. However, the hypothesis suggests that \\"a graffiti-covered van is taking children to the market.\\" It's important to analyze these statements and determine if the premise's truth makes the hypothesis true, and in this case, the answer is that it is not possible to tell. First, let's consider what the premise tells us: 1. There is a white van. 2. The van has graffiti on it. 3. The van is driving in front of a market. Now looking at the hypothesis, we can point out the following additional pieces of information: 1. The van is carrying children. 2. The purpose of the van being there is to take the children to the market. None of the above information provided in the hypothesis is implied or directly stated in the premise. Although the premise informs us about the existence and location of the white van with graffiti, it does not provide any details on the passengers of the van (if there are any) or the reasons behind the van's action. In other words, the premise doesn't reveal why the van is there and the intentions of its occupants, especially if there are children involved. It is important to note that although the hypothesis could be true, given that the premise is true, we cannot definitively confirm or deny this scenario solely based on the information provided in the premise. There could be many reasons the van is driving in front of the market – perhaps it is making a delivery or simply passing through. It could be taking children to the market or not, but based solely on the premise at hand, we cannot determine if our assumptions are accurate and conclusive. So, to answer the question, given that the premise is true, we cannot conclusively determine if the hypothesis is true as well. Therefore, the most appropriate answer in this case would be (b) - it is not possible to tell."},{"question":"Of the following two sentences, which one is against common sense?

Article: What is a six-letter word that immediately comes to mind when you need some information on the Internet? You probably thought of Google. But Google wasn't always the name of the famous search engine. In fact, the original name was BackRub! BackRub was the name two graduate students gave to the new search engine they developed in 1996. They called it BackRub because the engine used backlinks to measure the popularity of Web sites. Later, they wanted a better name -- a name that suggests huge quantities of data. They thought of the word googol. (A googol is a number followed by 100 zeros.) When they checked the Internet registry of names to see if googol was already taken, one of the students misspelled the word by mistake, and that's how Google was born. Google is just one example of a name change in the business world. Many other companies have decided to change their names or the names of their products. Here are some more examples: Jerry Yang and David Filo, two young computer specialists, developed a guide to Internet content in 1994. They called it \\"Jerry and David's Guide to World Wide Web.\\" But they soon realized that this wasn't a very catchy name, so they searched through a dictionary and found a better one: \\"Yahoo.\\" Sometimes companies change their names because of the popularity of one of their products.

Democrats of all stripes, including Clinton allies, have predicted for months that the former Secretary of State -- who was campaigning for midterm candidates in Iowa on Wednesday -- will face some kind challenge in the race for the Democratic nomination if she decides to run. The prospect of a Clinton campaign seems more likely with each passing day. But with the presidential race set to lurch into gear after next week's midterm elections and no clear alternative to Clinton emerging, there are questions about whether she will be the sole candidate on the ballot. That would mark a dramatic shift from the rollicking caucus fights in previous campaigns, including Clinton's battle with Barack Obama and John Edwards in 2008. Vice President","response":"Joe Biden and Senator Elizabeth Warren have long been talked about as possible contenders in the Democratic field as well, but neither has made any definitive moves toward a presidential bid. So, what does this mean for the Democratic caucus in Iowa, and what implications might it have for the overall race for the White House in 2020? First, let's consider what a Democratic caucus in Iowa with only Hillary Clinton on the ballot might look like. It would likely be quieter and less contentious than previous caucus cycles. The absence of competitors would mean that Clinton would face no direct challenge within the party for the nomination. This lack of competition could allow her to focus her efforts on winning over independents, reaching out to undecided voters, and mobilizing her base to ensure victory in the general election against the Republican candidate. Second, it's important to examine why no other candidates are emerging as alternatives to Clinton within the Democratic Party. One possible explanation is that potential candidates may be deterred by Clinton's perceived inevitability as the nominee. She has a large and well-funded campaign infrastructure, a massive fundraising advantage, and extensive experience on the national stage. It is possible that these factors may deter other prospective candidates from entering the race, fearing that their campaigns would be unable to compete with the momentum and resources behind Clinton's candidacy. Third, there are several potential consequences of a lack of competition within the Democratic caucus in Iowa. On the positive side, it could allow the party to unite more easily behind a single candidate, avoiding the intra-party divisions that often arise during a contested primary season. This unity could strengthen the Democratic Party's position in the general election, ensuring a more cohesive and coordinated campaign effort against the eventual Republican candidate. On the other hand, a lack of competition within the Democratic field might lead to complacency within the party, as there would be no direct challenger pushing Clinton to refine her policy positions, messaging, and campaign strategy. This complacency could result in a weaker general election candidate, leaving the Democratic nominee more vulnerable to attacks from the Republican candidate and potentially contributing to lower voter engagement and turnout. Lastly, the implications for the broader 2020 presidential race cannot be overlooked. While it is difficult to predict how the other party's primaries and caucuses will unfold, the lack of a competitive Democratic primary could influence the nature and tone of the general election campaign. Without a competitive primary season, the Democratic candidate may have a relatively untested campaign apparatus, potentially leading to vulnerabilities that could be exploited by the Republican candidate in the general election. Overall, while the prospect of a one-candidate Democratic caucus in Iowa may seem unusual at first glance, it is essential to consider the broader implications for both the Democratic Party and the 2020 presidential race as a whole. Although the absence of a competitive field could potentially benefit the Democratic nominee in some respects, it is important not to underestimate the potential downsides of this scenario. Ultimately, the outcome of the 2020 presidential election will largely be shaped by a variety of factors, including the dynamics within each party, the state of the economy, and the individual qualities of the candidates themselves."},{"question":"Ein weiteres wichtiges Thema ist die Vergabe von Finanzhilfe im Rahmen des Europäischen Fischereifonds zugunsten von Fischern, die durch gesetzliche oder politische Neuerungen im Fischereisektor Nachteile erleiden.

Embarrassed, he gets back up, picks up his groceries and carries them into his apartment with his head down. After putting his groceries away, he notices that although both of his knees are scraped, only his left knee is warm to the touch. His right knee feels cool when he puts his hand on it. and a hint : The body's second line of defense against pathogens includes the inflammatory response. If bacteria enter the skin through a scrape, the area may become red, warm, and painful. These are signs of inflammation. Inflammation is one way the body reacts to infections or injuries. Inflammation is caused by chemicals that are released when skin or other tissues are damaged. The chemicals cause nearby blood vessels to dilate, or expand. This increases blood flow to the damaged area, which makes the area red and slightly warm. The chemicals also attract white blood cells called neutrophils to the wound and cause them to leak out of blood vessels into the damaged tissue. Please answer this question : Is more blood flowing to the right or left knee? Answer:","response":"More blood is flowing to the left knee. The left knee is warm to the touch, which indicates that the body's inflammatory response has been triggered in this area due to a possible infection or injury.

Bamar culture has been influenced by the cultures of neighbouring countries. This is manifested in its language, cuisine, music, dance and theatre. The arts, particularly literature, have historically been influenced by the local form of Theravada Buddhism. Considered the national epic of Myanmar, the Yama Zatdaw, an adaptation of India's Ramayana, has been influenced greatly by Thai, Mon, and Indian versions of the play. Buddhism is practised along with nat worship, which involves elaborate rituals to propitiate one from a pantheon of 37 nats.\\" Answer: Answer:","response":"The Bamar culture, which is the majority culture in Myanmar, is known for its rich and diverse traditions, heavily influenced by neighboring countries and Theravada Buddhism. Among these traditions is the practice of nat worship, an intricate and elaborate system of rituals performed to honor and propitiate a group of 37 nats. These supernatural entities are believed to hold dominion over various aspects of life, and paying tribute to them is deeply rooted in the Bamar belief system, dating back centuries before the widespread influence of Buddhism in the region. In Bamar culture, nats are considered guardian spirits, and their worship is vital to maintain balance, achieve protection, and receive blessings in different aspects of life and society. The pantheon of 37 nats primarily comprises spirits of historical or mythical figures, who, despite living immoral or tragic lives, were later deified and honored by the people. As these nats are believed to have the power to intervene in daily life and provide guidance, paying tribute to them is a crucial aspect of Bamar belief. The tributes to nats in Bamar culture are characterized by numerous practices and ritual traditions, some of which are highlighted below: 1. Shrine building: Across Myanmar, shrines dedicated to specific nats can be found both within Buddhist temple complexes and in standalone structures. These shrines, adorned with intricately carved and brightly colored statues, serve as sacred spaces where devotees can leave offerings, light candles, and say prayers to the nats. 2. Offerings: Offerings to nats are a crucial component of their worship, and are thought to bring forth protection, success, and good fortune. Common offerings include fruits, flowers, cooked food, and alcoholic beverages, which are believed to appease and satisfy the nats. 3. Spirit mediums: Known as nat kadaws, these mediums play a central role in nat worship, as they are believed to possess the ability to communicate with the nats directly. Nat kadaws, often dressed in flamboyant outfits and makeup, perform rituals, dance, and chant in a trance-like state to invoke the nats and deliver messages to devotees. 4. Nat festivals: Periodically, Bamar communities gather to celebrate nat festivals called Nat Pwe. These events feature music, dance, and drama performances, in which the stories of nats are recounted and portrayed. Nat Pwe is considered an important occasion for people to demonstrate their devotion, make offerings to the nats, and seek blessings and protection. 5. Rites of passage: Some Bamar families may also incorporate nats into rites of passage or significant life events, such as marriages and housewarmings. Invoking the presence and blessings of nats at these moments is thought to bring good luck and ward off misfortune. In conclusion, nats hold a significant place in Bamar culture, and their tribute is characterized by various rituals and traditions, including shrine building, offerings, spirit mediums, nat festivals, and rites of passage. Even though Buddhism is the majority religion in Myanmar, the practice of nat worship and its distinctive rituals continue to thrive and play a vital role in the lives of many Bamar people."},{"question":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

UK factories enjoyed a surge in new orders over the summer, but high oil prices weighed on the service sector, surveys suggest.","response":"The situation being discussed here involves the UK's manufacturing and service sectors' performance over the summer period. It highlights the contrasting circumstances faced by these two key areas of the economy. On one hand, UK factories experienced an increase in new orders, contributing positively to the overall production capacity and economic growth. On the other hand, the service sector faced challenges due to high oil prices, which negatively impacted its performance. To provide more context, let's delve into these two aspects individually: 1. Surge in new orders for UK factories: During the summer months, UK manufacturing facilities witnessed a significant increase in new orders. This can be attributed to a variety of factors. Firstly, with COVID-19 restrictions easing in the UK and globally, businesses and consumers alike experienced increased confidence in economic stability, leading to higher demand for goods. This, in turn, resulted in new orders for factories to fulfill. Additionally, the Brexit transition period concluded at the end of 2020, and businesses in the UK and EU have been adapting to the new trade arrangements. This could have led to an increased demand for UK-made goods, contributing to the rise in factory orders. Furthermore, various government stimulus programs and support measures for both businesses and individuals were introduced to alleviate the economic impact of the pandemic. This increased disposable income and encouraged spending, translating into higher demand for consumer goods and, consequently, increased orders for UK factories. 2. High oil prices and the service sector: Conversely, the UK service sector faced headwinds during the same period, primarily due to high oil prices. The price of oil is a critical factor for the service sector because it influences the costs of transportation, energy, and production. When oil prices rise, it often results in increased operating costs for businesses operating in the service industry. Higher oil prices can cause numerous challenges for businesses in the service sector. For instance, transportation costs for goods and people increase, directly affecting the service industry, such as logistics, courier services, and public transportation. In addition, businesses that rely on energy-intensive processes or equipment may need to pay higher energy costs, subsequently influencing their overall expenses and profit margins. Moreover, higher fuel prices can also contribute to inflation, leading to increased costs of living and curbed consumer spending, which negatively affects service providers reliant on consumer spending. In conclusion, the summer months brought mixed fortunes for the UK's manufacturing and service sectors. While factories enjoyed a surge in new orders due to increased demand, eased COVID-19 restrictions, government stimulus programs, and businesses adapting to post-Brexit trade, the service sector faced challenges due to the rising oil prices that added pressure on operating costs, and potentially suppressed consumer spending. These contrasting situations demonstrate the complexities and interconnectedness of different parts of the economy and the importance of maintaining a balanced approach to foster sustainable growth and development across all sectors."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Kai turned their lights away from the house because they didn't want to wake anyone inside.

The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals's 3-0 decision ripped apart much of the administration's arguments, sometimes with stunning language. The opinion also sparked swift pushback from Trump, who declared on Twitter: “SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!” The panel hearing the case included Judges William C.

Here are five key passages from the full-throated rebuke. Courts assert right to review order \\"Rather than present evidence to explain the need for the Executive Order, the Government has taken the position that we must not review its decision at all. We disagree,\\" the judges wrote. \\"In short, although courts owe considerable deference to the President's policy determinations with respect to immigration and national security, there is no precedent to support this claimed unreviewability, which runs contrary to the fundamental structure of our constitutional democracy.” The administration had argued that the courts did not have the right to review an executive order related to national security threats, saying it was under the president's broad authority to act on such issues. But the panel, in vehemently repudiating that notion, cited a Supreme Court case that ruled U.S. courts could hear cases on the Guantanamo Bay detention facility. Judges raise religious discrimination issue While the judges declined to weigh in on whether they think the policy is a form of religious discrimination, they did acknowledge that there were “significant” questions that needed to be explored further. \\"The States’ claims raise serious allegations and present significant constitutional questions,\\" the opinion said. The plaintiffs in the case, Washington and Minnesota, maintain that the order violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, which prohibits the government from favoring one religion over another. Clifton, one of the judges on the panel, said he wasn’t entirely convinced of that assertion during a hearing on Tuesday. But the states argued that they just needed to prove that the order was motivated by a desire to discriminate against Muslims, citing Trump's statement in December 2015 about a \\"total and complete shutdown on Muslims entering the United States.\\" Both sides have merits “Aspects of the public interest favor both sides, as evidenced by the massive attention this case has garnered at even the most preliminary stages,” the decision stated. Judges pointed to valid arguments on each side of the passionate debate. They said there is a “powerful interest” in protecting national security and preserving the president’s authority. But on the other, the public also has an interest in the free flow of travel, avoiding the separation of families and the freedom from discrimination. The judges also argued that the states have shown sufficient legal standing to bring the case — at least at this stage — because of the harm inflicted on public universities in the states. Panel finds no evidence of terrorism risk “The Government has pointed to no evidence that any alien from any of the countries named in the Order has perpetrated a terrorist attack in the United States,” the ruling stated. Trump has said his immigration policy is necessary to prevent terrorists from infiltrating the country, citing the 9/11 terrorist attacks and other criminal acts committed by foreign-born individuals. But when pressed by the judges to provide hard evidence that the countries targeted in the ban — Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Iran, Somalia, Libya and Yemen — posed a real risk for terrorism, the administration said there was no evidence in the record of federal offenses from visa holders of those nations. The White House’s attorney maintained that those nations were previously identified by Congress and the Obama administration as “countries of concern.” The right to ‘life, liberty, or property’ When it comes to an individual's right to “life, liberty, or property,” the Trump administration was unable to convince the court that the ban did not violate due process rights — such as providing notice and a hearing prior to restricting an individual’s ability to travel. “The Government has not shown that the Executive Order provides what due process requires, such as notice and a hearing prior to restricting an individual’s ability to travel,” the opinion said. The government had argued that due process rights were not violated because the White House counsel, several days after the ban was implemented, issued guidance stating that the order did not apply to green card holders — and that other individuals were not citizens and therefore had no due process rights. The protections provided by the Fifth Amendment are not limited to citizens, the court insisted. “We cannot say that the current interpretation by White House counsel, even if authoritative and binding, will persist past the immediate stage of these proceedings,” they wrote.

Three federal judges unanimously refused to restore the White House's controversial travel ban, laying down the most significant marker yet that Trump's vision of an administration rooted in the muscular use of executive power -- similar to that he enjoyed as a business leader -- will not go unchallenged. In a stinging rebuke, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the administration's argument that the judiciary lacked the authority to block the travel ban as \\"contrary to the fundamental structure of our constitutional democracy.\\" The tone and content of the decision immediately called into question Trump's gamble in enacting such a fundamental reshaping of the nation's immigration laws through presidential order rather than a law debated and passed by Congress. And he might not be done yet. Asked if Trump was considering signing a new immigration executive order in the wake of the court's decision, a White House official said Friday that he hasn't ruled anything out. \\"Nothing's off the table,\\" the official said. New doubts The embarrassment of Thursday's ruling raises new doubts about the effectiveness of the President's unorthodox method of doing business. In this case, the tendency to draw up plans without much outside input has not served the White House well. The relative inexperience of Trump's core advisers may also have been a factor. It is now certain that the saga of the immigration ban, which has consumed the presidency for two of its three weeks and is distracting from other priorities, will run on indefinitely with possible damaging consequences for the young administration. But the President, who came to office predicting an avalanche of wins and warning that only he could fix the multiple crises he diagnosed as ailing the national soul, is a long way from admitting a final defeat. Drawing on the pugilistic instincts that sustained his business career, he dug in for a counter attack. \\"SEE YOU IN COURT,\\" Trump tweeted minutes after the ruling came down, previewing a possible appeal to the Supreme Court that would set up an even more dramatic and consequential showdown. A few minutes later, the President began the task of using the decision to galvanize his devoted armies of supporters who sent him to Washington to carry out reforms exactly on the lines of his original executive order. \\"It's a political decision, we're going to see them in court, and I look forward to doing that,\\" Trump told reporters at the White House. \\"We have a situation where the security of our country is at stake and it's a very very serious situation.\\" The ruling came with Trump waging feuds on multiple fronts with various lawmakers on Capitol Hill and with his own approval ratings at lower levels than ever seen for a newly inaugurated president. Democratic opponents hailed the decision as an affirmation of the principles on which the nation is based and a precursor of likely pitched legal battles to come on the extent of Trump's power. 'Check and balance' \\"I am pleased that our check and balance system is working in this country,\\" Ben Cardin, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. \\"It shows that the courts are going to be there when President Trump uses his power and exceeds his constitutional authority. I think that is an important message that our constitutional system will work.\\" But the President's allies quickly moved to contain the damage and to frame the terms of the political and legal fight ahead. Arkansas GOP Sen. Tom Cotton said the order was plainly legal and argued the courts shouldn't second guess the national security decisions of the president. \\"This misguided ruling is from the Ninth Circuit, the most notoriously left-wing court in America and the most reversed court at the Supreme Court,\\" Cotton said. \\"I'm confident the administration's position will ultimately prevail.\\" The Supreme Court could still rule in favor of the administration, either on the merits of the case or the issue of standing of foreigners on whose behalf the challenge to Trump's executive order was brought by the state of Washington. But the possibility of the nation's highest bench being called upon to clear up a growing legal imbroglio will also open a new political fight. The Supreme Court is currently lacking its ninth member owing to the prolonged Washington standoff following the death last year of Justice Antonin Scalia. Should the Court hear the case and split 4-4, the ruling of the 9th Circuit would be affirmed. That fact alone adds heat to the confirmation duel looming over the nomination of Trump's first Supreme Court pick, Neil Gorsuch. Republicans now have even more of an incentive to ram the confirmation through the Senate using the \\"nuclear option\\" to sidestep a Democratic filibuster. Democrats are even less likely to cooperate with a swift process. JUST WATCHED Who is Judge Neil Gorsuch? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Who is Judge Neil Gorsuch? 00:48 The 9th Circuit decision, however, seemed designed to shape the future arguments about the content of the executive order and the administration's attempts to significantly stiffen the government's anti-terrorism campaign. It went far further in its ruling than the simple question of the stay on the travel ban imposed by a lower court, taking pains to dismantle the administration's assertion that the travel ban was vital to protecting Americans against an influx of foreign terror threats from the seven named nations, Iran, Iraq, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, Libya and Syria. \\"The Government has pointed to no evidence that any alien from any of the countries named in the Order has perpetrated a terrorist attack in the United States,\\" the ruling said. \\"Rather than present evidence to explain the need for the Executive Order, the Government has taken the position that we must not review its decision at all.\\" Several options The stinging ruling presented the President with several options , including an immediate appeal to the Supreme Court. Trump also has the option of going back to the drawing board and coming up with a new way to impose \\"extreme vetting\\" restrictions he says are necessary. But it seems certain he will not take the route since to do so would involve not only admitting the bitter taste of a high stakes legal defeat but repudiating the combative win-at-all-costs attitude that animates his character. \\"The President has lost so he is now in a state of limbo. For weeks perhaps even months his order is going to be stayed,\\" Alan Dershowitz, professor emeritus at Harvard Law School, told CNN's Erin Burnett. \\"He claims that this is a threat to the national security of the United States. If he is right, then he has only one option -- rescind the order, start from scratch ... write a new order that will both protect the security of the United States and avoid constitutional challenge.\\" Dershowitz added: \\"But it would require him to admit that he is wrong.

In a unanimous 29-page opinion, three judges from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit flatly rejected the government’s argument that suspension of the order should be lifted immediately for national security reasons, and they forcefully asserted their ability to serve as a check on the president’s power. The judges wrote that any suggestion that they could not “runs contrary to the fundamental structure of our constitutional democracy.” [7 key take-aways from the court’s ruling on Trump’s immigration order] The judges did not declare outright that the ban was meant to disfavor Muslims — essentially saying it was too early for them to render a judgment on that question. But their ruling is undeniably a blow to the government and means the travel ban will remain off for the foreseeable future. (Reuters) Trump reacted angrily on Twitter, posting just minutes after the ruling, “SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!” He later said to reporters that the judges had made “a political decision.” “We have a situation where the security of our country is at stake, and it’s a very, very serious situation, so we look forward, as I just said, to seeing them in court,” he said. On Friday, Trump continued to take aim at the ruling. He posted on Twitter a quote from a Lawfare article, which noted the judges had not cited in their opinion the section of the Immigration and Nationality Act that gives the president broad powers to stop foreigners from entering the United States. What Trump failed to note is the article’s author said he felt the court’s decision was “correct … for the simple reason that there is no cause to plunge the country into turmoil again while the courts address the merits of these matters over the next few weeks.” The judges, too, noted they “owe considerable deference to the President’s policy determinations with respect to immigration and national security,” and their decision — for now — was limited to whether the government had an immediate need to put the ban back in place. The Justice Department, the Lawfare piece added, had “submitted no evidence to rebut the States’ argument that the district court’s order merely returned the nation temporarily to the position it has occupied for many previous years,” adding that the government “may yet pursue and vindicate its interests in the full course of this litigation.” The Justice Department, which was defending the administration’s position, said in a statement it was “reviewing the decision and considering its options.” Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson, who had sued over the ban, said, “Bottom line, this is a complete victory for the state of Washington,” and declared that the judges’ ruling “effectively granted everything we sought.” [Read the 9th Circuit’s opinion on the travel ban] The Justice Department could now ask the Supreme Court — which often defers to the president on matters of immigration and national security — to intervene. The Supreme Court, though, remains one justice short, and many see it as ideologically split 4 to 4. A tie would keep in place whatever the appeals court decides. The Justice Department could also ask the full 9th Circuit to consider the matter. The appeals court opinion was written by Judge Michelle T. Friedland, who was appointed by President Barack Obama; Judge Richard R. Clifton, who was appointed by President George W. Bush; and Judge William C. Canby, who was appointed by President Jimmy Carter. It was detailed, but it does not represent a final judgment on Trump’s immigration ban. Last Friday, U.S. District Judge James L. Robart granted the states of Washington and Minnesota a temporary restraining order on the ban. The appeals court judges noted their ruling was a “preliminary one,” and they were deciding only whether the government had “made a strong showing of its likely success” in getting the restraining order thrown out. Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, said on Fox News: “This ruling does not affect the merits at all. It is an interim ruling, and we’re fully confident now that we’ll get our day in court and have an opportunity to argue this on the merits, that we’ll prevail.” The ruling, though, is critically important — as Trump’s ban on refugees lasts only 120 days, and his ban on visitors from Iraq, Iran, Syria, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen lasts only 90 days. The judges also said that while the states of Washington and Minnesota had made serious allegations — and the impact of the order was “immediate and widespread” — the government had not pointed to any substantive evidence to support its need for the ban. “The Government has pointed to no evidence that any alien from any of the countries named in the Order has perpetrated a terrorist attack in the United States,” the judges wrote. “Rather than present evidence to explain the need for the Executive Order, the Government has taken the position that we must not review its decision at all.” [Travelers from Iran board flights to the United States following stay, attorney says] The states have alleged that the executive order harms their businesses and universities, preventing some students and faculty from traveling abroad for fear of being stranded and diminishing the sales tax revenue they receive. Legislators and others who had opposed the ban hailed the judges’ ruling and urged Trump to back down. “President Trump ought to see the handwriting on the wall that his executive order is unconstitutional,” said Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.). “He should abandon this proposal, roll up his sleeves and come up with a real, bipartisan plan to keep us safe.” Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) said, “If the President were serious about bringing our country together and keeping us safe, he would rescind this arbitrary and discriminatory order and recall what makes our country great.” Hillary Clinton, who lost the presidency to Trump in November, posted on Twitter simply, “3-0.” Federal immigration law undeniably gives the president broad authority to bar people from coming into the United States, stating that if the president finds “the entry of any aliens” would be “detrimental” to the country’s interests, he can impose restrictions. But lawsuits across the country have alleged that Trump’s particular order ran afoul of the Constitution in that it intentionally discriminated against Muslims. At a hearing Tuesday, Justice Department lawyer August Flentje vigorously disputed that the measure was intended to target Muslims. In their ruling, the judges did not reveal their opinion on that question, although they noted Washington and Minnesota had “offered evidence of numerous statements by the President about his intent to implement a ‘Muslim ban’ as well as evidence they claim suggests that the Executive Order was intended to be that ban.” Former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani recently said publicly: “So when [Trump] first announced it, he said, ‘Muslim ban.’ He called me up. He said: ‘Put a commission together. Show me the right way to do it legally.’ ” On the campaign trail, Trump himself called for a “complete and total shutdown” of Muslims entering the country. The appeals court judges had questioned both sides skeptically at Tuesday’s hearing, seeming particularly interested in what evidence Trump relied upon in implementing his order and what limits the Justice Department saw on the president’s authority to set immigration policy. While Flentje urged them to restore the measure completely, he also at one point offered a fallback position. The judges, he suggested, could limit Robart’s order so that it applied only to foreigners previously admitted to the country who were abroad now or those who wished to travel and return to the United States in the future. [Trump decries ‘disgraceful’ opposition as appeals court weighs immigration order] They declined to do even that, saying, as written, the president’s executive order could apply even to green-card holders — which it once seemed to do, although the White House counsel later issued guidance saying it did not. The judges said the Justice Department had “offered no authority establishing that the White House counsel is empowered to issue an amended order superseding the Executive Order,” and “in light of the Government’s shifting interpretations of the Executive Order,” they were not convinced that guidance would hold. Trump and his supporters have pressed the case that the short-term stoppage on refugees and immigrants from the seven countries is necessary for national security reasons, and they have leveled blunt criticism at the courts. Trump went so far as to suggest on Twitter that if an attack were to happen, the judiciary would be to blame. On Wednesday, he denounced arguments about his order as “disgraceful” and said “a bad high school student” would understand the broad authority the law gives him to impose immigration restrictions. A day earlier, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly told Congress that he thought judges might be considering the issue from an “academic” perspective instead of the national security lens through which he views the world. [Trump lashes out at ‘so-called judge’ who temporarily blocked entry ban] “Of course, in their courtrooms, they’re protected by people like me,” Kelly said. Federal courts in New York, California and elsewhere already had blocked aspects of the ban from being implemented, although one federal judge in Massachusetts declared that he did not think that challengers had demonstrated that they had a high likelihood of success. The case before the 9th Circuit, though, was much broader than the others, because it stemmed from a federal judge’s outright halting of the ban.

President Donald Trump's three-week-old administration took a thrashing from a federal appeals court Thursday as a panel of three judges unanimously rejected his request to resume enforcement of his controversial travel ban executive order. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling put into sharp relief several tactical and strategic errors Trump and his aides made in crafting, implementing and defending the order, which the president said was needed to ward off the terrorist threat posed by foreigners entering the U.S. Story Continued Below Introspection does not seem to be one of Trump's strongest personality traits. Even after Trump's own Supreme Court nominee expressed strong discomfort with Trump's public attacks on judges weighing his travel ban case, White House press secretary Sean Spicer made clear that the president had no intention of retreating from his remarks. \\"He has no regrets,\\" Spicer said flatly. Now, several legal experts are urging Trump to withdraw his order altogether, so it can be redrafted in a way that might be more likely to hold up to court review. Here are three key mistakes that contributed to Trump's courtroom defeat Thursday: 1. The green-card debacle The White House failure to make clear from the outset that the travel ban did not include U.S. permanent residents, so-called green-card holders, was both a political and legal gaffe of the first order. The confusion led to the detention of more than 100 green-card holders during the first 24 hours the order was in effect and many more thereafter. That caused major blowback from Congress, because many green-card holders are longtime residents of the U.S. It included many Iranians who fled their country in the 1980s to escape Islamic fundamentalism, a bizarre result for an executive order allegedly aimed at combating radical Islamic terrorism. But strictly as a matter of legal strategy, the impact on green-card holders was a serious error. Permanent residents have more U.S. constitutional rights than any other category of foreigners. The green-card issue all but guaranteed that opponents of the travel ban would win the early rounds of litigation by persuading judges that these long-term U.S. residents were being unfairly denied entry or detained. White House officials have insisted that green-card holders were never supposed to be covered by the order, but many experts don't believe that. \\"I think they clearly intended to include legal permanent residents,\\" said Jonathan Meyer, a former Department of Homeland Security deputy general counsel. \\"It was a mistake to do so, compounded by the fact and shows that they did not vet this sufficiently. There's no question that it meant they would face legal defeats ... It's definitely hurt them.\\" 2. The McGahn fix One of the steps the Trump team settled on to save face while stemming the legal and public outcry over the order's impact on U.S. residents essentially blew up in the White House's face Thursday. Once the concern about green-card holders was identified, Trump could have simply signed a half-page tweak to his executive order, making crystal clear that U.S. permanent residents were exempt from the order. But he didn't do that, apparently because he or his aides did not want to admit any flaws in the drafting or vetting process. A formal change to the order would have amounted to a concession of such imperfections. Instead, Trump and his advisers settled on having his official lawyer — White House Counsel Don McGahn — sign a memorandum purporting to offer \\"authoritative guidance\\" that the order did not apply to green-card holders. The memo did not say that Trump instructed McGahn to tweak the order or even that the president approved the new \\"guidance.\\" \\"The White House counsel speaks for the president in this context,\\" Justice Department lawyer August Flentje insisted during Tuesday's oral arguments in response to skeptical questions from the only Republican appointee on the three-judge panel, Richard Clifton. Despite the claims by McGahn and Flentje that the counsel's memo was conclusive, the three judges nearly ridiculed that position. \\"At this point, however, we cannot rely upon the Government’s contention that the Executive Order no longer applies to lawful permanent residents. The Government has offered no authority establishing that the White House counsel is empowered to issue an amended order superseding the Executive Order signed by the President,\\" the judges wrote, adding curtly: \\"That proposition seems unlikely.\\" And the appeals judges didn't leave it there. \\"Nor has the Government established that the White House counsel’s interpretation of the Executive Order is binding on all executive branch officials responsible for enforcing the Executive Order. The White House counsel is not the President, and he is not known to be in the chain of command for any of the Executive Departments,\\" the court wrote. Some legal experts said the Trump administration's contention that McGahn could clarify the order was bizarre. If Trump wanted to change it, he could have in moments with the stroke of a pen, but the bravado exhibited by the president and his aides seemed to foreclose that possibility. \\"There were other options,\\" said George Washington University law professor John Banzhaf. \\"The president's counsel has no official standing at all ...The Homeland Security Secretary does, the Secretary of State does. Maybe it's not as good as the president himself, but it's a hell of a lot better than the counsel, the president's dog, his wife or his son, all of whom have no official standing whatsoever in the government. 3. Pushing the legal argument too far Another major tactical mistake came when the Justice Department decided to argue to the 9th Circuit that the courts have no role to play whatsoever in examining immigration-related decisions the president makes on national security grounds. The claim that Trump's action was unreviewable is a tough one for judges to stomach. Some lawyers say government lawyers might have done better by acknowledging a role for judges but insisting that they must be very deferential to the executive branch. \\"I think in the context of this case it was clearly a mistake,\\" said Meyer, now with Sheppard Mullin. \\"I think it's a mistake almost any time you tell judges you can't look at something.\\" The claim that the issue was beyond the province of the courts essentially invited the judges to do just what they did at oral arguments on Tuesday: raise Trump's \\"Muslim ban\\" comments and ask whether the courts would have no role in reviewing an immigration-related action explicitly taken to discriminate against a religion or for some other highly dubious reason. The court's opinion makes short work of that argument. \\"There is no precedent to support this claimed unreviewability, which runs contrary to the fundamental structure of our constitutional democracy,\\" the judges wrote. And while the judges made no reference at the arguments or in their opinion to Trump's extraordinary public attacks on them and the judge who issued the restraining order at issue, this is where Trump's statements may have come into play. The 9th Circuit ruling goes on to cite a Supreme Court case decided under President George W. Bush rejecting efforts by Congress and the White House to shut down legal cases brought by Guantanamo prisoners. If the courts did not believe Bush was due complete deference in that case, it seems unthinkable that the 9th Circuit would grant such latitude to Trump, given the erratic decision-making processes on display in recent weeks. \\"Given the dynamics we've seen in this administration, they had to know that argument would not be popular with almost any judge,\\" Meyer said. In their ruling Thursday, the judges didn't squarely address the relevance of Trump's \\"Muslim ban\\" talk to assessing the legality of his executive order. But it was clear that the fact Trump was on the record suggesting a desire to target Muslims made it almost impossible for the judges to buy into the Justice Department's argument and conclude his order should be entirely immune from judicial scrutiny. ||||| A summary of this is?","response":"A San Francisco-based appeals court has unanimously rejected the Trump administration's attempt to resume a controversial travel ban that barred people from seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States.

Options: - yes - it is not possible to tell - no","response":"It is not possible to tell whether we can conclude \\"A motocross racer turns his gsxr during a race\\" from the given statement \\"A motocross biker rides mid-turn in the middle of a race.\\" First, let us break down the components of both statements: 1. \\"A motocross biker rides mid-turn in the middle of a race.\\" Here, we have the following information: - The subject is a motocross biker. - The biker is in the middle of a turn during a race. 2. \\"A motocross racer turns his gsxr during a race.\\" In this statement, we have: - The subject is a motocross racer - The racer is turning his gsxr during a race. Now, let's analyze the differences between these two statements: 1. \\"Biker\\" vs. \\"Racer\\": While both terms are related, they are not exactly synonymous. A motocross biker might simply refer to an individual who rides a motocross bike, whereas a motocross racer refers to someone who competes in motocross races. However, since both statements are describing a person who is participating in a race, we can assume that these terms are interchangeable in this context. 2. The \\"gsxr\\": The main difference between the two statements is the inclusion of the \\"gsxr\\" in the second statement. A gsxr is a type of sport motorcycle manufactured by Suzuki. It is important to note that although gsxr motorcycles can be used for racing, they are not specifically designed for motocross races. Motocross races usually involve off-road, dirt tracks with jumps and obstacles, requiring specialized bikes with specific features such as long-travel suspension, off-road tires, and lightweight construction. The gsxr, on the other hand, is a sportbike built for use on paved race tracks and public roads. Given these differences, it is not possible to tell whether the statement \\"A motocross racer turns his gsxr during a race\\" can be concluded from the original statement \\"A motocross biker rides mid-turn in the middle of a race.\\" The presence of the gsxr in the second statement introduces an additional piece of information that is not present or implied in the first statement. While we know that the biker in the first statement rides mid-turn, we cannot make any conclusions about the type of motorcycle being ridden or whether it is a gsxr in this context.

Let’s examine the diet cycle mentality. THERE IS A MAGIC CURE The reason you haven’t lost weight and kept it off is because you haven’t found the right diet that suits you particular physical and emotional needs.

Here is a deeper look into the dieter's mindset and how to find a more sustainable and balanced approach to weight management. 1. There Is a Magic Cure: The diet industry thrives on the idea that there is a perfect diet to suit everyone's unique needs. Constantly switching from one dietary plan to another and chasing the latest trend can be mentally and physically exhausting. The truth is, there is no one-size-fits-all solution for weight loss. Every individual is unique, and finding a sustainable and healthy approach to weight management requires understanding one's specific needs and creating a personalized plan that combines nutrition, physical activity, and emotional well-being. 2. One Last Diet: Many people believe that once they find the right diet, they will be able to lose weight and finally learn how to regulate their hunger and eat mindfully. The problem with this mentality is that it puts too much emphasis on the diet itself, rather than addressing the underlying issues of emotional eating, stress, and lack of self-acceptance. Developing healthy eating habits and a healthy relationship with food cannot be achieved through a single, finite diet plan but requires continuous self-awareness, adjustment, and growth. 3. Love for Health and Fitness: While having a passion for health and fitness is fantastic, obsession with diets and weight loss can cause more harm than good. Many people fall into the trap of constantly scouring fitness magazines and websites, hoping to find the \\"secret\\" to success. This can lead to a negative self-image and an unhealthy focus on one's weight. A balanced approach to health and fitness includes enjoying regular exercise, eating a variety of nutritious foods in moderation, and understanding that weight loss is just one aspect of overall wellness. 4. Breaking Free: To truly break free from the diet cycle mentality, it is essential to change the narrative and stop believing that a magical weight loss plan will be the answer to all problems. Some steps to take towards a healthier mindset include: - Accepting that there is no one-size-fits-all diet and that sustainable weight management requires a personalized and multifaceted approach. - Recognizing and addressing emotional eating, stress, and self-esteem issues, which could be contributing to the diet cycle. - Embracing a balanced lifestyle that incorporates a combination of eating well, regular exercise, and self-care practices. - Developing self-compassion and understanding that weight loss is a journey, and it is natural to have setbacks and face challenges along the way. In conclusion, breaking free from the diet cycle mentality necessitates a shift in perspective from seeking a quick fix or a magic cure to understanding that long-term weight management requires a balanced and individualized approach. This means recognizing the connections between emotional well-being, self-acceptance, and healthy habits while rejecting the idea that a single diet will solve everything. By acknowledging the complexities of weight loss, it becomes easier to develop a holistic and sustainable path towards a healthier and more fulfilling life."},{"question":"Recently Quebec agricultural producers, processors, and distributors, as well as the UPA and MAPAQ, came up with an initial proposal: with the OECD showing more flexibility, the United States taking a tougher stance, and little give from Asia, Japan and Europe, the UPA is calling for the status quo.

He first takes Iron Bar A and puts it out on his porch on a rainy day. Then he puts Iron bar B in an airtight bag and removes all of the oxygen and air to vacuum seal it. After some time passes the bar he left outside is completely covered in rust. He removes the bar in the vacuum sealed bag and to his surprise it has no rust at all. Because there was no oxygen and water in the air tight bag, iron bar B has no rust at all. Iron bar A was exposed to a lot of water and oxygen and there for it rusted completely. Which iron bar was exposed to more water and oxygen, Iron Bar A or Iron Bar B? Answer:","response":"Iron Bar A was exposed to more water and oxygen compared to Iron Bar B. This conclusion is drawn from the experimental setup and the observations made by Jordan. In his experiment, Jordan placed Iron Bar A on his porch on a rainy day. Due to this positioning, Iron Bar A was in contact with water from the rain, as well as the ambient oxygen present in the atmosphere. This exposure allowed water and oxygen to chemically react with the iron, leading to the formation of rust (iron oxide). Over time, Iron Bar A became completely covered in rust, showing the effects of the exposure to both water and oxygen. On the other hand, Iron Bar B was placed inside an airtight bag with all the oxygen and air removed, creating a vacuum-sealed environment. This setting did not allow any contact between the iron and either water or oxygen. As a result, after some time had passed, Jordan observed that Iron Bar B had no rust at all. The lack of rust on Iron Bar B is a direct reflection of its lack of exposure to water and oxygen. In summary, Iron Bar A, which was left outside on a rainy day, was exposed to more water and oxygen than Iron Bar B, which was vacuum-sealed inside an airtight bag with no air or oxygen. The increased exposure to these elements resulted in Iron Bar A becoming completely rusted, while Iron Bar B remained rust-free."},{"question":"Can you tell me the answer to which industrialist set up hindustan aircraft limited in association with the state of mysore??","response":"To find the answer to this question, I will look for information on the founding of Hindustan Aircraft Limited and its association with the state of Mysore.

Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf. I am facing a new situation today: Two farms had different plant cultivation methods. Jolly farm adopted the permaculture methods created by Sepp Holzer, while Peach farm continued using fertilizers and pesticides. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which farm caused less fertilizer to end up in oceans? Answer:","response":"Step 1: Understanding the two types of farms - Jolly farm adopted permaculture methods created by Sepp Holzer. Permaculture is a sustainable farming practice that focuses on using local resources, minimizing waste, and promoting biodiversity. It often avoids the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides. - Peach farm continued using fertilizers and pesticides, which are conventional agricultural practices that rely on synthetic inputs to maintain crop yields. Step 2: Analyzing the impact of different farming methods on fertilizer runoff - Permaculture practices at Jolly farm likely limit the use of synthetic fertilizers, reducing the potential for fertilizer runoff. - Peach farm uses fertilizers and pesticides, which can contribute to fertilizer runoff when rain dissolves it in the soil and carries it away. Step 3: Connecting the farming methods to ocean pollution - The background article states that runoff carrying fertilizer into bodies of water, including oceans, can cause excessive growth of algae and lead to the formation of dead zones. - Therefore, farming practices that contribute less to fertilizer runoff will be less likely to cause ocean pollution. Step 4: Comparing Jolly farm and Peach farm based on their farming methods - Jolly farm adopted Sepp Holzer's permaculture methods, which are more sustainable and are less likely to cause fertilizer runoff. - Peach farm's use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides increases the potential for fertilizer runoff, elevating the risk of ocean pollution. Answer: Jolly farm, which adopted Sepp Holzer's permaculture methods, caused less fertilizer to end up in oceans as compared to Peach farm, which continued using fertilizers and pesticides. The sustainable practices employed at Jolly farm contribute to reduced fertilizer runoff and consequently lower the risk of ocean pollution."},{"question":"Solve -3538*a = -1219*a + 1472*a + 422099 + 55567 for a. Solve this problem.","response":"Okay, little buddy! Let's solve this step by step! We have: -3538*a = -1219*a + 1472*a + 422099 + 55567 First, we will simplify the equation by combining the terms with \\"a\\" in it: -1219*a + 1472*a = 1472*a - 1219*a This equals to: 253*a So now our equation looks like: -3538*a = 253*a + 422099 + 55567 Now, let's get all the \\"a\\" terms on one side of the equation. To do that, let's add 3538*a to both sides. When we add 3538*a to -3538*a, it becomes 0 (because -3538*a + 3538*a = 0). So, we have: 0 = 253*a + 3538*a + 422099 + 55567 Now, let's combine the \\"a\\" terms (253*a + 3538*a): 0 = 3791*a + 422099 + 55567 Next, we will combine the numbers: 422099 + 55567 = 477666 So our equation now looks like: 0 = 3791*a + 477666 Now, let's solve for \\"a\\". First, we will get rid of the 477666 by subtracting it from both sides: -477666 = 3791*a Finally, get \\"a\\" by dividing both sides by 3791: -477666 / 3791 = a When we do that, we find out that: a = -126 So our answer is: a = -126"},{"question":"Answer the following question, but give the rationale first.

If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","response":"To determine if the second sentence is true given that the first sentence is true, let's break down the information provided in each sentence and analyze them step-by-step. Step 1: Understand the content of Sentence 1 Sentence 1 states that someone has \\"them\\", which could refer to oak trees, based on the context. The person also asks if they are oaks around \\"there\\", probably referring to a particular location. Step 2: Understand the content of Sentence 2 Sentence 2 expresses a desire to also have \\"them\\" (likely oak trees) and acknowledges that it's great that the other person has them. Step 3: Analyze the relationship between the sentences Both sentences refer to the same topic - the presence of oak trees. Sentence 1 is asking about someone else's oak trees and their location, while Sentence 2 is expressing the speaker's desire to have their own oak trees and is happy for the other person's possession of them. Step 4: Evaluate if Sentence 2 is true given that Sentence 1 is true Since Sentence 1 is true, that means someone has oak trees and they are possibly located around a specific area. Sentence 2 being true would mean that the speaker genuinely wishes to have oak trees as well and is genuinely happy for the other person. Step 5: Conclusion The truth of Sentence 1 doesn't necessarily determine the truth of Sentence 2, as Sentence 2 focuses on the speaker's personal feelings and desires. However, assuming that the speaker is sincere in their expressions, we can consider Sentence 2 to be true as well.

His departure comes just weeks after Microsoft launched Windows 8, the latest edition of its flagship product, seen as key to the firm's future. Microsoft did not give any reason for Mr Sinofsky's departure. However, one industry watcher suggested there had been talk of an internal \\"war\\" between Mr Sinofsky and chief executive Steve Ballmer. Markets took the news badly, with Microsoft's shares ending the trading day on Tuesday 4% lower. The company said Julie Larson-Green would be promoted to lead all Windows software and hardware engineering. \\"This is shocking news. This is very surprising,\\" said Brendan Barnicle, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities. He added that many observers saw Mr Sinofsky as a potential successor to Steve Ballmer, Microsoft's chief executive. In a letter to all employees, published by Forbes, Mr Sinofsky set out to quell the rumours about his departure. \\"Some might notice a bit of chatter speculating about this decision or timing. I can assure you that none could be true as this was a personal and private choice that in no way reflects any speculation or theories one might read - about me, opportunity, the company or its leadership,\\" he said. By Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent Sinofsky's exit, just weeks after the launch of Windows 8, raises questions about the future direction of the business, not least because he was seen as a credible successor to Ballmer. A 23 year veteran of the company, he was a familiar figure to anyone who attended a Microsoft launch, a polished performer explaining just why we should be excited about the latest innovations in the Windows operating system. Read Rory's full blog \\"It is impossible to count the blessings I have received over my years at Microsoft,\\" he added. Michael Gartenberg, an analyst with research firm Gartner, said that Mr Sinofsky's were big boots to fill. \\"The reasons why he left don't matter all that much but the big question is about how Microsoft fills the void,\\" he said. \\"He did a lot more than head up a division, he had a unified vision of Microsoft as an ecosystem, tying together the PC, phone, tablet, Xbox and online services. The ramifications of his departure are yet to be felt.\\" He added that the immediacy of his departure was \\"strange\\". \\"You don't often see that at that level,\\" he said. Mr Sinofksy's departure is the latest change at the top of some of the world's biggest technology companies. Last month, Apple announced that Scott Forstall, head of its iOS software, and John Browett, head of retail, would be leaving the firm. The announcement followed problems with Apple's new mapping software and disappointing quarterly results. Meanwhile, Yahoo - which has been trying to regain some of its lost market share - also hired a new chief operating officer in October. In July the internet company appointed its third chief executive in a year. Microsoft's Mr Ballmer said the changes in leadership were aimed at ensuring the firm continued to be a dominant player in the sector. \\"The products and services we have delivered to the market in the past few months mark the launch of a new era at Microsoft,\\" Mr Ballmer said. \\"To continue this success it is imperative that we continue to drive alignment across all Microsoft teams, and have more integrated and rapid development cycles for our offerings.\\" Summary:","response":"Microsoft executive Steven Sinofsky unexpectedly departs the company just weeks after the Windows 8 launch, with Julie Larson-Green promoted to lead Windows software and hardware engineering, raising questions about the firm's future direction."},{"question":"What type of details about julie bishop -lrb- actress -rrb- can be gathered from the following bio?

Can you help me answer a few questions? If you can't, please say \\"No I can't\\". Question: Who wins the duel? Movie title: The Duellists Movie plot: \\"The Duellists\\" is based on a story written by Joseph Conrad, which, according to the author, was itself based on a true story whose origins sprang from a ten-line paragraph in a small Southern France local newspaper. That brief paragraph reported the fatal ending of a duel between two officers in Napoleon's Grand Army. The two officers had fought a series of duels in the midst of great wars on some futile pretext. As the pretext was never disclosed, Conrad invented one.We are in 1800, in the garrison town of Strasbourg, on the Rhine. There is a lull in the Napoleonic wars, and the French soldiers are enjoying a moment of peace before resuming the slaughters. As the film opens, a young girl driving a gaggle of geese happens upon two men dueling in a meadow. Lieutenant Gabriel Féraud (Harvey Keitel), from the 7th Hussar Regiment, is in the process of settling a score with an unknown man who soon ends up skewered on the Lieutenant's épée. We learn that this man is the nephew of the Mayor of Strasbourg, and is seriously wounded, when General Treillard (Robert Stephens), Commandant of the garrison, enters his officers quarters and makes inquiries about this Lieutenant Féraud. Lieutenant Armand d'Hubert (Keith Carradine), from the 4th Hussar Regiment, admits to vaguely knowing the gentleman, and he is immediately \\"volunteered\\" by his Commandant to find him and bring him back to the barracks, where he will be put under house arrest. General Treillard, who must see that his soldiers obey the Emperors rules prohibiting combat with civilians, needs to investigate what happened in the meadow. It is somewhat ironical that Bonaparte, who spent a large part of his life dueling with the rest of Europe on a rather grand scale, involving tens of thousand of participants on both sides (but was somewhat of a dilettante when judged by present day's standards), had little respect for the same tradition on an individual level.D'Hubert, after looking all over town, ends up at Féraud's private quarters, where he learns that the...","response":"In the movie \\"The Duellists,\\" there is no clear winner in the series of duels between Lieutenant Gabriel Féraud (Harvey Keitel) and Lieutenant Armand d'Hubert (Keith Carradine). The duels take place over a prolonged period, driven by Féraud's relentless desire for revenge and d'Hubert's attempts to defend his honor. The film explores themes of obsession, honor, and the absurdity of violence. Throughout their encounters, both officers suffer injuries and setbacks, but neither emerges as an outright victor. The final duel happens years later, after Napoleon's downfall and when both men are out of the military. In this confrontation, d'Hubert gains the upper hand and could kill Féraud, but he chooses not to, realizing the senselessness of their long-standing feud. Instead, d'Hubert declares that the matter is settled and walks away, leaving Féraud wounded and defeated. While d'Hubert might be considered the winner of the final duel, the film emphasizes the futility of their conflicts and the cost that such violence has had on both of their lives. In the end, the lack of a clear victor highlights the message that the cycle of violence they've been engaged in has been a pointless, destructive pursuit."},{"question":"Q:Given this review: \\"It is good\\" Would you recommend this app to a friend?

It is unclear whether the reviewer had a positive or negative experience with the product or service being reviewed. Rating: 2 5. Objectivity: Although the reviewer used a neutral expression, the review's brevity hinders any assessment of their objectivity. There is no indication of personal bias or external factors that might have influenced their opinion. Rating: 3 After considering these factors, I would assign an overall rating of 1.6/5 for the given review.

Finally, Kendall made chicken. And I was wondering Why did Kendall do this? A:","response":"A: Based on the information provided, there could be various reasons why Kendall decided to make chicken for dinner. Here are some possible explanations: 1. Availability of ingredients: It is possible that Kendall had chicken readily available at home or found it to be the most accessible option at the time. Chicken is a versatile ingredient and can be combined with a variety of flavors and cooking methods. By choosing chicken, Kendall may have been able to create a delicious meal without needing to buy additional ingredients or go through the process of deciding what to make based on limited options. 2. Time constraints: Chicken is relatively easy and quick to cook compared to some other meat options. Kendall may have been short on time or looking for a convenient option for dinner. Cooking chicken takes less time than preparing certain other meats, such as roasts or slow-cooked meals, making it a more feasible option for a busy schedule. 3. Nutritional value: Chicken is a great source of high-quality protein, vitamins, and minerals such as iron and zinc. It is also leaner compared to other meats and contains less saturated fat, which plays a vital role in maintaining good health. Kendall may have opted for chicken to ensure a balanced, nutritious meal that supports a healthy diet. 4. Familiarity and comfort: Many people find comfort in preparing familiar meals, and chicken dishes can be common in various cuisines. Kendall may have chosen to make chicken as it may be a tried-and-tested recipe or a favorite meal that they know how to cook effortlessly. 5. Dietary preferences: Kendall may have eliminated other potential options for dinner based on personal dietary preferences or restrictions. Choosing chicken could be a lifestyle choice, such as maintaining a healthier diet, avoiding red meat, or accommodating the preferences of family members or guests. 6. Cost-effectiveness: Chicken is often more affordable compared to other meat options, such as beef or seafood. By choosing to make chicken, Kendall may have been able to save money while still providing a satisfying and fulfilling meal. In conclusion, there are several plausible reasons why Kendall chose to make chicken for dinner. These reasons range from the availability of ingredients and time constraints to nutritional value, familiarity and comfort, dietary preferences, and cost-effectiveness. Considering the factors in this situation, Kendall's decision to make chicken could have been influenced by any or a combination of these reasons."},{"question":"Please check if these have the same meaning.

Even superheroes can get boo-boos sometimes! Don't worry, because this article will help you know what to do when that happens. Just follow these simple steps, and you'll be feeling better in no time. 1. Look at the Boo-Boo First, take a good look at your boo-boo. Sometimes, it might be a tiny scratch that you can take care of on your own. But if it looks super big, deep, or very messy, it's best to ask a grown-up for help. They might take you to a special doctor called a nurse or even a hospital to make sure you get the right care. 2. Make the Bleeding Stop If your boo-boo is bleeding, we want to make it stop. Press a clean cloth or a tissue gently on your boo-boo. If the blood soaks through the cloth, don't remove it - just place another one on top and keep pressing until the bleeding slows down. 3. Say Bye-Bye to Tiny Germs and Dirt Sometimes, you might have small things like dirt or tiny rocks stuck in your boo-boo. Ask a grown-up to help you with tweezers or a tissue to take them out. If they can't get all of the tiny pieces out, they might take you to the nurse to help clean your boo-boo better. 4. Wash the Boo-Boo Next, it's time to clean your boo-boo. Gently wash the area around it with some soap and warm water. This will help get rid of any germs that want to sneak inside and make you sick. Be careful not to scrub too hard, or you might hurt your boo-boo even more! 5. Put a Bandage on the Boo-Boo Now that your boo-boo is all clean, it's time to protect it with a bandage! Choose a bandage that's the right size for your boo-boo. Gently place the bandage over the boo-boo, and smooth it down to make sure it sticks well. Bandages help keep germs out and let your boo-boo heal faster. Plus, they might have fun designs like superheroes or cute animals! Remember, taking care of a boo-boo is important because it helps your body heal and feel better. Always ask a grown-up for help if you're not sure what to do or if your boo-boo looks really bad. Now, go be the amazing superhero you are, and be careful while playing!"},{"question":"Fed dollar concern shows how tight fix is: James Saft (James Saft is a Reuters columnist. The opinions expressed are his own) EDINBURGH Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke's new found strong dollar policy is in part a reflection of weakness, caught as he is between inflation and a still fragile economy and banking system. Bernanke on Tuesday deviated from the usual policy of leaving jawboning the dollar to the Treasury department, warning on the unwelcome inflationary effect of its continued fall. \\"We are attentive to the implications of changes in the value of the dollar for inflation and inflation expectations,\\" Bernanke said, nodding as well to its impact on the price of oil and other commodities. Given the situation -- the economy, particularly the banking system, is too weak to withstand higher rates but yet inflation is rising and risks becoming entrenched -- talking the dollar up and hopefully helping to moderate the price of energy is a sensible and low cost strategy. The problem of course is that Bernanke can't do much about demand from China and elsewhere for energy and other commodities and having drawn a line in the sand it is always possible, some might say inevitable, that he is asked to defend it. \\"Bernanke is signaling that he has reached the limits of how much dollar and commodity-driven inflation he can tolerate,\\" said John Kemp, an economist at Sempra Metals in London. \\"He is saying: If there is renewed slide in the dollar, if there is a renewed escalation in the oil price we will have no choice but to respond, no matter how painful that is.\\" It is the Treasury which has responsibility for the dollar and would make the call for intervention in currency markets to support it, if such a call came, but it is probably fair to presume that the Fed and Treasury are singing from the same song sheet, especially given recent stronger comments from Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson. It's worth noting too that a study published last week by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas laid at least part of the blame for the rising price of oil on a weak dollar. The paper, Crude Awakening: Behind the Surge in Oil Prices, by economists Stephen P. A. Brown, Raghav Virmani and Richard Alm found that about a third of oil's 60 per barrel rise between 2003 and 2007 could be laid at the feet of the falling dollar. Of course, there is that pesky other two-thirds of appreciation and as it is being driven by rising living standards in China and elsewhere it is largely outside the Fed's influence. There is no question that the recent run of data from the U.S. has shown a disturbing trend, especially in inflation expectations. The Reuters/University of Michigan Survey of Consumers final reading for May showed one-year inflation expectations surging to 5.2 percent -- the highest since February 1982 -- from 4.8 percent in April. And as for the Fed's mantra that inflation will fade over time, the public isn't buying it: five-year inflation expectations jumped to 3.4 percent, the highest since April 1995. \\"When inflation expectations show a significant rise -- as they have of late -- the standard central bank playbook prescribed tougher anti-inflation rhetoric,\\" Morgan Stanley economist Dave Greenlaw wrote in a note to clients. \\"However the economy is quite fragile at present and markets are jittery. Moreover, it's not clear that the threat of a tighter monetary policy would have much impact on households' inflation expectations in the current environment.\\" If the dollar did make another run lower, it's fair to expect more verbal intervention from the U.S. authorities rather than any quick move to actually buy dollars. And of course there is also the possibility that something out of Mr. Bernanke's control goes his way for once. Having peaked above 135 per barrel, U.S. crude fell on Wednesday to below 124 amid growing signs of at least the possibility of a fall in demand. Americans drove 11 billion miles less in March 2008 than a year earlier, the first time estimated travel on public roads fell in March since 1979 and the sharpest year-on-year drop in the 66 years records have been kept. Perhaps as significantly, India, which subsidizes fuel prices, hiked petrol and diesel prices by about ten percent, while Malaysia has junked all fuel subsidies, both moves that theoretically should help to curb demand for oil and could point the way to a trend in Asia. But it's important to remember that any U.S. desire to see a stable dollar is still vulnerable to cracks in the banking and financial system. The renewed focus on the health and prospects of Lehman Brothers LEH.N, which has seen its shares tumble in recent days, is a case in point. If we see another Bear Stearns-style run on an investment bank you can expect the Fed and Treasury's commitment to a strong and stable dollar to be tested, sorely. -- At the time of publication James Saft did not own any direct investments in securities mentioned in this article.

A U.S. interagency group traveled to Saudi Arabia twice, in 1999 and 2000, to get information from the Saudis about their understanding of those finances. The group eventually concluded that the oft-repeated assertion that Bin Laden was funding al Qaeda from his personal fortune was in fact not true. The officials developed a new theory: al Qaeda was getting its money elsewhere, and the United States needed to focus on other sources of funding, such as charities, wealthy donors, and financial facilitators. Ultimately, although the intelligence community devoted more resources to the issue and produced somewhat more intelligence, it remained difficult to distinguish al Qaeda's financial transactions among the vast sums moving in the international financial system. The CIA was not able to find or disrupt al Qaeda's money flows. The NSC staff thought that one possible solution to these weaknesses in the intelligence community was to create an all-source terrorist-financing intelligence analysis center. Clarke pushed for the funding of such a center at Treasury, but neither Treasury nor the CIA was willing to commit the resources. Within the United States, various FBI field offices gathered intelligence on organizations suspected of raising funds for al Qaeda or other terrorist groups. By 9/11, FBI agents understood that there were extremist organizations operating within the United States supporting a global jihadist movement and with substantial connections to al Qaeda. The FBI operated a web of informants, conducted electronic surveillance, and had opened significant investigations in a number of field offices, including New York, Chicago, Detroit, San Diego, and Minneapolis. On a national level, however, the FBI never used the information to gain a systematic or strategic understanding of the nature and extent of al Qaeda fundraising. Treasury regulators, as well as U.S. financial institutions, were generally focused on finding and deterring or disrupting the vast flows of U.S. currency generated by drug trafficking and high-level international fraud. Large-scale scandals, such as the use of the Bank of New York by Russian money launderers to move millions of dollars out of Russia, captured the attention of the Department of the Treasury and of Congress. Before 9/11, Treasury did not consider terrorist financing important enough to mention in its national strategy for money laundering.

After getting into an elevator to go to her hotel room, she meets Spencer Aimes (Ashton Kutcher). Spencer asks her out for drinks, and she accepts. The scene then changes to Spencer sneaking onto a boat, putting a remote controlled bomb on the bottom of a helicopter, then taking out a guard. He then swims back and goes on the date with Jen. After the helicopter takes off, Spencer triggers the bomb using his phone. After a night of drinking, Jen reveals that she's not the spontaneous person she's been pretending to be and, in return, Spencer bluntly tells her that he's an assassin, albeit unhappy about being one. Unfortunately, she's already passed out and hasn't heard. In spite of this, Spencer decides that Jen's the woman he's been looking for and decides to marry her. When Spencer tells his boss, Holbrook (Martin Mull), his plan, the response is that quitting is not an option. Spencer is defiant and goes ahead with his plan. Three years later, they are settled into their new normal life. After Spencer surprises Jen with a remodeled office, she gives him a birthday surprise: tickets to Nice to celebrate his birthday and their three years. Because of his dubious connections to Nice, Spencer is less than enthusiastic.

The president's plans were contained in a draft proposal from a U.S. government agency. The source said the plan could be announced as early as Nov. 21, though the date might slip a few days pending final White House approval. Obama was briefed at the White House by Homeland Security officials before leaving on his Asia-Pacific trip last week, Fox News has learned. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters traveling with Obama in Burma Thursday that the president had not made a final decision on any executive actions concerning immigration and would not announce any until he returned to Washington. The draft plan, though, contains 10 initiatives that span everything from boosting border security to improving pay for immigration officers. But the most controversial pertain to the millions who could get a deportation reprieve under what is known as \\"deferred action.\\" More on this... Epic showdown over immigration on the horizon? The plan calls for expanding deferred action for illegal immigrants who came to the U.S. as children -- but also for the parents of U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents. The latter could allow upwards of 4.5 million illegal immigrant adults with U.S.-born children to stay, according to estimates. Critics in the Senate say those who receive deferred action, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, receive work authorization in the United States, Social Security numbers and government-issued IDs. Another portion that is sure to cause consternation among anti-\\"amnesty\\" lawmakers is a plan to expand deferred action for young people. In June 2012, Obama created such a program for illegal immigrants who came to the U.S. as children, entered before June 2007 and were under 31 as of June 2012. The change would expand that to cover anyone who entered before they were 16, and change the cut-off from June 2007 to Jan. 1, 2010. This is estimated to make nearly 300,000 illegal immigrants eligible. One of the architects for the president's planned executive actions at DHS is Esther Olavarria, the late Sen. Ted Kennedy's former top immigration lawyer. Under the changes, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers also would see a pay raise in order to \\"increase morale\\" within the ICE workforce. DHS also is planning to \\"promote\\" the new naturalization process by giving a 50 percent discount on the first 10,000 applicants who come forward, with the exception of those who have income levels above 200 percent of the poverty level. Tech jobs though a State Department immigrant visa program would offer another half-million immigrants a path to citizenship. This would include their spouses as well. The other measures include calls to revise removal priorities to target serious criminals for deportation and end the program known as \\"Secure Communities\\" and start a new program. The planning comes as immigrant advocates urge Obama to act. As lawmakers returned for a lame-duck session, Democrats in Congress on Wednesday implored Obama to take executive action. \\"We're begging the president. Go big. These [illegal immigrants] are a plus to our nation. Mr. President, please. You said you were going to do something. Do it. Act now,\\" said Rep. Juan Vargas, D-Calif. House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer said: \\"I join with my colleagues in urging the president to take action. What he needs to do is give immediate relief to families who are being wrenched apart and living in fear.\\" Angela Maria Kelley, vice president for immigration policy at the Center for American Progress, touted executive action as a \\"tried and true component of immigration policy used by 11 presidents, 39 times in the last 60 years.\\" She said for many undocumented immigrants who have been here for years, \\"there is no line for people to get into.\\" Obama has vowed to act in the absence of congressional action and has claimed that congressional action could still supersede his executive steps. That claim was restated by Earnest, who said Thursday that if the House approved an immigration reform bill previously passed by the Senate, Obama would \\"retract\\" any executive order. In a recent op-ed in Politico, Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., said Congress would stop Obama from taking executive action by adding language explicitly barring money from being used for that purpose. \\"Congress has the power of the purse. The president cannot spend a dime unless Congress appropriates it,\\" Sessions wrote. He also pointed out that similar language in the past has prevented the president from closing the Guantanamo Bay prison camp.

You can follow him on Twitter: @LucasFoxNews ||||| WASHINGTON — President Obama will ignore angry protests from Republicans and announce as soon as next week a broad overhaul of the nation’s immigration enforcement system that will protect up to five million unauthorized immigrants from the threat of deportation and provide many of them with work permits, according to administration officials who have direct knowledge of the plan. Asserting his authority as president to enforce the nation’s laws with discretion, Mr. Obama intends to order changes that will significantly refocus the activities of the government’s 12,000 immigration agents. One key piece of the order, officials said, will allow many parents of children who are American citizens or legal residents to obtain legal work documents and no longer worry about being discovered, separated from their families and sent away. That part of Mr. Obama’s plan alone could affect as many as 3.3 million people who have been living in the United States illegally for at least five years, according to an analysis by the Migration Policy Institute, an immigration research organization in Washington. But the White House is also considering a stricter policy that would limit the benefits to people who have lived in the country for at least 10 years, or about 2.5 million people. Extending protections to more undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children, and to their parents, could affect an additional one million or more if they are included in the final plan that the president announces. White House officials are also still debating whether to include protections for farm workers who have entered the country illegally but have been employed for years in the agriculture industry, a move that could affect hundreds of thousands of people. ||||| Summary:","response":"President Obama is planning a big change in the way we deal with immigration in the United States. He wants to create a 10-part plan that would help millions of people who came to the U.S. without permission to stay here without fearing they will be sent back to their home countries. This plan would also make it easier for some of these people to work and live in the United States. Some people think this is a good idea because it helps families stay together and makes our country more diverse and strong. Other people are worried that this plan might encourage more people to come to the U.S. without permission, and could make it harder for Americans to find jobs. This is a big decision, and President Obama wants to make sure everything is just right, so he is still thinking about all the details of the plan before he announces it."},{"question":"Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

Options: - pregnancy - feeling refreshed - mowing lawn - might dream - good sleep Let's give stream of consciousness first:","response":"Going to bed is essential to maintain overall health and well-being, and the primary reason behind it is to get good sleep. Here's a breakdown of each option you mentioned: 1. Pregnancy: Although not directly a reason for going to bed, pregnant individuals require more sleep due to the physical and hormonal changes their bodies go through. Adequate sleep is necessary to ensure the health of both the mother and the developing baby. 2. Feeling refreshed: One of the significant benefits of going to bed and getting proper sleep is feeling refreshed and rejuvenated. A good night's sleep helps in restoring the body's energy levels and mental clarity, contributing to improved overall well-being and daily functioning. 3. Mowing lawn: This option isn't directly related to going to bed. However, if someone engages in physical activities such as mowing their lawn, it is essential to get adequate sleep to allow the body to recover and restore energy levels for the next day's tasks. 4. Might dream: Dreams occur during the REM (Rapid Eye Movement) stage of sleep, which plays a crucial role in maintaining emotional and mental health. Furthermore, dreaming can help with memory consolidation and problem-solving. Thus, going to bed facilitates the dreaming process, contributing to overall well-being. 5. Good sleep: The primary reason for going to bed is to get good sleep, which is vital for the optimal functioning of the mind and body. Good sleep aids in regulating mood, improving memory, boosting the immune system, and promoting physical recovery. In conclusion, going to bed primarily serves the purpose of facilitating good sleep, which is essential for maintaining overall health and well-being. Other factors, such as pregnancy, feeling refreshed, and maintaining a healthy dream cycle, also associate with the importance of going to bed."},{"question":"Generate a question about the following movie plot: At a meeting of the Astronomic Club, its president, Professor Barbenfouillis, proposes a trip to the Moon.

Peter Goldmark, the man who developed the 33 1⁄3 rpm record, developed the Highway Hi-Fi 16 2⁄3 rpm record to be played in Chrysler automobiles, but poor performance of the system and weak implementation by Chrysler and Columbia led to the demise of the 16 2⁄3 rpm records. Subsequently, the 16 2⁄3 rpm speed was used for narrated publications for the blind and visually impaired, and were never widely commercially available, although it was common to see new turntable models with a 16 rpm speed setting produced as late as the 1970s.\\"? Answer:","response":"Question: What were the various uses and developments of the 16 2⁄3 rpm record format, and what factors contributed to its limited commercial success? The passage discusses several different developments and uses of the 16 2⁄3 rpm record format. First, it mentions the use of this format for recording books for the blind, allowing visually impaired individuals to listen to narrated publications. Additionally, Prestige Records utilized the 16 2⁄3 rpm format for some of their jazz releases in the 1950s, including two Miles Davis albums. Peter Goldmark, who was responsible for developing the 33 1⁄3 rpm record, also developed the Highway Hi-Fi 16 2⁄3 rpm record to be implemented in Chrysler automobiles. However, this development was not commercially successful due to poor performance of the system and weak implementation by both Chrysler and Columbia. As a result, the 16 2⁄3 rpm records were mostly limited to narrated publications for the blind and visually impaired, and were not widely commercially available. Despite the limited commercial success of the 16 2⁄3 rpm format, new turntable models with a 16 rpm speed setting continued to be produced until the 1970s. This suggests that there was still some demand for the format, even though it never achieved widespread adoption. In summary, the passage describes the use of 16 2⁄3 rpm records for books for the blind, jazz albums, and in-car entertainment systems.
